NEW YORK - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that 10 recipients across New York have been selected to receive more than $8 Million in Brownfields Grants to assess, clean up, and revitalize local lands. These investments support locally driven redevelopment, unlocking economic opportunity, creating jobs, and improving public health outcomes in communities in New York. In addition, EPA will provide $3.75 Million in new and supplemental funding to three successful Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) programs that support Brownfields work on an ongoing basis in New York. These grants put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

""The brownfield grants are essential for New York, allowing us to transform neglected sites into thriving community assets that instill pride and drive economic growth,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By investing in these revitalization efforts, we not only protect our environment but also create job opportunities and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers.""

“Over $5M in Brownfield grants across NY-22 will help revitalize and improve public health in key areas in Cortland County, Syracuse, and the Mohawk Valley,” said U.S. Representative John W. Mannion (NY-22). “I’ll continue to work with the EPA to deliver targeted investments in our communities, and I look forward to seeing these projects drive meaningful and lasting change.""

“I am thrilled that the EPA has selected Chautauqua County as a recipient of the Brownfield grant,” said U.S Representative Nicholas Langworthy (NY-23). “This is a fantastic opportunity for Dunkirk and Jamestown to clean up, redevelop, and revitalize local lands. This investment is crucial to unlocking economic opportunities and improving these communities.”

""The City of Rensselaer is grateful to the US EPA for providing us with this assistance. The reuse strategy for priority sites in the city supports the efforts of the “Rensselaer Rising” initiative which are to create a livable, vibrant, and sustainable urban environment. This initiative will provide new opportunities for residential, commercial, and recreational spaces by remediating brownfield sites, particularly in our downtown and waterfront areas,"" said Michael Stammel, Mayor of Rensselaer.

EPA has made these selections based on a competitive process. Selectees in New York are:

The Adirondack Economic Development Corporation in NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess and plan for the cleanup of various polluted sites in the Villages of Massena and Malone. Key sites targeted for assessment include an old vacant building, two former creameries, and a former coal storage facility.

The City of Binghamton, NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess and prioritize polluted sites in the North Chenango River Corridor and the First Ward Neighborhood. This includes engaging with the community. Key sites targeted for assessment include a vacant former wire manufacturing site, a former gasoline station, a parcel with dilapidated multi-family homes, and an unsecured site with a former industrial building and residences.

The Cortland County Industrial Development Agency in NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess 18 sites, develop cleanup plans and engage the community in the City of Cortland and the Village of Homer. Key sites targeted for assessment include a former metal manufacturing facility, an old armory, a vacant paint company in Cortland, and a textile plant, industrial site, and two fuel stations in Homer.

The County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency in NY has been selected to receive $500,000. This funding will be used to conduct assess 21 sites, develop cleanup and reuse plans and engage the community in the Cities of Dunkirk and Jamestown. Key sites targeted for assessment include a vacant waterfront block, a former auto dealer and repair shop, a large vacant manufacturing facility, and a former dry cleaner in Dunkirk, along with a former landfill and several vacant manufacturing properties in Jamestown.

Additionally, Chautauqua was selected to receive $1 million for their existing Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding supports a successful RLF program that has already facilitated cleanup projects. Highlighted projects for this funding include the Homesteads at Dunkirk Landing, the Westfield Welch Building Redevelopment, and the Dunkirk Waterfront Block.

The City of Glens Falls, NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess 25 sites and prioritize polluted sites along the city’s East-West End Textile Trail. This includes developing three cleanup plans and supporting community engagement efforts. Key sites targeted for assessment include a vacant auto repair site, an old cement plant, and a former gas plant.

The Lake Champlain-Lake George Regional Planning Board in NY has been selected to receive $1,155,000. The grant will be used to conduct 20 environmental site assessments. It will also fund the preparation and maintenance of a site inventory, as well as the development of 20 reuse plans and ten cleanup plans, alongside community engagement activities. Assessment efforts will focus on the City of Glens Falls and the Towns of Champlain, Plattsburgh, Essex, and Lake Pleasant. Key sites targeted for assessment include a former shopping center, a former county airport, a waterfront marina, and a former cement plant that has been closed since 2023.

Livingston County, NY has been selected to receive $1,000,000 to establish a Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program to provide up to three loans and two subgrants for cleanup activities. It will also support the development of four cleanup plans and community engagement efforts. RLF activities will focus on the Towns of Caledonia and Livonia, as well as the Villages of Dansville and Geneseo.

The Mohawk Valley Economic Development Growth Enterprises Corporation (Mohawk Valley EDGE) in NY has been selected to receive $1,000,000 for its existing Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding is being provided because the RLF program has performed well but has significantly depleted funds. The RLF program has successfully facilitated loans or subgrants for four cleanup projects that are either completed or in progress. One highlighted project for the use of the new funding includes the St. Luke's Hospital site.

The City of New York has been selected to receive $750,000 for its existing Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding comes on top of the $3,700,000 previously awarded by EPA and is provided because the RLF program has performed well but has significantly depleted funds.

The RLF program has successfully facilitated loans or subgrants for 18 cleanup projects that are either completed or in progress. Notable projects for the use of the new funding include sites at 103 West 108th Street in Manhattan, 819 Grand Street in Brooklyn, and 2828 West 28th Street on Coney Island.

The City of Rensselaer, NY has been selected to receive $300,000 to conduct eight environmental site assessments. It will also help prioritize polluted sites, develop four cleanup plans, and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant is the City of Rensselaer, with priority sites including two former gas stations and two adjacent parcels located on a floodplain next to an active industrial site.

Safe Harbors of the Hudson, Inc. in NY has been selected to receive $500,000 to assess nine sites, prioritize sites, develop a cleanup plan and to develop a community plan. The target area for this grant is a 1.3-mile corridor along the Hudson River Waterfront in the City of Newburgh. Priority sites include a 1.8-acre vacant grassy parcel, a 1.58-acre former commercial retail center, a 12-acre former ferry terminal, and a 1.44-acre former manufacturing facility.

The Greater Syracuse Land Bank in NY has been selected to receive $3,768,646. The grant will be used to engage with the community and clean up two contaminated sites contaminated with metals, inorganic contaminants, semi-volatile organic compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

The Montgomery Street site is a 0.2-acre parcel with a deteriorating 5,430-square-foot building and has been used for various purposes, including as a residence, bus service facility, and auto-related services. The Seymour Street site is a 1.7-acre parcel with a vacant 39,000-square-foot former manufacturing building, a former powerhouse, and a wooden shed. It has been unused since 2021 and was previously a metal and ball bearing manufacturing site.

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in New York have used previous EPA grants to assess, cleanup, and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results:

13.9 jobs per $100,000 of EPA Brownfield Grant funds spent

$20.45 for each $1 of EPA Brownfields funding expended on assessment, cleanup, and revolving loan fund grants.

Property values near cleaned-up sites increase by 5-15.2% with an estimated gain of $500,000 to $1.5 million in total property values

Increase of $29-97 million in local tax revenue in just the first-year post-cleanup, per a study done in 2017.

EPA’s Brownfields Program helps transform underutilized and blighted properties into community assets – empowering neighborhoods, protecting health, and sparking lasting economic change.

Adler, Autumn Billings, Peter Suderman, Liz Wolfe, Brendan McCord, Greg Lukianoff, Philipp Koralus, Steven Greenhut",,,,,https://reason.com/volokh/2025/05/16/can-the-epa-finesse-the-greenhouse-gas-endangerment-finding/,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency will consider rescinding the so-called endangerment finding that triggers the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.
The initial endangerment finding was made under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which governs motor vehicles.
Section 231, governing aircraft, has identical endangerment language to Section 202.
One in particular is that it would require the agency to reverse course on what constitutes a ""significant"" contribution of greenhouse gases.
We should soon see whether the EPA is going to adopt this more targeted approach to cutting back EPA regulation of greenhouse gases, or whether it will insist on running headlong into the maw of the original endangerment finding.","Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency will consider rescinding the so-called endangerment finding that triggers the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In a prior post, I explained why this is a fool's errand, and elaborated on some of the relevant points in this webinar.

My prior comments assumed that the agency was planning to do what Zeldin and others had publicly suggested: Rescind the primary finding that the emission of greenhouse gases ""cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare."" Given the precautionary nature of this language, taking this course would have required the Agency to disavow virtually everything it has said in the past 35 years about the potential consequences of climate change, among other things. It would be a morass.

Yet if the EPA's primary goal is to rescind greenhouse gas regulations imposed on stationary sources, and prevent the adoption of new such regulations, it has an alternative approach--an approach that is more of a targeted bank shot than a frontal assault on the endangerment determination and, judging from this E&E News story, it is a potential approach that is getting more attention.

The initial endangerment finding was made under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which governs motor vehicles. Under this provision, the EPA is obligated to adopt emission standards for pollutants about which such a finding is made. Other provisions of the Act have similar language, but they are not all the same, and the differences in the language found in different opinions could matter.

Section 231, governing aircraft, has identical endangerment language to Section 202. Section 111, governing stationary sources (including power plants), on the other hand, has slightly different language. Under 111, the EPA is required to adopt regulations for a category of sources if the category:

causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.

Here, unlike under Section 202 and 231, it is not enough that the emissions in question ""contribute"" to potentially harmful pollution. The emissions, from the source category in question, must contribute significantly. In other words, even taking endangerment as a given, there are some sources of greenhouse gas emissions that need not be regulated under Section 111 because their contributions to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is not significant enough to justify action.

What this means is that the EPA could seek to disarm the Clean Air Act's regulatory threat to stationary sources by defining what it means to contribute ""significantly"" so as to exclude most (if not all) such source categories as those that must be regulated. This is not a sure-fire strategy, as it may be difficult to argue that power plants in particular are not a ""significant"" contributor to climate change. Power plants are responsible for approximately 30 percent of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, most other source categories are far smaller, and would be easier to exclude, particularly if the EPA emphasizes that the significance of a source category's contribution to climate change must be evaluated on a global basis (and the fact that the United States produces a declining share of global greenhouse gas emissions).

The virtue of this approach for EPA is that it does not require contesting basic claims about climate science or reversing the agency's prior interpretation of that science or the meaning of Section 2020. Yet there are risks. One in particular is that it would require the agency to reverse course on what constitutes a ""significant"" contribution of greenhouse gases. Back in 2021, the Trump EPA said this applied to any source responsible for more than three percent of emissions. The EPA no longer eligible to receive Chevron deference on the meaning of this statutory language, and its change in position will reduce the amount of respect its new interpretation receives.

We should soon see whether the EPA is going to adopt this more targeted approach to cutting back EPA regulation of greenhouse gases, or whether it will insist on running headlong into the maw of the original endangerment finding. The agency's choice should reveal quite a bit about the extent to which it is prioritizing meaningful and sustainable deregulatory initiatives over blunderbuss, base-pleasing initiatives.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 13:13:36.899254

— Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley

Why this matters:

The EPA’s funding decisions affect how communities across the country — especially those already burdened by pollution — can protect themselves from environmental threats. The grants at issue were meant to reduce exposure to contaminated water, heatwaves, and floods, and to boost infrastructure like heat pumps and health clinics in underserved neighborhoods. Withholding these funds could stall or reverse efforts to clean up toxic sites, upgrade water systems, and prepare for climate-driven disasters.

So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits.
The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Under the Biden Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revived the social cost of carbon (SCC), which quantifies the economic effects from the release of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions. Specifically, the Administration adopted three Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)—the Data-driven Spatial Climate Impact Model (DSCIM), the Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE), and the Howard and Sterner meta-analysis models—to calculate the SCC.REF Policymakers often rely on SCC estimates from these models to justify imposing strict regulations on a wide variety of everyday products, ranging from vehicles and household lamps to pool pump motors.REF Given the SCC’s role in regulatory policymaking, the robustness of these models to key assumptions should be critically evaluated.

Prior Heritage Foundation research has found that reasonable changes to many such assumptions led to significant reductions in SCC estimates, suggesting that the Biden Administration selectively applied unrealistic assumptions to inflate SCC values and justify aggressive environmental regulations. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that SCC estimates and their underlying models are unreliable and subject to manipulation and, therefore, should not be used to guide regulatory policy.

A Brief Overview of Integrated Assessment Models and the Social Cost of Carbon

IAMs estimate the SCC by modeling interactions among the economy, society, and the environment. Central to these models are “damage functions,” which translate temperature increases into projected economic losses to support cost-benefit analyses. Monte Carlo simulations incorporate uncertainty in this analysis by repeatedly running a model with randomly chosen inputs to produce a range of possible outcomes. This process generates probability distributions of SCC estimates, which are often characterized by standard point and interval estimators. Although heavily influential in public policy, IAMs are highly sensitive to assumptions and subject to significant uncertainty, raising concerns about their robustness and reliability.REF

The SCC played a central role in the Obama Administration’s climate agenda. To develop SCC estimates, the Administration formed the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which included agencies such as the Department of Energy and the EPA. Using three IAMs, the IWG estimated SCC values ranging from $26 to $95 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2050.REF

The first Trump Administration disbanded the IWG and shifted the SCC focus from global impacts to domestic climate effects. The Biden Administration later reinstated the SCC framework, introducing three new models, including DSCIM, to project economic damages from climate change.REF On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued “Unleashing American Energy,” an executive order disbanding the IWG. The order criticized the lack of robustness in SCC estimates and directed the EPA Administrator to address its deficiencies, including the potential for SCC elimination.REF

Overview of the DSCIM Model

Developed by the University of Chicago’s Climate Impact Lab, DSCIM estimates the SCC by assessing damages from CO2 emissions across five key categories: health, energy, labor productivity, agriculture, and coastal regions.REF The model consists of four components: socioeconomic and greenhouse gas emissions projections, climate system modeling, damage functions, and discounting.REF

Given the inherent uncertainty in variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity, population growth, gross domestic product (GDP) projections, and agricultural assumptions, the model employs Monte Carlo simulations over 10,000 iterations to capture a range of possible outcomes. The associated probability distribution is summarized via the arithmetic average across these simulations.

As with any model, the DSCIM relies on a set of underlying assumptions. This Backgrounder discusses a subset of these assumptions to assess the model’s sensitivity to modest changes in their specifications—namely, the specification of discount rate, time horizon, and climate sensitivity.REF

Discount Rates. The SCC depends on the concept of discounting, which is intended to account for the time value of money and ensure that future climate benefits and costs are appropriately valued in present terms. Though identifying the optimal discount rate remains uncertain, selecting an appropriate rate is essential to engage in proper cost-benefit analysis.

Following the logic of greenhouse gas policy, cutting CO2 emissions is an investment in environmental capital. The theory is that cutting CO2 emissions today improves the environment and its flow of services in the future. There are unlimited choices for investment—in environmental capital, human capital, or physical capital—that could provide for improved flow of services in the future, but the resources for making those investments are limited. Therefore, the limited resources should be allocated to those investments that provide the greatest improvement.

Investments in environmental capital, such as reducing CO2 emissions, should be pursued only if they yield a rate of return at least comparable to the best available alternative investments. Discounting—the process of calculating the present value of future benefits—provides the framework for making this comparison. By reversing the process of compounding, discounting enables a consistent evaluation of the future benefits of CO2 reduction relative to other investment opportunities.

Selecting an appropriate discount rate is essential for making efficient investment decisions. Using too low a discount rate risks harming future generations by diverting resources away from alternative investments that could deliver greater overall benefits.

Though it is impossible to know what would be the highest return that could be reasonably generated by alternative investment, the real rate of return on the New York Stock Exchange has been 7 percent over the past two centuries. That this is a very broad sampling across both investment areas and time spans argues strongly for its use.REF Some may lean toward a 3 percent discount rate, which is closer to the rate of return of the bond market.REF

From 2003 to 2023, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed agencies to apply both 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates in cost-benefit analyses, with flexibility to consider additional rates as appropriate.REF In 2023, the Biden Administration revised this policy, establishing a central discount rate of 2 percent and encouraging declining discount rates to account for long-term uncertainty, particularly in the context of climate impacts.REF To support this shift, the OMB incorporated a discounting methodology known as Ramsey discounting as the preferred method for modeling uncertainty over extended time frames.REF The Biden Administration’s EPA estimated the SCC under 1.5 percent, 2 percent, and 2.5 percent Ramsey discount rates. The mean and median SCC under these rates are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Chart 1 provides an overall visual representation of the SCC in 2030.As Chart 1 shows, for 2030, the mean estimates of the SCC are $387, $233, and $140, with standard deviations of $553, $329, and $201 under 1.5 percent, 2 percent, and 2.5 percent discount rates, respectively. The 95th percentiles vary significantly, estimated for these discount rates at $1,276, $763, and $460, respectively. These findings, derived solely from the EPA’s own assumptions, underscore the significant variability inherent in SCC estimates.

As prior research published at Heritage as well as in the peer-reviewed literature has shown, the SCC can drop drastically as a result of altering the discount rate.REF It would therefore be useful to similarly alter discount rates in DSCIM and assess associated changes in the SCC. Discount rates in DSCIM, however, are tied to specific damage function coefficients. For example, estimating the SCC under a 1.5 percent Ramsey discounting involves a specific set of damage function coefficients, as do 2 percent and 2.5 percent rates.

In an effort to use DSCIM to estimate the SCC under alternative discount rates, we contacted the EPA to request the relevant codes to re-estimate the damage function coefficients. The EPA declined to provide the model codes, instead referring us to an external research group that had conducted the estimates using a high-performance computing environment. While it may be possible to obtain the codes from this group and replicate the set-up, the technical barriers and lack of direct federal access create a de facto transparency problem. These obstacles prevent meaningful independent analysis of alternative discounting assumptions and undermine the reproducibility of the SCC estimates.

Time Horizon. The SCC estimates rely on projected aggregate damages extending nearly 300 years into the future. However, making long-term forecasts of key variables such as GDP growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and technological progress centuries ahead are fraught with uncertainty. As a result, we re-estimated the model over a less unrealistic period of nearly 150 years, with results shown in Tables 3 and 4.

As Tables 5 and 6 show, as a result of altering the time horizon, the mean and median estimates are substantially reduced by 40 percent to nearly 80 percent. The largest SCC reductions occur at a 1.50 percent discount rate (69 percent to 78 percent) and in 2080 (58 percent to 78 percent). Chart 2 depicts the probabilistic distribution of the SCC for 2030 under this shortened time period.

As Chart 2 shows, under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent discount rates, the mean SCC estimates are $103, $81, and $62, with standard deviations of $112, $87, and $67, with 95th percentiles of $305, $240, and $185, respectively. As a result, beyond just the point estimators presented in Tables 3 and 4, the SCC is drastically lower under this 150-year time horizon.

Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity. Another assumption on which the SCC estimates depend is the specification of an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) distribution, which quantifies the earth’s temperature response from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 emissions. As a key determinant of global temperature projections, this concept heavily shapes the SCC. While there is a scientific consensus that rising CO2 emissions contribute to global warming, the magnitude of this effect remains uncertain.REF Given this uncertainty, ECS is not represented by a single fixed value but rather as a probability distribution involving a spectrum of possible values.

The EPA adopts a mean ECS of 3.18°C (median 2.95°C), which falls within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report estimated range of 2.0°C and 5.0°C.REF However, empirical evidence indicates that IPCC climate models consistently overpredict global warming, with observed temperatures falling below projections. These discrepancies imply that more realistic estimates of ECS likely fall toward the lower end of the IPCC’s range.REF One distribution was published by John Christy and Richard McNider in 2017, and another was published by Nic Lewis in 2022 in separate peer-reviewed journals.REF Tables 7–14 present SCC estimates under these two different distributions along with associated percentage changes.

As these tables show, altering the choice of climate sensitivity to that of the Lewis distribution elicits significant reductions in both the mean and median SCC estimates, with an average decrease of nearly 60 percent. The Christy and McNider (2017) distribution, as illustrated in Tables 11–14, also shows pronounced reductions in SCC estimates, with an average of approximately 90 percent.

Charts 3 and 4 show histograms under the alternative distributions. As Chart 3 shows, the SCC values are considerably lower under the Lewis (2022) distribution compared to the EPA specification. Namely, the mean estimates are $160, $97, and $59, with 95th percentiles of $590, $361, and $220 and standard deviations of $256, $150, and $92 under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent Ramsey discount rates, respectively.

As Chart 4 shows, as is the case with the Lewis (2022) distribution, the SCC is also substantially lower under the Christy and McNider (2017) distribution compared to the EPA’s specified climate sensitivity distribution. Namely, the mean estimates of the SCC are $28, $18, and $11, with 95th percentiles of $187, $115, and $72 and standard deviations of $98, $57, and $34 under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent discount rates, respectively.

Charts 3 and 4 clearly show that, in addition to the point estimates presented in Tables 7–14, the SCC is significantly lower under these alternative specifications of climate sensitivity. In the following section, we discuss a largely unexplored phenomenon—the concept and probability of a negative SCC.

Probability of a Negative SCC

CO2 plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and can contribute to environmental benefits such as higher agricultural yields and extended growing seasons, particularly under conditions of moderate warming. To its credit, DSCIM recognizes that in some scenarios, these positive effects may outweigh the projected climate damages, allowing for the possibility of a negative SCC.REF

Tables 15–18 display the probability of a negative SCC under both the EPA’s assumptions and the alternative assumptions presented in this report.Table 15 reports an average probability of a negative SCC of 0.15 under the EPA’s assumptions, and this falls slightly to 0.13 when the time horizon is truncated to 2150. This decline reflects the shorter period over which long-term climate impacts can be realized, which in turn reduces the probability of scenarios in which moderate warming results in net economic benefits. Under the Lewis (2022) and Christy and McNider (2017) ECS distributions, Tables 17 and 18 show a 0.23 and 0.39 probability of a negative SCC, respectively.

These higher probabilities for 2030 are also evidenced in Charts 1–4. Under the assumptions made by the prior Administration’s EPA, the probability of a negative SCC ranges between 0.13 and 0.15 for 2030. As Charts 3 and 4 show, these probabilities increase substantially under the Lewis (2022) and Christy and McNider (2017) ECS distributions, ranging from 0.22 to 0.40. These increased probabilities of negative SCC values reflect the modeled benefits of moderate warming under these ECS distributions.

A negative SCC, reflecting net benefits from CO2 emissions, suggests that, if anything, carbon emissions should not be taxed but rather subsidized. Of course, we do not take the position that the government should tax or subsidize greenhouse gas emissions, but the model’s negative SCC estimates under reasonable adjustments to assumptions underscore the sensitivity of these models to user manipulation. In fact, research published over the past several years has suggested that CO2 fertilization effects may be vastly understated in IAM modeling.REF

Policy Implications and Conclusions

As is the case with other IAMs, the DSCIM model intends to estimate the economic impact of climate change.REF However, also as with other IAMs, the DSCIM model is sensitive to reasonable changes in assumptions and therefore highly vulnerable to user manipulation. Consequently, policymakers—such as those in the Biden Administration—can manipulate the SCC by selecting assumptions that support their preferred outcomes, using circular logic to both produce and justify predetermined regulatory policies.

As a result, we offer the following policy recommendations:

To ensure transparency and reproducibility in regulatory analysis, federal agencies should not be able to hide behind the work of outside groups. Instead, they should maintain and publicly provide access to the full suite of models and code used to generate key policy metrics such as the SCC—including the ability to adjust core assumptions. Referring stakeholders to external research groups—particularly when replication requires high-performance computing—creates practical obstacles that limit independent scrutiny. Requiring agencies to directly host accessible and modifiable code would strengthen accountability and improve the integrity of cost-benefit analysis in environmental policymaking.

In the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order issued on January 20, 2025, President Trump instructed the EPA Administrator to evaluate the use of the SCC, including considering its elimination.REF On May 5, 2025, the Trump Administration issued this guidance, indicating that federal agencies should not consider the SCC in policymaking unless “plainly required by their governing statute.”REF

Although this guidance is indeed a step in the right direction, a future Administration could potentially reinstate the SCC framework with an executive order, as President Biden did during his term. To prevent this, Congress should enact legislation prohibiting the use of the SCC in policymaking. During the 118th Congress, Representatives Richard Hudson (R–NC) and Kevin Hern (R–OK), along with several other lawmakers, introduced a bill to do so. However, it failed to ultimately become law. Lawmakers should continue pursuing legislative measures to ensure that future Administrations, regardless of party, cannot reinstate the SCC in regulatory decision-making.REF",https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,N,,2025-05-16 12:24:51.729165

The first is a revamp of Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards for certain PFAS in drinking water. The second is an update to Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) timelines for reporting PFAS use. As we previewed in our April 30 note, these actions are part of a multifaceted effort by the Trump EPA to update the agency's approach to PFAS issues, with likely more to come. This note provides a summary of the changes and how their implementation may proceed in light of certain congressional and judicial scrutiny.

PFAS in Drinking Water

On May 14, the EPA announced its intention to make changes to national drinking water standards regulating certain PFAS. In a press release, the EPA described plans to extend the compliance dates for two PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) but rescind regulations for four other substances pending further EPA consideration.

By way of background, in April 2024, the Biden EPA issued a rule to limit levels of certain PFAS compounds in drinking water. That rule established enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for six PFAS compounds: 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA and 10 ppt for four other compounds: PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA (a.k.a. GenX). Compliance with the MCLs was to occur no later than 2029.

In its recent announcement, the EPA said it will extend the compliance date for PFOA and PFOS by two years to 2031. The EPA also announced that it intends to rescind regulations for the other four PFAS compounds and will reconsider how they should be addressed. EPA states that this action is ""designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these."" The Agency plans to issue a proposed new rule for public comment in fall of 2025 and a final rule in the spring of 2026.

Reaction has been varied—drinking water utilities have been generally positive, as they will benefit from additional time to meet the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, while environmental and some health groups have raised concerns. The move drew immediate attention from Congress, where EPA Administrator Zeldin faced senators on May 14 who questioned the agency's plans to address PFAS. Zeldin defended the actions as appropriate and reaffirmed his commitment to ""fulfill all statutory obligations."" We anticipate legal challenges to the new rule, as well as continued attention from Congress in the months ahead.

TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting

On May 13, the EPA published an interim final rule to amend the data submission period for the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS reporting rule. Under that rule, manufacturers (including importers) are to electronically report information regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, disposal, exposure, and hazards for activity beginning in 2011. Reporting was originally to occur over a six-month window beginning in November 2024 but was delayed to July 2025 and is now being reset to April through October 2026. Small manufacturers have until April 2027 to file their reports. EPA states this latest adjustment is to allow for sufficient time to develop and validate the software needed to receive the required data.

Of note, the Federal Register notice states that at this time the only change to the Section 8(a)(7) rule is the data submission dates. However, the notice also states the EPA ""intends to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future that will, among other things, allow for further comment on the appropriate reporting period."" Just as importantly, the EPA indicated that more substantive changes to TSCA reporting could occur: ""the Agency may, in a future separate action, reopen other aspects of this rule for public comment in light of Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulations (90 FR 9065, January 31, 2025).""

When Congress created TSCA 8(a)(7) in 2019 by statute, it specified that reporting was to cover actions since January 2011. Any change to the covered reporting period sought by EPA would likely need action by Congress. The Agency has signaled interest in actions to reduce the regulatory burden, particularly on small businesses, including in its April 28 press release: ""Implement section 8(a)(7) … without overburdening small businesses and article importers,"" a possible reference to a de minimis exemption or other modification to the reporting requirement.

What Happens Next?

Stakeholders should remain focused on how the EPA moves forward on PFAS matters. The Agency, as it laid out in its April 28 announcement, will continue to evaluate the suite of PFAS rules and regulations as it looks to create its own path forward. In addition to the expected drinking water rules previewed above, announcements are also expected regarding the 2024 hazardous substance designation of PFOA and PFAS under CERCLA and other measures under consideration. Congress continues to discuss PFAS matters, including how best to handle CERCLA liability for ""passive receivers,"" and will most certainly remain actively engaged with the EPA.

All of these regulatory actions, of course, are being litigated by affected parties and the Agency, even as the EPA alters the rules at issue.[1] Those actions (and perhaps new ones) are likely to continue, albeit with new underlying legal and substantive disputes. We anticipate that litigation will continue for the foreseeable future.

Others went further. Zeldin revealed that the EPA will “reconsider” the 2009 “endangerment finding,” its determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare, which underpins the agency’s regulation of carbon dioxide and other climate-warming pollutants under the Clean Air Act—a radical move that the first Trump administration considered but ultimately decided against pursuing. “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” said Zeldin. Soon after that piece of rhetorical violence, the EPA confirmed that it will no longer require power plants and other industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions.

Just ten months ago, the EPA’s leaders were instead celebrating the “historic $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund…made possible by President Biden and Vice President Harris’ Inflation Reduction Act, which is the largest climate investment in history.” Zeldin’s 180-degree turn away from those priorities fits a broader pattern: the second Trump administration has spent the past three months flipping the missions of various federal agencies on their heads. The leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services is promoting vaccine skepticism. The Department of Education is now focused on dictating what schools cannot teach. And the Environmental Protection Agency is now committed wholly to dismantling decades of environmental protections.

Officials have signaled that there will be little enforcement of water and air pollution rules.

Coastal Review Online

Federal and state efforts to limit the public’s exposure to “forever chemicals” through drinking water sources seemed to be gaining traction just a year ago.

In a historic move in April 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency set limits on six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, including PFOA, PFOS and HFPO-DA, most commonly referred to as GenX.

About three months after the federal drinking water rules were adopted, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources introduced proposed groundwater and surface water standards on eight PFAS.

Related: Zeldin says PFAS limits may get tougher, downplays layoffs

But, as of this week, the Trump administration says it intends to rescind and reexamine rules on four PFAS, including GenX, and extend the deadline for public water utilities to comply with rules on PFOA and PFOS by two years.

PFAS are a group of more than 14,000 chemicals used in everyday consumer products including food containers, stain-resistant carpet and water-repellant gear. These man-made chemical compounds are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they are persistent in the environment and have been found to accumulate in people and animals. Exposure to these substances has been linked to weakened immune function, reproductive and developmental issues and increased risk of some cancers.

The EPA’s announcement Wednesday of its plans to scale back PFAS limits comes on the heels of a recent decision by members of the state-appointed commission responsible for adopting rules that protect, preserve and enhance air and water resources to again defer moving forward monitoring and minimization discharge plans for PFAS and 1,4-dioxane into the state’s surface waters.

Critics of those proposed plans argue the rules, as written, lack any real subsistence in reducing the releases of chemical compounds into the state’s waterways.

And in a new year with a new administration at the helm of the federal government, the impetus for regulation may turn up the pressure on state governments to limit discharges of “forever chemicals” into drinking water sources.

State Division of Water Resources officials were heading in that direction in July 2024 when they presented water quality standards for eight PFAS to committees of the N.C. Environmental Management Commission.

The standards would be used to limit permitted releases of PFAS into groundwater and surface waters, set health thresholds for providing alternative water supplies to residents on private wells whose drinking water exceeds contamination limits, and establish goals for cleaning contamination.

The commission’s groundwater and waste management committee agreed to recommend groundwater health standards for only three PFAS, including PFOA, PFOS and GenX. That proposal went to public comment later in the year.

The commission’s water quality committee deferred a motion to send the surface water rule package on all eight PFAS to the full commission and, since its July 2024 meeting, has also pared down its focus on PFAS to PFOA, PFOS and GenX.

Based on that committee’s vote earlier this month, the commission isn’t expected to see a proposed draft rule on PFAS or 1,4-dioxane earlier than its July meeting.

In an emailing responding to questions from Coastal Review on Thursday morning, EMC Chair JD Solomon said the commission anticipates receiving the hearing officer’s report on the proposed groundwater rules at that same meeting.

Draft rule ‘doesn’t have sufficient teeth’

The current proposed rules for surface water bear little semblance to those the Division of Water Resources presented last July.

The set of rule drafts presented to the water quality committee in March were largely written from input provided by the North Carolina Water Quality Association, a statewide organization that represents public water, sewer, and stormwater utilities.

The water quality standards included in the initial draft rules the division created last year have since been deleted. Without those standards, the state lacks ability to enforce limits on dischargers of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, critics say.

One of those critics of the current proposed draft rules is Environmental Management Commissioner Robin Smith.

“I think that consistently there has been a concern that, in the absence of a water quality standard, even a minimization plan isn’t enforceable,” Smith told Coastal Review in a telephone interview earlier this week.

Following last week’s commission meeting, Smith raised several concerns in an email that she sent to fellow commissioners.

“My concern is that (the current draft rule) doesn’t have sufficient teeth,” she said. “If you read through the full draft, there’s just nothing there other than the minimization contents, like a table of contents for what the minimization plan would have to be. There are no standards for determining whether what a system submits in their plan is adequate or not.”

In his email, Solomon explained that the regulatory impact analysis, or RIA, which is an evaluation of the potential costs and benefits associated with a proposed regulation, did not sufficiently identify cost-benefits associated with the proposed rules.

Last September, the water quality committee voted to move forward with a proposed monitoring and minimization plan and “continue discussions with federal agencies to make sure the benefits portion of the numeric standard were realistic,” Solomon said.

“The monitoring and minimization approach is seen as a proactive measure by EPA because it addresses potential contamination before it gets into our human and natural systems communities,” he wrote. “Allowing potential contamination into our public water bodies and public sewer systems is also much more costly to clean up.”

But the proposed monitoring and minimization plan would fail to enforce consequences for industries if they increase their pollution, said Southern Environmental Law Center Attorney Hannah Nelson.

“DEQ worked really hard to put together a comprehensive set of water quality standards that would have required polluters to reduce their pollution at the source and they spent a lot of time putting those rules together,” she said. “We don’t see that same thing happening with this set of rules. Instead, the analysis supporting this rule making completely ignored impact to downstream drinking water utilities. They don’t address that because, if they did, we would see that this rule is all about protecting industry and it’s not about protecting the people of North Carolina.”

In an April 17 letter to state environmental officials, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority’s executive director admonished the revised draft rule for 1,4-dioxane.

“After months of research, our consultants determined, as a matter of law, that there is no legal basis by which to create mandatory, legally enforceable 1,4-dioxane minimization requirements without supporting water quality standards for surface waters,” wrote the utility’s Kenneth Waldroup in the letter addressed to Solomon and Division of Water Resources Director Richard Rogers.

“Given that the EMC determined many years ago that 1,4-dixoane adversely impacts the protected use of groundwater, we respectfully point out that the EMC neglects its statutory duty to protect surface waters from the same pollutant. Pollution mitigation plans that have no required or enforceable reduction targets will not garner any tangible results but instead be no more than an action in name only providing empty promises to the people of North Carolina,” the letter states.

There are six known 1,4-dioxane polluters upstream of the drinking water supply for Sanford, Fayetteville, Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties, and municipalities that buy drinking water from Sanford.

Waldroup has said that the utility will have to invest millions of dollars to remove 1,4-dioxane, a likely carcinogen, from its raw drinking water source: the Cape Fear River.

Cape Fear Public Utility Authority has already spent millions in upgrades and ongoing treatment of PFAS discharged into the Cape Fear River from, among other upstream polluters, Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant.

GenX is specific to the Bladen County facility, which is roughly 74 miles upstream of Wilmington.

Since news broke nearly eight years ago that Chemours had knowingly discharged PFAS directly into the river, air and groundwater for decades, the company has spent millions to reduce its PFAS emissions to comply with a 2019 consent order between the company, DEQ and Cape Fear River Watch.

The Cape Fear utility and other public water utilities in the region are calling for regulations that would ultimately shift the cost of reducing PFAS and 1,4-dioxane discharges to the industries that produce those chemical compounds.

“We seek meaningful regulation that acknowledges and rewards the reductions made to date, prevents backsliding, and requires uncooperative industrial dischargers to mirror the work of dutiful municipal partners,” Waldroup wrote.

The Clean Water Act includes “anti-backsliding” provisions advocates say prohibits repealing or weakening the drinking water standard.

“Unfairly” blamed

Water quality committee members pointed the finger at Division of Water Resources staff as the reason for the latest delay in getting proposed rules out for public comment.

Smith, who is not a member of the water quality committee, took issue with that assertion, saying in her email that committee members were “unfairly blaming” division staff.

“DWR was not responsible for the fact that the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) did not approve the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIAs) for these two sets of rules before the May EMC meeting,” she wrote.

Instead, “significant changes” to the rule drafts and the draft regulatory analyses that were presented to the committee in March “led directly to OSBM questions that delayed approval of the RIAs and remain unresolved.”

Changes to the draft rules were made at the direction of a group of commissioners, including the chair and vice chair of the water quality committee, chair of the groundwater and waste management committee, and Solomon. Solomon did not respond to an email request for comment.

During the water quality committee’s May 7 meeting, Rogers said staff had “been engaged in taking direction from a subcommittee of this committee” over the last month.

“We have taken that direction and applied it directly to the draft rules that y’all have before you today,” Rogers said.

Exactly which commissioners had been meeting with staff had not been made clear until the May 7 meeting, Smith told Coastal Review.

“It’s not necessarily inappropriate to have a subcommittee or a working group, a small group of EMC members who work on something between committee meetings, but one of my concerns about this process has been there’s never been any transparency about the fact that was going on and who was involved,” she said. “I do think we need to reach some common understanding of how we’re working on these rules, but that also clearly affects the public, and I’m also not sure we’re on a path toward making great progress in July, depending on how willing some of these water quality committee members are to making changes to satisfy OSBM.”

Solomon said that DEQ staff “asked for a more collaborative approach” with the commission for the monitoring and minimization draft rule.

“Coordination and communication with DEQ divisions is charged to the chair and vice-chair of the relevant EMC committee, and in this case the WQC chair and vice chair interacted with DWR to move this draft item onto the committee agenda for debate and discussion,” he said. “No action has been taken on the draft monitoring and minimization rule, or the RIA, by the WQC or the EMC. Based on OSBM’s response to the draft RIA, the benefits aspect of the draft rule is the primary issue. My direction as EMC chair is to bring the updated draft documents before the committee in July.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Raven_Rock_State_Park_Cape_Fear_River_8074824871.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-16 12:24:59.540109

Several House Republicans are pushing back against their own party’s attempt to slash clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, fearing local economic fallout.

Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP leaders support phasing out the credits to help fund Trump-aligned priorities, but some lawmakers say that could devastate investments in their districts.

With Republicans split and Democrats opposed, the fate of the tax package may rest with the Senate, where moderate Republicans also support preserving parts of the climate law.

Key quote:

“Across the country, there is a huge economic impact that would happen if we just cut these things off.”

— Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.)

Why this matters:

Republicans have spent the last two years slamming the Inflation Reduction Act as a liberal spending spree — but now some are getting cold feet about gutting its green tax credits. Clean energy tax credits are funneling billions into red-state districts, transforming economically depressed towns into hubs for solar, wind, and battery production, and bringing jobs that are hard to hate come reelection time. Is the GOP is willing to sacrifice an economic boon — one that’s driving green manufacturing and cutting pollution — to score points in a political fight?

In short:

President Trump has called climate liability lawsuits a threat to the economy and ordered the Justice Department to preemptively sue states like Hawaii and Michigan to prevent them from proceeding.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi filed additional lawsuits against New York and Vermont over laws aimed at making polluters pay for climate adaptation, labeling them threats to national security.

Despite federal pressure, some lawsuits are advancing in state courts, including a Colorado case allowed to proceed by the state’s Supreme Court, even as other suits have been dismissed or dropped.

Key quote:

“The climate crisis is here, and the costs of surviving it are rising every day. The burden should fall on those who deceived and failed to warn consumers about the climate dangers lurking in their products.”

— Josh Green, governor of Hawaii

Why this matters:

As the climate warms, communities across the United States are racking up billions in damages from floods, fires, droughts and storms — costs that state and local governments argue should be shared by the companies that profited from fossil fuels while allegedly misleading the public about their risks. These lawsuits resemble earlier efforts to hold the tobacco industry accountable and could set powerful legal precedents. But the federal government’s new legal interventions raise the stakes. Suing states to stop climate litigation marks an aggressive defense of fossil fuel interests and could undermine the ability of local governments to recover funds for climate resilience. If successful, this strategy might close off one of the few remaining avenues for holding corporations responsible for climate impacts — especially in the absence of sweeping federal climate policy.

In short:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin defended the Trump administration’s decision to freeze nearly $3 billion in climate law grants intended for low-income and minority communities, as well as $20 billion in green bank financing for clean energy projects.

Democrats accused Zeldin of illegally impounding funds mandated by Congress, while Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the funding cuts were “indiscriminate” and harmed rural communities, including her constituents in Alaska.

Zeldin said the agency acted based on new “policy priorities” under President Trump and suggested some grants might be reinstated if language about environmental justice and diversity is removed, in line with a Trump executive order.

Key quote:

“So you understand that when you impound funds, you’re violating the law?”

— Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley

Why this matters:

The EPA’s funding decisions affect how communities across the country — especially those already burdened by pollution — can protect themselves from environmental threats. The grants at issue were meant to reduce exposure to contaminated water, heatwaves, and floods, and to boost infrastructure like heat pumps and health clinics in underserved neighborhoods. Withholding these funds could stall or reverse efforts to clean up toxic sites, upgrade water systems, and prepare for climate-driven disasters. In addition, the dispute reflects a deeper clash over executive power and the role of science and equity in federal policy.

In short:

The rule being rescinded had cut project fees for solar and wind energy developers on federal land by about 80%.

The Trump administration argues the existing fee reductions unfairly favor intermittent renewables over traditional energy sources.

The planned rollback is part of a broader effort to dismantle clean energy incentives and revive fossil fuel production.

Key quote:

""Eliminating the Biden administration's preferential treatment of unaffordable, unreliable 'intermittent' projects and dismantling excessive, one-sided restrictions on traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and critical minerals, will unlock the full potential of America’s natural resources.""

— Doug Burgum, secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior

Why this matters:

The cost of developing solar and wind farms on public lands has long been a barrier to scaling up renewable energy in the United States. By slashing those fees in 2024, the Biden administration aimed to create a more level playing field with oil and gas, whose access to public lands has traditionally faced fewer financial hurdles. Reversing that policy signals a return to favoring extractive industries over low-carbon alternatives. Public lands make up a large share of the nation’s undeveloped potential for utility-scale renewable energy, especially in the sunny Southwest and windy Great Plains. Making them less accessible to clean energy developers could slow the transition to a cleaner grid and deepen the country’s reliance on polluting fuels.

In short:

A new report from the Plastics & Climate Project reveals that microplastics could interfere with ocean and soil processes that lock away carbon, a factor missing in most climate models.

Microplastics affect oceanic carbon sequestration by disrupting marine snow and altering plankton behavior, while in soil they may impact microbial carbon storage.

The report calls for more research into plastic's warming potential, especially in light of emerging evidence that plastics may influence Earth's reflectivity and release methane as they degrade.

Key quote:

“An incomplete understanding must not halt action to comprehensively account for plastic climate impacts.”

— Holly Kaufman, senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and a lead author of the report

Why this matters:

Scientists are learning that microplastics affect far more than marine life. These tiny fragments can slow plankton growth, disrupt fish waste, and alter microbial processes in the soil, all of which could reduce Earth’s ability to absorb and store carbon. This undermines a vital natural buffer against climate change. On top of that, plastic particles might change how sunlight reflects off snow, ice, and even clouds — and may emit methane as they break down. These pathways aren’t yet fully understood, but they suggest we’ve been underestimating plastic’s climate footprint. As plastics continue to spread through ecosystems, including remote oceans and mountaintops, it becomes more urgent to study how they affect planetary systems in addition to human health.

In short:

The National Weather Service has 155 open positions, including key roles in hurricane-prone areas like Louisiana, as it rushes to prepare for the June 1 start of hurricane season.

Democrats on the House Science Committee say staff have been urged to take demotions to cover gaps, while internal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) documents reveal shortages in meteorology, IT, and hydrology roles critical to public safety.

Former officials and lawmakers link the shortages to Trump-era workforce reductions and warn that understaffing at NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency could compromise disaster response as climate-driven events intensify.

Key quote:

“We’re not prepared. We’re heading into hurricane season as unprepared as anytime as I can imagine.”

— Tom DiLiberto, former NOAA official

Why this matters:

The National Weather Service staffing crisis couldn’t come at a worse time. As climate change drives stronger hurricanes, heavier rainfall, and more erratic storm patterns, gaps in forecasting and emergency communication could mean communities don’t get timely alerts. Local NWS offices are essential not just for tracking storms but for coordinating with emergency responders on the ground. If hydrologists, IT specialists, or lead meteorologists aren’t in place, radar systems could fail or data could lag just when it's needed most. Compounding the issue, NOAA’s tracking systems for billion-dollar disasters and polar data are also under threat.

In short:

AmeriCorps, the national service agency that deployed over 200,000 people annually, has been severely slashed by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), cutting 85% of staff and canceling $400 million in grants.

Programs across California and the U.S. that focused on disaster response, climate resilience, and environmental education have been abruptly halted, leaving communities and volunteers stranded mid-service.

Lawsuits from states and grant recipients aim to block the cuts, arguing that the dismantling of AmeriCorps threatens essential recovery efforts in the face of rising extreme weather and weakens national disaster preparedness.

Key quote:

“This will be disastrous to communities. And the thing that’s really unfortunate is we won’t feel it until after disaster hits.”

— Dana Fisher, professor at American University’s School of International Service

Why this matters:

AmeriCorps played a quiet but essential role in disaster recovery across the United States. By pulling thousands of young people into public service for modest pay, it built a decentralized but responsive force that could be quickly mobilized during emergencies. These programs often served as the first boots on the ground and the last to leave after disasters, especially in underserved areas where local support is thin. The decision to dismantle AmeriCorps comes as climate-fueled disasters intensify in frequency and scale. Without these workers, communities face longer recovery times, more chaos, and fewer hands to help. At the same time, other critical institutions like FEMA and NOAA are facing similar rollbacks, compounding the risk.",https://www.dailyclimate.org/media-library/a-sign-on-a-concrete-building-reading-united-states-environmental-protection-agency.jpg?id=60261355&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C96%2C0%2C97,N,,2025-05-16 13:13:55.079982

Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored. The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

Energy inequality across America

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see. Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods. “I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.

Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

Solar helps cool city

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate income households.

“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.

“Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

The window will close on 14 April.

According to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, “This is our clean energy superpower mission in action, kickstarting growth, delivering energy security and transforming towns and cities as part of the transition – from the ports of Nigg and Leith to the manufacturing hubs of Blyth and Hull”.

So, what is the CIB? How will it work? And can it live up to the Energy Secretary’s ambitions?

The CIB (previously titled Sustainable Industry Reward) applies to all offshore wind projects bidding for funding through Allocation Round 7 of the CfD scheme and is governed by its own allocation framework. It has two components:

a mandatory or minimum component (which sets a compliance ‘floor’ for all relevant CfD applicants); and

an optional or extra component (which makes additional CfD revenues available on a competitive bid basis).

To participate in the CfD allocation round, all relevant CfD applicants must obtain what is known as a CIB statement. In order to obtain a CIB statement, each such applicant must meet a set of CIB minimum standards, demonstrating investment of at least £100 million per gigawatt (GW) (fixed) or £50 million (floating) in shorter supply chains (criterion 1 investment), and/or sustainable means of production (criterion 2 investment).

Criterion 1 investment may be made in manufacturing facilities or installation firms for a defined category of key components. They may also be made in ports, however, the ports in question must all be located in specified deprived UK areas.

Criterion 2 investment may be made in component manufacturing facilities or installation firms that have committed to a ‘Science Based Target’ set under the Science Based Target initiative.

Please note, in either criterion CIB investments can only be made in tangible assets (as opposed to intangible assets such as skills, and research and development) and must be made after 13 March 2024, but before the relevant CfD start date.

As well as obtaining a CIB statement, each relevant applicant is also entitled to submit a range of proposals under the CIB extra component to make additional criterion 1 or criterion 2 investments (on top of the minimum investment already committed to obtain the statement).

These proposals will be ranked by the value of the investment proposed, relative to its cost (in terms of the amount of subsidy sought). Top ranked bids will be allocated additional CfD revenue under the CIB budget, which was set indicatively in November 2024 at £27 million per GW of total capacity covered by CIB statements. Part of the budget will be ring-fenced for floating proposals.",https://shepwedd.com/themes/custom/awbs4/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-16 10:09:37.333579

And that’s what the staff did for the Palisades restart environmental assessment,” Naber said.","As New Jersey-Based Holtec International works its way toward restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in West Michigan, a host of organizations are challenging regulator’s findings that reviving the reactor would not bring significant harm to the environment.

The Palisades restart marks the first effort of its kind in the United States, with the federal government awarding the effort a $1.5 billion loan alongside $150 million in state funding to bring the facility back online.

However the effort is not without its detractors, as some environmental organizations have argued against providing state funding for the effort, while other organizations have opposed the plant over safety and environmental concerns.

In a virtual hearing Thursday morning, attorneys representing Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, Michigan Safe Energy Future, Three Mile Island Alert, and Nuclear Energy Information Services asked a panel Atomic Safety and Licensing Board panel to accept a motion allowing them to file new and updated contentions. Those contentions argue the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission erred when it issued a finding of no significant impact for the project, allowing it to forgo a full review of environmental impacts.

“The position of the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] staff seems to be that, since the plant was operable in May 2022 that simply a return to operability means that there are no significant environmental impacts,” said Wallace Taylor, an attorney representing the anti-nuclear groups, arguing that the environmental analysis should have come from a perspective of retooling, recalibrating and restarting a dormant facility.

The Commission issued a draft of its findings in January, where it outlined the purpose and need reviving the facility would serve, the level of environmental review needed and provided a description of the plant, any potential alternatives, and the various ways it could impact the environment.

The environmental assessment cites Michigan’s standard for 100% clean energy by 2040, which includes provisions for nuclear energy and natural gas with 90% effective carbon capture technology in justifying the need for the project. It also argues the facility will enhance electrical reliability in the state by generating consistent, carbon-free energy and reducing the state’s reliance on imported energy sources.

Although the commission reviewed alternatives like replacing the current reactor with a new reactor; replacing the reactor with other alternatives like natural gas, solar and wind; and using alternative system designs with the current reactor, it only provided further analysis for a no-action alternative, where it would deny the authorizations needed to bring Palisades back online.

After reviewing a number of potential concerns, commission staff ultimately concluded the project would have no significant environmental impacts, and that choosing not to grant the authorizations Holtec needs to operate the plant would violate the purpose and need of the project: meeting clean energy demand.

Terry Lodge, also representing the groups challenging the review, contended that the purpose of need statement was flawed, arguing it presents a restart of the plant as the only viable option without offering any justification or explanation of the demand for power.

Lodge and Taylor also argued the limited consideration of alternatives to the plant was similarly problematic.

“I think that it’s pretty obvious that renewable energy would have a lessened environmental impact than a nuclear plant, which would require uranium mining, which would require something to be done with the radioactive waste. There’s radioactive material, like tritium, for example, that comes from nuclear plants, and all of that would have to be considered to have a really appropriate discussion in the [environmental analysis], and that wasn’t done,” Taylor said.

Lodge further contended that the impact of the project remains unclear, as Holtec is still working to identify whether it needs to replace key components of the reactor, like steam generators, arguing the environmental effects of the restart are not yet known and quantified.

While justifying their findings, commission staff explained that the purpose and needs statement is used to determine the range of alternatives considered within the assessment.

Anita Naber, representing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, explained that the alternatives analysis is intended to determine whether there are other options available or environmentally preferable alternatives.

She later explained that while developing a purpose and need statement for their environmental analysis, staff members give substantial weight to the goals and needs of an applicant, in line with both the commission’s policy and case law.

“The staff will look at the applicant’s purpose and need and the factual background and information that’s submitted by the applicant in support of that purpose and need and evaluate that. And that’s what the staff did for the Palisades restart environmental assessment,” Naber said.

In offering their closing arguments to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, the plant’s opponents emphasized that an environmental impact should have been required for the project since the beginning, and would have required a much more in-depth analysis of alternatives.

However, members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec argued that the contentions filed by the opposing groups should be denied, as they were not responding to new information as required by the commission’s rules. Naber also noted that the commission expects petitioners to file contentions on the basis of an applicant’s environmental report rather than delaying them until after the staff issues its environmental analysis.

“To have their contentions admitted for hearing, petitioners must demonstrate some sort of genuine factual or legal dispute with the staff draft [environmental analysis], which they have not done. They also need to provide actual fact or expert support for their assertion, but they have not done this either,” Naber said.

On rebuttal, Lodge argued that the Commission’s rules allow petitioners to file new or amended contentions based on a draft or final environmental impact statement, environmental assessment or any supplements to those documents.

“We timely and we believe properly under this section amended our contentions,” Lodge said, arguing their updated contentions should not be excluded as a result.

The panel will take the matter under consideration and will determine whether to accept the opposition’s updated contentions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Palisades-plant.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:10:47.577087

“This [environment protection reform] would be an ideal opportunity for her to show that she’s serious about that,” he said.","Legislating a federal environment protection agency is a “very high and immediate” priority for the re-elected Labor government, new minister Murray Watt has said, signalling he wants nature laws passed quickly to avoid another drawn-out political fight.

In an early statement of intent, Watt will next week travel to Western Australia where he intends to meet face to face with the premier, Roger Cook, and mining industry leaders whose lobbying helped sink the proposed EPA in the previous term.

In his first interview with Guardian Australia in the role, the Queensland senator said he was also considering dropping the “nature positive” title for Labor’s wider overhaul of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (Epbc).

“I am considering the type of language we use to describe these reforms,” Watt said.

“I think the more we can explain these concepts in terms that Australians can understand and buy into, I think that does improve our chances of building public support for them.”

The former industrial relations minister was last week appointed to replace Tanya Plibersek, whose three years in the environment portfolio were defined by a failure to win support for promised nature protection laws.

Watt’s first priority is a decision on Woodside’s application to extend its North-West shelf gas project to 2070 – due on 31 May – before he turns his attention to fixing the EBPC Act.

The Labor frontbencher said it was “certainly his intention” to make a ruling before the deadline rather than seek another extension.

Plibersek was on the cusp of a deal with the Greens in November to establish the EPA before it was scuttled by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, amid pressure from Cook and WA miners.

Albanese stepped in again in February, shelving the legislation indefinitely to the anger of environmental groups and grassroots Labor members.

The prime minister recommitted during the election campaign to establish a federal nature watchdog but not in the some form to the one shunted weeks earlier.

With the government committed to fresh rounds of talks with industry and environment groups, Watt would not be drawn on the possible design of EPA 2.0, including the option of an agency that enforces nature laws but does not approve projects.

Albanese offered up that model – which sections of industry backed – in a futile attempt to win the Coalition’s support in the previous term.

The EPA was just one part of the wider “nature positive” plan, which also included a suite of national environmental standards in line with recommendations in Graeme Samuel’s review of the EPBC Act.

Plibersek put the standards on the backburner, with no timeframe for their implementation, after splitting up the package in April last year.

Watt said he was open to changing course, pursing one large set of laws – including an EPA – rather than multiple tranches.

“It was absolutely understandable that we progressed the reforms in a staged manner prior to the election,” he said. “I’ve got a genuinely open mind about that (one broader bill). There will be pros and cons about that, and that’s one of the things that I want to consider.”

Watt has not formed a view about national environmental standards but said it was “his intention to progress these reforms in the spirit of Graeme Samuel’s recommendations”.

The new minister wouldn’t set a deadline for the legislation but has signalled Labor wants to resolve the legislation early in the term, outside the heat of the pre-election period.

“This is a very high and immediate priority for the government,” Watt said.

“It’s why on day one on the job, I was on the phone to all of the key stakeholders talking about this. It’s why I’m headed to WA next week … to get those conversations started.

“I do think that the immediate period after an election is an ideal time to settle complicated, contentious reforms and I want to use that opportunity to the best effect.”

The minister insisted he wasn’t “picking sides” in the debate, having held phone calls with environment groups, such as Greenpeace and Australian Conservation Foundation, and industry groups such as the Minerals Council of Australia.

Watt was open to working with either the opposition or the Greens to strengthen environment laws, with both parties under new leadership after the election.

The new Greens leader, Larissa Waters, urged the government to be “bold” as she reaffirmed the party’s position on banning native forrest logging and blocking new coalmines and gas fields.

Labor has ruled out a ban on native forrest logging but has committed to applying national environmental standards to regional forestry agreements.

The government also has no plans to add a “climate trigger” to environmental laws, adamant the safeguard mechanism is an appropriate mechanism to regulate emissions from fossil fuel projects.

Watt welcomed Waters’ commitment to a “constructive” approach to dealing with Labor.

TRANSCRIPT

Opening remarks

Murkowski: Good morning, the Committee will come to order. I'd like to welcome Administrator Zeldin to the committee here this morning. I think it is important that as we begin our budget hearings, we begin the oversight through the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee with the EPA, an area of interest, I think, for all of us, as we think about how we ensure that Americans from Alaska to Oregon, to New York to all the places in between, have the benefits of clean air, clean water for all of us.

So, thank you, Administrator, for being here to discuss the Fiscal Year 2026 budget request. We recognize that what we have seen is “skinny,” as we refer to it around here. Each year, the subcommittee holds a hearing to examine the EPA budget requests. Some years, the budget is the focus of the hearing, and others, it's agency actions that draw the majority of the questions. I think it's probably safe to assume that this year it's going to be a mixture of both of these. And again, we've just seen the “skinny” outline of Fiscal Year 2026, we have yet to see the full details of the President's budget request, but I have to say at the outset: looking at some of these proposed cuts, I'm looking at them and questioning whether they are serious cuts. I find many of them problematic. I'm just going to be open and honest with my words here this morning and we will have good dialogue, constructive dialogue, in this committee.

So again, while we're waiting for additional details, I want to spend my time this morning talking about the vision for the EPA and Administrator, how you plan to use your position to continue to better provide clean air, water and land for Americans from Alaska to Florida, from California to Maine, and how a budget like the one that you propose could support that mission.

Under the Biden administration, I had some very serious concerns about the regulatory overreach of the agency. I expressed them often. I also shared the concerns that I felt were overzealous enforcement actions coming out of the agency that went contrary to the needs of Alaskans. We were able to figure out how to find common ground in certain areas to make progress, and some things that were certainly good for Alaska. I mentioned to you contaminated lands, residential wood stove testing and certification. We still have a long, long ways to go on PM, 2.5, I think we know that. PM 2.5 and 301 (h) waivers... We've got work to do. I think we know that.

So now we're in a in a new administration, new administrator and perhaps a different direction here. I do appreciate many of the actions and the initiatives that we have had a chance to discuss. (I) certainly support the willingness to work with the Army Corps of Engineers to review the WOTUS rule, your reconsideration of Clean Power Plan 2.0, the vehicle emissions rules, and then, of course, a renewed focus on permitting, something I would think that all of us can come together on.

But my concern this morning, and what you will hear from me, and I think many others, is the approach that's been taken with regards to freezing funds, canceling grants, and then the reorganization of the agency. I'm looking at it through the not only through the lens of Alaskans, but really all Americans who, regardless of how you feel about the EPA, we benefit from its data driven decision-making, the remediation efforts and the mission to protect human health and environment. And I respect, I give a lot of leeway for an incoming administration's prerogative to implement changes in support of the policies and priorities, but it also has to be done with clear articulation of the of the goals against which such changes will be measured.

And so, it's problematic when as a committee we're asking questions, we don't receive basic data that would be helpful, would be good guidance for us. And so, when we see implementation of significant changes without working or seriously communicating with us, your partners in Congress, it just makes it harder for us to do the job of supporting your mission. We are on the same side here, and so we want to work with you in so many of these areas.

I think we all can agree that there are inefficiencies and redundancies to be found throughout the federal government, some of EPA programs we know are overly burdensome. And again, I applaud the administration for seeking to find ways to help ordinary Americans cut through red tape and make programs easier to access. But the seemingly indiscriminate freezing of EPA funding, regardless of source, has caused some significant anxiety from the folks that I'm talking to in Alaska. One example is the Community Change Grants in my state, we've received $150 million from this program. It's communities like the little village of Kipnuk, it's the Native village of Kotzebue. Took a lot of work to get to the place where they were able to secure the funding, and they've had their grants canceled by the agency without any explanation, and so this is where some of the anxiety comes, is just not knowing why.

It's not just in Alaska. I think members on both sides of the dais can, and probably will, talk about the benefits of the grants to their states and their communities. You've also proposed massive reorganizations of EPA to include the elimination of the Office of Atmospheric Programs and the Office of Research and Development. It is true that agencies funded by our bill will have the flexibility to reprogram and reorganize, and we provide that flexibility because we know - we get it. There can be urgent and exigent circumstances that warrant such actions. However, agencies must comply with the requirements and provide the committees with the requisite information, whether it's budgetary and staffing implications, but also the rationale for the actions to include why these actions are so urgent. And so far, EPA has not adhered to our reprogramming guidelines and has been largely unresponsive to the questions. So, I would certainly expect timely and transparent responses and information. I would expect EPA to abide by the parameters that are outlined in our reprogramming guidelines. And I think, as a former member of Congress, you get it. You've been on the frustration end of things as well. So again, ways that we can be working together.

Now, turning our attention to the FY 26 budget proposal. In Alaska, we've seen on the ground examples of really good things being done with some of the programs that your budget has substantially reduced or proposed to eliminate. Example: the proposed reduction of the State Revolving Fund, reducing it from $2.8 billion down to $305 million. This is an 88% reduction. This was one of the ones when I mention unserious proposal. This is the one that I'm looking at, because it clearly is one of the most essential programs that the agency administers. And you mentioned as part of your justification for cutting this program that the account has been heavily earmarked, and this is true. The 66 members of the Senate, including 17 Republicans, making it our most bipartisan account, who requested congressionally directed spending for the SRF accounts did so in connection with the states to ensure the funding was going to critical clean water and drinking water projects. Now I would also note that in FY 25, Congress voted for, and the President signed into law, a full year CR that keeps the SRF fully funded, rather than reducing it by the amount of the CDS is.

So, I'm going to close my comments here with, I don't know if it's a note of sympathy or just an acknowledgement, because I get it. You are, I think, 106 days since you were confirmed and sworn in as EPA Administrator. And for an agency as key and as vital as yours, that's really a short time to get everything up and running, from enacting the administration's priorities to establishing a clear working relationship with us here in Congress. We know that you're still getting your team in place, because we're trying to move them through our process here, and it is slow, and you need those folks. You need the members of your team. So, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here. There's plenty of time for us to figure out what's working what's not, establish open lines of communication between our teams that will mutually benefit your mission and all those that we work for. So, I'm eager to start on that. I thank you for your testimony today, your willingness to answer our questions and just the opportunity to be working with you. And with that, I turn to ranking member Merkley for his comments.

First line of questions from Murkowski

Murkowski: I will begin with my first five minutes, and again, appreciate the opportunity that you and I have had to discuss some of the particular issues. I'd like to ensure that we continue that very direct engagement, not only between us, but also with our staffs. We've had a conversation about transparency, partnership and responsiveness, and again, I think you come to this position really from a good place, because you've sat in in our seats here, so to speak. When you've asked questions of an agency and you get frustrated because you're not able to get what you're seeking.

So, there is a lot going on within the agency, as you have outlined, and as I suppose the ranking member and I have outlined. But we need to be more informed, rather than getting updates by way of tweets or stories for them from the media. The agency has issued reorganization notifications, but we're not getting the full picture or the answers to some of the questions that we have asked. So, my direct question to you this morning is just a renewed commitment that the promise of transparency, partnership and responsiveness is there, that we're going to be able to have meetings between your senior teams and our folks on the Appropriations side, so that we can help you. Let me help you type of an approach, and that's what I'm seeking from you this morning, Mr. Administrator.

Zeldin: Absolutely, Madam Chair, and you uniquely amongst 535 members of Congress have a “Batphone” into my office, which I would encourage you to use at any time. We’ve spoken since my confirmation, and when we meet, you often have a very long list of priorities for Alaska, that you’re fighting for, that you’re passionate about. And to make sure that we're working through that list at every opportunity is something that will be a priority for our team as long as I am here as administrator, and I would encourage you to reach out whenever you would like, and I'd be available to work through whatever is at the top of your list that day.

Murkowski: Very good. Very good. Let me ask about the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. I mentioned in my opening, these are probably the areas where on this committee we have more bipartisan support for a program, and we're looking at a budget that effectively eliminates the one thing that we're all in agreement on. So, I'd ask you to share with me and the others on the committee why the agency would move away from such a critical on-the-ground program when we're talking about access to clean water?

Zeldin: Madam Chair, as you pointed out in your opening remarks, and as you referenced from the skinny budget that was released that we're here to talk about today, there has been a bleeding out of funds deliberately through decisions made by Congress to earmark. I understand that when I came into this position, I inherited a lot of earmarks that many of you have fought for, and I want to be able to continue to work with each of you and your staffs. In some cases, we need to get the recipients to submit paperwork where they're on the receiving end of big earmarks, so that we can work through this backlog as quickly as we can. It would be helpful to have a conversation about the SRF and the use of earmarks, and how that has been reducing the funding through the years.

As you all know, there's a difference when these skinny budgets come out, whether or not something is funded at $0, or it's funded at $1. Now that might not seem like much to the American public in understanding how these conversations go in Congress. The SRF is not zeroed out in the skinny budget - In fact, it has hundreds of millions of dollars there in it. So, as we go forward with this process, I look forward to more conversations about the SRF, and I'm sure members of the House and the Senate will be having conversations amongst yourselves as to what you believe to be the appropriate funding level for SRF, as well as the future of the program, and whether or not earmarks will continue to be used to reduce that balance. That's obviously a decision that Congress has a very important role to play.

Murkowski: Well we do, and we can have a separate discussion about earmarks. I think we both know that earmarks don't contribute to the top line number you are discussing here. A concern that I have raised with you, that there has been, over the years, Congressionally Directed Spending, earmarks, that have been moved through the process, authorized and appropriated to, and still not spent down. So, my time has expired. Now know that on this next round, I'm going to ask for a little more discussion about that. But I do think that given the significance of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund by so many of us… let's have a broader discussion about how we move forward with what I would think most of us recognize has got to be a priority within the EPA.

Second line of questions from Murkowski

Murkowski: Administrator, I had asked you, we had had a discussion about the Congressionally Directed Spending projects. You have indicated that, indeed, we've got a backlog here that we need to address. My understanding is that since fiscal year 2022, Congress had directed 2,264 CDs projects at the EPA - only 705 have received the funding. So, I think both of us would agree, you know, we've got an issue here. There's a problem. The FY 25 CR, of course, did not include the CDS projects. So, I'm looking at that and saying, all right, the agency has the balance of the fiscal year to work on catching up from this backlog of the CDSs. Can you just give me a little bit of your understanding in terms of how you've directed your team to expeditiously get these projects out the door in a more timely manner?

Zeldin: I appreciate the question, Madam Chair. The backlog goes back years. I've directed my team to both work with the members of Congress who represent those areas, the members of Congress who requested those earmarks to get assistance in the case where the recipient has not been responsive, and simultaneously, to try to engage as much as possible directly with the recipient, to try to get the recipient to submit their paperwork. We want to completely get through the entire backlog that we inherited as quickly as possible.

Murkowski: Can we help you with that?

Zeldin: Yes.

Murkowski: I'm working with my constituents right now as we're moving forward in this year's appropriations and getting requests for CDSs. So, can you perhaps either let me know who it is on your team that we need to be communicating directly to if there are snags on your end, or perhaps, again, you're just not able to get in touch with the applicant?

Zeldin: 100%. As you well know, the EPA is broken down into all sorts of different program offices.

Murkowski: Right.

Zeldin: And the it might not be just one person for all grants. It might depend on whether the backlog might… we might be talking about a backlog inside of the Office of Water, where they need assistance from the members of Congress, or maybe it's another office. Maybe it's the Office of Air and Radiation. We would look forward to an opportunity to work with you and your team, and all members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle as much as possible, to eliminate the backlog that we inherited.

Murkowski: Good, good. Let's do that. I think that's a good plan.

Many members here have asked about different grants and programs, the pauses, the freezes. It's been particularly frustrating in Alaska, when we hear there's been a hold up in terms of the grant award. We've got just a limited construction season. It's just hard. Even if not choked by ice, you might have a barge that comes up with your materials for a project, maybe once, maybe twice a season, and so it can push a project back, not just months, but by another season - another year, perhaps multiple years. It's been hard to provide some clarity to our communities on which grants are going to be awarded, which are just going through the review process that you shared with us, which grants have been terminated.

So, I'd ask if your folks could provide a list of what's actually been paused for review versus what has been terminated. I think we've heard, for instance, on the EJ (Environmental Justice) grants, that one has been perhaps more clear, but there are a lot in between. And I think it would help our communities if there was more certainty as to what has actually been terminated versus what is still in the pipeline for review. So, I'd ask for your help on that.

Zeldin: Absolutely, Madam Chair, and we will continue to be distributing funding appropriated by Congress as we go through the rest of the fiscal year that will include funds for your great, great state, and we look forward to working with you on the process. As you know, when the President first came in, there was an administration-wide pause that was lifted. The pause that was then instituted for EPA was more specific to some of the Inflation Reduction Act programs. There was a Clean School Bus program concern that was that was raised early in the administration, when Lion Electric (Company) and their bankruptcy issue caused some questions to be asked to make sure that the concerns with Lion Electric (Company) were it was just specific to Lion Electric (Company). And as it relates to the grants that were that were canceled, that's something that if you have any questions about what was included in that we're happy to answer any individual questions.

Murkowski: Good, okay, we’ll work with you on that list.

Third line of questions from Murkowski

Murkowski: The operating plan for FY25 we received. It's very much in line with the previous year's funding level for each line item. There's a lot of changes that that have been discussed, but it sounds like you are committing to spending the funds as delineated in the agency's spend plans. And I guess my ask to you is, if that's not going to be the case, that the subcommittee receive a reprogramming request so that we basically follow the process if, in fact, we're not doing the agency is not doing this spend out as we have anticipated, as these small communities understand them.

I just have two very quick follow ups. One is very easy for you, because we've discussed it at length, but it is a significant issue in my state when it comes to contaminated lands. The history that I have shared with you of Alaska Natives receiving their settlement of lands, being conveyed by the federal government. And basically, they were conveyed tainted lands, lands that were contaminated by various actions of federal agencies, whether it's the land managers, or the Department of Defense. And so, we have made some good progress with EPA. And believe me, this is not EPA’s is fault or liability for the contamination. It's the federal governments. But what we have learned is that the EPA is uniquely qualified to help us solve this issue. Over the past couple years, there's been roughly $20 million in funding that has been directed to contaminated lands, and the agencies have been doing some really good work. I just need your commitment that we're going to continue with this. $20 million, unfortunately, doesn't even get the first project cleanup. We know that that these are expensive, but it is an obligation. It is a liability of our government, and we owe it, whether it's to Alaska Natives as conveyance of their settlement, or to others. And I know that when we're talking (EPA) Superfunds, Brownfields, contaminated lands, we just have so much work to do here. So, know that you got cooperation on my level here.

Zeldin: Yes, Madam Chairwoman, I look forward to visiting over the course of the next couple of weeks in Alaska. Might be able to have the opportunity to hear about, see about, see this firsthand, and I will, with regards to all appropriations, make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations under the law. So, if Congress appropriates the funds, we'll make sure that it's spent.

Murkowski: Very good.

PFAS is something that we talk a lot about in Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. Last month, you announced that EPA will “tackle PFAS from all of EPA’s program officers, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable, and providing certainty for passive receivers. You said this was just the beginning of the work that EPA is going to do to tackle PFAS, which I certainly appreciate, and I know most everyone up here does.

Can you tell me whether the operating plan and the skinny budget requests, whether they actually reflect this kind of full forward push on PFAS, and whether it includes the $10 billion that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding provided to take on PFAS contamination. I'm looking at this skinny budget, and I'm saying, good for you, let's go on PFAS. But I'm worried about making sure that we're actually budgeting to do so, and I'm also worried about whether or not with the RIFs that we have seen to date, as well as what is anticipated about perhaps an additional fork in the road, whether we're going to be able to do the job. So again, this is something where you're going to have good support from people in this committee for the initiative. But do you have the budget, and do you have the people?

Zeldin: Senator, we're actually adding people into this effort inside of the Office of Water. As you noted, this spans multiple program offices at EPA. A lot of the PFAS work is done inside of the Office of Water. The reorganization announcement that we made a couple weeks ago includes boosting that effort inside of the Office of Water. The press release from April 28 that you referenced included a lot of different actions that we plan on taking, and everything that the agency has announced is already factored into the skinny budget that is before the committee today.

Murkowski: And so, let me just ask more directly, whether or not you're concerned that the RIFs or the deferred resignation is going to impact your ability to execute, whether it's on the PFAS side or contaminated lands, or any number of issues that you've heard here from members.

Zeldin: No, Madam Chair. This is a very important priority of ours at EPA. When I was in Congress, I was a member of the PFAS Task Force. I had voted for the PFAS action act, when I was a member of the House. I represented the district that had all sorts of different PFAS contamination issues. This is something that, in many respects, started during President Trump's first term in office, and has continued to progress since. And we're going to make sure that we're hitting the ground running. That's included in the April 28 announcement, but as we noted in that announcement, that's just some of the many decisions and important work that's before us. It is a very high priority.

Murkowski: So, you've spoken to the adequacy to meet the PFAS mission. Are you concerned about your numbers EPA wide to do your overall mission, not just specific to PFAS, but with everything else that you're looking at? Because the reduction in staffing, is very significant, you've got to admit that. And so, you've got a big task, and we want you to be able to execute on that. So, just want to hear from you whether you have any concerns about your staffing levels right now.

Zeldin: Madam Chair, we are going to fulfill all statutory obligations. One of the things that was a surprise to me coming into the position was just how many people who are employees at the agency were not working on any statutory obligation at all. And I also want to say that there are a lot of amazing, dedicated employees at EPA. The American public might feel disconnected from agency employees who might be working in Washington, D.C., but there are a lot of people who have been there for a long time. They believe in the agency mission. They work hard every single day. One of the reforms we brought in coming in is ending COVID year remote work. And it's great to hear noise in the building, to see the foot traffic, and to see people being productive and collaborative. But if anyone out there was tuning in and they don't know what the agency looks like, it's filled with a lot of amazing, dedicated workers who believe in the agency's mission, and we're going to work hard to make the public proud.

Murkowski: Well, I'm glad that you've acknowledged your workforce, because I think you do have people who are good public servants. They're proud of the work they do, and they're the work that they do has value. And we want to recognize that.

Closing Remarks

Murkowski: We will have further discussion about so many of these issues: the reorganization, what we're seeing with the grants. But I appreciate, Administrator Zeldin, you appearing before the committee, responding to our questions. We will hold the record open until May 21 for additional questions from members and would look forward to your responses to those as well.

And with that, the committee stands adjourned – we’ve got to vote!

Coastal Review Online

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, speaking Wednesday during a Senate budget hearing in Washington, D.C., dismissed reports that the agency was weakening standards on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also called “forever chemicals.”

During questioning by the chair and ranking member, respectively, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin told the Senate Appropriations Committee that news reports about the EPA weakening PFAS standards were inaccurate and that the standards could instead get tougher. Zeldin said expected job cuts at the agency would not impact its work.

The senators said they were concerned about the EPA’s reductions in force, or RIFs, and its ability to meet commitments made earlier this year about tackling the compounds in soils and waters.

Murkowski noted that the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees EPA funding, frequently discusses PFAS.

“Last month, you announced that EPA will, quote, ‘tackle PFAS from all of EPA’s program offices, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable and providing certainty for passive receivers. You said this was just the beginning of the work that EPA is going to do to tackle PFAs,” she said.

She asked Zeldin whether the EPA’s operating plan budget requests “actually reflect this kind of full-forward push on PFAS and whether it includes the $10 billion that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding provided to take on PFAS contamination.”

Zeldin replied that the EPA was “actually adding people” to its Office of Water, which he said does much of the agency’s work on PFAS. But Murkowski pressed further on the announced RIFs deferred resignations and how they would affect EPA’s ability to execute the plan.

“When I was in Congress, I was a member of the PFAS Task Force. I had voted for the PFAS Action Act. When I was a member of the House, I represented the district that had all sorts of different PFAS contamination issues,” said Zeldin.

Merkley did not appear swayed. He said rough counts showed EPA had lost about 400 people, who were fired within their first year, 560 in the first round of deferred resignations, 180 in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility jobs who were RIF’ed. Another 1,129 exited via second round of deferred resignations, with 1,800 of opt-ins.

“Now we’re up to almost 3,000,” Merkley said. “Office of R and D, it’s rumored that would reduce to 500 positions, which would be a loss of 1,300 additional — now we’re at 4,300. I’ll just point out that for two decades, the level of employment at EPA was about 17,000. Right now, it’s about 14,000, so subtracting the numbers I just shared, we’re talking about more than 4,000 reduction from that.”

He said cutting further to the expected number of 10,000 employees “raises doubts” the agency can meet its own goals.

“It sounds like it’s at odds with your commitment to tackling PFAS and I’m concerned about the numbers,” Merkley said to Zeldin.

Zeldin responded that it was apparent that the question was in response to a news story.

“It might not come as a shock to you, but sometimes the news says stuff that’s not accurate,” Zeldin said. “That is not what the agency announced. As it relates to PFOA and PFAS, you said that we were weakening the standards, and that’s actually the opposite of what the agency actually announced.”

Zeldin said “there was an issue” pertaining to four compounds, “and that’s something that we are going to be going through a process, but that doesn’t mean that the that it gets weaker. The (maximum concentration) might end up getting lower, not higher.”

Merkley entered for the record the Washington Post story with the headline: “EPA plans to weaken rule curbing forever chemicals in drinking water.”

Zeldin said he would “encourage the committee to look at the actual announcement from EPA, as opposed to the Washington Post.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zeldin.jpg?fit=1200%2C786&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-16 08:04:54.671422

Boxtown residents hoping to question Musk himself haven’t had a chance — he hasn’t appeared at any community meetings.","MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Homes without indoor plumbing. Few streetlights. Virtually no public transportation. Half a century ago, residents of Boxtown, a neighborhood in South Memphis settled by formerly enslaved families, felt forgotten by the modern age. But no longer.

They are now at the center of a battle with the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who built what his company xAI has dubbed the world’s largest supercomputer, Colossus, roughly 2 miles away.

City leaders see Musk’s arrival in Memphis, Tennessee, as a coronation of its future economy, a chance to transform the region into a “high-tech manufacturing hub.” Like their counterparts in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, they were eager to recruit tech companies looking for homes outside Silicon Valley. Musk’s xAI would bring tax revenue and new jobs.

“It represents a tremendous opportunity,” Mayor Paul Young recently told NBC Nightly News, “an opportunity for us to take our economy to the next level.”

But in an area beset by industrial pollution, residents are wary of the methane gas turbines helping to power the electricity-hungry behemoth. The turbines give off nitrogen oxides, a key contributor to smog, and formaldehyde, among other pollutants, according to their manufacturer. Residents say public input has been limited and the company hasn’t been transparent about its plans.

xAI has vowed to stay below allowed limits on pollutants. In response to questions from NBC News, the company defended its process. “xAI works collaboratively with County and City officials, EPA personnel, and community leaders regarding all things that affect Memphis,” it said in a statement, adding that its tax revenue would support “vital programs and services” in the area.

Still, residents of Boxtown, a nearly all-Black community, have their doubts. “How do we really know what is coming from those facilities?” said Sarah Gladney, 71. “They can tell us anything, but how do we really know?”

Their skepticism has deep roots. For decades, outsiders with big plans have come and gone, sometimes leaving the air worse than they found it. But now the outsider also happens to be one of the country’s most powerful men, one who has been helping to run it alongside President Donald Trump. What happens next could test the limits of Musk’s power and the strength of environmental protections.

In at least two other states, Musk’s companies have run afoul of regulators and have been cited or fined for allegedly breaking environmental rules — Tesla in California, and SpaceX and The Boring Co. in Texas. The companies have denied wrongdoing.

Separately, Trump has vowed to shift the focus of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has already dismantled teams created under the Biden White House to address environmental justice issues like those now facing Boxtown.

In coming weeks, the Shelby County Health Department is expected to decide whether to approve xAI’s permit to permanently install 15 turbines. Meanwhile, xAI has already purchased another property in nearby Whitehaven to expand its operations in Memphis.

Local residents aren’t backing down. Their distrust escalated into anger in late April, when they packed a meeting to fight xAI’s permit approval.

At the hearing, xAI senior manager Brent Mayo, clad in a black T-shirt and hat with the company logo, said its turbines would be equipped with technology to lower emissions, making it the “lowest-emitting facility in the country.”

After roughly a minute, several in the crowd began to chant, “People over property. People over property,” drowning him out.

The dirt roads, hogs and cotton fields that once made Boxtown feel more country than city are long gone. But the neighborhood still feels alive with history — both good and bad.

Older residents talk about how their ancestors settled here, building homes out of scraps of boxcars, which gave the area its name.

""They wanted something they could call their own,"" said Raymond C. Cheers, 74, a local historian, noting that some of the freedmen who lived in Boxtown are now buried in a cemetery there at Mount Pisgah Baptist Church.

As a child growing up in the then-unincorporated Boxtown, Brenda Odell, now 76 and retired from a career in education, remembers going down with her family to check out the site of a future power plant.

It was the Jim Crow South, but Odell said there was a sense of hope around the Allen Fossil Plant. Yet, as she reached adulthood, many in the community still lacked electricity, even after Boxtown was annexed by Memphis. And by the time the Tennessee Valley Authority decommissioned the facility in 2018, millions of tons of hazardous coal ash were left behind.

“Everybody was excited, you know,” she said. “And now they’re having to take the coal away.”

Other businesses have come to South Memphis, leaving pollution in their wake. A facility that sterilized medical equipment closed shortly before xAI’s arrival, after the EPA found a heightened cancer risk in the area due to the plant's ethylene oxide emissions. Sterilization Services of Tennessee said at the time it had “never been out of compliance” with local, state and federal regulations and had issues relating to a lease extension before it closed.

KeShaun Pearson, president of Memphis Community Against Pollution, says the neighborhood, whose zip code has a median income just under $37,000, is sometimes seen as an easy target.

“They always come to southwest Memphis,” Pearson said. “They always come to what they believe is the path of least resistance.”

Shelby County, which includes Boxtown, leads the state in emergency room visits for asthma. One study found that Southwest Memphis has at least 22 local pollution sources and a cumulative cancer risk four times higher than the national average. Last month, the county received an “F” from the American Lung Association for its air quality.

Dr. Christie Michael, an associate professor with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, who oversees a program for high-risk pediatric asthma patients at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital, said any additional pollution is too much.

“If we’re already struggling in Shelby County to meet the EPA standards, and we haven’t been,” she said, “regardless of how responsible this is, it’s not going to help.”

When xAI first launched its chatbot in 2023, it described Grok as an edgier AI, with a “bit of wit” and a “rebellious streak.” But training Grok to answer quickly and accurately requires massive computing power, roughly 200,000 graphics processing units housed in a facility whose main building is the size of 13 football fields.

By using a shuttered Electrolux factory, Musk was able to bring Colossus online in just 122 days and double its size in less than a year, giving his artificial intelligence company, xAI, a competitive advantage.

In a webinar, a consultant for xAI said the turbines the company used were intended to be temporary and did not need a permit for their first year of use, a view endorsed by the mayor, the health department and the Chamber of Commerce.

Environmental advocates disagree. “Not getting a permit from day one was circumvention,” said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “And we’re certainly concerned that it’s going to continue.”

“xAI’s operations comply with all applicable laws,” the company said in a statement, adding that it intended to use “Lowest Achievable Emission Rate” turbines and relegate stationary turbines “to a backup power role, which will further reduce emissions” once another power source is available later this year.

Boxtown residents hoping to question Musk himself haven’t had a chance — he hasn’t appeared at any community meetings.

Sitting on her front porch with her friend Easter Knox, Gladney mulled over what she’d say to him. “What was the rush?” she said she’d ask.

“Did you even know that this community has already been fighting, and has all these polluters surrounding us?”

In its January application, xAI included a 19-page “environmental justice review,” arguing that the project was safe. The scope was limited to the nonresidential area closest to the facility, leaving out nearby communities like Boxtown.

Shaolei Ren, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied the health costs of data centers, said emissions’ risks can be far reaching.

“A lot of people think if they are not living next to the emission sources, they are not affected by the air pollutant,” he said. “That’s not true because these air pollutants can really travel hundreds of miles, and they are not limited by the state lines or county lines.”

At the request of the mayor’s office, Chunrong Jia, a professor of environmental health at the University of Memphis, used xAI’s data to model the potential impact of running 15 turbines for Colossus, if approved, and projected its emissions were unlikely to threaten local air quality for residents. But Jia’s analysis was based on data provided by xAI rather than on independent air monitoring.

“The modeling results were preliminary,” Jia said. “We still had a lot of uncertainty, a huge uncertainty behind that modeling process.”

In an interview last week, Young said he planned to work with Jia to implement air monitoring in the coming months.

Days before the public hearing in April, some residents received anonymous mailers with the message: “Breathe Easy, Memphis!” equating xAI’s emissions to those of a neighborhood gas station.

But local residents remain skeptical. Toward the end of the hearing, Alexis Humphreys, a 27-year-old who lives in Boxtown, asked those in the room with asthma to raise their hands, as she held up her inhaler. Her mother and her 87-year-old grandmother have it too, she said.

“I can’t breathe at home, it smells like gas outside,” she said, about the existing pollution in the area, facing representatives of the Shelby County Health Department and Greater Memphis Chamber.

“How come I can’t breathe at home and y’all get to breathe at home?”

Though Boxtown has a legacy of environmental harm, it also has a tradition of activism.

Easter Knox moved to the area in 1977 after marrying her husband, Starry, and has come to be known to local children as “Mama Easter.”

Inside her home, she has a picture of Black men carrying the “I Am a Man” sign from the city’s 1968 sanitation strikes. Martin Luther King Jr. was in Memphis supporting the workers’ demands for safer working conditions when he was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel.

In Boxtown, Knox has seen echoes of the injustices he fought. In 2019, two companies announced plans to run a crude oil conduit, known as the Byhalia Pipeline, through the community, which activists saw as a threat to drinking water, though the companies denied it. Some families were sued in an effort to seize their land.

Knox and others protested the pipeline, and eventually, the oil and gas giants backed off.

She sees the battle with xAI as a similar one.

“It’s just sort of hard, you know, when people got money,” Knox said, wearing a mask because of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

She’s said she relies on her faith to stay positive and sees her activism as a gift to future generations.

“Hopefully when I’m gone and left the scene, they can continue to fight,” Knox said.

For now, xAI appears to be responding, at least to some extent. Through the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, it announced plans to remove some of the turbines within two months.

And while the company recently acquired a 1-million-square-foot site in Whitehaven, the chamber said xAI would not be using gas turbines there.

Pearson will be watching closely. “Until we see all of the turbines removed from South Memphis, there’s nothing to celebrate, and there’s nothing to believe,” he said. “We believe facts down here.”

Gladney, a retired postal worker, has grown accustomed to living in a neighborhood that’s become a battleground in the fight for clean air.

Even before xAI moved in, she stopped walking as frequently in the neighborhood, which depending on the day, can smell like chemicals or sewage, she said.

“It’s really hard to continue to walk in a community where the unknown is going on,” Gladney said.

Still, she’s not willing to give up the fight. “Some people say, ‘Well, you know, why don’t y’all move?” she said. “And my question is, ‘Why don’t you move from where you live?’ If you keep moving, things will never change.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250510-triptych-memphis-boxtown-ch-1651-5897f3.jpg",N,,2025-05-16 10:10:36.513944

Aprill, Hillary Kane",,,,,https://nonprofitquarterly.org/flood-insurance-is-becoming-unaffordable-can-community-based-catastrophe-insurance-help/,"Flood insurance is essential for families to protect their homes, which are often people’s most valuable assets.
The Issues with Flood Insurance FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance to qualified residents (those who have a government-backed mortgage) who live in participating communities by way of a network of insurance companies.
Peter Waggonner, public policy manager at New Orleans’s Coalition for Sustainable Flood Insurance, told the radio program Marketplace that the higher premiums are simply unaffordable for some households.

While subsidizing would be a good start, the issues with flood insurance reach beyond federal policies and into the private insurance market.","On Valentine’s Day 2025, roughly nine inches of rain began falling in Kentucky, at least eight inches in Tennessee, and five in Virginia. Adding to the torrent was the spring snowmelt and soil unable to adequately absorb moisture due to being thinned by mining.

Rivers overflowed. Landslides overtook homes. More than 300 roads were closed across Kentucky, hundreds of families were displaced, and more than 1,000 people had to be rescued. Twenty-one people died in Kentucky and one person died in Georgia, all while many communities were still struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene last September.

Then there’s the insurance issue. Flood insurance is essential for families to protect their homes, which are often people’s most valuable assets. But as climate change worsens disasters, including floods, across the globe, home insurance is becoming increasingly expensive and difficult—sometimes impossible—to acquire. This renders recovery from a disaster prohibitive.

The Issues with Flood Insurance

FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance to qualified residents (those who have a government-backed mortgage) who live in participating communities by way of a network of insurance companies. But in 2023 FEMA recalculated its prices after updating the flood maps it uses. The cost for some policyholders increased more than 600 percent.

Peter Waggonner, public policy manager at New Orleans’s Coalition for Sustainable Flood Insurance, told the radio program Marketplace that the higher premiums are simply unaffordable for some households. His coalition wants the government to subsize the cost of NFIP flood insurance (which provides nearly all of the nation’s flood insurance policies) for low-income homeowners.

“They could receive a discount from that based on their ability to pay so they could stay in their home and continue to serve the community that they live in,” Waggonner said.

While subsidizing would be a good start, the issues with flood insurance reach beyond federal policies and into the private insurance market.

The cost for some policyholders increased more than 600 percent.

According to a 2022 survey from Fannie Mae of nearly 4,000 residents in high- and medium-risk flood areas, 56 percent of respondents with varied flood insurance policies said that their premiums increased over the previous year. Twenty percent of respondents reported a “significant” increase in their overall homeowners’ insurance premiums, too.

Areas in Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida, Ohio, and Texas saw double-digit or triple-digit increases in the cost of their flood insurance, according to the survey. Residents of Jupiter Inlet in Florida’s Palm Beach County saw an average increase of 342 percent.

On top of that, property values in flood-prone areas are declining due to severe weather events. As of July 2024, roughly 9 percent of all US properties were at risk of flooding. About 92 percent of those properties were not covered by an active NFIP policy as of May 1, 2023.

Properties within communities of color, communities comprised mostly of primary (versus secondary) residences, and properties that are inland versus coastal are less likely to be covered by an NFIP flood policy. This last point is particularly salient for inland communities like western North Carolina that have been hit by flooding from extreme rainfall, rather than from coastal weather events.

Community Suffering, Community Solutions

It’s more than just homeowners and families who are impacted by flood damage without insurance. Communities suffer, too.

As the Nature Conservancy wrote, “From rural river towns to big cities, significant and repeated flood events can destroy wealth among the uninsured and depress growth for years, if not decades, as the community recovers. In severe cases where recovery isn’t possible, relocation is yet another possible financial burden on the uninsured.”

“Flood events can destroy wealth among the uninsured and depress growth for years, if not decades, as the community recovers.”

According to a 2021 report from risk strategy firm Marsh & McLennan Companies, and the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Process Center at the University of Pennsylvania, insurance plays “a critical role in the recovery from disasters, but many households and small businesses do not have sufficient savings to fund repair and rebuilding on their own.”

Because grants, loans, and other forms of disaster aid can be slow and insufficient, “insurance is a vital source of adequate and immediate recovery funds, yet many remain uninsured against disasters—referred to as the protection gap,” according to the report. When properties are insured, “overall community recovery improves and helps to reestablish the local economy.”

That’s why, the report’s authors argue, new models of catastrophe insurance have to be explored and implemented. Community-based catastrophe insurance (CBCI) is one such avenue.

According to the report, “In a CBCI program, a community—loosely defined as any community organization, special-purpose district, or public entity—arranges insurance protection on behalf of its members or to the benefit of its members. By securing coverage for a group of properties, CBCI has the potential to help close the disaster protection gap, improving financial recovery for communities.” Furthermore, “CBCI could also be designed to provide more affordable disaster insurance coverage and could be linked directly to financing approaches for community-level hazard mitigation.”

The Hope of De-growth

The report outlines several structural approaches to creating and delivering a CBCI program, but importantly, notes that insurance doesn’t stand alone: “The community should also be able to implement risk reduction measures.” In order to mitigate flooding risks, floodplains have to be protected, stormwater runoff has to be slowed and reduced, and, perhaps, de-growth has to be embraced.

“By securing coverage for a group of properties, [community-based catastrophe insurance] has the potential to help close the disaster protection gap.”

As defined by The Swaddle, de-growth “suggests a series of changes in both individual lifestyles and existing political and economic systems to support a model of living that can halt the earth’s current rate of warming and depletion of natural resources.” De-growth is a longer-term plan addressing and responding to environmental limits, and it would mean a radical change in thinking.

This reduction in economic development can be a hard sell, especially to those invested in real estate. But considering that development in floodplains only exacerbates the climate crisis and puts residents at increasing risk, a change is necessary. Until de-growth takes hold, CBCIs—an affordable, proactive, community-based insurance structure—can be a good interim solution.

PFAS are a group of human-made chemicals known as “forever chemicals” because they do not easily break down in the environment. They are ubiquitous in our modern world and have been used for decades in everything from non-stick pans to waterproof clothing to fire-fighting foam and beyond. These chemicals accumulate in the body and are associated with a variety of health harms. In 2024, the Biden administration established the first national drinking water standards for five PFAS.

EPA plans on maintaining the standards for the two most common PFAS—PFOA and PFOS—but will delay compliance deadlines for water systems by two years from 2029 to 2031. PFOA and PFOS have a maximum contaminant level of four parts per trillion, which is almost at the lowest level these chemicals can be detected.

EPA will also rescind standards for three other PFAS—PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX Chemicals)—as well as a health hazard assessment for mixtures containing PFBS.

This announcement was met with mixed reactions. Environmental groups have generally criticized the decision, claiming it will worsen public health. On the other hand, some industry groups have given positive feedback, noting that the new rule will provide necessary time for compliance and an opportunity to better understand these chemicals. The timeline certainly provides some reprieve to water systems needing to meet the required standards. Background PFAS levels are already exceeding the maximum allowable limit in many places around the world. For context, PFAS were detected in Mt. Everest Base Camp snow and meltwater at concentrations up to 26.14 parts per trillion.

PFAS regulation is a rapidly evolving area of law and affected groups should stay informed of any new developments.

And carbon dioxide wells in Texas are expected to cause more earthquakes, blowouts and other geological issues.
“Arizona has long prioritized securing authority over underground injection wells, and I’m encouraged to see the EPA take this important step forward,” Hobbs said in a statement.
“(ADEQ) should absolutely say no to these carbon storage injection wells and for other injection wells,” Bahr said.
“Any carbon injection facility would have to meet the (Underground Injection Control) program requirements, which includes demonstrating that Arizona’s underground sources of drinking water are protected,” Baggiore said.","Arizona will have total control over regulation of underground wells to store carbon captured from industrial facilities, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday, even as environmental groups have been urging the EPA to halt approvals of the wells.

Underground injection wells, often referred to as carbon injection wells, are viewed by some as a way to store carbon dioxide in the earth — but in liquid form instead of the gas that is a driving force behind climate change.

However, the largely untested technology hasn’t been deployed without its problems, including one pipeline rupture that caused evacuations and leaks at wells in Illinois that have raised concerns over possible future water contamination.

And carbon dioxide wells in Texas are expected to cause more earthquakes, blowouts and other geological issues.

Arizona Republicans and Gov. Katie Hobbs applauded the decision to give the power to regulate the wells back to the state.

“Arizona has long prioritized securing authority over underground injection wells, and I’m encouraged to see the EPA take this important step forward,” Hobbs said in a statement. “Giving the state direct oversight is critical to protecting the integrity of our groundwater resources while supporting responsible economic growth and clean energy development. This decision strengthens Arizona’s ability to manage our future and gives us the tools to lead on sustainable resource management and innovation.”

The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the state agency that will be responsible for implementing the proposed changes, submitted a formal application to the EPA in February of 2024 seeking to obtain the ability to directly regulate injection wells.

“We remain committed to advancing state-led protection of Arizona’s groundwater and drinking water resources,” ADEQ Water Quality Division Director Trevor Baggiore said to the Arizona Mirror. “Once granted primacy, ADEQ will be responsible for administering the program in Arizona. This will enable the state to directly regulate Class I, II, III, IV, V, and VI injection wells with oversight tailored to Arizona’s unique hydrogeologic conditions and water protection priorities.”

At a press conference in Washington, D.C., EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin was joined by Arizona GOP Congressmen Andy Biggs, Juan Ciscomani and Paul Gosar Thursday morning to make the announcement. All three applauded the decision, thanking the Trump administration for allowing Arizona to permit the wells.

“This new policy is going to benefit Arizona, and we couldn’t be happier,” Ciscomani said, adding that Trump’s EPA is keeping its promises of “cutting the red tape.”

“This is a tremendous benefit and blessing,” Biggs said. “I’ve never been able to say ‘my friends at EPA,’ but I can now.”

Environmental groups have been voicing concern over underground injection wells — and even suing over their regulation. In West Virginia, a state that was given similar authority recently by the EPA, a lawsuit was filed that argues the state will not have adequate funding to maintain proper oversight of the wells.

That concern is shared by some in Arizona, as well.

“We are especially concerned about the lax oversight with today’s EPA, which has been almost weekly promoting weakening of protections,” Sandy Bahr, Chapter Director for the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club, told the Mirror. “There is also concern about the lack of staff at the EPA and the additional proposed cuts that are under consideration. Our drinking water is just too important.”

Bahr said they are concerned that the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality does not have the adequate funding to do proper oversight.

“(ADEQ) should absolutely say no to these carbon storage injection wells and for other injection wells,” Bahr said. “They should take a good hard look at them and implement the most protective standards possible to ensure protection of our groundwater.”

There are no carbon injection facilities in Arizona and no permits have yet been requested to build any in the state.

“Any carbon injection facility would have to meet the (Underground Injection Control) program requirements, which includes demonstrating that Arizona’s underground sources of drinking water are protected,” Baggiore said.

While much of the metro Phoenix and Tucson regions receive most — if not all — of their water from the Colorado River, the same isn’t true in most of the state, where water comes from underground aquifers.

“It’s not a question of whether these things are going to leak,” Abel Russ, an attorney with the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog organization based in Washington, D.C, told the Louisiana Illuminator last year. “It’s a question of how much is acceptable and how much is going to be happening.”

Although wells to store carbon dioxide have been a major focus, the change also opens up permitting for other types of injection wells. During the fracking process, wastewater is sometimes pumped into underground wells meant to keep the toxic water from contaminating the environment, though it sometimes still finds a way out.

Environmental advocates and residents have raised concerns about the impacts of similar methods used for proposals such as helium fracking in the Navajo Nation and uranium mining in the Coconino Plateau that could both contaminate groundwater in a similar fashion.

The EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on June 25, 2025 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the proposed change where the public can provide feedback.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/carbon-dioxide-storage-well-univ-illinois.png,N,,2025-05-16 03:03:21.394680

The MOA generally sets forth responsibilities for 1) the RRC's proposed Class VI permitting program, 2) the RRC's compliance monitoring and enforcement and 3) the EPA's oversight role for the RRC's administration of its Class VI program.
In EPA Region 6's recent rulemaking supporting Louisiana's Class VI primacy, almost 50,000 comments were received and reviewed by the EPA.","Stakeholders following developments in states obtaining primary authority for implementation and enforcement of permitting of carbon storage and sequestration wells, take notice. With a recent Memorandum of Agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), Texas is a step closer to receiving that authority.

EPA Region 6 Regional Administrator Scott Mason and RRC Chairman and Commissioners executed a Memorandum of Agreement Addendum 2 (MOA) on April 29, 2025, marking a major step toward Texas receiving regulatory control, or primacy, for Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells.

Class VI wells are used at carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities to inject carbon into subsurface geologic formations and regulated by default under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) as a safeguard against potential impacts to underground sources of drinking water. SDWA regulations allow for states such as Texas to apply for regulatory primacy allowing the state to 1) issue permits for Class VI wells and 2) act as the primary enforcement agency. Currently, just four states – Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming – have primacy for Class VI wells. Louisiana is the only state to have primacy in EPA Region 6.

The MOA generally sets forth responsibilities for 1) the RRC's proposed Class VI permitting program, 2) the RRC's compliance monitoring and enforcement and 3) the EPA's oversight role for the RRC's administration of its Class VI program. Highlights include 1) an acknowledgement that the EPA will transfer to the RRC any pending Class VI permits, applications and other information once RRC receives primacy, 2) the RRC commitment to inspections and surveillance of permitted CCS facilities to ensure compliance with permit conditions and other regulatory requirements, and 3) the RRC commitment to public outreach and community engagement, including public meetings at convenient times with translating services, as appropriate, to get early feedback on permit applications. Perhaps unsurprisingly, references to environmental justice that were included in earlier drafts are not present in the executed MOA.

The RRC is several years into the application process, and the end now seems to be in sight. The MOA sets the stage for the RRC to obtain primary responsibility for Class VI UIC permits that support CCS facilities perhaps during this calendar year.

For next steps, the EPA will propose a rule granting primacy for Class VI wells to the RRC with a 45-day notice and comment period. After the close of notice and comment, the EPA will review and provide summaries and responses to the public comments received, including making any necessary revisions or updates to the proposed rule for consideration by the EPA administrator. Once the EPA administrator approves the final rule and selects an effective date, the final rule will be published in the Federal Register.

There is some recent precedent for what we might expect next in Texas. In EPA Region 6's recent rulemaking supporting Louisiana's Class VI primacy, almost 50,000 comments were received and reviewed by the EPA. Many of them focused on the ability of the state to administer the program and the post-closure liabilities associated with CCS projects. Given the commonalities in Texas, it is likely there will again be significant engagement by the public and other stakeholders during the rulemaking process on these topics and potentially others. The EPA's consideration of all comments received, along with the creation of a written response to the comments, will be another significant undertaking. In addition, the final rulemaking will present opportunity for stakeholders that remain skeptical to consider filing a lawsuit challenging the grant of primacy in federal court, as happened in Louisiana.

Strategic Considerations

Given these recent developments in the process for Texas obtaining primacy over the UIC Class VI well program, actions to best position companies and organizations for the transition include:

Engaging with Regulatory Developments. Early involvement helps shape effective programs and policies, so interested parties should stay informed about comment periods and engage in the process – especially as the EPA moves toward the final rulemaking. The number and tenor of public comments will be an important early indicator of whether there will be significant legal or policy challenges and how much longer it might take for Texas to be able to take the reins of the Class VI well program.

Considering Class VI Permit Application and Project Timeline in Texas. Applications currently at the EPA Region 6 office undergoing review could soon be transferred to the RRC once primacy is granted. Applicants should consider which strategic engagements will best position their applications and projects for future success.

Beginning Work for the Transition. Ensure you are prepared to meet the intent and four corners of the Class VI program currently being considered for primacy in Texas, including the RRC's proposed robust public outreach and community engagement efforts during the permit application process.

“When we started [fundraising], my boss told me not to mention decarbonisation or energy transition at meetings,” said one GP, currently raising a renewables-focused fund, at our Women in Private Markets Summit in New York this week. She was not the only manager at the event to express concern or uncertainty about the propects for renewable energy investment and other climate-oriented strategies.

The Trump administration has extolled the virtues of fossil fuels as a power source and withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement. This month Republicans in the House of Representatives have drafted legislation to phase out tax credits for various renewable energy projects.

The downbeat diagnosis at the conference echoed comments from TPG earlier this month: fundraising for climate-related strategies would “be elongated due to policy uncertainty in the US”, said TPG CEO John Winkelreid.

The two top factors holding investors back from committing to climate funds are political uncertainty and illiquidity, according to a survey by sustainable investing platform Capricorn.

So far, so bleak, for environmentalists and climate investors alike in the US. But beneath the fear sit some solid facts worth keeping in mind.

One is that overall demand in the world’s second-largest energy consumer is set to accelerate. After remaining relatively flat for nearly two decades, US electricity consumption is set to grow based on increased commercial usage, such as data centres. Corporates have soaring needs and ambitions for increased usage of renewable energy that seem not to have been thrown off track by the political environment.

This is top of mind for Brookfield. Natalie Adomait, managing partner and chief operating officer in Brookfield’s renewable power and transition group, and one of the speakers at the Impact Investor Global Summit next week, was relatively ebullient when asked on The New Private Markets Podcast about the US energy market: specifically whether it was possible to transact amid this uncertainty. It is not only easier, she asserted, but more attractive, as “there is a bit less competition for investors looking at large developers with strong track records and incumbent teams with ready to build projects”.

Brookfield is currently raising its second global transition fund and has gathered $14 billion towards its target of $17 billion. It will likely soon be joined in the market by Global Infrastructure Partners, part of BlackRock, which is preparing to launch a $10 billion energy transition vehicle. This fund will seek to go beyond renewables to target a brown-to-green decarbonisation approach, with investments in industrials, hydrogen and, in certain use cases, midstream pipelines, all to be considered, reports affiliate title Infrasturcture Investor.

Which takes us to a second hard fact: investor allocations to climate strategies have not disappeared with a change in US administration. As we will report next week, large pension plans with ambitious climate investment strategies – even in the US – are continuing to deploy. “We keep on keeping on,” one tells us.

Fundraising may have slowed down, but the megatrend is not going away. As Just Climate‘s Clara Barby told us last week: “Really insightful allocators are recognising that, if you look back over history, we’ve had a series of moments like this. At these moments, the bounceback after the political setback has actually been even stronger.”",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/05/1100x600-GettyImages-165590627-Converted-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 03:03:55.155369

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced plans to rescind and postpone rules limiting “forever chemicals” in drinking water that were enacted under the Biden administration and designed to prevent millions of people from exposure to these persistent and dangerous contaminants.

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency plans to issue new rules this fall that would repeal drinking water levels for four PFAS chemicals and delay the implementation of limits on two others.

PFAS — or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — have been used in the manufacturing of a huge range of products for decades, becoming ubiquitous in water and soils despite the dangers they pose to human and environmental health. Research has shown that roughly half of the U.S. population consumes water contaminated with PFAS, which are linked to cancers, reproductive and neurological problems and low birth weights. New data shows that PFAS are found at more than 8,500 drinking water sources across all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Recent research has found that PFAS in ocean waters can disrupt carbon cycles, increasing climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Resistance to regulation

The chemical industry and water utilities have fought against any federal limits on PFAS in drinking water for years, but in 2024 the EPA, under President Joe Biden, set limits on six. The rule came after ongoing pushback from the chemical industry, which has long argued that the substances are safe, and marked the first time in decades that the agency took steps to limit unregulated contaminants in drinking water.

“This was a historic regulation and it came after decades of community organizing. Companies have known about the toxicity of these chemicals since the 1950s,” said Mary Grant, the water program director at the advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “Finally the EPA issued these rules, and today Lee Zeldin announced he’s rolling them back.”

‘The Trump administration is proposing to weaken really critical drinking water standards on toxic PFAS chemicals.’ — Rob Hayes, Environmental Advocates NY

After the Biden administration issued the new PFAS rules last April, the chemical industry, represented by the American Chemistry Council and the National Association of Manufacturers, joined with water utilities to sue the agency. Water utility trade associations argued that the costs of complying with the new rule were prohibitive and would be passed on to consumers.

The Trump administration has sought to delay the lawsuit, filing its latest attempt on Monday, saying it anticipated an “announcement of potential proceedings addressing the regulations challenged here.”

The agency’s proposed rollbacks were first reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday.

“On May 14, EPA announced next steps with the intent of reducing the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the Agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these,” said Mike Bastasch, an EPA spokesman, in a written statement.

Proposed new rules

Bastasch explained that the compliance deadline for two types of PFAS — known as PFOA and PFOS, which are older-generation types of the chemicals and less widely used now — would be extended to 2031 under a proposed new rule. Another proposed new rule will attempt to rescind standards on so-called GenX PFAS types and change the “hazard index mixture” of those types, as well as an additional type, known as PFBS, to “to address procedural flaws” by the previous administration.

In their legal challenge to the Biden rules, the chemical industry and water utilities argued the administration made procedural missteps in the regulatory process.

Environmental groups, including those that intervened in the industry’s lawsuit, said they expect to sue over the Trump administration’s move, noting that the Safe Drinking Water Act contains an “anti-backsliding” provision that prevents the agency from issuing rules that are weaker than previous ones.

Advocates for communities affected by PFAS contamination, including especially hard-hit ones in North Carolina and New York, said they were disappointed by the announcement.

“The Trump administration is proposing to weaken really critical drinking water standards on toxic PFAS chemicals,” said Rob Hayes, the water policy director at Environmental Advocates NY. “This will result in more exposure to toxic chemicals to New Yorkers, every time they turn on the tap. … The Trump administration caved to pressure by this very powerful industry. Unfortunately, Americans will pay the price.”

In 2017, residents in coastal North Carolina learned that GenX compounds were in their drinking water and successfully pushed for new safeguards in their water systems. Emily Donovan of the advocacy group Clean Cape Fear lives in a community about 85 miles south of a Chemours chemical plant that produced these GenX compounds for industrial processes.

“That facility was using the Cape Fear River as its sewer system,” Donovan said. “When we first learned about GenX in our tap water, that was such a shock for us. We had a lot of leaders tell us [PFAS levels] met or exceeded state and federal standards — but that’s because there weren’t any.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/05/water-treatment-plant-equipment.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 03:03:33.985643

According to a report from the UCSB Political Science Department, the county could save as much as $100 million by 2045 through avoided mortality costs, minimized oil spill emergencies, and reduced impacts from climate change. The report estimates savings between $54 million and $81 million in mortality-related costs due to mitigated exposure to airborne particulates from the industry.

Currently, Santa Barbara County has 2,348 active and idle oil wells, of which 1,030 are actively producing. There are also nearly 2,500 wells classified as plugged and abandoned.

While the county’s oil and gas production operations generate approximately $512 million in annual direct benefits to oil companies and contribute $7.1 million in property taxes, these revenues represent only 0.2% of the County’s 2024-25 budget and are believed to be insufficient to outweigh the associated environmental and public health costs, according County’s staff report.

As the resolution moved forward with a majority vote, the discussion underscored divisions within the board. Supervisor Bob Nelson was the sole dissenting voice, expressing frustration and describing the resolution as “political theater.”

“Actions that have been advocated by those in the environmental nonprofits in our county. You know, they’ve tried to drag the county into lawsuits which have cost us time and money where we had really no say in whether the pipeline starts again. This is the same thing here,” Nelson remarked during the meeting.

However, Board Chair Laura Capps defended the resolution as forward-thinking and questioned whether we want to be investing in jobs related to clean economy or ones in a dwindling oil and gas economy where there’s only about 100 jobs in the area.

Supervisor Steve Lavagnino was absent from Tuesday’s meeting.

Santa Barbara County’s average oil production over the last five years amounted to 2.7 million barrels annually, highlighting the scale of the sector’s operations. Despite these figures, environmental advocates argue that transitioning away from fossil fuels will yield long-term benefits, including avoided cleanup costs, reduced spill risks, and broader climate adaptation strategies.

As oil production continues to decline, the county faces the challenge of balancing fiscal impacts with the opportunity to position itself as a leader in renewable energy and sustainability in California.",https://www.edhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/oil_pump_stock_image.png?ver=1718947684,N,,2025-05-16 05:04:36.072654

The U.S. power sector is in a state of transition, driven by technological innovations, energy markets, and regulations, and changes in the future electricity generation mix will have important implications for water use. Most models for long-term electricity sector projections do not have sufficient regional detail for analyzing water-related impacts and important decisions on electricity and water usage. In this paper we analyzed how water consumption and usage constraints affect the U.S. electricity generation sector. In addition, we investigated whether current CO2 emissions mitigation policies such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) cap-and-trade program in California would improve or magnify electric sector water reliance. Finally, we analyzed what generation technologies will likely be deployed under different constraint assumptions. Keywords:MARKAL multi-regional model; CO2 emissions reduction policies; power generation technologies; CCS; R&DThis study uses power plant-specific fuel consumption, generation, and water use data to assess changes in the water withdrawn and consumption by thermo-electric power plants across nine census regions. Last decade the average water withdrawn per unit of electrical output decreased over this time, while changes in water consumption rates stayed relatively flat. Changes in water usage are une-venly distributed, as some water-scarce regions experienced increases in cooling water usage for thermal power plants, while others experienced significant water reductions and environmental benefits, especially where coal-fired generation was retired or retrofitted. The results from this study underscore the importance of

The study is focused on the interaction between climate policies and water usage, and will help guide policy making by identify-ing areas, and the extent to which, climate policy can reinforce energy security objectives. The study discusses multiple scenarios, considering the synergistic effects of energy development objectives, diversification in water consumption and withdrawals and environmental regulations in the U.S. at the regional level.MethodsWe adopt an integrated energy systems modeling platform MARKAL that was used to analyze energy, economic, and environmental issues at the global, national, and municipal level over a timeframe of up to several decades. MARKAL is a set of software tools that may be used to quantify the impacts of policy options on technology development and deployment, and resource depletion. MARKAL is a bottom-up, dynamic, linear programming optimization model to find the cost-optimal decarbonization pathway within the context of the entire energy system. MARKAL represents energy imports and exports, domestic production of fuels, fuel processing, infrastructures, secondary energy carriers, end-use technologies and energy service demands of the entire economy. MARKAL does not contain an in-built database, so the user is obliged to enter input parameters. In this study, the publicly available EPAUS9r2016 database had been adopted and modified. The EPAUS9r2016 database divides the U.S. into nine regions based on the U.S. Census Divisions. Each region is modeled as an independent energy system with different regional costs, resource availability, existing capacity, and end-use demands. Regions are connected through a trade network that allows transmission of electricity and transport of fuels. Electricity transmission is constrained to reflect existing regional connections between North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regions as closely as possible. We have examined the techno-economic impacts of the RGGI and GHG cap-and-trade program in California on carbon emissions reductions, electricity gen-eration mix and water consumption and withdrawal through analyzing various assumptions using the following scenarios (see Table 1):ResultsResults are presented in scenario format at the national and regional levels. The modeling scenarios results are compared to each other and a base case scenario. The reduced diversity in electricity input fuels is an important challenge in some scenarios.

The greatest growth in water consump-tion in electricity generation sector in the scenarios without water constraints is expected in West South Central, South Atlantic and Pacific regions or in the regions that are already experiencing intense competition over water. By 2050, in the scenarios without CO2 constraints, water withdrawal drops in New England, East North Central, South Atlantic and Mountain regions in response to decreased electricity generation and replacement of once-through cooling systems by recir-culating systems.ConclusionsStrategies for achieving either water reductions or CO2 emissions reductions in the power generation sector have been explored independently in the literature but the interplay of these constraints have been examined to a lesser extent. Previous studies have focused on various aspects of the water and energy link, including aggregate views across energy sectors and impacts of regional variation in water shortages on electricity generation. The future water demand in the electricity gen-eration sector will be affected by the increase of electricity demand and by the power generation mix at the technologies’ levels. The electricity demand and gen-eration mix projections vary, and are highly uncertain and depend on many fac-tors, including market and economic conditions, energy policies, resource avail-ability, technologies’ deployment and environmental regulations. In comparison with previous work on this topic, our study summarizes interactions in multiple energy scenarios not previously explored in the context of the U.S. electric sector regional water usage.Coal plant retirement along the associated cooling systems plays a major role in water withdrawal reductions in the scenarios with CO2 constraints. Replacement of old facilities also increases generating efficiency and consequently decreases with-drawal. The significance of electricity generation sector water demand depends to some extent on local conditions or on how much water is locally available and Table 1Scenario definitions.ScenariosDescriptionsBASE9RBase case scenario calibrated at EIA AEO 2017 reference scenarioBASEREGBASE9R with the RGGI and GHG cap-and-trade program in CaliforniaBASE9RWBASE9R with water constraintsBASREGWBASE9R with the RGGI and GHG cap-and-trade program in California with water constraints

The greatest growth in water consump-tion in electricity generation sector in the scenarios without water constraints is expected in the West South Central, South Atlantic and Pacific regions or in the regions that are already experiencing intense competition over water. Natural gas combined cycled units are replaced by natural gas simple cycle units in the sce-narios with water constraints due to lower water usage.While California is adopting an aggressive climate change mitigation policy, to meet the state’s aggressive targets in 2050 will require widespread adoption of CCUS technologies. However, water is involved in most steps of the CCUS pro-cess and current capture technologies require additional water supplies at the site, either as a direct result of the capture process or indirectly by making the elec-tricity needed to power the capture facility. Including water constraints into the model with aggressive climate change mitigation policy in California results in model instabilities.ReferencesP.G. Taylor, P. Upham, W. McDowall, and D.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- If it feels like Kentucky has experienced Mother Nature's wrath more frequently over the last few years, that's not your imagination. Increasingly, scientists – including at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – are noting the extreme weather pattern of ""Tornado Alley"" is expanding eastward. In 2025 alone, Kentucky has experienced up to three quarters of an inch of ice, 14 inches of snow, extreme cold, more than 30 reported tornadoes and the worst flooding on the Ohio River since 1997.

For utility providers, including Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, stronger, more frequent storms underscore the importance of system hardening to withstand the effects. Already, LG&E and KU's ongoing system investments for customers have achieved a reduction in power outage frequency by 40% and duration by 30%.

As the risks of these more severe storms, wildfires and demand for energy continue to rise, LG&E and KU are working to mitigate the threats with stronger wires and poles; increasing vegetation management to further control this leading cause for power outages; and installing advanced technologies to identify and prevent outages.

Coupled with system enhancements, LG&E and KU are making it even easier for customers to do business. New advanced meter technology gives customers access to near real-time data to better pinpoint savings and manage their energy bills. Behind the scenes, the utilities also are upgrading information technology systems, improving customer billing processes and adding even more protections against cyber-related threats.

""We continually evaluate how to best serve our customers and ensure that we are providing safe, reliable, affordable energy with award-winning customer service,"" said John R. Crockett, LG&E and KU President. ""Our system enhancement plans will help us defend against Mother Nature and improve service for our customers.""

Stronger poles and wires and updated substations

While the utilities continuously invest in their transmission and distribution systems, some equipment dates back to the 1920s and is reaching the end of its life, posing a significant risk to system reliability.

Currently, 55% of the wooden transmission poles are more than 60 years old and in need of replacement with steel structures that offer greater strength and durability against wind and ice; upgraded components, and, in some cases, additional lightning protection.

Likewise, system hardening, real-time monitoring and automated technologies, coupled with advanced metering functionality, is greatly improving the utilities' distribution system. Since 2017, customers have collectively experienced 150,000 fewer power outages each year, preventing 27.7 million outage minutes in total. However, to maintain or improve this performance, the system not only needs additional stronger wires and poles, but upgrades to its aging substations, some of which are nearly 100 years old.

Natural gas system safety and reliability

LG&E also is investing in its gas system, including pipeline integrity and safety projects, to ensure it continues to provide safer, more reliable gas service. The most notable project is the 12-mile Bullitt County pipeline project that began this year. Due in large part to legal challenges, hundreds of requests for new or expanded natural gas service were delayed over the past six years. Once complete, the line will provide much needed reliability for current customers in the area and allow for new and expanded service, including those additional delayed requests, to be fulfilled.

Meeting customers' needs in the most reasonable, least-cost manner

To support the necessary system enhancements, LG&E and KU plan to file, on May 30, requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission for adjustments to their total revenues. LG&E and KU have not requested increases in base rates since November 2020. KU will request an increase of 11.5% in total revenues. LG&E will request an 8.3% increase in total revenue for the electric business and 14.0% for its natural gas business. Over the last five years, as inflation increased nearly 20% and labor and material costs escalated, LG&E and KU have held down costs and maintained residential rates that are more than 24% below the national average.

""We understand that increasing customer bills is impactful and not a decision we take lightly. Our employees, who are also our customers, work hard to operate and maintain our systems to be among the best in the nation, and we have held true to our commitment to not increase rates for the last five years. Even now, our request is significantly less than the rate of inflation,"" said Crockett. ""However, we're at a tipping point in which the foundational portions of our system – poles, wires, substations and technology – are reaching the end of their useful lives.""

LG&E and KU also are proposing several new services to help lessen the impact for customers and allow for more flexibility. For customers who pay with cash, the utilities will ask for approval to waive the current $1.95 transaction fee required for cash payments at third-party locations. And to help customers better manage their energy usage and budget, the utilities are requesting a pre-pay program that allows all residential AMI customers to deposit funds in advance to pay for energy as it is used.

If approved, these adjustments would likely go into effect not before Jan. 1, 2026. Even with the proposed increase, residential rates for both LG&E and KU electric service will remain below average U.S. residential rates.

If approved, KU residential customers using an average of 1,085 kWh per month would see an increase of $18.14 in their total monthly electric bill.

LG&E residential electric customers using an average of 866 kWh per month would see an increase in their total monthly bill of $­­­11.04.

LG&E residential natural gas customers using an average of 52 Ccf per month would see an increase of $11.12 in their total monthly bill.

LG&E and KU offer programs to help customers manage their energy use, including the largest portfolio of energy efficiency offerings in the company's history; a new advanced meter portal that allows customers to view their energy usage in near real time; and tips to save energy and money. However, LG&E and KU understand customers can sometimes have difficulty paying their utility bills. Customers who are eligible to set up payment arrangements can do so via the mobile app or online My Account, in addition to reaching out to LG&E or KU for assistance and be connected with a number of agencies that provide assistance.

Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, part of the PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) family of companies, are regulated utilities that serve more than 1.3 million customers and have consistently ranked among the best companies for customer service in the United States. LG&E serves 335,000 natural gas and 436,000 electric customers in Louisville and 16 surrounding counties. KU serves 545,000 customers in 77 Kentucky counties and 28,000 in five counties in Virginia.

A bill before Indiana legislators that would have prevented city officials from requesting energy information from large commercial buildings failed in this year's legislative session.

One nonprofit believes if Senate Bill 197/House Bill 1389 had become law, Hoosiers would have faced higher utility bills. The Thriving Buildings Program relies on utility usage data gathered between 2021 and 2025 to help lower utility bills.

Paula Brooks, justice director for the nonprofit Hoosier Environmental Council, said conversations between community stakeholders, public officials and residents about building environments are key to the program's success.

""It gave building owners the opportunity to benchmark -- which is, make comparisons of their energy and water usage -- to be able to identify ways to save money on utility costs and most importantly, improve the air quality, reduce carbon emissions,"" she explained.

A building environment consists of building and construction materials and is a major contributor to global gas emissions. With the program's collected data, it is predicted that public health savings in Indianapolis could reach $77 million by 2030. Indianapolis is responsible for 66% of community-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

Brooks applauds the Thriving Buildings Program because residents feel their voices are being heard as their communities develop. But these voices also oppose President Donald Trump's recent executive orders to build more coal plants to boost electricity generation, and to ensure the EPA is assisting in promoting America's energy security.

Brooks believes there is another alternative to using coal as a power source.

""Renewables is not only the future, but it's happening now. This distribution model that we have now, where the energy companies hold all the power, it's only about 75 years old,"" she continued.

Renewable energy creates opportunities to look at new energy delivery models or ""energy democracy,"" with solar for microgrids. So, rather than having a huge power plant somewhere, she noted, the electricity could be in a community and owned by the community, while contributing to the electric generation for industrial use.

A new report from the Ohio River Valley Institute argued the oil and gas industry, not taxpayers, should cover the cost of plugging up hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil wells across Appalachia.

Plugging wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia could cost nearly $40 billion, with most of the burden coming from shale wells.

Dwayne Purvis, founder and principal consultant at Purvis Energy Advisors in Fort Worth, Texas, and co-author of the report, said he analyzed the Ohio River Valley along with other states, finding old shale wells are often unable to fund their own decommissioning.

""Of course, there are some shale wells are getting older and depleting, producing at slower rates, and even some that are shut in or marginal,"" Purvis explained. ""What we did in this study that was new for the first time, was to offer ideas on how financial assurance reform can address this disparity.""

Purvis pointed out there are currently more than 265,000 unplugged non-shale wells across the three states too, many of which also pose environmental risks. He added hundreds of thousands more were plugged decades ago but often to outdated standards, meaning they may still leak.

Purvis noted the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law jump-started efforts to plug oil wells but the funding was never meant to be permanent. He contended operators should pay for decommissioning the wells but acknowledged many cannot afford to do it.

""The next best option is what we've offered, that it needs to come from, the money for decommissioning, needs to come from other companies in the oil and gas business, who do have the income necessary to cover the liabilities of the industry as a whole in order to protect the public,"" Purvis outlined.

According to the report in the three states studied, Purvis' proposal would directly increase oil and gas employment by an estimated 32% and create more than 19,000 new jobs.

Supporters of the Campaign for Affordable Power are pressing state lawmakers to pass a series of reform bills aimed at big investor-owned utilities like Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric.

Edison brought in more than $1.6 billion in profit last year and has raised rates 85% over the last decade.

However, the company is still asking the California Public Utilities Commission for another big rate increase after the Los Angeles fires.

Lee Trotman, communications director for the Utility Reform Network in Oakland, said he is against further rate hikes.

""The way to stop these utilities from getting away with these rate increases is by publicly participating,"" said Trotman. ""And you can actually call in during the CPUC vote meetings. You can go online. You have to make yourself heard.""

All three utility companies say they need rate increases to cover their costs.

The California Senate Appropriations Committee is holding a hearing today on a reform bill that promotes public financing of electrical infrastructure.

Advocates for the bill argue the current method of bond financing makes projects more expensive.

Trotman said another bill to be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on Wednesday would restrict how utilities can use money earned from ratepayers.

""They'll use the ratepayers' money for lobbying, promotional advertising,"" said Trotman, ""and other non-energy related expenses out of the monthly energy bills, which so far has been legal.""

Other bills being considered by the legislature would require cost savings to be passed on to customers, and ban power shutoffs during wildfire smoke days and industrial accidents.

It also makes significant cuts to electricity-side taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. credits. While shrinking the credits is a good option for revenue, the bill achieves that savings in large part through complex, difficult-to-comply-with regulation, rather than simplification and consolidation.

Table 1. How the Reconciliation Package Changes the IRA Credits

Source: Committee on Ways and Means, “The One Big Beautiful Bill,” https://docs.house.gov/meetings/WM/WM00/20250513/118260/BILLS-119-CommitteePrint-S001195-Amdt-1.pdf.

1. The Bill Prioritizes Eliminating Individual-Side Tax Credits

The bill would eliminate several major credits after the end of 2025. The four credits related to electric vehicles (the clean vehicle credit, the commercial clean vehicle credit, the pre-owned electric vehicle credit, and the credit for refueling property) would be repealed after 2025, although the main clean vehicle credit would remain in limited form for 2026, available for vehicles from manufacturers that have produced under 200,000 EVs. A series of residential energy-focused credits would be repealed after 2025.

These credits have several problems. The EV credits have become much more expensive than projected thanks to EPA tailpipe emissions and the leasing loophole, which allows consumers to benefit from the commercial EV credit even if vehicles do not comply with the main EV credit’s restrictions. From a climate perspective, these credits are among the least effective. The EV credit in particular largely benefits drivers who would have purchased an electric vehicle otherwise.

While the new electric vehicle credit introduced some income limits, they can be circumvented through the leasing loophole, and historically EV credit benefits have also skewed disproportionately to high-income taxpayers. The residential energy credits are one of the few IRA tax credits for which we have relatively comprehensive datasets, and those datasets show that benefits disproportionately accrue to higher-income households.

2. The Bill Phases Out the Major Electricity Generation Credits

The clean electricity production tax creditA tax credit is a provision that reduces a taxpayer’s final tax bill, dollar-for-dollar. A tax credit differs from deductions and exemptions, which reduce taxable income rather than the taxpayer’s tax bill directly. (Section 45Y, also known as the PTC) and the clean electricity investment tax credit (Section 48E, also known as the ITC) are the core of the IRA. These two tech-neutral credits took effect at the beginning of 2025, and they are available to all new zero-emission electricity production. Projects must choose between the use of one or another.

Under current law, the PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when the US power sector reaches 25 percent of 2022 emissions levels, whichever is later. It is highly unlikely the latter condition will be reached in 2032, so the PTC and ITC would likely continue many years into the future.

The reconciliation bill accelerates the phaseout. The ITC and PTC, along with the nuclear production tax credit (45U), would start phasing out after 2028. Facilities entering service in 2029 would see a 20 percent reduction of credit benefit, facilities entering service in 2030 would see a 40 percent reduction of credit benefit, facilities entering service in 2031 would see a 60 percent reduction in credit benefit, and facilities entering service after 2031 would see no benefit.

This approach comes with trade-offs. From one perspective, ending the subsidy early means not leaving the training wheels on new technologies. On the other hand, the IRA reforms brought some stability, a change from a long history of one-year and retroactive extensions for renewable energy provisions in a practice known as extenders. This practice creates uncertainty, undermining investment incentives, while still costing significant revenue. While current lawmakers may intend for the phaseout to take effect in 2029, lawmakers in 2029 may see things differently.

Additionally, from a climate perspective, the ITC and PTC are the primary emissions reduction policies in the IRA. Meanwhile, the bill actually expands the clean fuels production credit, a provision with dubious merits (climate or otherwise), at a cost of $45 billion over 10 years.

The reform also does not eliminate the series of requirements attached to the ITC and PTC. Under current law, credit benefits are cut by 80 percent if firms do not meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. That gap in benefits is large enough for most firms to find compliance worthwhile, but the requirements add significant costs. Some analysts consider them more extensive than Davis-Bacon requirements for federal contracts, which raise federal infrastructure project costs by around 10 percent. Further, or alternative, ITC/PTC reform could include reduced credit rates paired with eliminating burdensome requirements.

3. The Bill’s Transition Rules Are Sharp, but Do Not Include Retroactivity

The PTC is awarded for electricity production over 10 years for eligible facilities. How reform would treat facilities already in service, as well as facilities currently under construction, is consequential. The bill shifts eligibility provisions for the ITC and PTC from being based on when facilities began construction to when facilities enter service. This reduces eligibility for the programs by more than just starting the phaseout in 2029 would.

However, the bill does not claw back credits to be paid out under the pre-2025 PTC, and a facility that enters service before 2029 would continue to receive the full benefits of its chosen provision. Put another way, under the Ways and Means package, full-value PTCs would continue to be paid out until 2038, and reduced-value PTCs would continue to be paid out until 2041, even though no new facilities would be eligible for the credit after 2031.

4. The Bill Eliminates Transferability After 2027

The IRA also expanded the use of transferability. Under transferability, companies that stand to benefit from a handful of IRA credits, but lack tax liability to offset, may sell, or transfer, their tax benefits to a third party. The introduction of transferability effectively replaced more complicated tax equity partnerships.

The bill would eliminate transferability for all relevant credits after the end of 2027. Eliminating transferability should raise some revenue. However, if reducing the cost of the credits is the goal, it would make more sense to directly reduce the tax credit rate rather than tinker with which users are able to benefit.

5. Proposed FEOC Restrictions Are Very Strict

The House bill would also tighten restrictions related to the involvement of foreign entities of concern (FEOC). Foreign entities of concern include governments of covered nations (China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran), as well as businesses or individuals associated with covered nations.

The reconciliation bill would introduce FEOC-style restrictions to several credits, and in several cases, dramatically expand them. For the clean electricity ITC, clean electricity PTC, and the advanced manufacturing production credit, the bill prohibits credit eligibility “if the construction of such facility includes any material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.”

Material assistance is defined as “any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral as defined in Section 45X(c)(6)) included in such property that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity.” A large portion of the energy supply chain runs through China, and the definition of a foreign entity of concern could potentially cover virtually any business in China.

The law does provide an exemption for assembly parts “not uniquely designed for use in the construction of a qualified facility” and “not exclusively or predominantly produced by prohibited foreign entities,” as well as a similar exemption for constituent materials. The exact scope of these categories (both the expanded FEOC rules and the exemptions for them) is unclear. Some have characterized the restrictions as a de facto full repeal of the IRA provisions, but they may end up being “just” strict.

The Big Picture

Tax simplification has two aspects. The first is a code without a mess of targeted provisions for various social policy goals. The second is a code with provisions that are simple and easy to comply with.

The Ways and Means bill succeeds at the first, by eliminating or phasing out several credits, but fails at the second, by not eliminating existing complex rules and instead introducing new ones.

The rollout of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in convenience stores will slow following the Trump administration’s pause on federal funding for EV chargers, Tom Healy, vice president of facilities development and maintenance at Nouria told CSP.

“There's not really a business model there to make a large investment without grant funding because it's a large capital investment, and the business volume is just not there right now,” he said.

Public chargers cost approximately $3,500 per connector for Level 2 chargers and $38,000 to $90,000 per connector for direct current (DC) fast chargers, with higher costs depending on power output, according to the according to the Department of Energy. That’s not including installation costs, which average around $2,500 per connector.

Healy doesn’t predict much of a decrease in EV charger customers at Nouria charging locations, though. The Worcester, Massachusetts-based convenience-store chain has 183 locations, 13 active EV chargers and 26 additional EV chargers expected to be installed by the end of 2025 that have not been affected by the pause on federal funding. There are only about five charging sessions per charger per day, which was expected, he said, but still, Nouria wants to be at the forefront of this new industry, learn from initial installations and customer expectations at both larger and small locations.

What exactly does a pause on funds mean, and how are retailers reacting?

Federal Funding

Federal incentives, such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI), were designed to allocate funds to convenience-store chains for EV charging port installations. It’s also ramped up the number of charging locations for consumers—part of the Biden administration’s push for a more energy-focused automobile industry across America.

Government grants incentivize both consumers and c-store retailers to push EV growth forward.

Along with Nouria, convenience-store chains such as Kwik Trip, La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Love’s, Oklahoma City, have added charging ports with the NEVI funds. Retailers are required to add four chargers per location with the NEVI grants, whereas without, they might have tested the market with just one or decided that the budget wasn’t there for any.

On the consumer side, range anxiety is a top concern preventing consumers from purchasing EVs. If there are more charging ports, there is more incentive to hop on the EV train; with more EVs on the road, there’s more incentive for retailers to invest in chargers.

The mandate that the Biden administration put into effect in 2021 aimed for 50% of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be electric, plug-in hybrid or hydrogen-powered by 2030; stricter fuel economy standards for automakers; EV tax credits for consumers; grants to grow the EV charging network across the country; and domestic manufacturing of EV infrastructure.

In a separate but related initiative in 2021, the Biden administration also signed the NEVI program into law, which was launched by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) through its Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

It includes $5 billion worth of grants to the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico to support the installation of EV charging infrastructure, with multiple rounds of funding from 2022 to 2026.

The DOT must approve the state requests before the grants are funded, but with two years left of the five-year plan, states are at different degrees of approval.

However, the push for EVs is facing some resistance as President Trump paused federal funding programs and revoked the electric vehicle EV mandate on Jan. 20 that former President Biden put into place.

“The NEVI program has in many states helped catalyze existing gas stations and truck stops to install fast, state-of-the-art EV charging stations,” said David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Truck Stop Owners (NATSO), Alexandria, Virginia, and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA), Washington, D.C. “In other states, NEVI has been implemented poorly, with chargers either still not built or, if they are, they're in places nobody wants to stop. We are encouraged that the Trump administration is reevaluating rather than abandoning the NEVI Program and intend to work closely with the administration to share our experience and keep what's been working, while reconsidering clearly unproductive approaches.”

Many retailers have taken the leap to integrating EV chargers because of location and existing amenities.

“The big winner [of NEVI funds] has been gas stations and convenience stores because they have real estate,” Ryan McKinnon, director of communications at Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition based in Richmond, Virginia, said on an EV webinar he hosted. “They're already located right off the highway. They have the amenities. They have everything people want, and people have been trained through decades of driving to stop at these locations. So, they're the prime candidates to offer EV charging.”

Trump's Executive Order

In his executive order “Unleashing American Energy” on Jan. 20, Trump said under the heading “Terminating the Green New Deal” that “all agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 … or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.”

This includes a pause on the NEVI Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program (CFI)—a similar program backed by a $2.5 billion investment— plus the rescindment of the electric vehicle mandate.

“America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have—the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth—and we are going to use it,” Trump said in his 2025 inaugural address.

A letter from DOT Feb. 6 stated it is pausing the current NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is updating it to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities. FHWA aims to publish the new draft in the spring.

“Nobody knows what's going to happen yet.” —Badih El-Nemr, Nouria

Instructions for the submission of new state plans for all fiscal years will be included in the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance. States will not face any consequences for not implementing their existing plans. Until new guidance is issued, reimbursement of existing obligations will be allowed so that financial commitments are not disrupted, the letter said.

“That executive order just put those [programs] under a 90-day hold for the review,” said Badih El-Nemr, executive vice president at Nouria. “Nobody knows what's going to happen yet.”

Moving Forward

Nouria has received NEVI funding for one location in Bridgton, Maine. The contract was set, and installation was already underway when the pause was announced, so the chain was able to move forward.

However, in August, Nouria received grant funding for EV charger installations at five New Hampshire sites through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAG) Federal program, administered at the state level. These projects are currently on hold due to the uncertainty of the federal funding.

In addition to NEVI and other federal grants like the CMAG and CFI grant programs, Nouria has leveraged state, local and utility grants for EV chargers.

EV leaders are concerned that state-level actions could fill gaps left by federal policy and the complexity of a “patchwork” approach, with some states offering incentives while others do not, leading to uneven adoption across the country, according to an Electric Vehicles Vision Group (EVVG) discussion in January.

“Let me put it this way, I'm not losing sleep over doom and gloom if incentives dry up or change or reuse,” said Chris Normandeau, director of New York-based FirstService Energy, an energy management partner of real estate business FirstService Residential, at the EVVG meeting. “The industry is moving forward one way or another, and it's not something I'd bet against regardless of who's in the Oval Office or Congress.”

Retailers Left in Limbo

Many other c-store retailers are dealing with uncertainty while they wait for the FHWA to release an update on the funding pause.

Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores also continues to monitor the developing situation. The 640-store chain based in Oklahoma City is growing its network of EV charging stations, in part, through NEVI grants. The company was awarded $83 million in 2024 for the construction of chargers in 13 states. Love's has 31 existing EV charging locations and 165 chargers. The chain said it will add 80 chargers to 20 Love’s locations in 2025.

Construction is planned to start in 2025 on new fast chargers in eight states: Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

“Love’s will continue to monitor related executive orders and subsequent changes in law to determine the next steps,” said Kim Okafor, general manager of zero emissions for Love's.

Kwik Trip is also still trying to understand what the executive order means and how to move forward, Ben Leibl, public relations specialist at the La Crosse, Wisconsin-based convenience-store chain of 868 stores, told CSP regarding its Kwik Charge program.

In January, the first three Kwik Trips with fast electric chargers were up and running in Wisconsin as part of the NEVI Formula Program.

“We were awarded 24 locations as part of Wisconsin’s NEVI program,” Leibl told CSP at the time.

The c-store locations, which started operating the chargers in December, are in Ashland, Chippewa Falls and Menomonie, Wisconsin.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-05/background/97_Cedar_Milford1.jpg?VersionId=cQZzZ5Rh6tb7rmN6nyoXvz_w8EoDb65.,N,,2025-05-16 03:04:05.598413

Andy Beshear highlighted new investment in Kentucky’s workforce development initiatives to further maintain and advance the commonwealth’s thriving economy.

Over 11,700 Kentuckians will receive skills training thanks to support provided through the Bluegrass State Skills Corp. (BSSC), which oversees programs attached to the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development that help private-sector businesses establish industry-specific training initiatives.

“One of Kentucky’s greatest strengths is our hard-working, talented and diverse workforce, and we must continue to provide the resources needed for our workers to develop and grow,” said Gov. Beshear. “The commonwealth’s economy continues to thrive, and to keep that momentum going, we need to connect Kentucky employees with skills training opportunities. We are committed to building a better Kentucky, and programs like BSSC are helping us reach that goal.”

This month’s approvals included workforce training support for over 10,000 employees at Ford Motor Co.’s Fern Valley Road and Chamberlain Lane locations in Louisville. Other approvals include 273 trainees for Highlands Diversified Services in London, 269 employees at Steel Technologies in Louisville, 209 workers at F&E Aircraft Maintenance in Erlanger and 121 trainees at Amneal Pharmaceuticals in Glasgow, among others.

The most recent BSSC meeting concludes fiscal year 2025, where in total, the BSSC board approved more than $9.5 million in training funds and credits for over 30,600 trainees across 115 Kentucky facilities.

In fiscal year 2024, the BSSC board of directors approved roughly $19 million in funds and credits for 104 Kentucky facilities to train 42,600-plus workers, the most since 2016.

Gov. Beshear previously announced over $10 million for 115 applicants throughout the state to train nearly 35,000 workers for fiscal year 2023. The state also provided over $8.4 million in funds and credits during fiscal year 2022. Those funds assisted with workforce training for more than 35,400 Kentucky employees.

Employers across the state benefit from BSSC’s Grant-in-Aid (GIA) and Skills Training Investment Credit (STIC) programs. GIA provides cash reimbursements for occupational and skills upgrade training at Kentucky businesses, while STIC offers state income tax credits for companies to offset the costs for approved training programs. Applications for both programs are accepted and considered for approval by the Bluegrass State Skills Corporation Board of Directors.

Types of operations that could qualify for BSSC incentives include manufacturing, agribusiness, nonretail service or technology, headquarters operations, state-licensed hospital operations, coal severing and processing, alternative fuel, gasification, renewable energy production or carbon dioxide transmission pipelines.

Kentucky’s investment in workforce development builds on the best five-year period for economic growth in state history.

Since the beginning of his administration, Gov. Beshear has announced more than 1,100 private-sector new-location and expansion projects totaling over $35 billion in announced investments, creating more than 60,500 jobs. This is the highest investment figure secured during the tenure of any governor in the commonwealth’s history and $14 billion more than the next highest total.

The robust job creation has been accompanied by rising wages across the commonwealth. Since 2022, the average incentivized hourly wage has topped $26 in three consecutive years for the first time.

Gov. Beshear has announced some of the largest economic development projects in state history, which have solidified Kentucky as the electric vehicle battery production capital of the United States: Ford Motor Co. and SK On’s transformative $5.8 billion, 5,000-job BlueOval SK Battery Park in Hardin County; AESC’s $2 billion, 2,000-job gigafactory project in Warren County; Toyota’s $1.3 billion investment in Scott County; and Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing’s $712 million investment, creating 1,572 jobs in Shelby County, among others.

The Governor’s administration also secured the largest General Fund budget surplus and Rainy Day Fund. In 2023, Kentucky recorded over 2 million jobs filled for the first time ever and has stayed above that number ever since.

Kentucky also secured rating increases from major credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings, S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.

Site Selection magazine ranked Kentucky in the top five nationally and second in the South Central region for economic development projects per capita in its 2024 Governor’s Cup rankings. Last April, Site Selection placed Kentucky second in the South Central region and in the top 10 nationally in its 2024 Prosperity Cup ranking, which recognizes state-level economic development agencies for their success in landing capital investment projects.",https://ae-lane-report.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10135147/StateSealBlueGold.png,N,,2025-05-16 05:04:45.351368

As the solar energy market grew, it became cheaper to develop solar in North Carolina than other states, Brooks said.
Following Trump’s move away from clean energy When Trump took office, North Carolina’s clean energy windfall appeared to face an early expiration date.
Congressional Republicans are now proposing a bill that would repeal clean energy tax credits, including EV charging tax credits.
“We still have enough economic activity in our state tied to our renewable energy standard and clean energy customers like Facebook and Apple and Google that want clean energy, it seems like it’s still the prevailing interest to continue to invest in clean energy,” Harrison said.","In 2021, after months of tough negotiations over clean energy policies, North Carolina lawmakers, Gov. Roy Cooper and public energy utilities made a commitment: by 2050, North Carolina’s largest electric generating facilities would reach carbon neutrality.

By then, facilities would offset each ton of carbon dioxide they released into the atmosphere with renewable energy. In 2030, they’d have to show some progress by reducing emissions by 70%.

Now, some lawmakers want to renege on the clean energy deal by removing the interim date. And that’s not the only climate-friendly policy they’re walking back.

This session, lawmakers are pushing bills to phase out solar energy property tax exemptions, give themselves final approval of environmental agreements between state and federal environmental agencies and redefine clean energy eligibility to include older nuclear and hydroelectric facilities.

Last year, lawmakers took away one of the governor’s Utilities Commission appointments, so that he no longer controls a majority of the board regulating much of the state’s energy.

Together, these steps and proposed changes signal a reversal of North Carolina’s commitment to clean energy, which has been a boon to the state’s environment and economy.

If not directly inspired by President Donald Trump’s environmental agenda, lawmakers have certainly been “emboldened” by his declarations of a national energy emergency and attempts to roll back key climate legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, State Rep. Pricey Harrison, D-Guilford, told Carolina Public Press.

Before, some climate change skeptics in the legislature and North Carolina commissions wanted to roll back environmental protections and commitments, Harrison said. But federal backstops like the the Environmental Protection Agency director and President Joe Biden wouldn’t let it go too far.

Those barriers have disappeared, and with them, much of the willingness to address North Carolina’s climate future.

However, one potential obstacle to complete environmental rollbacks remains: Gov. Josh Stein‘s veto power.

North Carolina as a clean energy leader

Today, North Carolina is positioned as a national leader in the clean energy industry, specifically in solar energy and electric vehicle technology. It wasn’t always this way.

The industry gained steam after a 2007 law created a new renewable energy portfolio standard requiring utilities to generate part of their electricity from clean, renewable sources, said Josh Brooks, North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association chief of policy strategy and innovation.

As the solar energy market grew, it became cheaper to develop solar in North Carolina than other states, Brooks said. Soon enough, five megawatt projects were popping up, and in the decades since, the state has secured the second most solar deployment in the country.

Former Gov. Cooper saw an opportunity to do more. In 2021, he issued an executive order setting an offshore wind energy target: by 2040, he wanted the state to develop eight gigawatts of offshore wind capacity — enough to power up to a quarter of the state’s electricity generation.

The same year, he also helped negotiate the now-threatened 2050 carbon neutrality commitment for electric public utilities. Under the law, the Utilities Commission would create a Carbon Plan to meet 2030 and 2050 carbon reduction goals, while keeping energy costs low and ensuring any changes maintained or improved the power grid’s reliability.

Later that year, former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda further boosted North Carolina’s growing clean energy sector.

Collectively, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act granted North Carolina several billion dollars toward programs and tax rebates designed to cut consumers’ energy bills while incentivizing them to make energy efficiency upgrades, particularly in lower income and disadvantaged communities.

Indirectly, the laws spurred more than $21 billion in private sector clean energy investment and created more than 17,000 jobs, according to one analysis. Only South Carolina has seen more investment.

Many of the 26 major clean energy projects announced since then are located in rural areas, like the $13 billion production of lithium ion batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles at the Randolph County Toyota Battery Plant.

Following Trump’s move away from clean energy

When Trump took office, North Carolina’s clean energy windfall appeared to face an early expiration date.

On his first day, Trump froze federal climate funding, declared a national energy emergency and announced the end of the “EV mandate,” among other acts. America would be energy dominant, and that energy would primarily include coal, natural gas and petroleum.

While federal courts have ordered the administration to resume most federal funding, for now, Trump’s actions have increased uncertainty in the clean energy industry, Brooks said.

Repealing IRA incentives would waste a lot of private investment, which was made under the promise that federal support was on its way, he said.

Trump’s actions have also threatened electric vehicle infrastructure grants and the work of now laid-off EPA scientists stationed in the Research Triangle Park who were researching climate change and PFAS pollution, said Mary MacLean, Southern Environmental Law Center director of North Carolina offices.

The threatened electric vehicle money would pay for charging stations on highways and interstates, MacLean said. Without it, electric vehicle demand and manufacturing will decrease.

“Putting in electric vehicle chargers, it’s not a hippie environmental thing,” she said. “It’s an economic thing, and it’s a way for people to move around in a clean and equitable manner.”

The Southeast has disproportionately benefited from electric vehicle manufacturing, said Stephen Smith, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy executive director. There’s the Toyota plant in North Carolina, the Hyundai electric vehicle plant in Georgia and Ford battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky. Those projects, and the jobs that come with them, are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are now proposing a bill that would repeal clean energy tax credits, including EV charging tax credits.

Smith thinks resistance to clean energy, in spite of its economic benefits, has become “almost tribal.” As the Republican Party’s leader, Trump’s rhetoric rules, and he’s telling his supporters to “drill, baby, drill.”

“If you run counter to Trump’s energy agenda and to the MAGA approach to energy, then all of a sudden you are on the outs of this sort of tribal perspective on what is acceptable, instead of letting the facts determine where we go,” Smith said.

Scrap that

If Vice President Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election, Smith doesn’t think North Carolina would see the kinds of energy bills it’s seeing this session — particularly Senate Bill 261.

The bill would eliminate a 2030 interim goal, previously amended to 2034, to reduce emissions by 70%, on the way to 2050 carbon neutrality for large public utilities. Bill sponsor Sen. Paul Newton, R-Cabarrus, said the move would save North Carolinians billions of dollars in a committee hearing.

Newton, a former Duke Energy executive, said moving the interim goal from 2030 to 2034 already saved Duke Energy $4 billion already, and scrapping it entirely would reduce its construction costs by $13 billion.

Smith isn’t convinced. The math doesn’t include the long term costs of inaction, and removes any sort of accountability measure Duke would face in the next decade, he said.

“This is an opportunistic move by Duke to back away from their commitments, more than it is a legitimate technological or financial reason,” Smith said.

Republican lawmakers hypothesized in committee meetings that North Carolina could still meet its 2050 goal without meeting the 2030 interim goal, by say, powering on nuclear power plants in 2048.

That makes no sense to Smith. Or MacLean.

“You’re not going to say, ‘I’m going to lose 20 pounds by the end of the year and not start on that until November,’” MacLean said. “You need measuring sticks along the way. That’s what our current law provides.”

Besides, between now and 2050, carbon will continue to be emitted. The climate will warm, threatening future natural disasters like Hurricane Helene. And there’s no guarantee nuclear technology will be ready to go by then anyways, MacLean said.

The bill’s second provision may be its death knell: construction work in progress.

CWIP allows electric generating facilities to increase rates while a project is under construction, instead of waiting until completion to get a return on investment. The provision is deeply unpopular, after South Carolinian ratepayers took on the $9 billion cost of a nuclear reactor project that never came to fruition.

While the bill pushed soared through the state Senate, the House Republican caucus has seemingly not given the bill its blessing yet, Rep. Harrison said.

Solar scapegoat

According to the American Farmland Trust, North Carolina is projected to lose about 1.2 million acres of farmland — about the size of Delaware — between now and 2040.

“The people moving in, the businesses moving in and the solar development all share in that disappearance of farmland,” said Republican Agricultural Commissioner Steve Troxler at a committee hearing over The Farmland Protection Act.

The proposed bill would phase out solar energy property tax exemptions, in place since 2008, in the next four years. Counties need the tax revenue, argue proponents like the county commissioners association.

Detractors counter that solar makes up a tiny fraction of disappearing farmland. Harrison said there’s resistance to the bill from farmers. Regardless of how they feel about the politics of clean energy, many of them have leased land to solar operators and companies that have invested in solar operations.

The tax exemption has allowed land that would otherwise sit vacant to generate stable revenue for families and counties, while diversifying the state’s power supply, Brooks said.

In some cases, farmers have also negotiated for dual land use as grazing pasture around the photovoltaic solar panels, making the land doubly profitable.

It’s a system proven to work in a very American industry, he added. So why get rid of it?

“If we are truly in a moment of explosive demand, then we need to be utilizing the resources that we can quickly deploy, but are also inherently flexible in where they’re sited,” Brooks said.

A clean energy messaging problem

Duke environmental toxicologist Linda Birnbaum has spent decades trying to convey the urgency of climate change, as former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and federal EPA scientist.

The message doesn’t always hit, despite the increasing prevalence of severe weather and warning temperatures.

Research on climate change in the past decade has discovered a plethora of concerning developments, Birnbaum said. Wildfires are coming more often, and are more intense when they do. The distribution of fish in the ocean has shifted due to rising water temperatures, forcing fishermen to adapt. Longer growing seasons have led to changes in insect and bird populations. As temperatures warm, crops become less nutritious and more prevalent heat waves kill people.

Federal funding bankrolled a lot of that research. But, with the Trump administration, the spigot turned off, Birnbaum said. It will now be harder to make informed decisions about the nation’s climate future as a result, she added.

It will also be easier to mislead the public with outdated science, Smith said. Myths about solar energy being unreliable when the sun isn’t shining still surface constantly, despite improved storage technology, he said.

Solar and wind are labeled unreliable while gas market volatility has risen in the past few years as it’s asked to handle more and more, Brooks said. Diversification boosts reliability, he added.

“The grid operates like a symphony,” he said “It’s not one instrument. It’s a symphony of resources. And the job of the grid operator, the utility, is to manage the orchestra.”

While climate change pleas may fall on deaf ears, economic messaging could be a savior for clean energy in North Carolina this session.

Lawmakers can’t ignore the thousands of clean energy businesses, even though there’s increasing hostility toward climate change initiatives in Raleigh, Harrison said.

If these bills pass , Harrison and her peers will be watching closely to see whether Democratic Gov. Stein uses his veto pen, and then, whether House Democrats, who have just enough votes to prevent a Republican veto override, can hold the line.

“We still have enough economic activity in our state tied to our renewable energy standard and clean energy customers like Facebook and Apple and Google that want clean energy, it seems like it’s still the prevailing interest to continue to invest in clean energy,” Harrison said. “I feel like we’re still in decent shape.”

Current law

The clean vehicle credits under IRC Sections 30D, 25E and 45W provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction of federal income taxes for new and used clean vehicles placed in service by a taxpayer during the tax year before January 1, 2033.

To claim the IRC Section 30D credit, (1) the original use of the vehicle must commence with the taxpayer, (2) the taxpayer cannot acquire the clean vehicle for resale, (3) the clean vehicle must be made by a qualified manufacturer, (4) the final assembly of the clean vehicle must occur in North America and certain other requirements in IRC Section 30D(d)(1) must be met.

The IRC Section 30D credit can reach $7,500, so long as the sourcing requirements are satisfied for each of the critical minerals contained in the clean vehicle's battery and its components.

IRC Section 25E allows taxpayers who acquire a used clean vehicle (i.e., at least two years old), to claim a federal tax credit during the tax year the vehicle is placed in service. The credit equals the lesser of (1) $4,000, or (2) 30% of the sales price. The credit can be used once every three years for clean vehicles sold for $25,000 or less and is based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income.

The IRC Section 45W credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles applies to vehicles acquired before January 1, 2033. The credit is the lesser of (1) 30% of the basis of a vehicle not powered by a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine or (2) the incremental cost of such vehicle (i.e., the excess of the purchase price of the vehicle over the price of a comparable vehicle). The IRC Section 45W credit cannot exceed $7,500 for vehicles weighing less than 14,000 pounds and $40,000 for other vehicles.

Proposal

The Bill generally would repeal the credit under IRC Sections 30D, 25E and 45W for vehicles placed in service after December 31, 2025. The credit under IRC Section 30D would continue through December 31, 2026, for manufacturers that have sold 200,000 or less plug-in electric vehicles or clean vehicles after 2009 and before 2026.

Effective date

The repeal would be effective for vehicles placed in service after December 31, 2025, subject to limited exceptions.

Implications

The Bill would eliminate the tax credits for the purchase of new and used clean vehicles available to individuals, businesses and other taxpayers. While incentives may still be available at the state and local level, these credits have historically been used to lower the total cost of purchasing clean vehicles. Taxpayers transitioning to electric vehicles should closely monitor the status of electric vehicle credits as the provisions move through the reconciliation process and consider the timing and potential acceleration of their transition plans in light of the possible repeal.

Current law

The IRC Section 30C alternative fuel refueling property credit allows a credit of up to 30% of the cost of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service in low-income and non-urban areas before January 1, 2033. Depreciable alternative fuel vehicle refueling property qualifies for a 30% credit if certain wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. Otherwise, depreciable alternative fuel vehicle refueling property is limited to a 6% credit. The credit for depreciable alternative fuel vehicle refueling property cannot exceed $100,000. For any non-depreciable alternative fuel vehicle refueling property, the limit is $1,000. The credit limitation applies per any single item of qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property.

Proposal

The Bill would generally repeal the credit for property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

Effective date

The repeal would be effective for property place in service after December 31, 2025.

Implications

Similar to the clean vehicle credits, the credit under IRC Section 30C lowers the costs of electric vehicle-charging infrastructure for individuals, businesses and other taxpayers. A full repeal of the IRC Section 30C credit based on the placed-in-service date of eligible property as opposed to when property began construction would significantly impact ongoing and planned projects that may not be completed before the end of 2025. Taxpayers currently undertaking IRC Section 30C eligible projects should carefully examine their construction timelines to determine if the credit would be available based on when their assets will be placed in service should the repeal be adopted.

Current law

Additionally, similar rules apply to reduce the credit where tax-exempt bonds were used to finance the facility.

The IRC Section 48E technology-neutral ITC is available for any qualified electric generating facility and any energy storage technology that is placed in service after December 31, 2024, and for which the greenhouse-gas-emissions rate is not greater than zero. Qualified property is generally tangible personal property or other tangible property and is subject to certain limitations and restrictions. The IRC Section 48E ITC generally provides a 6% base rate, which can increase to 30% if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met.

Under both IRC Sections 45Y and 48E, taxpayers are eligible for a 10% bonus if certain domestic content requirements are met, or the qualified facility or qualified energy storage technology is located in an energy community (although the bonus rate can be reduced to 2% if certain labor requirements are not also met). An additional 10% or 20% bonus credit may be available for certain solar and wind facilities located in low-income communities.

The credits under IRC Sections 45Y and 48E begin to phase out for qualified facilities in the first calendar year after the later of (1) 2032 or (2) the calendar year in which the Secretary determines that the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the US are equal to or less than 25% of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States for calendar year 2022.

The ITC under IRC Section 48 is generally available for eligible projects that begin construction before January 1, 2025, except for geothermal heat pumps, which remain eligible under IRC Section 48 until January 1, 2035. The IRC Section 48 ITC is subject to the two-tiered credit structure similar to IRC Section 48E and can also be supplemented by bonus credits for clean energy facilities located in designated energy communities and for meeting domestic content requirements.

Eligibility for the IRC Section 48 ITC depends, among other criteria, on the type of energy property used in the clean energy projects and when construction began.

Proposal

The Bill would phase out the credit as follows:

Transferability would not be allowed for qualified facilities and energy storage technologies where construction begins two years after the date of enactment.

Specific to IRC Section 48E, the Bill would change the amount of direct current capacity for the low-income community bonus program for each year beginning on January 1, 2025, and ending on December 31, 2031, and zero thereafter. Excess capacity limitation could not be carried over to any year after December 31, 2031. Facilities that were awarded bonus credits would have to be placed in service by the earlier of four years after the dates they have been allocated electricity generation capacity or December 31, 2031.

The Bill would also modify the phase-out for IRC Section 48 ITCs for geothermal heat pump property setting the base credit as follows:

Foreign entity of concern (FEOC) limitations: For a ""specified foreign entity"" (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(51)(B)), the credit would generally be repealed for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. Credits would not be available if construction begins one year after the date of enactment and there is ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(52)). ""Material assistance"" means prohibited foreign entities would affect the procurement of components and subcomponents.

For a ""foreign-influenced"" entity (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(51)(D)), no credit would be available in tax years starting two years after the date of enactment.

Effective date

The Bill would be effective for tax years beginning after the date of enactment.

Implications

Early phase-out of clean energy ITCs and PTCs under IRC Sections 48E and 45Y present a major challenge for large scale renewable energy projects. The proposed phase-out language would apply based on when projects are placed in service instead of when they began construction, which is the standard under current law and has historically been determinative for when credits phase out. Most projects that are currently under construction have either factored tax credits into their economics or received financing based on the expectation of receiving tax credits, so the focus on the ""placed in service"" date will present significant challenges for project financing and likely increase costs.

While many expected the definition FEOC and its requirements to be expanded, the proposed restrictions would significantly impact the viability and costs of new projects. Taxpayers with planned investments in clean energy technologies will need to evaluate their supply chain in light of the ""material assistance"" requirements and may need to find alternative suppliers, which could lead to delays or forgone investments.

Current law

The IRC Section 45Q credit is available to certain taxpayers for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide. The 12-year credit term begins on the first day of the first tax year in which an IRC Section 45Q tax credit is claimed if certain conditions are met. This applies to carbon capture equipment that is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after the date the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was enacted if (1) no taxpayer has claimed a credit under IRC Section 45Q for the equipment for any prior year, (2) the facility where the equipment is placed in service is located in an area affected by a federally-declared disaster after the capture equipment was originally placed in service and (3) the disaster resulted in the facility or equipment ceasing to operate after it was originally placed in service.

Eligible carbon oxide sequestration credit projects must begin construction before January 1, 2033.

Proposal

The Bill would repeal transferability for carbon capture and sequestration projects that begin construction after the date that is two years after the date of enactment.

FEOC limitation: For a ""specified foreign entity"" (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(51)(B)), the credit would generally be repealed for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. In addition, a ""foreign-influenced"" entity (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(51)(D)) could not claim a credit in tax years starting two years after the date of enactment.

Effective date

The Bill would be effective for tax years beginning after the date of enactment.

Implications

Although the proposed provisions only make minor modifications to IRC Section 45Q, the termination of transferability could significantly impact developers' ability to realize immediate value from the generation of tax credits, especially for large carbon capture projects. The FEOC limitations would also impact joint ventures in the carbon capture space where the venture partner is a foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity, which may impact current projects. While the modifications would be limited, taxpayers should consider how the proposed provisions would impact their project economics and structure where they have engaged partners in the deployment of carbon capture assets.

Current law

The zero-emission nuclear power production credit under IRC Section 45U is available for taxpayers that produce electricity at a qualified nuclear power facility and sell it to an unrelated person. A qualified nuclear power facility means any nuclear facility that (1) is owned by the taxpayer and uses nuclear energy to produce electricity, (2) is not an advanced nuclear power facility as defined in IRC Section 45J(d)(1), and (3) is placed in service before August 16, 2022. The credit does not apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2032.

Proposal

The Bill contains a similar phase-out structure as the one used for IRC Sections 45Y and 48E credits for electricity produced and sold by the taxpayer.

FEOC limitation: For a ""specified foreign entity"" (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(51)(B)), the credit would generally be repealed for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. In addition, a ""foreign-influenced"" entity (defined in new IRC Section 7701(a)(51)(D)) could not claim a credit in tax years starting two years after the date of enactment.

The Bill would repeal transferability for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Effective date

The Bill would be effective for tax years beginning after the date of enactment.

Current law

IRC Section 45V provides a tax credit to produce qualified clean hydrogen for 10 years beginning on the date the facility is placed in service. The credit ranges from $0.12 to $3.00 per kg of clean hydrogen produced depending on the emissions rate of the hydrogen and whether the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. Taxpayers could also elect to treat clean hydrogen production facilities as energy property under IRC Section 48.

Proposal

The Bill would terminate the credit for facilities whose construction begins after December 31, 2025. In addition, the Bill would terminate the election to treat the facilities as energy property for purposes of IRC Section 48.

Effective date

The Bill would apply for facilities whose construction begins after the date of enactment.

Implications

The IRC Section 45V tax credit is one of several incentives enacted to bolster domestic investments in clean hydrogen. The early termination will require taxpayers to revisit future investment plans and determine if it is feasible to begin construction before December 31, 2025. Taxpayers with planned investments in 2026 and beyond may consider alternative hydrogen production pathways in favor of less costly solutions.

Current law

The IRC Section 45X credit amount varies depending on the eligible component. For eligible components other than applicable critical minerals, the IRC Section 45X credit decreases as follows: (1) 75% of the otherwise available credit for eligible components sold during 2030, (2) 50% of the otherwise available credit for eligible components sold in 2031, (3) 25% of the otherwise available credit for eligible components sold in 2032, and (4) no credit for components sold in 2033 or after. Applicable critical minerals are not subject to the phase-out.

Proposal

The Bill would add restrictions to, and advance termination of, the credit. The Bill would also terminate the credit for wind energy components for components sold after 2027 and eliminate the credit for sale of all other components, including critical minerals, after 2031. Transferability would be repealed for components sold after 2027.

FEOC restrictions would apply as follows: No credit would be allowed for ""specified foreign entities"" for tax years beginning after the date of enactment; the ""material assistance"" FEOC rules would apply to manufactured components with a new prohibition on licensing agreements valued over $1 million with a prohibited foreign entity; ""foreign-influenced entities"" could not claim a credit for tax years beginning two years after the date of enactment; for this purpose, the restriction would apply across the entire eligible component category in IRC Section 45X (e.g., solar energy components).

Effective date

The Bill would be effective for tax years beginning after the date of enactment.

Implications

The additional restrictions on ""material assistance"" for FEOCs would require domestic producers of eligible components and materials to analyze their supply chain to confirm that their eligibility for IRC Section 45X is not impacted. These restrictions would likely create challenges for domestic producers that procure minor subcomponents or materials from select foreign suppliers that are used in producing eligible components and may reduce or eliminate their credit. The early termination of the credit would also impact those making new investments as the availability of the IRC Section 45X credit could significantly change project economics.

Current law

The IRC Section 45Z clean fuel production credit applies to low-emission transportation fuel produced at qualified facilities (not including facilities for which an IRC Section 45V, 45Q or 48 (related to hydrogen) credit is available). The IRC Section 45Z credit is generally available for low-emission transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility in the United States until December 31, 2027.

The IRC Section 45Z credit equals the (1) the applicable amount per gallon (or gallon equivalent) for transportation fuel produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility and sold in the manner described in IRC Section 45Z(a)(4) during the tax year multiplied by (2) the emissions factor for such fuel as determined under IRC Section 45Z(b).

Only registered production in the United States, including its territories, is considered for the IRC Section 45Z credit.

Proposal

The Bill would repeal certain provisions and modify others. The credit would be extended through December 31, 2031. The credit could not be transferred, however, after December 31, 2027.

Fuel would have to be produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada. In determining emissions rates, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would be adjusted to exclude emissions from indirect land use changes and new distinct emissions rates would be created for specific manure feedstocks.

Effective date

The Bill would apply to tax years beginning after the date of enactment.

Current law

Certain publicly traded partnerships (PTP) are not treated as corporations under IRC Section 7704(d) if at least 90% of their gross income comes from certain activities, including, but not limited to, the (1) exploration, development, and/or mining, or (2) the production, processing, refining, transportation, and/or the marketing of (3) any mineral or natural resources, industrial source carbon dioxide, or the transportation or storage of specified fuels.

Proposal

The Bill would expand the activities that can be categorized as qualifying income to include: (1) the transportation or storage of liquified hydrogen or compressed hydrogen, and (2) the generation of electricity or capture of carbon dioxide at a direct air capture or carbon capture facility.

Effective date

The Bill would apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.",https://taxnews.ey.com/Resources/Images/LinkedInSharePreview/GettyImages-1271694533.jpeg,N,,2025-05-16 10:09:51.146869

Due to heightened concerns about spending and inflation, the bill was incongruously titled the Inflation Reduction Act.
Congress hoped to use these tax credits to encourage progressive changes in the economy.
Congress would raise the expected price tag of the corporate tax credits again and again.
As with other recipients of the greenhouse grants, the organization is populated by former Obama and Biden administration officials.","On signing the Inflation Reduction Act on August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden called it “one of the most significant laws in our history.” With the new law, Biden said, “the American people won and the special interests lost.” He repeated the line.

The largest portion of the bill supposedly passed for the benefit of ordinary Americans went to tax credits for favored green corporations, amounting to more than half of the IRA’s nearly $400 billion in estimated environmental spending. The act also authorized hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidized financing for green corporations and environmentalist groups. Populist rhetoric aside, Biden was funneling unprecedented sums of money to a limited number of well-connected firms and “special interests.”

The government’s cost estimates for the act proved almost comically understated. Meantime, much of the new revenue that the law was supposed to generate never materialized. Many of the bill’s projects remain stuck in bureaucratic limbo.

Presented as a plan to reform the economy, tame inflation, and reduce the deficit, the Inflation Reduction Act will be remembered as ineffective in all but increasing both inflation and the deficit. From its name to its premise to its contents, the IRA was a patchwork of often contradictory ideas, hastily bundled together in one of the most brazen acts of political logrolling in recent memory. Biden’s presidency may be over, but Americans will be paying for this law—and its false promises—for years to come.

One of the IRA’s few saving graces is that it could have been much larger. Early in 2021, responding to the pandemic’s economic fallout, the White House proposed a Brobdingnagian plan known as Build Back Better. Divided into an infrastructure component and a catchall climate and social-services package, it aimed to fulfill nearly every progressive dream of recent decades. The legislative fight over the bill would become the defining battle of Biden’s presidency, as he himself acknowledged.

Despite progressive efforts to keep the two parts of Build Back Better together, what became the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed first. After further negotiations with Congress, Biden introduced the promised environmental and social-services package. Its scope was massive: the bill would create a universal pre-K program, fund child-care subsidies and four weeks of paid leave, raise the child tax credit, boost Obamacare subsidies, strengthen Medicare hearing benefits, expand government housing, enlarge Pell grants for college, increase funding for school meals, provide legal representation for illegal immigrants seeking asylum, and launch a version of the Green New Deal—complete with a new Civilian Climate Corps that would march into America’s forests and, by means not entirely clear, save the world from carbon dioxide. Advocates estimated the bill’s cost at $1.75 to $1.85 trillion. National Public Radio called this the “slimmed down” version of Biden’s earlier plan.

The House of Representatives approved the Build Back Better bill at the end of 2021, but in the Senate, it fell one vote short. Democrats launched an elaborate charm offensive to win over West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo invited him to her home for eggplant parmesan and his favorite scotch. National Economic Council director Brian Deese went zip-lining with Manchin at a West Virginia gorge. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hosted a “Pasta Summit” for Manchin at an Italian restaurant on Capitol Hill.

The bonhomie worked. Manchin signed off on a reduced but still massive bill that included tax credits for producers and consumers of environmental goods, loans and grants for any group even remotely connected to renewable energy or fighting climate change, and about $100 billion in extraneous health-care subsidies. According to OpenSecrets.org, more than 2,000 organizations, from General Motors to the American Chemistry Council, lobbied on the measure. Due to heightened concerns about spending and inflation, the bill was incongruously titled the Inflation Reduction Act.

After the IRA passed, Manchin was less than pleased with the outcome. He had struck a deal with the White House and congressional Democrats to pass a permitting-reform act after the IRA, but both progressives and Republicans spiked it. Frustrated, Manchin accused the Biden administration of hijacking the bill through executive action to advance a “radical climate agenda.” “I will vote to repeal my own bill,” he later declared. But by then, it was too late.

The core of the IRA was providing corporations with tax credits for environmental activities, often awarded after extensive lobbying. Mike Carr, a former Department of Energy employee in the Obama administration, discussed how he helped craft an early version of the clean-energy manufacturing tax credit to benefit two solar-cell firms. After he persuaded some Democratic senators to introduce a bill that gave tax credits based on how many panels solar companies produced, the idea “started looking like the right approach for a bunch of other things,” and it “didn’t take long for the House to add wind technologies” to the list of businesses that could get the credit. Soon battery manufacturers came along, too, adding their industry and subsidies to the list. The earlier bill eventually got shoved into the IRA along with the new additions. Congress estimated that the law’s so-called 45X tax credit, designed to bolster the domestic manufacturing of clean-energy components, would cost $30 billion; but even at the time, Carr noted that it could “well exceed” that amount.

Despite the terminology, the IRA made clear that the “tax credits” were just cash. For one, the law let nonprofits, state and local governments, and other groups get a check for the credits even if they didn’t pay any taxes. It also allowed the “transferability” of credits, whereby companies could sell their credits for cash to others that needed them. Firms such as Basis Climate, Common Forge, Evergrow, Reunion Infrastructure, and Baker Tilly have launched their own marketplaces to help facilitate the trades between buyers and sellers of tax credits, which itself has become a lucrative financial activity.

Congress hoped to use these tax credits to encourage progressive changes in the economy. Companies building clean-energy manufacturing plants and generation projects, carbon-capture facilities, energy-efficient buildings, or EV charging stations had to meet new union prevailing-wage and apprenticeship standards to receive the full credits. The administration reduced penalties under the law if companies agreed to sign “project labor agreements” that allow “monitoring and administration by union officials.” Businesses could also get bonus credits for complying with other progressive wishes, such as building in low-income areas. One approving progressive news source stated that, before the IRA, everyone “had an incentive to keep costs as low as possible”; but now, “the top priority is getting that 30% tax credit” by splurging on union projects. And the “upside is valuable enough that it’s generated a whole new cottage industry in tax credit compliance” that would keep tabs on companies’ labor and union policies.

The act also doled out billions of dollars in tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements, which, studies have found, were more likely to be claimed by high-income households. According to journalist Franklin Foer, both Senator Manchin and President Biden “hated that rich families would receive tax credits to buy fancy electric cars.” But Biden either forgot or moved on from his earlier opposition, and his IRS soon loosened the rules for claiming the credits. He then imposed a mandate requiring automakers to make most new cars and trucks electric by the early 2030s—massively expanding the number of people who will be forced to buy EVs and, in turn, claim the accompanying credits. While original estimates put the bill for expanded EV tax credits at about $14 billion by 2031, newer projections suggested that they will cost almost $400 billion. Stanford researchers estimated that 75 percent of the subsidies will go to people who would have bought an EV anyway.

Congress soon realized that Biden’s mandates and regulations were making the bill far more expensive than expected. Less than a year after the IRA passed, new congressional estimates for the ten-year cost of the corporate electricity and energy tax credits had risen by 40 percent. Predicted costs for the tax credits for carbon-capture and clean-fuel technology had doubled. And the bill for the advanced manufacturing tax credits, as Carr had predicted, would “well exceed” initial projections: the expected costs were four times the original estimate. Congress would raise the expected price tag of the corporate tax credits again and again. Independent sources had even starker reevaluations. University of Pennsylvania researchers estimated that the act’s green spending portion would cost more than $1 trillion over ten years. Goldman Sachs suggested $1.2 trillion.

Besides tax credits, the other major component of a bill supposedly passed to help hardworking Americans was a vast expansion of subsidized loans for green projects—not exactly an item on any populist’s wish list. One of the strangest of these giveaways was the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which allocated $20 billion in untethered grant money to nonprofits that would then loan out the funds.

Generous government grants to nonprofits are nothing new, but thanks to the IRA, the four largest federal grants to nonprofits on record were doled out by President Biden, not long before last November’s election. In contrast to many government lending programs, no pretense was made that the government would be repaid. These nonprofits would give the money to other nonprofits, which would then lend it to whatever environmental group—broadly defined—they chose. The recipients were at least two layers removed from direct government oversight.

The largest nonprofit beneficiary of federal largesse in modern history is the Climate United Fund, formed by activist lending groups specifically to receive the grant. As with other recipients of the greenhouse grants, the organization is populated by former Obama and Biden administration officials. On its own, the nearly $7 billion grant would make the Climate United Fund one of the 200 biggest banks in the nation, as measured by assets. For these billions, it submitted a 49-page work plan of generalized prose—not a bad per-page return. Instead of focusing on how to get the best returns for the money, the work plan notes that the fund will “center equity in access in our community engagement” and try to encourage more meetings about its projects, including by paying people to attend them. The group Inclusiv received $1.87 billion to support initiatives such as “Inclusiv Black Communities” and to “deliver products that address the effects of discrimination and bias in traditional financial services.” Its work plan wasn’t too bashful to note that, in distributing the money, it would require $187 million in overhead and funding for its own programs.

The IRA also created massive new lending programs to be run directly by the federal government. The bill authorized the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office to lend or guarantee up to $350 billion. By the generous standards of federal accounting, the government estimated that this vast outflow of subsidized loans would cost taxpayers only a few billion dollars.

Yet, studies have shown that the government consistently underestimates the cost of its lending programs. One reason is that these loans are often used to pursue political goals rather than maximize returns. The DOE, for instance, required IRA loan applicants to create “Community Benefits Plans” that detail which interest groups they will serve, their “community and labor engagement,” and how each project will “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.”

The San Francisco Bay Area utility PG&E got a $15 billion DOE loan after it submitted a community-benefits plan that committed it to “strong diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging principles.” PG&E promised to promote something called “spatial, procedural, and recognition justice,” which apparently means holding as many meetings as possible. PG&E pledged to back its three largest unions and enter contracts with more women-owned and minority-owned businesses. Since PG&E has gone bankrupt twice in the past quarter-century, partly under the burden of similar progressive mandates from California, the loan poses a not-insignificant risk for taxpayers.

Another reason federal loan programs often cost more than projected is that the government tends to bail out politically powerful borrowers. The American public has seen this pattern repeatedly, from federal housing loans to federal student loans. The IRA itself reflected this tendency by including an unrelated $3.1 billion in relief for farmers who had borrowed from the Department of Agriculture. In another era, a multibillion-dollar bailout of a government lending program would have made national headlines. In the IRA, it was buried in the fine print. Future presidents and Congresses will doubtless find ways to rescue firms that borrowed too much federal money under the act.

The premise of the IRA’s green financing drive is absurd, since no plausible argument can be made that green projects are underfinanced. On one recent estimate, $8 trillion in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) assets are under management in the United States alone. The largest banks in America pursue ESG directives that lead them to provide more loans to green groups. Public or quasi-public “green banks” already make environmental loans in 14 states. Extensive green lending programs operate at the DOE, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Agriculture, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and other government entities.

Environmental projects are probably the most overfinanced initiatives in history. Having all this new federal money chase after a shrinking pool of viable projects will further reduce the returns on that lending and raise the chance of defaults—which taxpayers will have to cover.

The IRA not only hoped to use its credits and loans to create a corporate America more in line with Congress’s progressive image; it also wanted to remake America’s political system. The act gave $3 billion for “environmental and climate justice block grants.” These awards swiftly turned many small, so-called environmental-justice groups, which tie climate-change activism to race and class activism, into political behemoths. “We’re going from tens of thousands of dollars to developing and designing a program that will distribute billions,” observed Environmental Protection Agency head Michael Regan. The law’s language enabled grants to go to vague programs like “[c]limate resiliency and adaptation” and to facilitate “engagement of disadvantage communities” in “public processes.” In other words: activism.

To ensure that the grant funds were even less accountable to taxpayers, the government, as with the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, picked big nonprofits to hand out the money to smaller nonprofits as they saw fit. The administration gave $600 million to 11 so-called Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmakers. The Institute for Sustainable Communities received $50 million to give out, thanks to its “equity-centered expertise.” The Climate Justice Alliance also was awarded $50 million, though it had previously portrayed itself as part of a movement that “challenges capitalism and both white supremacy and hetero-patriarchy.” Members of the Climate Justice Alliance have organized illegal protests at the U.S. Capitol and elsewhere about the Gaza war and backed a legal defense fund for those sabotaging “Cop City,” Atlanta’s police training center.

The IRA supported a $2 billion program of Community Change Grants. It has already provided $2.2 million to use “data, storytelling, and organizing training” for Youth Environmental Councils and Climate Action Groups in Ohio. It gives $3 million to allow “tribal elders, traditional ricers, and knowledge Keepers” to participate in a project “to protect wild rice” in Michigan, as well as $1.5 million to teach prisoners and former prisoners “about the unique environmental and climate justice challenges” that they face.

The Biden administration’s so-called Justice40 initiative tried to apply the environmental-justice framework embodied in the IRA to all aspects of government. Justice40 demanded that at least 40 percent of the benefits of all federal green energy spending flow to “environmental-justice communities,” defined as low-income areas with a pressing environmental issue. As Manhattan Institute fellow James B. Meigs notes, the initiative involved opening a host of new programs and offices. The White House launched an Environmental Justice Scorecard to keep agencies updated on their progress toward the 40 percent goal, a White House Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights to enforce its dictates, and a Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool for those winning grants to show that they were acting in an environmentally just manner.

The IRA also effectively bribed state and local governments to implement a key part of the Green New Deal. The act provided $1 billion to governments willing to adopt the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code for buildings or, more expansively, codes that promise “zero energy” use in new buildings. Far from driving down inflation, the codes will significantly drive up the cost of new housing. A National Association of Homebuilders report estimated that the 2021 IECC would increase new housing costs by over $30,000 and will take up to 90 years for homebuyers to recover through energy savings. Even supporters admit that the codes add thousands of dollars to housing costs—and “zero energy” buildings will cost even more.

The IRA contained so many disparate programs—119 in all, on one estimate—that even many attentive commentators are unaware of them. The IRA offered an impressive $100 million to start a program for sticking labels on “low-emissions construction materials.” After holding several webinars trying to figure out what this meant, the EPA remained uncertain. By the Biden administration’s end, the funds still had not been distributed.

The law allocated $3 billion to revamp and electrify the basic postal delivery truck. The Postal Service projected that 3,000 of the so-called Next Generation Delivery Vehicles would be ready by the November election. By that time, in a familiar pattern, the government had received only 93 trucks. According to the Washington Post, the electric versions of these vehicles cost $77,692 each—about 40 percent more than the gas-powered versions—and offered a shorter range. For purchasing fewer than 100 overpriced electric trucks, the Biden administration awarded the Postal Service its “federal sustainability award.”

Though the IRA was billed as a climate bill, it also directed more than $100 billion to health-care subsidies, with the largest share funding the Obamacare insurance market. The administration claimed that this would reduce insurance costs for struggling families. Yet the law removed the cap on subsidies for higher earners—meaning that, thanks to the IRA, people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year can now have their health care subsidized by the federal government. An Urban Institute estimate found that the largest beneficiaries—by far—on the Obamacare exchanges would be those making more than 400 percent of the poverty level.

Despite the IRA’s immense price tag, the Biden administration claimed that the act would reduce the deficit through new taxes, revenues, and spending cuts. The largest share of these revenues was supposed to come from a corporate minimum tax, aimed at preventing large corporations from using deductions and loopholes to lower their tax rate below 15 percent of income. Given that the IRA’s main purpose was to provide tax benefits for corporations, this new minimum tax was deeply ironic. To shield the IRA’s centerpiece—its clean energy tax credits—from the very tax meant to fund the law, the administration announced that most of those credits would be exempt from the minimum tax.

In a typical example of Washington accounting, another major source of revenue in the IRA was supposed to come from increased government spending. The bill allocated $80 billion to expand the IRS workforce, with Congress estimating that the new agents would generate more than twice that amount through heightened enforcement. The administration, never shy about exaggeration, claimed that the effort could raise more than ten times its cost. But by late 2024, the administration admitted that it had recouped just over $1 billion from its increased enforcement efforts. By every measure—including the government’s own—the bill will now add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit.

The IRA’s climate benefits turned out to be largely specious, as well. Some sources stated that the act would cut carbon emissions by up to 40 percent by 2030. Senate Democrats and the EPA itself repeated this claim, based on misreadings of studies that the bill would assist in cutting overall U.S. emissions to 40 percent below 2005 levels—thus only accelerating a reduction in emissions already under way. Even these assumptions were overestimated. As Scientific American pointed out, almost any substantial reductions in the next few years would be difficult, if not impossible, since it can take more than a decade to complete a single electric transmission line to a new renewable project. The idea that hundreds of these would be connected and obliterate large sections of the fossil-fuel industry in a few years was literally incredible.

The new Trump administration is no fan of the IRA. One of President Trump’s first executive orders involved “Terminating the Green New Deal.” It paused the distribution of funds from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. New Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called the IRA a “doomsday machine for the budget,” and both Trump and Bessent have promised to pare back its tax credits for electric vehicles and other green programs. The administration has placed on administrative leave about 200 employees in Biden’s environmental-justice offices, from the EPA to the Department of Justice. The new Congress is looking to claw back some of the IRA as well.

Yet stopping the IRA’s money gusher won’t be easy. Just before Biden left office, the White House announced that it had dispersed 84 percent of the law’s clean energy grants. The rapid push of funds out the door, officials suggested, would protect the grants from the incoming Trump administration. The outgoing administration also announced some $11 billion in extra grant funds, without finishing the legal process of dispersing them. Kristina Costa, a Biden White House assistant, noted that the announcement “creates some political pressure” to spend the funds later. One video caught a Biden EPA official describing the effort to get IRA money out the door as like “tossing gold bars off the Titanic.”

The Biden administration tried to get the biggest green loans out just before he exited. The largest IRA lending program announced its first loans right after the election, in December 2024. Four days before leaving office, Biden committed another $22 billion in loans to utilities. The DOE lamented that it had billions more to give.

After the passage of the IRA, a New York Times headline wondered, “Did Democrats Just Save Civilization?” On the contrary, the law gave mountains of money to questionable companies, nonprofits, and well-off consumers, at an astounding cost to taxpayers. The spending, loan losses, and politicized projects will weigh on the U.S. economy for years, while the supposed benefits evaporate into the atmosphere.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/President-Biden-signed-the-IRA-on-August-16-2022.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 22:07:06.873341

“They were like, ‘Hey, we have a two-year incentive to give you free charging with Electrify America,’” EV driver Antonio Zorrilla, of Falls Church, Virginia, said.

That sold Zorilla, who said it’s been easy to stay on the road in the D.C. area with just a 30-minute charge.

There are more than 3,500 public charging stations in the D.C. area and there were supposed to be more coming.

But on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to freeze funds allocated by the Biden-era bipartisan infrastructure law, including billions of dollars for states to install charging stations.

In February, the Federal Highway Administration said no new projects could begin while the program is under review. A Department of Transportation spokesperson told the News4 I-Team the program needs “major reform.”

How the federal freeze has affected EV charging station construction in the DC area

For now, Maryland is waiting to see if they’ll get $33 million. The state Department of Transportation already began work on 22 charging stations – work that is allowed to continue since the funding freeze came after they started. But plans for future EV charging stations are on hold, mostly along busy highways.

“We are currently waiting on the DOT to provide that guidance,” said Joe McAndrew, assistant secretary at Maryland’s DOT.

Virginia is limbo now too, waiting for the majority of its $83 million from the federal program. A spokesperson for the state Department of Transportation told the I-Team only one new charging station is operating from the program so far. Awards for more than 50 other projects were withdrawn.

""Without that infrastructure and without that federal support, it means that a lot more of the burden is going to be on states in that area,” said Michael Brooks with the Center for Auto Safety.

So far in the D.C. area, there are this many charging stations, according to the Department of Energy:

D.C.: 334

Maryland: 1,462

Virginia: 1,786

A lawsuit filed by D.C. and several states, including Maryland, argued the federal government is illegally withholding EV charging station funds awarded to states. The I-Team asked the DOT about the lawsuit and have not heard back.

‘People are kind of hesitant to buy EVs at this point’

Questions about infrastructure are the biggest holdup now for many drivers considering going fully electric, Brooks said.

""People are kind of hesitant to buy EVs at this point because of some of that uncertainty,” he said. “They don't know, for instance, what the charging infrastructure in America is gonna look like in five years.”

Almost 6 million EVs are on the road now, in a new high, according to the Alliance of Automative Innovation. There’s only one public charging port for every 30 vehicles.

The FHA said it aims to publish new guidance for the EV program after getting public comment this spring.

An EV driver named Cooper said he moved from a hybrid to a fully electric car and isn’t overly concerned about the pause in federal funding for charging stations. But he’s keeping a close eye on what might be coming down the road.

“If the existing infrastructure starts to crumble, will I be forced to go back to a gas engine? In that case then yeah, you know, probably will have to,” he said.",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/05/ev-charging.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-05-15 22:07:15.030830

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time.

Demand has held steady compared to the same period last year, according to a new study from consumer insights and research firm J.D. Power.

EVs are powering a once-in-a-century transformation of the U.S. auto industry, but the country remains sharply divided over their adoption. Uptake has surged in coastal and Democratic-leaning states, particularly among younger buyers, while rural areas lag behind. Even as EV sales hit record highs last year and again in Q1 2025, federal support is beginning to waver, with the Trump administration pledging to dismantle pro-EV policies.

According to the J.D. Power study, 24% of vehicle buyers said they are “very likely” to buy an EV and 35% are “somewhat likely”—these metrics remain essentially unchanged from a year ago. So about 60% of vehicle shoppers have EVs on their minds, but the conversion rate remains far lower due to myriad reasons. EVs accounted for only about 7.5% of total vehicle sales in the U.S. in the first quarter, still up from 7% in Q1 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Despite the headwinds, the EV market is showing surprising resilience, even though it’s not clear if it will stay that way. There’s an influx of new and affordable models such as the Chevy Equinox EV and demand remains strong for its rivals such as the Kia EV6 and Honda Prologue. Tesla sales have been sliding, but its rivals are eagerly stepping in to fill the void—both the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are stealing Tesla buyers.

That’s the other big reason why consumer demand is steady: more options. EV shoppers who fall in the “very likely” consideration category are trying out models from multiple brands and cross-shopping at an average of nearly 3 brands. Buyers falling in the “somewhat likely” EV consideration category cross-shop an average of 2.8 brands.

It’s hard to not do that when you have offers from Polestar and Lucid that top $20,000 in stacked discounts if you’re a current Tesla owner. Or when you have short-term, low-commitment lease deals from Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai and Kia that have consistently remained under $300 per month.

“As more EV options come to market, this should serve as an encouraging sign for automakers because it’s an opportunity for them to gain a foothold and pull shoppers from outside their brands,” Brent Gruber, executive director of the EV practice at J.D. Power, said in a statement. “EV shoppers consider products from mass market and premium brands alike, highlighting the opportunity to capture consumer interest with brands or products that shoppers may not have otherwise considered,” he added.

Still, the study states two big reasons continuing to plague the EV market: charging anxieties and affordability. Availability of EV charging stations remains the top concern for this pool of buyers, and that’s where the market is losing more than half of its potential buyers: 52%. Affordability is also a concern, but that situation is improving due to costs dropping 4% year-over-year. Now just 43% of buyers list it as a major concern.

Now the Trump administration is coming after the very policies that have made EVs so popular and affordable, like the so-called “leasing loophole,” which qualifies EVs for federal tax credits even if those models don’t meet the strict battery and component sourcing requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act. The administration is also separately going after funding for public charging stations and trying to repeal the 45X production credit that has created a battery manufacturing boom across the U.S.

The House Republican bill may face some resistance in the Senate, as tens of thousands of EV jobs are at stake in Southern red states like Georgia and North Carolina. Still, long-term EV industry growth may ultimately rely less on tax credits and more on fundamentals of this industry, such as expanding the charging network and making it more reliable, bringing innovative car features to attract buyers and driving down sticker prices.

Ohio mayors are urging that solar projects in their cities be able to continue using the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Direct Pay provision, which has supported numerous solar projects in the state. They attest that without the tax credit provision, many of these projects would not have been possible.

Direct Pay is a provision in the IRA that allows local governments and other tax-exempt organizations — including churches, hospitals and schools — to claim tax credits for investing in renewable energy projects for the first time, alongside the private sector.

Threatening this provision, the Congressional House Ways and Means Committee on May 12 released a draft tax proposal including significant rollbacks to the tax credits available to local governments through Direct Pay. The proposal was included within the House Ways and Means Committee markup to its Fiscal Year 2025 reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has dubbed “One big, beautiful bill.”

To counter the cuts being encouraged within the Committee bill, three rural Ohio mayors held a press call on May 13 to testify about the value of the IRA Direct Pay provision. These Ohio mayors included Edward Kraus of Solon, Steve Patterson of Athens, and Sharetta Smith of Lima.

“All three mayors on the call represent cities with populations lower than 35,000 and have boosted their economies with clean energy projects, demonstrating that Direct Pay has benefited cities and towns of all stripes,” said Georgia Panitz, an associate for energy and sustainability at FGS Global, which facilitated the press call.

Worth noting: Ohio has also seen energy policy corruption at the state level with the House Bill 6 Scandal. The passage of HB 6 allegedly involved roughly $60 million in bribes tied to utility companies used to secure more than $1.5 billion in ratepayer subsidies for aging coal and nuclear power plants. Two former FirstEnergy executives were indicted by a federal grand jury in January, charged with one count of participating in a racketeering (RICO) conspiracy.

Mayors explain Direct Pay benefits

Athens is one city in Ohio that has benefited from the Direct Pay provisions, said Mayor Patterson during the May 13 call.

“Our city of Athens East Side solar project was a 2.1 MW solar array project, which utilized the community center campus, where we deployed solar on the rooftop of our community center, a canopy in front of our seasonal swimming pool, and then also a significant ground mount array next to our wastewater treatment plant,” he said. “About 90% of the energy for our seasonal swimming pool is coming directly from the sun. With the PPA agreement, we have a six-year buyout [from Kokosing Solar] at the end because of the Inflation Reduction Act credits.”

Lima, Ohio, has also gained savings through a Direct Pay solar project:

“The city of Lima has put floating solar panels on two of our reservoirs. it is going to allow us to save on our water treatment plant electricity, [which produces a] bill of about $1 million per year,” said Mayor Smith. “Projections through our partner D3Energy, we’re going to save rate payers $200,000 in the first year and $10 million over the life of the project.”

In Solon, Ohio, a group of solar projects is in early development.

“We now have a program for renewable energy, exploring lots of different options for solar,” said Mayor Kraus. “We’re looking at both rooftop solar and solar on the ground; we’re trying to aggregate it.”

Direct Pay Tracker

Another participant in the May 13 call was Kate Wright, executive director of Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of nearly 350 mayors across 46 states, collectively representing 60 million people. Climate Mayors and other partners launched the Local Government Direct Pay tracker, “a first-of-its-kind tool showing where federal tax credits are helping support clean energy projects in U.S. cities across the country.”

The Local Government Direct Pay tracker currently accounts for more than 100 clean energy projects across 29 states and 59 jurisdictions, including Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, New Mexico, Florida, and Indiana, according to the organization website.

“The projects reflected in the tracker demonstrate how clean energy tax credits, which the private sector has benefited from for decades, are now helping local governments and nonprofits unlock innovative clean energy projects, from installing solar energy and creating more energy independence, to purchasing electric vehicles and reducing toxic pollution. The Direct Pay tracker’s interactive dashboard allows users to filter projects by Congressional district, project type, and tax credit,” the Climate Mayors website explains.

The tracker was developed in partnership with C40 Cities, the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), the Sustainable Cities Fund (SCF), and Atlas Public Policy, and in collaboration alongside Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG) and World Resource Institute (WRI), Climate Mayors states.

Upcoming Ohio solar projects

Preceding the call, a bipartisan coalition of 30 Ohio mayors and local officials sent a letter on April 24 to the Ohio Congressional delegation, seeking to protect the Direct Pay provision. The letter was organized by Power a Clean Future Ohio (PCFO). “There are 13 tax credits available to local governments, including the qualified Clean Electricity Investment tax credit for solar, wind, and geothermal projects (48E), Commercial Clean Vehicles tax credit (45W), and the Alternative Refueling Property Credit (30C),” PCFO stated in the letter.

PCFO cites a host of Ohio projects among the solar and other clean energy projects that have been supported by the Direct Pay provision:

Cuyahoga County plans to utilize Climate Pollution Reduction Grant funds to develop multiple brownfield and landfill solar sites within Cuyahoga County and the City of Painesville that will produce 63 MW of renewable energy, putting Northeast Ohio on a pathway to achieving its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction goals. This program will create 136 construction jobs, 17 jobs retained and re-skilled from coal-fired power plant to solar and battery storage facility, 100 pre-apprenticeship positions, and 6 total staff hired for new positions across Cuyahoga County and the cities of Cleveland and Painesville. The project will leverage approximately $60 million of federal tax credits through Direct Pay.

The City of Lima is constructing a floating photovoltaic (FPV) facility on the surface of Twin Lakes Reservoir, located next to the city’s water treatment plant. The 2 MW of power generated by this FPV system will directly power the city’s water treatment plant. $890,000 of Direct Pay will support this project upon its completion in 2026.

The City of Cincinnati is planning to file for $405,000 in Direct Pay tax credits for five solar projects on recreation centers and municipal buildings in the city. The city has also purchased nine electric vehicles they plan to file for.

Three rooftop solar projects are planned to be installed on senior living facilities in the cities of Reynoldsburg, Macedonia, and Sylvania, all of which are dependent on Direct Pay tax credits to make them financially viable. These projects total nearly 300 kW of solar energy and will result in significant energy savings for seniors in Ohio.

The City of Columbus accelerated a 6 MW bioenergy project at the Southerly Water Reclamation Facility to secure $120 million in savings from the IRA Direct Pay provisions. In addition, Columbus is poised to develop a 5 MW community solar array for its municipal power customers and expand its residential solar program with $15 million in Solar for All grant funding and Direct Pay tax credits.

The agency said that its ""actions are designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills"" while still ""continuing to protect public health.""

In addition to rescinding the limits for three out of the five forever chemicals, the EPA said it also intends to extend water utilities' compliance deadline from 2029 to 2031 in order to give them more time to develop a plan that would allow them to meet the standard.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it will rescind four of the six chemicals named in the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation, keeping maximum contaminant levels for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).

The agency announced it will be rescinding and reconsidering regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS, “to ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulation follow the legal process laid out in the Safe Drinking Water Act.”

All are considered “forever chemicals,” commonly referred to as PFAS. They are widely used chemicals in products that break down slowly over time. Because of widespread use, they are found in blood of people and animals and in the environment. Studies have shown they are linked to negative health effects.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin in an agency news release. “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants. EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.”

As more research has been done in recent years, officials believe local water systems will bear the financial burden of attempting to remove these chemicals from drinking water sources. The American Water Works Association estimates between $3 and $6 billion annually.

It appears part of EPA’s motivation for the announcement is taking into consideration these costs.

“Paired with effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) for PFAS and other tools to ensure that polluters are held responsible, EPA’s actions are designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these,” the release states. “EPA is also announcing its intent to rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS to ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulation follow the legal process laid out in the Safe Drinking Water Act.”ates the challenge.",https://floridaspecifier.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Water-Regulations-2.png,N,,2025-05-15 23:00:23.344423

Likewise, other RFF research has demonstrated that subsidies for public charging stations and EV purchases can reinforce one another in a positive feedback loop.
Eliminating the federal waiver that allowed California (and, subsequently, other states) to adopt an EV mandate.
Similarly, investors in charging stations will want some level of certainty regarding future demand so they can make informed investments.
(For more on that topic, see another article in this magazine issue about leveraging investments in EV charging stations to maximize public benefits.)","Demand for light-duty electric vehicles (EVs) has risen to about 10 percent of new vehicle sales nationwide, with California and a few other states far exceeding that average. Though part of this success has been due to improvements in EV manufacturing and quality, along with reduced battery costs, policies at the state and federal levels have played an important role. Effectively decarbonizing the transportation sector has relied on a whole-of-government approach, with various state and federal policies supporting one another to help move the needle toward increased EV adoption, particularly for passenger vehicles.

Given a recent decline in federal and monetary support for the EV transition, states will need to ramp up their own spending and strengthen their policies if they want to ensure continued advancement of EV adoption.

Three major types of policies have helped boost EV adoption to date: vehicle emissions standards, federal and state subsidies for vehicles and charging stations, and state-level EV mandates. These policies reinforce one another, working to simultaneously encourage EV manufacturing and increase demand by subsidizing vehicle purchases and expanding charging infrastructure. This policy complementarity means that weakening or removing one is likely to make the others less effective.

Resources for the Future (RFF) research has demonstrated that California’s EV mandate (the Advanced Clean Cars rule) helped the federal government increase the stringency of fuel efficiency standards. Without the mandate, manufacturers would have felt less pressure to make and sell EVs. Likewise, other RFF research has demonstrated that subsidies for public charging stations and EV purchases can reinforce one another in a positive feedback loop.

On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump released an executive order titled Unleashing American Energy, which put a spotlight on actions that the administration may take to weaken vehicle electrification policies, potentially including the following:

Halting the release of funds that were allocated in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for investments in charging stations through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program. Jointly, these programs represented an investment of $7.5 billion.

Revisiting and loosening vehicle emissions standards, which had placed strong pressure on manufacturers to increase EV production.

Eliminating the federal waiver that allowed California (and, subsequently, other states) to adopt an EV mandate.

Eliminating tax credits for EV purchases and battery manufacturing also may be in the works, though not included in recent executive orders. The tax credits would have cost the federal government $390 billion by 2028, according to estimates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—an order of magnitude larger than originally estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.

Cutting subsidies for public charging stations and certain EV purchases presumably would require congressional action, but the administration might try to weaken federal standards or revoke the waiver unilaterally. Already, the administration has moved forward on blocking the release of funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and temporarily paused the electric school bus subsidy program.

California has strong decarbonization goals for the transportation sector and has implemented a variety of policies that push forward EV adoption. In December 2024, California approved a $1.4-billion investment in charging stations statewide, which could replace the funds for infrastructure that would have come from the federal government. However, other states are fully reliant on federal funding. Given local budget shortfalls in California, and with its ongoing fire disasters, how much the state can afford to subsidize EVs remains an open question. Furthermore, California also has implemented its own emissions standards, which are part of the Advanced Clean Cars rule. However, if the waiver is rescinded, California (and others that followed the state’s lead) will no longer be able to set its own emissions requirements for vehicles.

Reducing federal support creates a challenge for ensuring a robust supply of EVs and public charging stations nationwide. Uncertainty about federal emissions standards and federal policies for EV charging hampers investment decisions for manufacturing, such as building new facilities for vehicle and battery production. Similarly, investors in charging stations will want some level of certainty regarding future demand so they can make informed investments. For states to achieve their goals, they will have to find policies that can provide some certainty for auto manufacturers and charging-station investors.

To meet ambitious goals that address climate change and EVs in the absence of federal support, state governments will have to revisit both the scope of their policies and the magnitude of their investments for transitioning to EVs. Given their limited resources, states will need to focus on finding the most cost-efficient policies to boost demand and to incentivize innovation and investment on the supply side.

For states with ambitious decarbonization goals and limited budgets, identifying and implementing policies that also maximize the broader benefits for economic and social well-being in the energy transition also would be valuable. (For more on that topic, see another article in this magazine issue about leveraging investments in EV charging stations to maximize public benefits.) Because public support for federal EV policy has waned over the years, a more decentralized policy approach may be viewed more favorably and would allow states to chart their own decarbonization pathways.

Underlying these pending policy decisions, of course, is rigorous evidence. Timely research, including work that facilitates a better understanding of the barriers to EV adoption and how to overcome those barriers, can help guide states in identifying the most cost-effective suite of policies. One interesting example is the use of restructured registration fees to encourage electric truck adoption, as proposed by economist James Sallee. Understanding the price tag that’s involved for a state to achieve their EV goals without any federal support is an open question which also can benefit from more research.

Importantly, investments in EVs have broader implications above and beyond the fuel that powers the vehicle. Research has shown that growth in the EV fleet can drive job creation; for example, through an increase in EV manufacturing, a boost in battery manufacturing, and the workforce deployment required for the maintenance and operation of EVs and charging stations. Indeed, the letter to Trump from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation asked for the continuance of EV tax credits due to the benefits that have accrued in terms of increased manufacturing and job creation. Of course, reducing sales of new gasoline vehicles would reduce employment at certain production facilities and possibly for auto mechanics, as well. Thus, the effects on national and regional employment of slowing EV adoption still are unclear. Furthermore, charging stations placed in urban settings can have positive economic spillovers to neighboring businesses and can help improve outcomes such as affordability, accessibility, and broader economic growth for local communities if investments are made carefully.

Researchers at RFF will continue to track the quickly evolving world of federal and state policies in the EV space to provide relevant evidence of the trade-offs and possible outcomes for vehicle fleets among states and nationally.",https://media.rff.org/images/RFF_-_States_Steering_Wheel_-_1.4_copy.width-600.png,N,,2025-05-15 22:07:35.267485

The innovative Ramcharger will now hit the market in early 2026, with the all-electric Ram 1500 REV following in 2027.

The company attributed the REV's delay to slower demand for full-size electric pickups.

The innovative Ram 1500 Ramcharger is set to be in a league of its own when it hits the market as America's first extended-range electric truck—that is, a battery-powered pickup with a range-boosting gasoline engine.

It promises to blend the best parts of electric and gas-powered trucks. Understandably, people are pretty pumped for this thing to hit the road.

Now it's coming later than initially expected. Stellantis, parent of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler, has delayed the Ramcharger's launch to the first quarter of next year because it is ""extending the quality validation period,"" Crain's Detroit Business reported on Wednesday.

The 2026 Ram Ramcharger pairs an electric powertrain with a range-extending gasoline generator.

The Ram 1500 REV, the brand's fully electric truck, is getting pushed until the summer of 2027, a Stellantis spokeswoman confirmed to the outlet.

That truck seems to be in a perpetual state of delay.

In December, the automaker said it would shift REV production to 2026 from early 2025, citing slowing demand for full-size electric pickups. That's the same reasoning Stellantis gave for the latest move. The truck was unveiled in 2023 with an initial targeted launch date of late 2024.

The Ram 1500 REV was unveiled in 2023 and has been delayed twice.

Stellantis is just one of many automakers that has shifted its electrification plans in the face of weaker-than-expected demand growth for EVs. If the federal government successfully cuts key pro-EV policies like the federal clean-car tax credits and tailpipe emissions regulations, that trend could accelerate.

And when it comes to electric trucks in particular, Stellantis has a point. Big electric pickups haven't taken off quite like the industry imagined they would.

Ford went all-in on F-150 Lightning, ratcheting up its production targets to 150,000 units annually in 2022. The automaker sold roughly 33,000 of them last year.

The Ford F-150 Lightning hasn't been nearly as popular as the company initially projected, indicating there's limited demand for big, expensive electric trucks.

Electric pickups cost far more than their gas counterparts, mostly because of their enormous battery packs. They also usually can't tow for long distances. And there's limited overlap between people who buy trucks and the coastal city-dwellers who tend to buy EVs.

The plug-in hybrid Ramcharger could be exactly what the electric truck market needs. It promises to go 140 miles on electric power alone, before its V6 generator kicks in to extend range by 550 miles. That engine never drives the wheels. Rather, it just feeds electricity to the truck's battery pack.

It's a neat idea, but we won't know for certain whether Americans will embrace this strange new truck until it actually gets here, or, crucially, how much it'll cost.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/pbzx0o/s1/2026-ram-ramcharger.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 21:06:29.236358

Energy Star represented a voluntary public-private partnership, meaning a nonregulatory approach to engaging the business community and catalyzing the adoption of strategic energy management. So at the time, it was the first of its kind. I wouldn’t say folks were just like, “Yes, let’s do this.” It was really new and different.

The other thing is that at that time, we had come out of the oil crisis of the 1970s, and people were starting to recognize the importance of where and how our energy was being produced. But we weren’t focused on thinking about it as an opportunity. For office buildings, the single largest controllable operating expense is your energy or utilities expenses; if the Environmental Protection Agency or the government could build awareness, develop tools, and help businesses understand how they could invest in energy efficiency and how that would translate to financial performance results for them — it was a great experiment. And it turns out that it’s the single most successful voluntary program we’ve had to date, saving over $5 billion annually.

It’s clear how losing Energy Star would harm consumers, but I’m curious to hear from you about how this is also bad for building owners and residents. What is the cost of losing this program, especially from a climate perspective?

The most important contribution of the EPA’s Energy Star program is that it has created a national standard to benchmark and measure efficiency and energy performance. You can’t manage what you don’t measure, and consistency across building types, ages, and sizes — it’s pretty complicated to make an apples-to-apples comparison.

One of the tools and resources that Energy Star has created, which I see as being embedded in the fabric of American businesses, is their benchmarking tool called Portfolio Manager. It is tied to dozens of state and local jurisdiction policies and legislation that range from building energy disclosure to mandatory best practices to maintaining and operating buildings and emissions thresholds. So the Energy Star rating system is tied not only to how organizations assess their whole building performance, but also to how it tracks and measures progress towards efficiency improvements and then gives a certification or recognition for the most highly efficient ones.

Another thing folks tend not to consider is the relationship between energy efficiency and grid stability. Energy Star-certified appliances, homes, buildings, and industrial facilities help to reduce peak demand, which improves grid stability and resilience. It also lowers the risk of brownouts and blackouts. Think about the growing demands of data center computing and AI models — we need to bring more energy onto the grid and make more space for it. People sometimes don’t realize that it is really dependent on a consistent, impartial standard as a level setting.

If you look at some of the statistics, they’re projecting that investments in new data centers will grow at more than a 20% compound annual growth rate, and that’s equal to $59 billion. It’s just astronomical how much more energy demand there will be. If you try to put that on top of a grid that is fairly antiquated and very inefficient in the way it generates, transmits, and distributes energy, then you are intensifying the potential problem.

I’ve heard about manufacturers or an outside energy or appliance group possibly setting up a replacement program if Energy Star is eliminated. What is the advantage of having the government specifically oversee Energy Star?

Three or four things make the federal government the most unique entity and the most well-equipped to oversee the Energy Star program. First, they have access to large data sets using CBECS, the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey, and RECS, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. The government inherently is an impartial, unbiased group, and entities are willing to share their data with it, and that would not be the same if it were a third party or a privatized group. That data set is instrumental in creating the standards that allow you, for products, to evaluate the most energy efficient, or for buildings, to develop a one-to-100 score. Energy Star allows the top 25% to be recognized as exemplary energy performance.

The government also has access to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory resources; they have the data, and I believe they have the impartiality and the trust. Today, the Energy Star brand has over 90% consumer recognition. I would be concerned if manufacturers or others would produce confusion in the marketplace related to a single little blue label.

Is there anything consumers should know about making decisions or navigating their choices if we return to a pre-1992 landscape?

In the absence of an Energy Star label, one thing we can do is help consumers understand that it is not just about the first cost of a dishwasher or a washing machine or renting an apartment. It’s about total lifecycle costs. What the Energy Star label does is it helps you have confidence that [an appliance] will use the least amount of energy necessary to run over its lifetime. But if your product or apartment is full of less efficient appliances, you have to think about how much more energy you will pay for over that life cycle. That’s sometimes a difficult concept for folks to understand: They think of their first cost, not the cost to operate or maintain something over time, which is higher if it’s not energy efficient.

Is there anything else people often overlook when considering the ramifications of losing Energy Star?

Energy efficiency is important for all constituencies and all sectors of the U.S. economy. Some folks will be harder hit by this, and by that, I mean low-income housing, schools, hospitals, and public sector buildings. Those facilities often have very limited budgets, so energy efficiency is one of the lowest-cost, most effective investments with good returns. But if you’re a low-income family, think about it: If you make less than $33,000 a year for a family of four, your utility bills have an outsized impact on the total cost of living. If the total utility bill is $300 or $400 a month, then utilities represent 10% to 15% of your total income, so efficiency can have an outsized impact.

The other side of that is mission-critical facilities. Having the ability to run lights, air conditioning, and cooling is important for comfort, but in some facilities — like precision manufacturing or biopharmaceuticals, data centers, things of that nature — it becomes a mission-critical area, not a nice-to-have. We can help reduce the amount of energy used by those facilities, extend their useful life, help them maintain their systems longer, and allow those businesses to be more competitive.

What’s your read on how the proposed Energy Star elimination is being discussed right now?

There’s a lot of hyperbole about Energy Star being eliminated — it’s a fait accompli. It is important to note that Energy Star is a line item identified in the statute by Congress for approval for funding. It seems pretty unrealistic, from a judicial standpoint, that it would be able to be eliminated before the end of this fiscal year.

I know that there are many, many representatives, both Republican and Democrats, who support Energy Star. We’ve had 35 years of bipartisan support, and it has been earmarked in congressional law many times, through multiple George H.W. and George W. Bush administrations. And there are a lot of lobbying efforts that I’m personally aware of within the commercial real estate industry and the manufacturing industry, where folks are reaching out and doing calls to action for the House and Senate Appropriations majority members — similar activities to what we did eight years ago when Energy Star was directly under fire.

It seems like such a strange thing for the administration to go after. It’s not like appliance manufacturers were clamoring for this, right?

It’s very vexing to me. I don’t get it. If the Trump administration wants to focus on affordability in American households, energy efficiency isn’t the thing to cut. I’m not sure if it’s getting caught up in the fact that it is in the Office of Atmospheric Pollution Prevention, or because at the Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Program, Biden launched the Better Climate Challenge. I don’t know if it’s because it had some ties to climate, but what’s ironic is that it didn’t start as a climate program. It began as an energy efficiency program, and it’s always been focused on businesses and the financial returns on investment — it helps us attract capital and debt for investment in real estate. It’s really disconnected.

Nixing transferability isn’t the bill’s most damaging blow to clean energy — new sourcing requirements for the tax credits and deadlines that block early-stage projects pose a bigger threat. But the ripple effects from the change would permeate all aspects of the clean energy economy. At a minimum, it would make energy more expensive by making the tax credits harder to monetize. It would also all but shut nuclear plants out of the subsidies altogether.

Prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, if renewable energy developers with low tax liability wanted to monetize existing tax credits, they had to seek partnerships with tax equity investors. The investor, usually a major bank, would provide upfront capital for a project in exchange for partial ownership and a claim to its tax benefits. These were complicated deals that involved extensive legal review and the formation of new limited liability corporations, and therefore weren’t a viable option for smaller projects like community solar farms.

When the 2022 climate law introduced transferability across all the clean energy tax credits, it simplified project finance and channeled new capital into the clean energy economy. Suddenly, developers for all kinds of clean energy projects could simply sell their tax credits for cash on the open market to anyone that wanted to buy them, without ceding any ownership. The tax credit marketplace Crux estimated that a total of $30 billion in transfers took place last year, only about 30% of which were traditional tax equity deals. In the past, tax equity transfers have topped out at around $20 billion per year.

Schneider Electric, which has long helped corporate clients make power purchase agreements, now facilitates tax credit transfers, as well. The company recently announced that it had closed 18 deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credit transfers since late 2023. The buyers were all new to the market — none had directly financed clean energy before the IRA, Erin Decker, the senior director of renewable energy and carbon advisory services, told me.

It turns out, buying clean energy tax credits is a win-win for brands with sustainability commitments, which can reduce their tax liability while also helping to reduce emissions. Some companies have even used the savings they got through the tax credits to fund decarbonization efforts within their own operations, Decker said.

By simplifying project finance, and creating more competition for tax credit sales, transferability also made developing renewable energy projects cheaper. Developers of wind and solar farms have been able to secure upwards of 95 cents on the dollar for transferred tax credits, compared to just 85 to 90 cents for tax equity transactions. The savings go directly to utility customers.

“State regulators require electric companies to pass the benefits of tax credits through to customers in the form of lower rates,” the Edison Electric Institute wrote in a policy brief on the provision. “If transferability were repealed, electric companies once again would rely on big banks to invest in tax equity transactions, ultimately reducing the value of the credit that flows directly through to customers.”

Many of the companies that can’t count on tax equity deals will still have other options under the GOP proposal. Tax-exempt entities, like rural electric cooperatives and community solar nonprofits, can use “elective pay,” another IRA innovation that allows them to claim the credits as a direct cash payment from the IRS. For-profit companies developing carbon capture and advanced manufacturing projects also have the option to use elective pay for the first five years they operate. All of this raises questions about whether axing transferability would furnish the government with meaningful savings to offset Trump’s tax cuts.

But the bigger danger for Trump would be his nuclear agenda. Prior to the IRA, low power prices meant that many nuclear operators couldn’t afford to extend the licenses on their existing plants, even ones that had many years of useful life left in them. The IRA created a new tax credit for existing nuclear plants that made it economical for operators to invest in keeping these online, and even helped bring some, like the Palisades plant in Michigan, back from the dead.

This wouldn’t have worked without transferability, Benton Arnett, the senior director of markets and policy at the Nuclear Energy Institute, told me. Going forward, finding a tax equity partner would be nearly impossible because of the unique rules governing nuclear plants. Federal regulations require that the owners of a nuclear power plant be listed on its license, so bringing on a new owner means doing a license amendment — a headache-inducing process that banks simply don’t want to take on. “We’ve had members reach out to tax equity groups in the past and there was very little interest,” Arnett said

While a few plant owners might have enough tax appetite to benefit from credits directly, most have depreciating assets on their books that greatly reduce their liability. “Without transferability, for many of our members, it’s very difficult for them to actually monetize those credits,” said Arnett. “In a way, nuclear is disproportionately impacted by removing that ability to transfer.”

In February, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright declared that “the long-awaited American nuclear renaissance must launch during President Trump’s administration.” But so far on Trump’s watch, between the proposed loss of transferability and early phase-out of nuclear tax credits, plus cuts to loan programs at the Department of Energy, we’ve only seen policies that would kill the nuclear renaissance.

The White House on Tuesday announced a $600 billion investment commitment from Saudi Arabia during President Trump’s trip to the Gulf. In exchange, the U.S. offered Riyadh “the largest defense cooperation agreement” Washington has ever made, with an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, Reuters reports. The deals announced so far by the White House total just $283 billion, although the administration told The New York Times that more would be forthcoming.

Among the known commitments in the health and tech sectors, the U.S. also reached a number of energy deals with Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company, Aramco, which agreed to a $3.4 billion expansion of the Motive refinery in Texas “to integrate chemicals production,” OilPrice.com reports. Aramco additionally signed “a memorandum of understanding with [the U.S. utility] Sempra to receive about 6.2 million tons per year of LNG.” (Aramco is responsible for over 4% of the planet’s CO2 emissions, according to the think tank InfluenceMap, and would be the fourth largest polluter after China, the U.S., and India, if it were its own country.) Additionally, Saudi company DataVolt committed to invest $20 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the U.S.

2. Senate Republicans push back on House GOP plan to gut energy tax credits

Senate Republicans are reportedly putting the brakes on the House Ways and Means Committee’s proposal to overhaul the nation’s clean energy tax credits and effectively kill the Inflation Reduction Act. “[S]ome Senate Republicans say abruptly cutting off credits and changing key provisions that help fund projects more quickly could stifle investments in energy technologies needed to meet growing power demand, and lead to job losses for manufacturing and electricity projects in their states and districts,” Politico reports. North Dakota’s Republican Senator John Hoeven, for one, characterized the Ways and Means’ plan as a “starting point,” with “some change” expected before agreement is reached.

As my colleague Emily Pontecorvo reported earlier this week, the House proposal “appears to amount to a back-door full repeal” of the IRA, including cutting the EV tax credit, moving up the phase-out of tech-neutral clean power, and eliminating credits for energy efficiency, heat pumps, and solar. But as she noted then, “there’s a lot that could change before we get to a final budget” — especially if Republican senators follow through on their words.

3. Interior Department to fast-track uranium mine permit in Utah

The Interior Department plans to expedite permitting for a uranium mine in Utah, conducting an environmental assessment that typically takes a year in just 14 days, The New York Times reports. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the fast-track addressed the “alarming energy emergency because of the prior administration’s Climate Extremist policies.” Notably, Burgum also recently issued a stop-work order on Equinor’s fully permitted Empire Wind offshore wind project, claiming the project’s permitting process had been rushed under former President Joe Biden. That process took nearly four years, according to BloomberNEF.

Critics of the Velvet-Wood project in San Juan County, Utah, said the Interior Department is leaving no opportunity for public comment, and that there are concerns about radioactive waste from the mining activities. Uranium is a fuel in nuclear power plants, and its extraction falls under President Trump’s recent executive order to address the so-called “national energy emergency.”

4. Clean Investment Monitor report paints mixed picture for Q1

Clean energy investment saw a second quarterly decline at the start of 2025, but nevertheless accounted for 4.7% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods in the first quarter of the year, a new report by the Rhodium Group’s Clean Investment Monitor found. Among some of its other notable findings:

New industrial decarbonization announcements dropped to $79 million, compared to $16 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

Consumer purchases of EVs declined 11.5% from the previous quarter — a slump driven mainly by a 21% decline in sales by Tesla.

Retail investment in electricity generation and storage, however, increased by 57.4%, and heat pumps by 4.2%.

Texas leads states for jobs created by facilities that have come online since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, with 13,000, followed by Georgia with 12,500.

5. Dutch environmental group sues to stop Shell from investing in new oil and gas fields

A Dutch environmental group is suing oil giant Shell, arguing that the company is in violation of a court order to make an “appropriate contribution” to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, France 24 reports. Amsterdam-based Milieudefensie previously won an historic precedent against Royal Dutch Shell in 2021, with the court ruling the company had to cut its carbon emissions by 45% of 2019 levels by 2030 because its investments in oil and gas were “endangering human rights and lives.” Shell appealed the decision, moved its headquarters to London, and dropped “Royal Dutch” from its name; subsequently, a Dutch appeals court sided with Shell and reversed the 45% emissions reduction target, while still insisting the company had a responsibility to lower its emissions, Inside Climate News reports.

Now, Milieudefensie is suing, claiming Shell is in breach of its obligation to reduce emissions due to its “continued investment in new oil and gas fields and its inadequate climate policy for the period 2030 to 2050.” Sjoukje van Oosterhout, a lead researcher on the Shell case for Milieudefensie, said in a press conference, “The impact of this case could really be enormous. Science is clear, crystal clear, and the ruling of the appeals court was also clear. Every new field is one too many. That’s why we have this case today.”

AstraZeneca

UK regulators this week approved the use of AstraZeneca’s new medical inhaler, which uses a propellant with 99.9% lower global warming potential than those currently in use. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the discharge and leakage of planet-warming hydrofluoroalkane propellants from inhalers was responsible for 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents in 2020, or about the same emissions as 550,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTg2MTI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDA5NDI5MH0.QKEQVpFhKz3ec12g71fN7OW88qvSnENz63BUPb0H_II/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-15 22:08:19.580164

Equipped with standard All-Wheel Drive with X-MODE®, the bZ Woodland will have a highly capable combined system net output of 375 horsepower with a manufacturer-estimated all electric driving range rating of up-to 260 miles. It also brings additional midsize SUV utility, with 8.3-inches of ground clearance, 3,500-pound towing capacity, and available All Terrain tires.

“With zero emissions and a powerful drive, the bZ Woodland is bringing outdoor-inspired style to our BEV lineup,” said Dave Christ, president, Toyota Group. “This latest entry in our bZ line embraces the spirit of adventure with surprising capability, rugged style, and an all-electric powertrain that’s backed by Toyota.”

The 2026 bZ Woodland adds a different twist to its bZ sibling’s signature style. It takes the Toyota hammerhead front end with full-width LED’s and adds wide, black overfenders for a powerful stance. It also has a slightly different vehicle profile due to nearly 6-inches of additional length and just under 1-inch of additional height in the rear, giving it more than 30-cubic feet of rear cargo space. Its standard roof rails are also a different feature, giving it even more utility for accessories like luggage or bicycle racks. For the finishing touch, bZ Woodland-unique 18-inch aluminum wheels with removable covers give it a modern-yet-rugged feel, and All Terrain tires are available for drivers that want to take on rough roads.

The bZ Woodland is the third BEV recently announced by Toyota. It joins the refreshed bZ small SUV and the all-new C-HR compact crossover, bringing the total number of electrified models in the Toyota lineup to 21 vehicles in a choice of BEV, Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid, and Fuel Cell (CA and Hawaii only) powertrains.

The 2026 bZ Woodland will be available in a single, well-equipped grade. A Premium Package with JBL Premium Audio, a fixed glass panoramic roof, digital rearview mirror, ventilated front seats and memory driver seat/side view mirrors, and optional All-Terrain tires will also be available. Exterior paint options also capture its outdoor spirit, with colors that will include the all-new Stepping Stone, along with Halo, Steel, Pavement, Raven Black, and Trueno Blue. Models are expected to arrive in early 2026.

*Ranges and charging times will vary depending on weather and other factors.

Intuitive, Focused Driving with Off-Road Performance

The bZ Woodland comes equipped with standard AWD with electric motors housed in the front and rear eAxles. Thanks to this system, it will have an impressive towing capability of 3,500 pounds. It will also have the X-MODE system, a function that allows the driver to operate a switch to select a mode according to the road conditions, automatically changing to optimize brake control and power delivery at the wheels for enhanced control and traction.

Another feature of the AWD X-MODE system is Grip-Control. When activated and used at low speeds, the system leverages motor drive power modulation to achieve capable off-road performance. This feature was developed as an added function to react to road surface characteristics and maintain a constant speed to prevent slipping on rough roads.

Its AWD prowess combines with the smooth, yet exhilarating, driving performance inherent in an all-electric vehicle. Its powerful drive is complemented by a low center of gravity, thanks to its battery pack placed flat under the floor. A battery cross-framing structure also adds to overall vehicle rigidity for stable handling.

Charging Up the Woodland

The 2026 Toyota bZ Woodland will have a lithium-Ion battery with a total capacity of 74.7-kWh. It will have a North American Charging System (NACS) port that is compatible with Level Three DC fast-charging, giving it access thousands of DC charging stations nationwide. Under ideal conditions when using DC fast charging it is capable of charging from 10% to 80% battery capacity in around 30 minutes*.

A pre-conditioning function is also equipped. This system is designed to bring the battery to an optimal temperature for DC fast charging, which can enable faster charging in colder climates. This function can be activated manually or automatically by setting the navigation system destination to a fast-charging station.

The Toyota bZ Woodland will also have Plug & Charge capability, an industry standard protocol that allows automatic identification, authentication and authorization at selected charging networks, reducing the need for multiple mobile charging applications.

For added charging flexibility, it will also be capable of Level One and Level Two AC charging and have an 11-kW on-board AC charger. The 2026 bZ Woodland will also have steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters to activate and adjust regenerative braking. These paddles turn the system on and dial the regenerative braking force up or down based on driver preference to capture additional energy and transfer it to the battery.

Woodland by Design

Thanks to its BEV-dedicated e-TNGA platform, the spacious cabin provides ample room for passengers. A precision-placed Multi Information Display screen expands the vehicle’s feeling of space and displays key information like speed, estimated vehicle range, and charging status. For entertainment and connectivity, a 14-inch touchscreen equipped with the Toyota Audio Multimedia system is standard.

The bZ Woodland will have standard SofTex®-trimmed seats that are heated for the driver and front passenger, with power adjustability for the driver. Interior seating colors stay with the bZ Woodland’s outdoor motif and include Stone Brown and Black.

Upgrading to the bZ Woodland Premium package adds a JBL Premium Audio system, panoramic roof, ventilated front seats, and front radiant heater. Keeping devices charged up is easy, thanks to a dual wireless Qi charger in the front, and four conveniently located USB Type-C charging ports throughout the cabin. Passengers can relax with abundant legroom for front and rear seats as well as ample side-to-side space in the rear.

The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill Wednesday morning — after a full night of debate — that would scrap consumer credits for electric vehicle purchases and hydrogen fuel development, among other provisions. The rollbacks would help pay for an extension of the 2017 tax cuts and some of President Donald Trump’s other campaign promises.

Now, companies and moderate Republicans — who have been lobbying for months to save at least some Inflation Reduction Act benefits — are urging changes before the measure gets closer to becoming law. GOP leaders want a broad tax, energy and security package ready for Trump’s signature by July.

“We appreciate the Ways and Means Committee putting America first by investing in American energy dominance, but the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families,” said a group of Republicans in a statement Wednesday. “We urge the Committee to consider these important changes in this critical part of our One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Led by Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), the Republicans said the tax bill included some “reasonable phase-out schedules” but that changes would ensure “certainty for current and future energy investments to meet the nation’s growing power demand and protect our constituents from higher energy costs.”

Specifically, their three suggestions include revising a foreign entity of concern provision to give companies more time to reorganize their supply chains, tweaking standards for when companies qualify for credits and keeping the practice of “transferability” through 2031, when certain incentives would sunset. Transferability allows project sponsors to transfer credits to a third party to reduce their tax burden.

It’s unclear how seriously Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) and Speaker Mike Johnson will take the demands. Both are currently trying to appease a group of lawmakers balking at provisions concerning state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) has been helping lead the charge on the SALT issue, but has also expressed concern about the fate of climate law provisions. A problem is that increasing SALT deducations would mean less money available for other asks.

“There are a lot of ingredients in the One Big, Beautiful Bill,” LaLota said when asked about the situation. “The energy tax credits are important to many members like me.”

Other Republicans who signed the new statement included Andrew Garbarino of New York, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio, Young Kim of California, Mike Lawler of New York, Dan Newhouse of Washington and David Valadao of California.

Cuts ‘unworkable’

The House Budget Committee is scheduled to vote Friday on legislation combining the work of all committees participating in crafting the Republican’s budget reconciliation megabill. It could hit the floor next week.

But not only are House leaders open to amending the broader package before it hits the floor, but the Senate will then have its say.

Like the 12 lawmakers, clean energy developers and their lobbyists were pushing the same three points in a last-ditch push to reverse IRA tax credit cuts.

Prominent solar energy industry officials told reporters prior to meetings with 21 congressional offices in the House and Senate on Wednesday that the IRA cuts were “unworkable” in their current form.

“We have come to give these CEOs expertise on why that opening salvo is sort of unworkable from a financial and business perspective,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, head of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

That reflects a firm belief from the solar industry that the Ways and Means text is only a starting point for negotiations and that Republicans who generally support of tax credits will come to the rescue.

“I think a number of Republicans have significant insight into how our companies are working, and why certainty really matters for us,” Hopper said. “There’s absolutely people in that room that understand the problems we have with it.”

Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), who sits on Ways and Means, said he was meeting with energy advocates. And although he voted for the proposal, Buchanan suggested he understood the pleas of businesses who “do keep our energy costs down.”

“I think obviously they’d like to get more done,” he said. “But we got some things done. I think we’re in the first quarter.”

He added: “I told them, look, we still got the Senate. They are going to make changes. We’re not done till we’re done.”

Indeed, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of four Senate Republicans who expressed interest in keeping some clean energy tax credits, said he expects to make significant changes to the House’s proposed cuts.

“I don’t think there are any [IRA cuts], or I can’t think of many, that we would take just word-for-word, as is, but it’s a good foundation to build on,” Tillis said.

Another Ways and Means member, Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) thought the panel’s text struck a fair balance that’s illustrative of where the House conference is on the whole. Many conservatives are demanding a full IRA repeal.

“I don’t know how we do anything different than what we just did,” he said. “I could be blindsided but I think we found a nice sweet spot.”

Members of the solar industry were particularly disturbed by strict foreign entity of concern restrictions slapped on carbon neutral and manufacturing credits. The restrictions would apply to mineral supply chains dominated by China.

“This is complete death,” said Sandhya Ganapathy, CEO of EDP Renewables North America. “If a project doesn’t qualify because it uses any equipment, which includes subcomponents and minerals, that have been extracted or processed in any part of the world, then that is the death of a credit right there.”

Members of the solar and geothermal industries brought up significant concerns with language that would phase out IRA credits depending on when the projects “are placed in service,” rather than when they start construction.

Fifty members of the geothermal industry met with over 110 congressional offices this week to advocate adjustments to the sunset language, among other priorities.

Electric vehicles

Hit hardest by the GOP tax proposal was the electric vehicle industry. Lobbyists have also been telling lawmakers that cutting the EV consumer tax credit could upend the future of the U.S. auto industry.

“That future demand for EVs around the world is going to be served by somebody, but if this bill passes as drafted it’s not going to be served by the U.S.,” said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association.

The Inflation Reduction Act set some limits on the amount of foreign-made battery components and foreign-sourced minerals like lithium and graphite to address supply chain concerns. Since the law took effect, companies have announced hundreds of billions to build and develop mines, refining plants, battery factories and other facilities.

“Batteries are going to be an enormous part of the global economy from now on,” Gore said. “This is an inflection point where the U.S. needs to figure out if it wants to participate.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/48/3b/5aa5a60f4cc7bba1092c21148cfc/marianette-miller-meeks-pen-and-pad-53731.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 22:07:43.454706

Sixteen states and Washington, D.C., are suing President Donald Trump’s administration for illegally withholding billions of dollars’ worth of funds allocated to them for building electric vehicle (EV) chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced on May 7.

The lawsuit, which stems from Trump’s pause on National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program fund allocations, challenges the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) authority to halt the funding. They argue that Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.

""President Trump has unleashed an attack on an increasingly popular consumer choice—the electric vehicle,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in the lawsuit.

The 16 states include Washington, Colorado, California, Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C. It is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington.

The lawsuit also highlights disruptions caused by the suspension, such as delays in infrastructure builds and financial setbacks for contractors and state agencies.

""Clean energy is not just smart for the environment; it creates new jobs for Marylanders and strengthens our economy,"" said Maryland Gov. Wes Moore in the lawsuit.

It’s also provided monetary motivation for businesses like convenience-stores to install EV chargers.

“There's not really a business model there to make a large investment without grant funding because it's a large capital investment, and the business volume is just not there right now,” Tom Healy, vice president of facilities development and maintenance at Nouria told CSP in March.

Upon inauguration, Trump paused federal funding of many programs and revoked the electric vehicle EV mandate. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has frozen the NEVI Program.

A letter from DOT on Feb. 6 stated it is rescinding the current NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA is updating it to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities. FHWA aims to publish the new draft in the spring.

The rescinding means an immediate suspension on the approval of all state electric vehicle infrastructure deployment plans for all fiscal years. No new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new state plans are submitted and approved, the letter said.

Former President Biden put a mandate into place in 2021 that aimed for 50% of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be electric, plug-in hybrid or hydrogen-powered by 2030; stricter fuel economy standards for automakers; EV tax credits for consumers; grants to grow the EV charging network across the country; and domestic manufacturing of EV infrastructure.

In a separate but related initiative in 2021, the Biden administration also signed the NEVI program into law, which was launched by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) through its Federal Highway Administration as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). It includes $5 billion worth of grants to the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico to support the installation of EV charging infrastructure, with multiple rounds of funding from 2022 to 2026.

The DOT must approve the state requests before the grants are funded, but with two years left of the five-year plan, states are at different degrees of approval.

The bZ Woodland shares its adventurous spirit with the mechanically similar Subaru Trailseeker, including its 8.3-inch ground clearance, 3500-pound towing capacity, and available all-terrain tires. This is a Toyota EV that can venture off the beaten path, but we'd stop short of making plans to take it overlanding.

What's New for 2026?

The bZ Woodland is a new addition to the Toyota EV lineup for 2026 and is closely related to the Subaru Trailseeker. Toyota says it will go on sale in early 2026.

Pricing and Which One to Buy

The price of the 2026 Toyota bZ Woodland is expected to start around $50,000.

bZ Woodland

$50,000 (est)

Toyota hasn't released pricing for the bZ Woodland yet, but we know it will come in a single trim with an optional Premium package. The Premium package adds a premium JBL stereo, a fixed-glass roof, a digital rear-view mirror, and ventilated front seats with memory settings for the driver. When we find out more information about the bZ Woodland's features and pricing, we'll update this story with a recommendation on which one is the best buy.

EV Motor, Power, and Performance

All bZ Woodlands come with a dual-motor electric powertrain with 375 horsepower. All-wheel drive is standard, and a driver-selectable terrain system provides different modes for on- and off-road driving. The suspension provides 8.3 inches of ground clearance and all-terrain tires are available. Both should help when encountering obstacles on the trail, but if you're hoping to go as far afield as a 4Runner or a Land Cruiser, you're likely to be disappointed. When we get a chance to test drive the bZ Woodland for ourselves, we'll update this story with driving impressions and instrumented test results.

Towing and Payload Capacity

Toyota says the bZ Woodland can tow up to 3500 pounds. That is more than you can pull with the Honda Prologue or the Jeep Wagoneer S.

Range, Charging, and Battery Life

With a range estimate of up to 260 miles per charge, according to Toyota, the bZ Woodland isn't setting any long-distance records. Luckily, all models come with a NACS charging port, which will make it easy to access charging via the Tesla Supercharger network. Toyota says that the battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in as little as 30 minutes under ideal conditions.

Interior, Comfort, and Cargo

The dashboard and front seat area of the bZ Woodland appear to be copied verbatim from the smaller bZ SUV, but there's more room in the back seat and the cargo area in the Woodland. Heated front seats are standard, and all models come with faux-leather upholstery. The optional Premium package adds a host of desirable goodies, including ventilated front seats, two smartphone charging pads, more USB-C charging ports, and a panoramic glass roof.

Infotainment and Connectivity

A 14.0-inch infotainment touchscreen stands upright in the middle of the bZ Woodland's dashboard. It runs the brand's latest software interface which we have found intuitive and responsive in other Toyotas. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard, as is SiriusXM satellite radio, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and in-dash navigation. A six-speaker stereo is standard, but a nine-speaker setup tuned by JBL is optional.

Safety and Driver-Assistance Features

Toyota equips all of its models with a generous standard package of driver-assists, and the bZ Woodland is no different. Buyers of the bZ Woodland will find desirable features such as lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control are standard. For more information about the bZ Woodland's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:

Standard automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection

Standard lane departure warning with lane-keeping assist

Standard adaptive cruise control

Warranty and Maintenance Coverage

Toyota matches what its competitors offer, but it provides above-average coverage when it comes to complimentary maintenance. Likewise, its electrical component warranty is at industry-standard levels.

Limited warranty covers three years or 36,000 miles

Powertrain warranty covers five years or 60,000 miles

Electrical components are covered for eight years or 100,000 miles

Complimentary maintenance is covered for two years or 25,000 miles

“No one anywhere, in any part of the economy, has ever had to understand their supply chains to the degree of specificity that this bill applies to clean energy companies and manufacturers,” said Kristina Costa, a former Biden administration clean energy adviser.
She played a lead role in managing interagency implementation of the tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Most utility-scale energy projects take longer than one year to begin construction.
Energy industry analysts, energy project developers, and major manufacturers of gas turbines agree that renewables and batteries are the only additional energy projects that will be able to get built over the coming years.","Tucked into the House Republicans’ 389-page tax bill released on Monday is a poison pill for U.S. clean energy developers and manufacturers, one that energy and tax policy experts say would essentially repeal the hundreds of billions of dollars of tax credits now flowing to energy projects and solar, battery, and EV factories across the country.

The provision at issue prohibits tax credits for any project associated with ​“foreign entities of concern,” a category that includes companies and individuals linked to China as well as any ​“material assistance” from Chinese companies, their subsidiaries, or even non-Chinese companies that happen to have executives who are Chinese citizens. Its scope is so sweeping, and China’s dominance of clean-energy supply chains so vast, that virtually all clean power projects or factories being built today could be implicated.

If passed into law, this piece of the House Ways and Means Committee proposal would undermine investor confidence in financing the buildout of new clean-energy projects and factories, experts say. It could also erode the tax-credit eligibility of solar, wind, battery, geothermal, nuclear, and other zero-carbon energy developments under construction, and the eligibility of factories that are already online and churning out batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy products.

Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, firms have invested $321 billion in domestic clean energy projects, per Clean Investment Monitor data released Tuesday. The private sector has pledged to spend another $522 billion. The majority of this money has flown or will flow to GOP-led congressional districts, but the bill introduced by House Republicans would seriously disrupt these economic gains.

“No one anywhere, in any part of the economy, has ever had to understand their supply chains to the degree of specificity that this bill applies to clean energy companies and manufacturers,” said Kristina Costa, a former Biden administration clean energy adviser. ​“It’s going to grind everything to a standstill.”

The budget proposal faces a long road to becoming legislation. Several Senate Republicans and more than a dozen House Republicans have pushed back on the text as written and signaled changes would be needed to gain their support — including a revision to the foreign entity of concern language. Nearly two dozen House Republicans, many of whom are from districts benefiting heavily from the IRA, sent a letter in March opposing deep cuts to the law’s tax credits.

Still, such a harmful policy idea being introduced in Congress is an unwelcome development for a clean energy industry that’s already dealing with a slowdown thanks to the Trump administration’s chaotic tariff policies and slashing of federal agency spending and staffing.

The finer points of foreign entities of concern

Costa, who served as deputy for clean energy innovation and implementation under former White House climate adviser John Podesta, knows her tax policy. She played a lead role in managing interagency implementation of the tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act.

A handful of those IRA credits already include foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, she noted, namely those limiting tax credits for EVs with batteries or materials and minerals from Chinese companies or sources. But those restrictions were designed to incentivize EV manufacturers to build up a domestic battery industry, and they applied to a relatively small number of automakers with sophisticated supply chain management capabilities, she said.

Even those narrowly scoped rules were tricky to enforce. ​“It took us 18 months to do FEOC guidance for this one provision,” she said. ​“And you’re only talking about one kind of product — a battery that goes into an electric vehicle. It’s not applying to every nut, bolt, and wire.”

The FEOC strictures in Monday’s bill from House Republicans, by contrast, bar tax credits for any project that receives ​“material assistance“ in the form of ​“any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral” that is ​“extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity.” They also apply to products produced under ​“any copyright or patent” or ​“any know-how or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity.”

That could apply to ​“hundreds of components that go into a clean energy project, or every single thing that goes into a hydropower or geothermal facility,” Costa said. Nor does the bill define its terms, such as ​“what a component or subcomponent would mean,” she said. ​“That’s all up to Treasury to define.”

Such guidance would take years to finalize, she said, by which time most of the tax credits in question would be set to expire under the accelerated phaseout structures also proposed in the bill.

Until those definitions come out, ​“the way the tax code works is that it’s on the taxpayer to substantiate compliance, particularly in the absence of Treasury or IRS guidance,” Costa said. ​“And they’re not going to know how to comply with this.”

Even if project developers felt they could figure out compliance, they’d have a difficult time convincing a bank to finance a project that lacks certainty about crucial financial incentives.

Ted Lee, a former Biden administration Treasury official who was also deeply involved in implementation of tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, agreed with Costa’s assessment.

“This is essentially a backdoor repeal that won’t address our actual national security concerns and supply chain vulnerabilities,” he said. ​“It’s going to immediately freeze investment,” by creating ​“an impossible burden of proof, even if taxpayers do their very best to comply.”

For the ​“tech-neutral” 45Y and 48E tax credits, which are available to all forms of carbon-free energy, the bill’s strict FEOC requirements would go into effect one year after the enactment of the law, Lee said. That would make it difficult for projects not already underway to act fast and claim the credits before the restrictions set in. Most utility-scale energy projects take longer than one year to begin construction.

That risk would be heightened by a proposal in the House Ways and Means bill that would shift the milestones for these projects to be eligible to claim investment and energy production tax credits, Lee noted. Today, projects can claim the credit and secure financing based on when they begin construction. But under the proposed change, they would have to secure investors based on when they can achieve ​“placed in service” status — that is, get plugged into the grid and be delivering power.

The time lag between starting construction and being placed in service can stretch into years, putting more projects at risk of missing the deadline to avoid the FEOC rules that would undermine the tax credits they relied on to begin construction in the first place.

“Any project that’s not really close to breaking ground, it’s not going to happen,” Lee said. ​“Virtually all of those projects could get killed.”

A different set of risks faces the 45X tax credit, the cornerstone of the huge surge in domestic factories for solar panels, batteries, critical minerals, and other clean energy materials. The manufacturers receiving this incentive have locked down financing for their facilities under the assumption that they’ll be able to earn the per-unit tax credits provided by 45X for their products for years to come.

But under the House bill’s FEOC restrictions, which Lee said would kick in two years after the law is enacted for 45X, recipients could see their tax credits challenged on the grounds that their operations include some form of restricted ​“material assistance.”

“‘Material assistance’ is a misnomer. This would really require you to look up every level of the supply chain,” Lee said. ​“It’s death by red tape. You will never know for certain if you’re in compliance, so you will never be able to confidently claim the credit, and your investors will never feel comfortable with you claiming the credit, because they can never know if it will be clawed back by the IRS.”

The combined effects will be to choke off investment in new electricity generation capacity that the U.S. desperately needs to meet growing demand for power, while simultaneously undermining efforts to build up a domestic supply chain for industries now dominated by China, said Harry Godfrey, head of the federal investment and manufacturing working group of trade organization Advanced Energy United.

“The industry has shown over the past couple of years that there’s a real dedication to making as much of this content as possible in America, all the way down the supply chain,” he said.

But the FEOC rules in the bill are ​“fundamentally unworkable,” he said. ​“What you will get as a result of this is not just folks who fall out of compliance, but folks who look at it and say, ​‘I don’t want to approach it for the downside risk of unwittingly falling out of compliance, given the complexity of it.’ It just serves to chill investment.”

An economic and climate wrecking ball

The combination of FEOC restrictions, accelerated cutoffs for claiming tax credits, and other changes proposed by the House Ways and Means bill — including ending tax-credit transferability rules that have expanded investment in clean energy — will equate to a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, according to a Tuesday report from research firm Rhodium Group.

In December, the firm modeled the effect of a full repeal, and the results were stark.

Doing away with the climate law would raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, ​“stifle energy technology innovation,” increase greenhouse gas emissions — and potentially put ​“half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk,” Rhodium researchers wrote in this week’s report.

In fact, the profound uncertainty introduced by the FEOC restrictions could do more harm than simply putting tax credits out of reach of future projects, said Ben King, an associate director at Rhodium Group. The firm’s December forecasts presumed that already-announced projects set for completion in the next two years or so would get built.

But the FEOC rules are so aggressive they ​“may bring to a screeching halt what’s already been announced,” King said.

That would not only result in lost investment dollars and jobs but also make it harder for utilities nationwide to meet surging power demand.

Energy industry analysts, energy project developers, and major manufacturers of gas turbines agree that renewables and batteries are the only additional energy projects that will be able to get built over the coming years. Manufacturing capacity for new gas turbines is maxed out with orders from projects that are already on the books.

“For the next five years or so, the only thing you can build that’s not already contracted is wind, solar, and batteries,” King said. ​“Certainly there are places where wind and solar pencil out independent of the tax credit. Even in our modeling, with full repeal, you still see hundreds of gigawatts of wind, solar, and batteries. But that level of growth is neither sufficient for meeting the near-term demand growth we’re seeing on the grid, or for the energy transition that folks still may be thinking about.”

Advanced geothermal and nuclear power plants, which have greater support from the Trump administration and Republicans but which are further out in terms of readiness to be built at large scale, may also be threatened. These zero-carbon energy resources are eligible alongside solar and wind power for the ​“technology-neutral” 45Y and 48E tax credits, which replaced longstanding technology-specific tax credits at the start of this year and which are subject to some of the stricter FEOC restrictions proposed in the tax bill, Lee said.

“Given the difficulty of even building a geothermal plant without using a single Chinese-made part, I feel like FEOC criteria this strict are essentially just repealing the 45Y/48E credits in full,” Seaver Wang, director of climate and energy at The Breakthrough Institute, a think tank that supports nuclear and geothermal power, wrote in a Monday X post.

“This is of course just the opening salvo for negotiations,” Wang wrote on X. ​“I can already imagine these Foreign Entity of Concern rules will rightly get a lot of pushback. Hard to see how they could even be effectively enforced.”

The Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) introduced the Ohmio shuttle buses on Monday, marking a significant step toward the city's goal of becoming a hub for vehicle manufacturing, akin to Detroit.

The electric shuttles, which operate on pre-designated routes at a maximum speed of 25 mph, are part of a two-year pilot program approved by the Riverside City Council. The program is a collaboration between the city, the RTA, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and Ohmio, which has relocated its headquarters from New Zealand to Riverside. The move is expected to boost local employment and generate substantial sales tax revenue for the city.

Riverside Mayor Lock Dawson expressed ambition for the city to become a leader in vehicle manufacturing for the 21st century. ""Riverside is it, we are going to do this for the 21st century,"" she said.

The shuttles are designed to operate on low-speed roads, with initial routes including the Riverside Municipal Airport, downtown Riverside, and the University of California, Riverside. The buses are equipped with sensors to detect their surroundings and can be manually overridden by a human attendant if necessary. The deployment of these shuttles is expected to improve air quality by reducing the number of cars on the road.

Ohmio plans to produce between 500 and 750 buses over the next five years, generating over $2 million in sales tax for Riverside. The project is also expected to create 25 local jobs within three years. The city and its partners have invested $2.5 million in the initiative, with the expectation that the investment will be recouped through sales tax revenue.

The introduction of the self-driving shuttles is part of Riverside's broader strategy to develop its clean tech and advanced manufacturing sectors. As the program progresses, officials hope to expand the service to more routes and increase the speed of the shuttles.","https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/68263d586a6e0a497335d8ff?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)",N,,2025-05-15 21:06:43.058169

Crain’s Detroit Business had the news first, citing a memo from Ram’s parent company, Stellantis, to suppliers. The company later confirmed the news, Crain’s says.

This marks the second time Ram has pushed out the release date for the truck. The company had originally planned the REV as a 2025 model. A December announcement delayed it into the 2026 model year.

About the Ram REV

Ram previewed its electric truck all the way back in 2023. At the time, the company promised 500 miles of range and 14,000 pounds of towing capacity. The company later revised its plan, targeting just 350 miles of range.

The truck is full of storage, including bed-side lockers and a sizeable frunk (front trunk). However, ideas from a more radical concept, like a fold-down midgate that lets you carry long items partially in the cab, were cut from the final design.

Demand for Electric Trucks Has Proven Modest

Why another delay? Crain’s explains, “the automaker’s slower and more flexible approach to EV manufacturing reduces exposure, as compared to competitors Ford Motor and General Motors, which both dedicated entire factories solely to electric pickups with high volume expectations that haven’t panned out.”

GM’s Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV are thoroughly impressive trucks on paper, with the Silverado boasting up to 492 miles of range. Ford’s F-150 Lightning is essentially a gas-free version of America’s best-selling vehicle. Yet none of the three have sold as well as automakers expected.

No company has struggled with electric truck demand as much as Tesla, which invested heavily in construction of its distinctive Cybertruck only to see demand last a short time. Tesla is now sitting on a large volume of unsold Cybertrucks.

Ram Has Another Electrified Pickup

Ram, however, is developing a second, partially electric truck. It can hedge its bets by sending EV-curious buyers to that one instead.

The 2025 Ramcharger will have an electric-only range of about 145 miles and an onboard engine that serves as a generator to extend the range indefinitely. This allows truck buyers to use electricity for most of their daily driving needs, but gasoline on trips over 145 miles.

It’s not a pure plug-in hybrid because its V6 engine isn’t connected to the wheels, serving only as a generator. But that approach makes it mechanically simple (read: potentially more reliable) and gives it the higher towing power of an EV without the range limitations.",https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2025-ram-1500-rev-blue-front-3qtr.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 21:06:47.087089

State, North Carolina Health and Human Services, and the North Carolina Conservation Network was underscored Wednesday by a release from the Environmental Protection Agency intending to rescind regulations.

On May 14, the EPA declared its intent to rescind and reevaluate regulations on certain PFAS including PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and GenX — all of which have been found in the Cape Fear River since 2017. In the announcement, the EPA also said it would extend utility companies’ timeline to meet maximum containment level (MCL) PFAS/PFOS from 2029 to 2031, meaning water utilities have two additional years to lower the levels of these specific compounds.

The announcement is a change in direction from when the Biden Administration had previously finalized the first-ever national drinking water standards for PFAS in April of 2024. The 2024 decision set legally enforceable limits to ensure PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS and GenX chemicals were regulated and removed from public water supplies.

As a result of the Trump administration’s review of these rules, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency will uphold the current National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for only PFOA and PFOS, which set limits for these chemicals in drinking water nationwide. The limits are the same as proposed in 2024 at 4 ppt.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Zeldin said in the release. “This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants.”

While the direct manufacturing of PFOA and PFOS was phased out in the U.S. in the mid 2000’s, they are still present in the environment due to their persistence as “forever chemicals.” Other PFAS, including GenX, are still being manufactured today in North Carolina by Chemours in Fayetteville and continue to be found in the Cape Fear River.

The EPA press office indicated the agency has yet to determine a timeline for when regulations on PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and GenX would be rescinded or revaluated. The EPA did not answer PCD upon asking why these specific PFAS were targeted.

Panelist Stephanie Schweickert, director of environmental health campaigns for North Carolina Conservation Network, was at the Clean Cape Fear community meeting held May 14 in Oak Island. She said the EPA removing certain PFAS regulations could be in violation of the law.

“I do want to say not to lose hope, because our view is the EPA’s move was illegal and that it won’t stand,” Schweickert said. “The standards set were based on good science and we think they will hold up.”

The EPA has the authority to regulate PFAS in public drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.Schweickert said legal challenges could be made in regards to the legislation’s “anti-rollback” provision, which aims to prevent the weakening of existing drinking water standards, ensuring that any revisions maintain or enhance the protection of public health.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear said. “It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses. This is a clear victory for the trillion-dollar chemical industry — not public health.”

While the EPA signals a potential retreat from stricter PFAS regulations, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority has moved in the opposite direction, implementing proactive measures to ensure compliance with federal standards.

In October of 2022, CFPUA installed granular activated carbon filters at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant which supplies about 80% of the water for New Hanover County. GAC filters are highly effective at removing PFAS like GenX to at or near undetectable levels. According to latest testing results from the CFPUA, GenX in treated water has remained in compliance below 10 ppt since August of 2022.

Clean Cape Fear co-founder Emily Donovan said at Wednesday’s meeting an invitation to attend had been extended to Brunswick County Public Utilities, which they declined. According to previous PCD reporting, Brunswick County has faced criticism for their approach to PFAS contamination in drinking water, particularly on their slow pace to implement effective water treatment technology.

BCPU is in the process of expanding their Northwest Water Treatment Plant to include a reverse osmosis treatment facility, which will filter pollutants like PFAS out of the water. The $168 million project has faced multiple delays pushing the completion date until June 2025.

Southport residents like Bob Fulton aren’t confident the reverse osmosis treatment facility will guarantee clean water for all Brunswick residents.

“It should solve most of the problem of taking certain contaminants out of our water,” Fulton said at the meeting. “That’s going to serve all of Brunswick County except for those who are served by the Highway 211 Plant.”

A map on the BCPU webpage shows residents living in St. James, Southport and Oak Island will receive a mix of water from the Northwest Water Treatment Plant and the Highway 211 Plant, which sources water from untreated underground wells. PCD reached out to BCPU on how it is ensuring all Brunswick residents receive clean water, particularly those served by the Highway 211 Plant, and for its reaction to the EPA’s release — an answer was not received by press.

A catalyst for regulation, researchers from N.C. State University have been studying GenX and PFAS in human blood in the Cape Fear region since 2017. Led by Dr. Jane Hoppin, findings include Chemours-specific PFAS, elevated levels of legacy PFAS, and a potential link to high cholesterol. Hoppin stated while the EPA’s plan to weaken regulations might not directly impact their research, it does pose a threat to the health of people living in the Cape Fear region.

“These rules were promulgated based on the best science at the time and that hasn’t changed since October,” Hoppin said. “These standards were set to be health protective, so removing these standards would fail to protect the over 150 million US residents who are exposed to PFAS over these limits in their drinking water.”

Panelist Dr. Virginia Guidry, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services branch head of Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology, informed the crowd at Wednesday’s meeting of various PFAS health concerns, including:

Changes to liver enzymes

Decreased vaccine response in children

High blood pressure and preeclampsia in pregnant women

Decreased infant birth weight

Increased risk of kidney, testicular, breast, and other cancers

Jeffrey Enders, senior research scholar at N.C. State and panelist, revealed findings showing high concentrations of PFAS in sea foam, as previously detailed by PCD. He explained chemical companies can change their chemical compounds after knowing researchers like him are looking for those specific compounds in the water.

“Keep in mind these are the only PFAS that we know to test for,” Enders said. “A lot of times, and we’ve seen this happen with GenX, what happens is when the chemical companies find out that we’re detecting the PFAS they put in the waterways, they change the chemistry to a different molecule. If we don’t know that they’ve done that, we’re not looking at the right thing.”

Enders likened the situation with chemical companies to the illegal drug manufacturing industry suggesting the EPA classify certain chemical compounds as if they were illegal drugs.

“They would just change the chemistry and they wouldn’t be illegal anymore. So what the DEA ended up having to do was class level distinction. You make anything that has this grouping of molecules, anything that’s in this class of molecules is illegal to make.”

Schweickert highlighted bills currently in the North Carolina General Assembly to regulate PFAS in the state. House Bill 569 – the PFAS and Polluter Liability bill, and H.B. 570 — the Responsible Firefighting Foam Management Act, both sponsored by New Hanover Rep. Ted Davis. Davis has introduced similar legislation in the past, but efforts were unsuccessful. The bills passed the House and now sit in the Senate committee on rules and operations.

“I’m pretty optimistic that we’ll get something,” Schweickert stated. “I think we need the community to weigh in strongly with their decision-makers to make sure they stay on top of this and if they pass the strongest package.”

When can you get the Rivian R2 electric SUV?","Rivian is one of the few American car manufacturers aside from Tesla that produces only EVs.

The R1T electric full-size pickup truck and R1S full-size electric SUV have impressive specs, but high sticker prices make them out of reach for many drivers. A new Rivian R1T or R1S costs nearly $70,000, which is much more than the average new car price of $49,740, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Rivian's new, more affordable EV could have a better chance at besting Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y. Here's why.

What is the Rivian R2?

The Rivian R2 is an upcoming midsize electric SUV that is more affordable and compact than the R1S. The Rivian R1S full-size electric SUV showcased what the company is capable of from a design and engineering standpoint. Now, the R2 can help the Rivian brand become accessible to more American drivers.

The upcoming Rivian R2 and R3 electric SUVs will include many of the same tech features and capabilities that earned the admiration of auto enthusiasts.

Tesla originally manufactured high-priced performance luxury electric vehicles like the Tesla Roadster. The more affordable Model Y and Model 3 EVs went on to become best-selling models for Tesla, as reported by Hagerty. Will the R2 have the same effect for Rivian as a more affordable alternative to its first models?

How much does the Rivian R2 cost?

According to Rivian, which has a vehicle development and testing center in metro Detroit, the R2 midsize electric SUV will start at around $45,000, about $5,000 less than the Model Y. It is expected to qualify for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax incentive, bringing its starting price closer to $37,500. You can reserve an R2 electric SUV for just $100.

The R3 is ""designed with even tighter dimensions and at a lower price point than R2,"" says Rivian. The American automaker says that models equipped with larger battery packs are capable of over 300 miles of driving range. Rivian's current least powerful battery pack provides 270 miles of driving range, but the standard R2 could have less range as a smaller model.

When can you get the Rivian R2 electric SUV?

Pre-orders are open but deliveries on the R2 aren't expected to begin until the first half of 2026. So the market won't see the impact of the R2's arrival until the second half of 2026. That said, anti-Tesla sentiment has been growing due to CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration as senior adviser to the president.

Tesla sales have experienced a huge international decline, leaving room for competitors to gain momentum. If the Rivian R2 manages to launch without a hitch, it could be a serious rival to the Tesla Model Y in pricing, standard technology, and performance.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sTUmHBGxoRHE_r2Uw2mjhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/detroit-free-press/67b1b875b02199fb80338a18b27b5b25,N,,2025-05-15 21:06:58.534594

Ram is yet again delaying its electric pickup truck, the 1500 REV, and the Ramcharger plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version. Here’s when you can expect to see them reach dealerships now.

When is Ram delaying its electric pickup truck until now?

Ram’s first electric pickup truck was initially scheduled to arrive by the end of 2024. Last year, former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said the launch date would be pushed back to the first half of 2025 and then 2026.

Here we are, and the Ram 1500 REV is still nowhere in sight. According to a new memo sent to suppliers, Ram is again delaying the electric pickup truck.

The note, viewed by Crain’s Detroit Business, said production is now being pushed back until summer 2027. It will now arrive as a 2028 model year. The plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Ramcharger version will also be delayed until the first quarter of 2026.

Stellantis confirmed the news in a statement to Crain’s, saying the delay was due to “extending the quality validation period.”

A company spokesperson explained in an email that Stellantis “continues to reassess its product strategy in North America to align it with our competitive advantage with the Range Extended Ram and in light of slowing consumer demand for half-ton BEV pickups.”

After pulling the PHEV Ramcharger ahead of the EV pickup last year, Stellantis blamed weak demand for electric trucks.

Outperforming the competition, or falling behind?

The Ram 1500 REV will be available with a massive 168 kWh battery, which provides an estimated 350-mile range. Ram said a larger 229 kWh battery option would be available later, with at least 500 miles range.

Tavares promised for years that Ram’s EV pickup would “outperform all competitors” where it matters most in range, towing, and charging times. The Ram 1500 REV is expected to arrive with a towing capacity of up to 14,000 lbs and a 2,700 lb max payload.

In comparison, Ford’s F-150 Lightning offers a driving range of up to 320 miles, a 10,000-lb max towing capacity, and a 2,000-lb max payload capacity.

The 2025 Chevy Silverado EV offers up to 492 miles of range, 12,500 lbs of towing capacity, and 1,800 lbs of max payload capacity.

Tavares said last year that Stellantis is “facing a very significant amount of workload” with the first electric Jeep and Dodge models, the Wagoneer S and Charger Daytona, rolling out.

When former president Joe Biden's EPA issued the original rule in 2024, it was challenged by chemical industry and water utility groups who argued, among other things, that the agency had improperly combined two key steps in the process: determining that a chemical poses health risks and proposing a rule.

Biden's rule had set the maximum allowable concentration for the four additional PFAS -- including GenX, a dangerous chemical that has contaminated drinking water in the Cape Fear river basin of North Carolina -- at 10 parts per trillion.

Rather than wait for a court ruling, Zeldin told reporters he agreed ""there was a procedural error that we are addressing.""

""Quite frankly, there's a possibility that at the end of the process, a new number could be lower, could be higher,"" he added, stressing that the revised standards would be guided by science. He did not provide a timeline for their finalization.

""Administrator Zeldin is almost posturing like they have no choice but to go back and redo it -- but they are making a choice, to switch sides in the litigation,"" she told AFP. ""It seems like the EPA is trying to have it both ways.""

There is bipartisan support for action on PFAS, with some of the hardest-hit communities -- in West Virginia, rural New York, and North Carolina -- located in Republican strongholds, and billions earmarked by Congress to address the problem in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

At least 158 million Americans are estimated to have drinking water contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which accumulate in the body and have been linked to cancer, birth defects, reduced fertility, and behavioral disorders -- even at extremely low levels.

Nicknamed ""forever chemicals"" because they can take millions of years to break down, PFAS were first synthesized in the 1930s and are defined by their ultra-strong carbon-fluorine bonds, which give them extreme heat resistance as well as water and grease-repellent properties.

Today, they blanket the planet -- from the Tibetan Plateau to the ocean floor -- and circulate in the blood of nearly every American.

A USA TODAY analysis of EPA data shows the chemicals have recently been detected in hundreds of water systems serving over 84 million Americans.

Most of these detections weren’t enough to trigger action under the now-abandoned rule, but dozens of utilities providing water to a total of 4 million Americans reported measurements that would have required them to install advanced filtration or find other sources of water.

This group includes water systems covering Fort Worth in Texas and Fresno and Sacramento in California, which each serve over a half-million customers.

This tally is an undercount, though, as the EPA data is incomplete. The agency is only halfway through a three-year effort requiring thousands of water systems to test for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. These manmade chemicals don’t easily decompose in nature, so they tend to accumulate in human bodies, where they can lead to certain cancers and other serious health complications.

The EPA originally adopted its PFAS rule under the Biden administration in April 2024, setting limits on six types of chemicals. Limits on just two of those – PFOS and PFOA – will remain set at 4 parts per trillion, although the EPA now plans to give water systems two more years to comply, setting the deadline in 2031 instead of 2029.

“We will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a news release. “This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants.”

Shortly after the rule was approved last spring, trade associations representing water utilities filed suit to challenge it, echoing sentiments many water systems have told USA TODAY. They say the regulation unfairly burdens them and their customers with the expense of filtering out chemicals put there by outside sources, such as airports, military bases and manufacturers.

The executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, which is one of the organizations that sued the EPA, applauded the two-year delay.

“States and water systems are struggling with the timeframes to complete the pilot testing, development of construction plans and building the necessary treatment improvements,” said Alan Roberson in a news release.

The EPA plans to reconsider limits on these four chemicals and finalize its reworked PFAS rule by next spring. In the meantime, the agency announced a new initiative called “PFAS OUT” to share resources, tools, funding opportunities and technical assistance with water utilities, particularly those struggling with PFOS or PFOA levels above the agency’s limits.

Clean water advocates suspected changes were coming for months, since the Trump administration returned to power, but they were still dismayed by the announcement.

“We're just going to have to keep drinking PFAS for another decade,” said Betsy Southerland, a retired official from the EPA’s water office. “By having drinking water standards only for PFOA and PFOS we're dealing with the legacy contamination. … All the current ones they're now using will not have any drinking water standards.”

Southerland accused the EPA of providing relief to PFAS manufacturers, which developed the four chemicals whose limits are now rescinded as alternatives to older types of forever chemicals.

She said the filtration technique that typically works on the two PFAS that still have limits – known as granular activated carbon – is less effective on the four chemicals whose limits have been nixed. So, more of those chemicals could now legally remain, even in drinking water that’s been treated to remove PFOS and PFOA.

“(Utilities) might have to do some additional different kind of treatment than granulated activated carbon, and so that's what (the EPA) is giving them full relief from,” Southerland explained.

“This is a public health betrayal, plain and simple,” added Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs for the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “The EPA is bowing to industry pressure and leaving millions exposed to toxic PFAS in their tap water.”

Her organization has estimated 158 million Americans drink water contaminated with forever chemicals, based on additional state and federal test results that extend beyond the EPA data USA TODAY used in its analysis.

Benesh pointed out 2021’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included billions of dollars for removing PFAS from drinking water and that some large manufacturers have paid multibillion-dollar settlements to utilities. She accused the EPA of shifting the burden to the public instead of further strengthening clean water laws or holding polluters accountable.

“Instead of building on this progress, the Trump Administration is threatening to leave Americans to foot the bill for drinking water they can’t trust and healthcare they can’t afford,” Benesh said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/13/USAT/74787151007-usatsi-23918482.jpg?crop=6759,3802,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-15 19:06:07.345487

Under Clean Air Act regulations, EPA allows certain classes of stationary internal combustion engines to operate without an hourly limit for emergency situations but with a 100-hour annual limit for nonemergency situations.1 A nonemergency situation includes demand response as part of a financial agreement with a third party.2 These agreements enable operators to seek reimbursement for financial costs associated with nonemergency demand response uses. Under EPA regulations, backup engines may be operated pursuant to these agreements for up to 50 hours a year — which counts toward the broader 100-hour nonemergency limit — provided that five conditions are met:

The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator.

The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or distribution limitations to avoid the interruption of local power supply.

The dispatch follows reliability and safety protocols that adhere to specific standards or guidelines.

The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local transmission and distribution system.

The owner or operator keeps adequate records.

The regulations do not provide a definition for the term “local balancing authority” or “local transmission and distribution system operator,” nor do they define “emergency” with particularity.

Key Takeaways

Many businesses — including data centers and other energy-intensive facilities — have faced challenges in determining whether and how they might operate backup engines under these demand response agreements without jeopardizing their “emergency” status under Clean Air Act regulations. EPA’s recent Fact Sheet and FAQ, which refer to an earlier letter EPA sent to an energy company, clarify two key points:

Local balancing authorities get added flexibility. Local balancing authorities may require customers to reduce demand by starting up their backup generators pursuant to demand response agreements. By requiring customers to generate their own power for short period of times, local balancing authorities may be able to avoid load shedding.

Expanded view of “imminent” grid emergencies. The new guidance finds that an Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 event — when grid reserves fall below prescribed thresholds — may suffice for triggering an emergency demand response if escalation to Level 2 is “imminent without further action.” This effectively relaxes the bar for demonstrating the occurrence of an emergency situation.

The press release notes that EPA is “evaluating more substantive changes” to the underlying regulations. While timing and scope remain uncertain, stakeholders should monitor for a new rulemaking that could further expand or restrict permissible activities.

EPA’s Fact Sheet and FAQ mark a shift for data centers, utilities, and environmental compliance teams navigating the intersection of grid reliability and air-quality standards. By confirming the permissible use of emergency generators and endorsing compensated demand response programs, EPA has clarified the applicability of these regulations for industries facing surging power demands from electrification and artificial intelligence. Notably, EPA’s Fact Sheet and FAQ cite the Trump administration’s goal to “ensure [that the] U.S. is the AI capital of the world” as well as Executive Order 14156 (“Declaring a National Energy Emergency”), underscoring the national significance of these changes. As the regulatory landscape evolves, businesses should assess their compliance strategies and operational protocols to ensure uninterrupted operations.

“When we started, my boss told me not to mention decarbonisation or energy transition at meetings,” she continued.
As one panellist put it, natural gas was supposed to be a bridge to renewable energy, but nowadays renewable energy is acting as a bridge to natural gas.
One panellist referenced the fact that Republicans in the House of Representatives have drafted legislation to phase out tax credits for various renewable energy projects by 2031.
“We dipped our toes and now we want to put a significant amount of capital to work,” he said.","“Fundraising is tough”, one renewable energy fund manager told New Private Markets on the sidelines of the third annual Women in Private Markets Summit North America, hosted by PEI Group in New York City this week. It was a common refrain from the two-day conference.

“When we started, my boss told me not to mention decarbonisation or energy transition at meetings,” she continued.

In fact, as her firm was pitching a fund to investors, one of the large pension plans that was considering a commitment asked if the word “renewable” could be removed from the name of the fund.

“These are the sort of anecdotes you hear that lead to an overall impression,” she said.

That impression, according to other conference-goers speaking in both sideline conversations and Chatham House Rule panel sessions, is that renewable energy strategies are clouded in uncertainty as the US administration shifts focus to more traditional forms of energy. As one panellist put it, natural gas was supposed to be a bridge to renewable energy, but nowadays renewable energy is acting as a bridge to natural gas.

The second administration of President Donald Trump has placed a renewed focus on fossil fuels. One panellist referenced the fact that Republicans in the House of Representatives have drafted legislation to phase out tax credits for various renewable energy projects by 2031. The end result remains to be seen, she continued, given many Republican districts have benefited from job growth in low-carbon energy projects, particularly in hydrogen production, battery storage, wind and solar power.

So far, the Trump administration has tinkered with the energy market rather than institute widespread change. The question now is how far it will go, she added.

Two other fund managers said that the market had paused in recent months as LPs and GPs come to terms with shifting energy policy.

It wasn’t all one-way traffic, however: one conventional energy investor said his firm is looking to get more involved in energy transition, adding that the best way to do that was through a specialised fund manager or perhaps through co-investments. “We dipped our toes and now we want to put a significant amount of capital to work,” he said.",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/05/Women-in-Private-Markets-Summit-North-America-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 03:04:32.292954

A key initiative is the UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), launched in November 2022, which seeks to mobilise US$100 billion in financing and investment to deploy 100GW of clean energy by 2035.

As part of this effort, the two countries announced in January 2023 a $20 billion allocation to develop 15GW of clean energy projects in the United States by 2035. The initiative is being led by Masdar in partnership with private-sector investors from the United States.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) also joined the clean energy push by acquiring a 35 percent equity stake in ExxonMobil's blue hydrogen project in Texas, which will be capable of producing up to 1 billion cubic feet daily of blue hydrogen, with about 98 percent of carbon dioxide removed, and more than 1 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year.

In support of innovation, the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy signed agreements with the University of Arizona and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to explore advanced clean energy technologies, including solar power in space and climate acceleration tools.

The United States remains a core market for Masdar, which is targeting a clean energy portfolio of 25GW in the United States within a decade. Masdar's portfolio in the US comprises wind, solar and battery storage projects in California, Texas, New York, and New Mexico, reflecting the company's long-term commitment to transforming energy systems.

Masdar's US activities began in January 2019 with investments in the Rocksprings and Sterling wind farms in Texas and New Mexico. In 2020, it partnered with EDF Renewables North America across a portfolio of seven operational projects comprising 1.3GW of operating capacity.

In 2024, Masdar acquired a 50 percent stake is one of the USA's leading renewable power producer Terra-Gen, adding another 3.7GW of operating capacity, 6GW of under construction and advanced pipeline assets, as well as significant early stage pipeline. With this acquisition, Masdar's gross operating portfolio in the US now exceeds 5.0GW.

Prior to the Terra-Gen acquisition, Masdar's 1.3GW portfolio in the US consisted of four utility-scale wind projects in Texas and New Mexico and five solar projects in California. Two of the solar projects, Big Beau and Desert Harvest, include battery energy storage systems.

The acquisition of Terra-Gen added a gross operating portfolio of 3.7GW of wind, solar and battery storage projects, including 5.1GWh of energy storage facilities across 30 renewable power sites, predominantly in California and Texas. Terra-Gen is currently developing further 12GW of wind, solar and battery storage projects California, Texas and New York.

What happens when the largely public industry charged with ensuring the country’s water is safe opposes clean water rules, as it has repeatedly?","The Trump administration has announced it would attempt to kill some of the strong new Pfas “forever chemical” drinking water limits set in April 2024.

While the moves would deliver a clear win for the US chemical and water utility industries, it is less clear whether the action will be successful, what it means longterm for the safety of the US’s drinking water, and its impact on progress in addressing forever chemical pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is attempting maneuvers that violate the law, observers say, and even if they survive a legal challenge, progress under the Biden administration cannot be fully undone. There’s also some momentum in regulatory and legal battles that public health advocates have won at the state level and in courts that will ultimately improve water piecemeal regardless of the EPA’s backtracking.

Still, the announcement raises a fresh round of questions about the water utility industry, which has led the attack on the new rules. And the announcement represents a blow on a popular environmental and public health issue that has seen notable successes in recent years.

“With this action, EPA is making clear that it’s willing to ignore Americans who just want to turn on their kitchen taps and have clean, safe water,” said Erik Olson, the senior strategic director for health at the NRDC. The non-profit is an intervenor on legal action on the issue, and lobbied for the limits.

Pfas are a class of chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, liver problems, thyroid issues, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious health problems.

The chemicals are ubiquitous in the environment and thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million people across the US. The 2024 Pfas rules marked the first time in 27 years the EPA had put in place new drinking water limits for contaminants.

The EPA created limits for six Pfas compounds, and the Trump administration targeted four of those – PFNA, PfHxS, and HFPO dimer acid, more commonly called GenX.

However, the Safe Drinking Water Act would in theory stop the EPA from simply killing or even weakening the limits because it includes an “anti-backsliding” rule that prohibits a loosening of restrictions. It states that a revision “shall maintain, or provide for greater, protection of the health of persons”.

“The EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard – this action is not only harmful, it’s illegal,” Olson said.

However, the water utility and chemical industries have sued to attempt to kill the limits for all six Pfas – not just the four covered in yesterday’s announcement. The EPA and justice department under Joe Biden began defending the rules, and it’s unclear how the Donald Trump EPA’s will handle the cases for the four Pfas limits it announced it intends to undo.

Kyla Bennett, the policy director with the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, and a former EPA scientist, said she suspects the agency and the justice department will, in effect, try to lose the case.

“The DOJ could stop defending and do a shitty job and make the court say: ‘These limits aren’t science-based,’ then strike them down,” Bennett said. It would then be up to legal intervenors like NRDC to defend the rules.

Olson detailed the agency’s other legal options, which involve revising the rule. That could take more time than the Trump administration has in office, but it delays the rules’ implementation.

“It’s going to take years and years, and they’re going to kick the can down the road because they dont give a shit,” Bennett added.

While the proposal shreds blanket protections against the four Pfas, it leaves in place limits for PFOA and PFOS. Reverse osmosis systems utilities are installing to remove PFOS and PFOA would catch most of the other Pfas, as well. However, not all water utilities are installing systems that can catch smaller Pfas, such as GenX.

Moreover, Chemours is responsible for high levels of GenX pollution around its Pfas plants in North Carolina and West Virginia. The consent agreements in place use EPA limits as the standard for cleanup and requirements for the company to provide impacted residents with safe drinking water.

The full impact on those communities is unclear, but the EPA’s plans are “right on the bullseye of what Chemours wanted”, Olson said.

The development also highlights the need for reform of the country’s water utility industry, which is leading the charge against the limits. What happens when the largely public industry charged with ensuring the country’s water is safe opposes clean water rules, as it has repeatedly?

“It’s definitely a huge problem,” Olson said. “Most people would be shocked to hear that their water utility is spending precious dollars on lobbying, litigating and fighting against public health requirements, rather than using the money to install better water systems.”

There are few good quick answers, advocates say. Still, there’s some momentum that the EPA action and utilities won’t slow. More than$12bn in legal settlement is already available for utilities that were a part of those suits. Meanwhile, the federal government has made more than $20bn available, and many projects are underway, while states have also enacted their own limits and made some money available.

The Trump administration, for its part, wrote in its press release that it is “keeping [limits] for PFOA, PFOS” and it is “on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water”.

The statement did not impress campaigners.

“It’s just lies and that press release was gas lighting,” Bennett said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3422bf36d62c0b22a414a1b15134d8d8752155cf/548_0_4503_3603/master/4503.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=476cf2c65f8591ac5d0391ad59bf8ce9,N,,2025-05-15 19:06:16.144682

In a move that signals a shift in strategy, General Motors (GM) has pressed pause on its highly anticipated hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing facility in Detroit, Michigan. First announced back in September 2024, the $55 million factory was set to breathe new life into the old State Fairgrounds site and create roughly 300 skilled jobs in the process. Spanning nearly 292,500 square feet, the facility was expected to become a major player in GM’s push toward alternative fuels. But come May 2025, those plans were officially put on hold—leaving many to wonder what this means for the future of fuel cell technology in the U.S.

Why GM Is Pumping the Brakes

So, why the sudden change of heart? Well, it comes down to uncertainty—both in the market and in the infrastructure behind hydrogen. While GM made big strides through its longstanding collaboration with Honda—a partnership that’s been going strong since 2017—they’re now taking a closer look at how realistic it is to go big on hydrogen right now. One GM spokesperson, speaking off the record, summed it up like this: “We still believe hydrogen has a big role to play in clean mobility long-term, but in the short run, we’ve got to rethink how fast and how big we go.” That cautious note echoes across the industry. Between red tape, technology costs, and slow progress on hydrogen infrastructure, a lot of companies are playing it safe for now—and GM is no exception.

Detroit’s Hydrogen Hopes on Hold

Detroit, the birthplace of the American auto and home to countless automotive milestones, was gearing up to take center stage in the next era—this time as a hub for industrial decarbonization. Locals had high hopes the new plant would be a launchpad for green jobs and innovation, bolstering the city’s ongoing transformation into a next-gen manufacturing heavyweight. The site—a piece of historic fairgrounds unused since 2009—was more than just real estate. It was part of Detroit’s bigger vision to mix economic renewal with sustainability. But, for now, that vision is on the back burner.

A Missed Milestone for Piston Automotive

This wasn’t just GM’s show. Piston Automotive, a proud Detroit-born supplier that’s been in the game since 1994, was lined up to be a key partner. They’ve been expanding into alternative fuel component assembly, betting big on the future of clean tech. The project’s suspension doesn’t necessarily end that partnership—but it does put their shared plans on ice. What was supposed to be a defining chapter for both companies is now a question mark in the margins.

Fuel Cells vs. Batteries: Still Anyone’s Game

Globally, the momentum behind fuel cell technology is undeniable—especially in places like Japan, South Korea, and parts of Europe. Giants like Toyota and Hyundai are all in. But here in the U.S.? The story’s a bit more complicated. While battery-electric vehicles are clearly dominating the landscape, hydrogen still has a shot, especially for big rigs, long-hauls, and other heavy-duty uses where quick refueling and high power matter. Still, GM’s decision makes one thing clear: hydrogen isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, and without better infrastructure in place, even the biggest automakers have to pause and rethink.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A), exposure to PFAS — a class of highly toxic, long-lasting compounds also known as “forever chemicals” — has been linked to cancer, decreased fertility in women, developmental effects in children, immune system issues, interference with the body’s natural hormones, and more. At least 45 percent of America’s tap water is estimated to have one or more types of PFAS.

Last year, former President Joe Biden set first-ever limits on PFAS, requiring water utilities to begin bringing down contamination levels of six types of PFAS chemicals — while setting a strict limit of four parts per trillion for two of those chemicals, PFOA and PFOS.

Despite the plethora of research warning against the dangers of forever chemicals in water, the E.P.A. said that while it will uphold the limits for those two types of PFAS, it will extend a deadline requiring water utilities to meet those limits to 2031. The E.P.A. also said it plans to eliminate and reconsider the limits for the other four chemicals — PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS — listed.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. “At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants.”

President Donald Trump and his allies have escalated attacks on clean water protections. Through E.P.A. deregulations and cuts, Supreme Court rulings, executive orders, and bills in Congress, Trump and conservatives are systematically eroding rules aimed at providing Americans with clean, healthy water.

In March, Zeldin said he would look to significantly reduce a significant portion of the waterways, such as wetlands, rivers, and streams, that are protected under the Clean Water Act, a 1972 law that regulates the discharge of pollutants in water.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Senate has confirmed Sean Donahue to serve as the General Counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Appointed by President Donald J. Trump, Sean Donahue will work in this new role to advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative.

“President Trump made a fantastic pick in Sean to be EPA’s General Counsel. He has the experience and expertise to help us advance our core mission, Power the Great American Comeback, execute on President Trump’s promises, and help us root out waste and abuse. I am proud Sean is returning to EPA and look forward to continuing our work to protect human health and the environment,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin.

“It is the honor of a lifetime to return to EPA and serve as its General Counsel. Under President Trump’s bold leadership, the agency is delivering for the American people by championing sound environmental policies grounded in its statutory authority—and we are doing this while ensuring clean air, clean water, and clean land for all Americans. I look forward to leading the Office of General Counsel as we fulfill its critical duty to provide the best legal advice and advance EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment. Thank you to President Trump, Administrator Zeldin, and my EPA colleagues for their confidence and unwavering support,” said EPA General Counsel Sean Donahue.

EPA's General Counsel is the chief legal advisor to EPA, the federal agency with primary responsibility for implementing the nation’s environmental laws. These laws include the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund”). The General Counsel leads the Office of General Counsel (OGC) in providing legal counsel to EPA policymakers, providing critical input to rules, regulations, and guidance documents that are promulgated and issued to implement the agency’s statutory obligations. In addition, the General Counsel and OGC provide assistance to Congress on national legislation affecting the environment and address international law issues. Working with EPA headquarters and regional offices, OGC attorneys also provide legal support for the issuance of permits, and the approval of state environmental programs. In tandem with the United States Department of Justice, the General Counsel and OGC represent the Agency in court challenges to agency actions, appeals of enforcement cases, and Supreme Court litigation. The General Counsel carries out these functions not only with respect to EPA’s environmental programs, but also in connection with EPA’s day-to-day operations.

Sean Donahue returns to EPA after having served as a Special Advisor in the Administrator’s Office and Office of Land & Emergency Management from 2018 to 2021. He most recently was an associate counsel at a solar energy company, where his work included environmental permitting, compliance, and advising on all phases of the project lifecycle. Prior to this experience, Sean worked as an associate at a regional law firm, where he worked on a variety of environmental and energy matters. Sean is a member of the District of Columbia Bar and earned his Juris Doctor from Florida State University College of Law and a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies from the University of Central Florida.

Here’s what people are saying about Sean Donahue’s presidential appointment:

Senator Rick Scott (R-FL): “I’m proud to congratulate Floridian Sean Donahue on his confirmation as General Counsel of the EPA. Floridians love our natural treasures and Sean will work hard to preserve and protect our environment for future generations.”

Senator Ashley Moody (R-FL): “I was so proud to vote to confirm Sean Donahue to be the next General Counsel of the U.S. EPA. Yet another great leader hailing from the Free State of Florida serving in the Trump administration. I have no doubt he will do an excellent job!”

Former EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler: “Sean did a great job at EPA during the first Trump Administration. He’s a very smart and capable lawyer and he’s going to be an outstanding General Counsel.”

Former EPA General Counsel Matt Leopold: “Congratulations to Sean Donahue on his confirmation as EPA General Counsel. He will serve this Administration well leading the lawyers defending the agency’s most important actions.”",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 15:08:47.519007

Experts say that in the absence of federal regulations, more emphasis will be placed on the states to safeguard drinking water from PFAS pollution.

San Juan, P.R. – This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regional Administrator Michael Martucci traveled to Puerto Rico to focus on the benefits to people and local economies during EPA’s Annual Caribbean Brownfields Week. EPA hosted events across Puerto Rico during the week and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The events supported the EPA’s mission of ensuring clean land, air and water to the public.

“The Brownfields program changes communities and changes lives,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “We called on local leaders, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations to join us in turning contaminated and abandoned places into spaces of opportunity and growth.”

During this week, the EPA and its partners trained and advised entities interested in applying for funding under EPA’s Brownfields program. The events helped promote the funding and technical assistance available through the program to help assess and clean up contaminated sites, as well as the training available for individuals to prepare for good-paying careers in the environmental field.

Work under the Brownfields program transforms abandoned and underused properties into vibrant community assets while training residents to undertake this work. One area that requires attention are vacant housing units. Puerto Rico has more than 255,000 vacant housing units, and the U.S. Virgin Islands has over 7,000—all with untapped potential to serve their communities. EPA’s Brownfields program equips communities with tools and technical assistance to advance local redevelopment efforts.

Regional Administartor Martucci also noted that this effort aligned with EPA’s broader mission: “Revitalizing Brownfields directly supports the Powering the Great American Comeback initiative. By breathing new life into previously impacted sites, we preserve land, and secure cleaner air, land, and water for all residents.”

The week’s activities included a Workforce Development Forum and Brownfields Job-Training Application Workshop in Puerto Rico, a graduation ceremony for graduates of the Pathstone job training program, and Revitalization Resources Summits in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Administrator Zeldin, welcome back to the House. It is great to have you testify before this subcommittee on the Environmental Protection Agency’s goals for the upcoming fiscal year.

As you well know, I am proud to represent the Kerr Environmental Research Center in Ada, Oklahoma.

For over 50 years, the Kerr Lab – which leads the U.S. in research and advancements on groundwater, aquifer recharge, and agriculture soil health – has established itself to be a premier EPA research center.

Kerr’s record of scientific achievements proves that the lab is well positioned to take on additional research opportunities to address growing environmental challenges and statutory mandates from Congress.

The Kerr Lab also plays a pivotal role in the local rural community by providing jobs, partnering with local universities and tribal nations, and serving as a strong economic driver. I hope we can welcome you back to the Sooner State soon to see firsthand the important work Kerr Lab is carrying out to advance the Agency’s mission.

I was also pleased to see the budget prioritizes funding for Tribes to maintain and improve water infrastructure throughout Indian Country.

Investments like these are critical to ensuring the federal government is upholding its trust responsibility to Native Americans to provide basic services and resources. Administrator Zeldin, I look forward to working together to reduce red tape, provide regulatory certainty, and improve environmental health while also protecting American jobs and lowering energy costs.

As EPA Administrator, you play a key role in strengthening our national security by unleashing domestic energy production, and I look forward to discussing where resources can be applied for all these efforts in the full FY26 budget request.

Again, thank you for being here today, Administrator Zeldin.

US Republican tax proposal would nullify clean-energy incentives for solar, battery, and other projects using Chinese components, putting billions in climate investments at risk.

Republican lawmakers have unveiled a tax package that could gut President Biden’s climate-law incentives years ahead of schedule by disqualifying any clean-energy project reliant on materials from China and other “foreign entities of concern.”

The Republican proposal, meant to help pay for extending President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, rolls back roughly $560 billion in clean-energy credits. Buried in the bill is language barring developers from claiming key subsidies if their projects contain components, subcomponents, or critical minerals originating in China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran.

That restriction hits the heart of the US renewables sector, which still leans heavily on Chinese-sourced polysilicon, solar cells, permanent magnets, and battery materials. “This would be a complete death sentence for projects that depend on global supply chains,” warned Sandhya Ganapathy, CEO of EDP Renewables North America. Credits for offshore wind, nuclear, carbon capture, geothermal, heat pumps, and biofuels would also be swept into the ban.

The House plans to vote on the measure before the Memorial Day recess. Even if it clears that hurdle, the Senate is expected to rewrite significant portions, yet developers say the mere prospect of supply-chain tests is already rattling investors. Evercore ISI cautioned clients the rules could “create a cloud of uncertainty until the IRS clarifies compliance,” potentially freezing billions in planned projects.

But guidance may be slow to arrive. Under a second Trump administration, the IRS would face little pressure to issue the definitions and safe harbors developers need, said Jesse Jenkins, an energy-policy professor at Princeton University. “That alone could be the kiss of death,” he noted, arguing the proposal jeopardizes the manufacturing renaissance sparked by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Clean-energy advocates contend the United States lacks sufficient domestic capacity to replace Chinese inputs overnight. They fear that stripping credits now would stall gigafactory investments already on the books, undercutting job creation in swing-state manufacturing hubs.

Republicans counter that taxpayers should not subsidize supply chains tied to geopolitical rivals, pointing to last month’s continent-wide blackout in Europe as proof grids must be secure as well as green.

With just days before the House vote, lobbyists are scrambling to carve out exemptions or soften the foreign-entity definitions. But unless those efforts succeed, the bill could redraw the economics of US clean-energy development long before its official 2033 sunset.",https://list.solar/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-16 10:10:28.860465

Native Vote. As President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress push for more tax breaks for billionaires—while working families in New Mexico foot the bill—Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo), candidate for New Mexico governor and former U.S. secretary of the Interior, is sounding the alarm. In a video shared across her social media platforms, Haaland spoke directly to voters, highlighting the serious damage these policies would inflict on New Mexico’s growing clean energy economy.

In the video Haaland states, “When I served as Interior Secretary, one of the key things I focused on was creating jobs in clean energy and lowering energy costs in New Mexico - harnessing the wind and sun to generate energy and create economic opportunity. These local industries were actually doing that, bringing jobs and generating electricity, and now Trump is trying to stop those efforts. It’ll make electricity more expensive and kill even more New Mexico jobs.”

The extreme Republican tax plan slashes key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and gutting investments that drive job creation, lower energy costs, and support local businesses in New Mexico. The state currently has $9.9 billion in low-carbon energy projects in the pipeline—many of which are already underway thanks to Inflation Reduction Act funding. These projects showcase how federal investment can spark innovation and economic growth in New Mexico, making clear just how much damage Trump and congressional Republicans could cause by reversing course.

Secretary Deb Haaland has a strong record of advancing new industries to diversify New Mexico’s economy. As Secretary of the Interior, she moved forward with permitting for the SunZia Transmission Project—a major infrastructure effort that supported union labor through a project labor agreement between the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the project’s developer. The IBEW estimated the initiative would generate 500 construction jobs and 150 permanent positions.

During her time in the U.S. House of Representatives, Haaland celebrated the groundbreaking of the La Joya Wind Farm in Torrance County, advanced energy efficiency through the National Defense Authorization Act, and led the THRIVE Agenda. This bold initiative aimed to create high-quality union jobs in a clean energy economy while ensuring environmental justice for communities long burdened by pollution and corporate neglect.

The legislation passed includes the Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, which was established in 2022, but hasn’t been used, leaving billions in potential economic development untapped. Additionally, the House also passed the Community Energy Act, which would improve the ability of agriculture producers and low-income Pennsylvanians to jointly share energy resources to lower their costs.

Supported by a broad coalition of labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, the Governor’s commonsense energy plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, speed up permitting, and protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building more energy generation in Pennsylvania – positioning the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

“Pennsylvania has long been a national energy leader, from Ben Franklin to today, and my energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We have to meet this moment and this plan – supported by leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates – will lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, speed up permitting, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. The time for action is now and I look forward to working with leaders in the General Assembly to get this legislation to my desk.”

Governor Shapiro highlighted the benefits of community energy while visiting Penn England Farms in Blair County last month, where a methane digester is turning farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and generating revenue. The Lightning Plan, through the Community Energy Act, will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers and rural communities benefit.

The EDGE Tax Credit passed today is a collection of tax credit programs designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing and energy sectors, including semiconductors, biomedical, milk processing, and and clean, reliable, affordable energy generation and storage. The Lightning Plan proposes several tax credit modifications to ensure businesses can actually take advantage of the credit to create jobs, innovate, and grow our economy, including:

Reliable Energy Investment Credit: Up to $100 million per facility, focused on adding clean, reliable, and affordable energy sources to the grid.

Regional Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit: Up to $49 million annually for regional hydrogen projects, with lower thresholds to qualify.

Semiconductor Manufacturing, Biomedical Manufacturing and Research Tax Credit: up to $8 million per year for semiconductor manufacturing and up to $2 million per year for early-stage semiconductor businesses.

Milk Processing Tax Credit Program: Invests in Pennsylvania’s agricultural industry by providing up to $15 million in tax credits per year and $120 million total for milk processing facilities.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Up to $15 million per year to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through projects that make at least a $250 million investment.

Governor Shapiro’s energy plan will provide funding for new projects through the updated tax credits, streamline energy project approvals by creating a state energy siting board to cut red tape, and increase rebates for energy-efficient appliances to help reduce household energy costs. The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.

The 183-page bill, already approved by the House, includes measures that would redirect millions of dollars from a state renewable energy fund to the general budget and to rebates for utility customers.

Advocates say the changes would endanger renewable energy development in New Hampshire and do not belong in this bill, which is intended to lay out policy changes needed to implement the state budget.

“Major policy changes do not belong buried in a bill with no chance for significant scrutiny,” said Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs for nonprofit advocacy group Clean Energy New Hampshire. ​“It’s undemocratic, and it’s irresponsible.”

Supporters of the measures, however, say they are sensible approaches to saving consumers money at a time when energy bills have been soaring.

“You can’t keep piling costs on the backs of ratepayers indefinitely because eventually they’re going to rebel,” said Rep. Michael Vose, a Republican and the chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee. ​“We’re not against clean energy at all, but we are for cost savings and efficiency.”

The provisions in question relate to the state’s Renewable Energy Fund, which utilities pay into when they are unable to meet state requirements for procuring renewable energy. The fund supports programs including competitive grants for non-residential renewable energy projects, rebates for solar installations, and funding for community solar projects benefiting low- to moderate-income residents.

The pending bill would transfer all of the fund’s uncommitted dollars to the general fund, as the state deals with ongoing budget shortfalls. Then, from 2027 on, most of the money that flows into the renewable energy fund would be returned to residents as a rebate on their electric bill. The fund would only retain enough money to cover administrative costs and the budget of the state’s offshore wind and energy innovation office — a total of $660,000 in fiscal year 2024 — as well as incentive programs at the discretion of the New Hampshire Energy Department.

“It would effectively eliminate the fund,” said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation.

The fund’s annual revenue has ranged from less than $1.4 million to more than $19 million since it was launched in 2007. In 2023, the last year for which numbers are available, the fund took in $5.9 million and disbursed about $4.5 million. The awards included a $140,000 grant expected to cover most of the cost for a solar installation on housing for older adults in Portsmouth, and a $400,000 grant to support a biomass-burning system to provide heat and air conditioning to an assisted living community.

Projects like these would be at risk if the proposal to return renewable energy fund money to utility customers becomes a reality, Krakoff said. ​“They’re unlikely to be able to make up that money elsewhere,” he said.

Vose acknowledged that the plan for the fund would deprive some proposed projects of access to money, but said tackling high energy bills is more important right now. In addition, the renewable energy market has developed to a point at which it might not need as much support from state incentives anymore, he said.

“A vast majority of the legislative caucus in the House thought it was more important to save ratepayers some money at this particular point in time,” Vose said. ​“It’s time to start rethinking what kind of money we’re spending on these projects.”

The bill is now under consideration in the Senate. Supporters and opponents alike expect the Senate to remove the provision that funnels money out of the renewable energy fund, though that does not mean it will be completely off the table. It is possible the measure could be restored when the two chambers conference to resolve the differences in their versions of the bill, Vose said.

Otherwise, it is probable the idea will return as a standalone bill at the beginning of next year, he said. It would likely be joined by another measure adjusting some of the requirements for renewable energy procurement by utilities and lowering the payments they make into the fund for noncompliance.

That, said Paul, is where these ideas belong: In their own bills, facing public scrutiny, rather than deep within a budget implementation bill.

“I don’t think these are proposals that would pass on their own,” he said. ​“They are deeply unpopular, and they don’t make any sense.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1466767445_2025-05-14-213719_zsso.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=df6658604464c04eb86ae6e12704949e,N,,2025-05-15 10:11:07.294637

Maine’s new energy-efficiency plan is projected to lower electricity bills for the state’s residents — even those who don’t directly benefit from its rebate and incentive programs.

The plan, set to go into effect in July, is heavily focused on getting electric heat pumps in as many homes as possible. It comes as other states debate rolling back efficiency programs funded by utility customers as a short-term fix to rising energy prices. Maine’s strategy takes the opposite approach: It leverages investments in efficiency and electrification to lower rates for everyone.

“This is bucking the trend,” said Michael Stoddard, executive director of Efficiency Maine Trust, the agency that administers the state’s energy-efficiency plans. ​“This is our pathway to managing electricity prices while also transitioning the consumers of our state to the highest-efficiency, lowest-polluting equipment that is available.”

Amid rapidly evolving energy goals, Maine lawmakers seek more coordinated grid planning

Maine has been an aggressive adopter of home heat pumps in recent years. In 2019 , the state set the goal of deploying 100,000 heat pumps by 2025, a target it blew by two years ahead of schedule. The state now aims to get another 175,000 heat pumps up and running by 2027. Maine is also a member of a five-state coalition that is collaborating to boost heat pump adoption, lower prices, and train installers throughout New England.

The state’s new energy-efficiency plan is geared toward continuing this progress. It is centered largely on the idea of ​“beneficial electrification,” a somewhat jargony term that refers to switching from fossil fuels to electricity wherever the move would save money and cut emissions. There are plenty of opportunities to make that swap in Maine, where roughly half of households keep warm with heating oil, which can be pricey and inefficient.

Over the next three years, the incentives in the plan are forecast to support 38,000 new whole-home residential heat pump systems — including 6,500 in low-income households — and weatherization for 9,900 houses. A low-income household can get rebates of up to $9,000 for heat pump installations, and homes at high income levels qualify for up to $3,000. The incentives do not offer any money for residential fossil-fuel-burning equipment.

This strategy should decrease annual heating costs by more than $1,000 each for homes that switch to heat pumps from oil, propane, or electric baseboard heat, but it is also expected to lower electricity prices across the board, Stoddard said. Efficiency Maine Trust estimates the plan will suppress electricity rates by more than $490 million over the long term.

How? Utilities have certain fixed costs, such as maintaining power lines. To pay for them — and this is a bit of a simplification — they essentially divide the expense by the amount of power they expect customers to use in a year, and add that number to the rate they charge per kilowatt-hour. When more heat pumps come online, power demand goes up, so the fixed costs are spread out over more kilowatt-hours, lowering bills for the average consumer.

Accomplishing that effect depends on finding ways to make sure much of the added demand occurs during off-peak hours, when there is plenty of room for more power to flow along the lines without building out more infrastructure and thus increasing the utilities’ fixed costs. To achieve this timing, Maine’s plan includes demand-response programs that pay consumers for using less energy at peak times, an incentive for low-income residents to buy electric vehicles with chargers that can be set to work at off-peak times, and other measures.

“We’ve already invested a lot of money in the grid, and yet it sits largely unused for many hours of the day,” Stoddard said. ​“If we can find ways to manage consumption so that it is occurring during off-peak periods, then it will maximize the use of the grid infrastructure and spread the fixed costs of the utility across many more kilowatt-hours.”

Maine’s plan also includes an innovative program that calls for Efficiency Maine Trust to negotiate with retailers and distributors for discounted prices on electric water heaters and for agreements to keep the equipment in stock. The strategy is particularly effective at getting people to switch from fossil-fuel water heaters in moments when their old equipment has failed and they are searching for an affordable, easily available replacement, said Erin Cosgrove, director of policy and programs for the nonprofit Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships.

Lawmaker argues it’s a ‘moral imperative’ to address high energy costs alongside climate change

“This program is unique for the Northeast,” she said.

More states have prioritized electrification in their efficiency programs in recent years, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the research group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Massachusetts, for example, phased out its incentives for oil and gas equipment last year, and Washington, D.C., has also eliminated rebates for fossil-fuel-powered systems and appliances.

“What a lot of programs across the country are doing is recognizing that providing incentives for fossil-fuel-based systems doesn’t achieve their goals,” he said. ​“Most of the leading states are prioritizing efficient electric appliances like heat pumps going forward.”

Energy-efficiency programs have traditionally centered the big-picture goal of helping consumers lower their energy use to save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whether that energy comes from an oil-delivery truck, a natural gas pipe, or over power lines.

Amid rising concern about climate change, however, more states have looked for ways to amplify the emissions impact of their programs. The solution has been to limit or eliminate incentives for fossil-fuel equipment and lean into electrification, which can often save consumers money and almost always reduce the emissions associated with heating and cooling their homes.

“When you use those additional metrics, you realize some of those old measures don’t make sense anymore,” Kresowik said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-100/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1934748893-scaled-1-1024x7681747312471.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=NCmBUqg6,N,,2025-05-16 03:04:40.082225

In contrast, the Salton Sea proposal in Southern California aims to position an emerging renewable energy industry for rapid growth, and ensure that local residents get a piece of the pie.

The organization has already challenged a Salton Sea project called Hell’s Kitchen, which promised to be one of the world’s largest lithium mines.","The Salton Sea is a haven for wildlife, a repository of critical minerals and the site of some of the worst environmental and economic conditions in California.

The contrast between its natural riches and its impoverished population has sharpened as companies seek to mine vast deposits of lithium, a mineral used to make batteries for electric cars, computers and cellphones.

“Today, the Salton Sea region stands at a critical juncture with a chance to become a major domestic supplier of lithium,” state Sen. Steve Padilla, who represents parts of Riverside, Imperial and San Diego counties, recently told the Senate Committee on Business, Professions and Economic Development.

The Chula Vista Democrat wants to give the region a bigger say in how it grows amid the projected lithium boom. His bill, SB 534, would create a “green empowerment zone” around the sea that would govern how to use public money, invest in local communities and support the transition to a renewable energy economy.

It would be run by a board of directors with representatives from Imperial and Riverside Counties, local cities, tribal members, energy experts with the University of California and large, private employers.

Padilla’s proposal is modeled after a similar program for the Contra Costa waterfront, which aimed to build on an existing workforce in the renewable energy sector. That program was due to expire in 2028, but two northern California lawmakers are proposing to extend it to 2040, to blunt the economic impact of the Marathon oil refinery closure in Martinez.

In contrast, the Salton Sea proposal in Southern California aims to position an emerging renewable energy industry for rapid growth, and ensure that local residents get a piece of the pie.

Development of lithium mining and other energy projects “could drive regional prosperity, create high paid jobs, support a well-articulated workforce” and boost industry in the desert, Padilla said.

But local advocates say there’s a risk that neighboring communities could be left behind. Most of the region faces poor air quality, high unemployment, an untrained workforce and limited health care access.

The region’s 150,000 inhabitants have also been split along jurisdictional lines. Imperial County communities are lumped in with San Diego, while the Coachella Valley and eastern Riverside County areas are attached to the Inland Empire. But those southeastern desert areas — with low-income, rural, largely Spanish-speaking communities — have more in common with each other than with their respective urban counterparts, the bill notes. Gov. Gavin Newsom last year vetoed a bill that would have created an economic hub similar to SB 534 to help stitch these areas together.

Padilla acknowledged that the region has often suffered disappointment through “major boom and bust cycles, economic promises that have often failed to deliver sustainable quality of life improvements to the residents and local communities.”

Salton Sea residents and local organizations want to make sure they don’t miss out on the benefits of what state leaders hail as a “white gold” rush in the region.

“The development of a California-based clean energy supply chain in the Salton Sea region that facilitates vocational and higher education opportunities for local residents, in their pursuit of high road quality jobs in the Imperial Valley emerging clean energy sector, is a priority,” said Christian Torres, director of climate equity and resilience for the nonprofit Comite Civico Del Valle.

The organization has already challenged a Salton Sea project called Hell’s Kitchen, which promised to be one of the world’s largest lithium mines.

Comite Civico Del Valle and the nonprofit Earthworks argued that the company proposing the mine, Controlled Thermal Resources, didn’t fully address the project’s effects on water supply and air quality, and didn’t properly consult with local Native American tribes. A judge cleared the project to start in January, but the groups filed an appeal in March.

Aydee Palomino, an environmental justice project manager with the nonprofit Alianza Coachella Valley, a co-sponsor of Padilla’s bill, said a green empowerment zone would help local agencies collaborate on funding applications and projects and provide “a structured way to ensure everyone has a seat at the table, shares responsibilities, and advances regional priorities,” she said.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/020323_Geothermal-Lithium_AD_CM_02.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 10:11:10.309401

“Current federal policies, such as clean energy tax credits, grants, loans, and standards accelerate clean energy project deployment and electric vehicle sales in Utah,” Energy Innovation wrote in the report.
Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at the nonprofit Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement that this proposed budget would make it much harder to bring the necessary clean energy and other efficiency resources to meet Utah’s growing needs.
“Clean energy tax credits are critical to harnessing Utah’s plentiful solar, geothermal, and energy storage resources this decade,” Craft said.
“These clean energy tax credits have supported some of Utah’s most exciting and forward looking projects, but by voting to rollback these investments, Rep. Moore is turning his back on the clean energy future that Utahns deserve.”","After a lengthy hearing that ran overnight and amid orders from President Donald Trump to reduce the national deficit, a U.S. House committee advanced a tax bill that, among many other actions, would phase out clean energy initiatives from the Biden administration that have substantially contributed to energy developments in Utah.

The House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing panel in the House, approved its bill that, bundled with other bills, make up Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” on Wednesday. With full Congressional approval, the large reconciliation package would establish some Trump priorities, including eliminating the tax on tips, paving the way for a national school choice voucher program, and eliminating major programs from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments.

Environmentalists in the state expressed deep concerns when the proposal was unveiled on Monday that some federal tax credits for clean energy developments, electric vehicles, home energy efficiency upgrades, and manufacturing projects would either be eliminated or phased out early.

Some pointed out that repealing these energy incentives would drive up electricity prices in Utah. According to a study by Rhodium Group, an independent research provider, energy bills would rise between 2.5% and 5.5% in Utah if the tax credits were to be repealed. Another study from Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank, indicates that the action could increase energy costs for an average Utah household by $20 annually in 2030, and more than $120 a year in 2035.

“Current federal policies, such as clean energy tax credits, grants, loans, and standards accelerate clean energy project deployment and electric vehicle sales in Utah,” Energy Innovation wrote in the report. “But repealing these policies would force Utah households to pay higher electricity bills because less low-cost clean energy is being built, while fewer EVs on the road would force consumers to spend more on gasoline.”

Simultaneously, phasing out the clean energy tax credits would eliminate the prospects of supporting 3,200 jobs annually, and $50 million in local tax revenue by 2032, according to BW Research and the Nature Conservancy.

Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at the nonprofit Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement that this proposed budget would make it much harder to bring the necessary clean energy and other efficiency resources to meet Utah’s growing needs.

“Clean energy tax credits are critical to harnessing Utah’s plentiful solar, geothermal, and energy storage resources this decade,” Craft said. “The House should revise the final reconciliation bill to maintain robust clean energy tax credits that are workable for Utah businesses and communities.”

Republicans voted along party lines to advance the draft to the House floor, including Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee and praised the bill in a social media post, arguing that it would keep taxes low for families, workers and businesses.

“Today we will advance policies that prevent a major tax hike on hardworking Americans, provide financial relief for families and parents, put American workers first, fuel economic growth, make American companies more competitive, and lower taxes for our farmers,” Moore wrote.

However, his nod to the bill didn’t sit well among some Utah environmentalists. Rebekah Ashley, Sierra Club Utah’s lead organizer on climate and energy described it as “deeply disappointing” and “a disservice to Utahns.”

The organization lamented the bill’s progress in a news release, since the tax credits had propelled some of the state’s most important clean energy projects recently, including Fervo’s Cape Station, located in Beaver County, which is set to become the largest next-generation geothermal project in the world. The incentives also helped to make possible the Green River Energy Center in Emery County, which is poised to become one the country’s largest solar and storage facilities.

“It blocks economic opportunity, puts good-paying jobs out of reach, and makes it harder for families to afford home energy upgrades that lower monthly bills and improve quality of life,” Ashley said in a statement. “These clean energy tax credits have supported some of Utah’s most exciting and forward looking projects, but by voting to rollback these investments, Rep. Moore is turning his back on the clean energy future that Utahns deserve.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/073124_Emery-County-Solar_03-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 10:11:12.972926

,Detroit Environment,2025-05-15 11:31:20+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Riverside wants to become 'the new Detroit.' Can this self-driving electric bus get it there?,"Anthony Solorzano, www.latimes.com, anthony-solorzano",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-15/riverside-self-driving-buses,"It’s electric, tops out at 25 mph, and can only go on a pre-designated route set up by the Riverside Transit Agency.
As of Monday, commuters in Riverside are the first in the country to ride a fully self-driving, publicly accessible bus that is deployed by a city transit agency.
The first bus began serving the Riverside Municipal Airport this week, followed by one in downtown Riverside and another at UC Riverside by the end of the program’s first year.
“Now, the robots are trying to replace us,” quipped bus rider Patrick Gray, 32, while he waited recently at a Riverside stop for a traditional bus to work.
Now up and running, travelers should consider the Ohmio buses as their first or last leg of their journey, officials say.","There is a little shuttle bus in the Inland Empire that’s fueled with big aspirations.

It’s electric, tops out at 25 mph, and can only go on a pre-designated route set up by the Riverside Transit Agency.

But here’s a catch — it also drives itself.

As of Monday, commuters in Riverside are the first in the country to ride a fully self-driving, publicly accessible bus that is deployed by a city transit agency.

It’s one small step for public transportation commuters, and one giant leap toward Riverside becoming the next Motor City, or so the mayor hopes.

“I like to say I have no lesser ambition than to be the new Detroit for vehicle manufacturing,” Riverside Mayor Lock Dawson said. “Riverside is it, we are going to do this for the 21st century.”

In October 2023, the Riverside City Council approved a two-year pilot program to have the RTA operate, staff and maintain three automated, fully electric Ohmio shuttle buses. The first bus began serving the Riverside Municipal Airport this week, followed by one in downtown Riverside and another at UC Riverside by the end of the program’s first year.

To date, other iterations of self-driving buses around the country are limited to private roads or properties, or rely on drivers to lend the occasional hand or foot for certain parts of the route. But not Riverside’s, where officials say the whole route is mapped out and the person behind the wheel is there for just-in-case scenarios, helping passengers and communicating back with RTA headquarters, according to Assistant City Manager Rafael Guzman.

While the experience isn’t supposed to change much for passengers, it can still feel like a sign of big changes to come.

“Now, the robots are trying to replace us,” quipped bus rider Patrick Gray, 32, while he waited recently at a Riverside stop for a traditional bus to work. “I’m used to humans driving things, operating things, with this new age of AI and robotic stuff, it’s just, you know, it’s crazy. ... It shows us that we are moving into a different age of life.”

The program is funded by the Riverside Transit Agency, South Coast Air Quality Management District, Ohmio and the city of Riverside. As part of the deal, Ohmio moved its headquarters from New Zealand to the Inland Empire city, establishing it as the company’s research, development, testing and designated point of sale.

Over its first five years, the company is expected to produce between 500 and 750 buses, which would generate more than $2 million in sales tax for the city. Ohmio buses also operate in New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Luxembourg. There was a pilot program in New York that ran for four months out of JFK International Airport’s long-term parking lot, but that has since concluded.

The program will cost the $2.5 million to relocate Ohmio’s operations to Riverside. Both the city and AQMD are contributing $1 million each and the RTA is chipping in the final $500,000. Each bus sale is expected to generate about $26,250 in sales tax revenue for the city, according to the city’s partnership announcement. As part of the agreement, Ohmio has committed to creating 25 local jobs over the first three years of the program.

One of the first staffers to work on the Ohmio buses is Kimberly Quamina, an RTA worker for 39 years. She spent Tuesday morning learning the ropes of her new role on the bus for the next four months as riders got on and off.

“I’m hoping to retire on one of these buses, that’ll be nice,” Quamina said.

One of her passengers, Nataly Zuniga, said she and her family decided to ride the “funny looking” bus after having lunch at the Riverside Airport Cafe. During the ride Tuesday, the bus made a sudden hard stop when it detected a car on the opposite side of the intersection, surprising Zuniga and the other passengers.

“The detection is too far away,” Zuniga said. “I think they have to narrow it down, it detects anything and that’s where [the bus] stops.”

Despite the sudden stop, she said she felt safe riding the bus and would definitely be open to riding them out in the busier roads.

For now, though, their role in public transportation is on the outskirts.

“In a place like California ... these can help fill some gaps that were created,” said Juan Matute, UCLA’s deputy director of the Institute of Transportation Studies. “This provides another option for when maybe there’s lower ridership to justify transit or maybe they want something that can circulate on the smaller streets a little bit more.”

Ohmio’s arrival in Riverside follows two other clean energy companies that have also recently set up in the city: Voltu, which manufactures medium-duty all-electric trucks; and Hyundai Rotem, which manufactures hydrogen trains.

The buses will follow routes that tap into already existing electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the city and will charge overnight or when not in service, said Zayn Mashat, Ohmio’s director of business development, in an email. At first, they will motor along at a max 15 mph, but will eventually speed up, company officials said. They will collect data along the way and share it with the RTA, which passes it along to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Department of Motor Vehicles in adherence with state and federal law, according to Guzman.

They are also equipped with sensors to detect surroundings and has its stops pre-programmed in, though they can be skipped as needed by the human on board.

“We’re very confident that this is going to be a successful deployment and we have paid particular attention, especially the City Council, with respect to the safety dimensions,” said Guzman.

Now up and running, travelers should consider the Ohmio buses as their first or last leg of their journey, officials say. The first route is operating on a new route, while the two that follow are expected to blend new and existing RTA routes together.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4dde02c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4207x2209+0+298/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F91%2F6096828643c98942c853fd186ef6%2F1502667-me-riverside-autonomous-shuttles-4-gmf.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 09:04:48.914101

Power J.D.","TROY, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Despite a cloud of uncertainty around future EV interest and potential economic headwinds hanging over the automotive industry, consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has remained stable, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study,SM released today. The study reveals that 24% of vehicle shoppers say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV and 35% say they are “somewhat likely,” both of which remain unchanged from a year ago.

“Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, executive director of the EV practice at J.D. Power. “To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns—many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

Following are some key findings of the 2025 study:

EV customers active in cross-shopping: EV shoppers who say they are “very likely” to consider an EV cross-shop an average of 2.9 brands, while those who say they are “somewhat likely” shop an average of 2.8 brands. This is in alignment with the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index Study, SM which found EV buyers shopped 3.0 different dealer brands compared to 2.5 for gas-powered vehicle shoppers. “As more EV options come to market, this should serve as an encouraging sign for automakers because it’s an opportunity for them to gain a foothold and pull shoppers from outside their brands. This year’s study results also show that EV shoppers consider products from mass market and premium brands alike, highlighting the opportunity to capture consumer interest with brands or products that shoppers may not have otherwise considered,” Gruber said.

Purchase price and cost of ownership concerns decline, while charging concerns persist: Charging station availability remains the top concern, with 52% of shoppers citing it as a reason for rejecting EVs. The continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues. However, while consumer rejection due to purchase price has dropped 4 percentage points year over year to 43%, concern with cost of ownership has dropped 2 percentage points to 33%.

Young and higher-income shoppers show most interest but rarely overlap: Only 17% of consumers who are in the 25-49 age range have an annual income of over $100,000. “It’s an interesting dichotomy because younger consumers are the most receptive to EVs, but also the least likely to be able to afford them, while older consumers have the financial means but show less interest,” Gruber said. “Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products.”

Midwest states least enthusiastic about EVs: When looking at EV consideration by region, the lowest shares of consumers who say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV live in Wisconsin and Kentucky (18% each), Minnesota (17%) and Ohio (16%). This is influenced by several factors, including concerns about EV performance in cold climates and the stronger loyalty of consumers in these regions to traditional automakers.

The U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study, now in its fifth year, is an industry benchmark focusing on gauging fully electric or battery electric vehicle shopper consideration. Study content includes overall EV consideration by geography; demographics; vehicle experience and use; lifestyle; and psychographics. It also includes model-level consideration details such as “why buy” findings and analysis of reasons for EV rejection. This year’s study measures responses from 8,164 consumers who intend to buy or lease a new vehicle in the next 12 months and was fielded from January through April 2025.

At the center of the proposed changes is the extended phaseout schedule for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under Section 48E and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) under Section 45Y.
The proposed bill eliminates Section 25D of the residential clean energy credit at the end of 2025.
Adding to the complexity of clean energy financing, the bill proposes eliminating ITC and PTC credit transferability two years after enactment.
One order directed federal agencies to immediately pause the disbursement of funds through the IRA, which proposed spending millions of dollars to promote clean energy.","The U.S. House Ways & Means Committee has issued the initial draft of the 2025 budget reconciliation bill, proposing sweeping revisions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The draft legislation outlines a fundamental realignment of the tax policy that favors utility-scale solar development and domestic manufacturing while eliminating or curtailing several benefits for individual consumers and companies with foreign supply chain dependencies.

At the center of the proposed changes is the extended phaseout schedule for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under Section 48E and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) under Section 45Y. Contrary to earlier expectations of a more abrupt phase-down beginning in 2026, the bill maintains the full value of these credits through 2028. After this time, the credits would decline gradually, dropping to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031, and expiring by 2032.

While utility-scale players stand to benefit from the added clarity and extended runway for credit eligibility, the residential solar sector faces a setback. The proposed bill eliminates Section 25D of the residential clean energy credit at the end of 2025. This 30% tax credit has been a cornerstone of homeowner solar adoption, especially for middle-class families financing rooftop installations through cash or loans. Its removal would disproportionately impact companies that have built their models around direct-to-consumer equipment sales.

In a broader crackdown on foreign involvement in the clean energy supply chain, the bill introduces stringent new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions that could dramatically alter global sourcing dynamics. Modeled after the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, the FEOC rules prohibit tax credit eligibility for projects using materials, components, or intellectual property linked to adversarial nations.

These restrictions apply to the 45X manufacturing credit and the 45Y and 48E credits and define “material assistance” broadly encompassing any critical minerals, subcomponents, recycling processes, or even design elements tied to an FEOC. Specific thresholds restrict ownership, board control, and financial influence from such entities, potentially excluding a large portion of Chinese-manufactured solar components even when final assembly occurs elsewhere.

This policy positions domestic manufacturers for a competitive advantage while creating obstacles for firms that maintain significant operations in or ties to China. The bill also outlines that wind products will be excluded from the 45X manufacturing credit starting in 2028 and that the credit itself would remain in full effect until 2031 before being eliminated without a phase-down in 2032.

Adding to the complexity of clean energy financing, the bill proposes eliminating ITC and PTC credit transferability two years after enactment. This rollback of a key IRA financing provision could hinder project economics for smaller or less capitalized developers who rely on credit transfers to monetize incentives. The loss of transferability would likely increase dependence on traditional tax equity financing structures, which can be more restrictive and less accessible to newer market entrants.

Beyond solar and manufacturing, the draft bill also calls for the removal of other clean energy incentives at the end of 2025, including tax credits for new and used electric vehicles (Sections 30D and 25E), commercial clean vehicles (45W), alternative fuel infrastructure, energy-efficient home improvements (25C), and new energy-efficient home construction (45L). These eliminations reflect a broader trend in the draft toward removing clean energy benefits for individuals while maintaining or adjusting them for large-scale projects.

If passed as written, the bill would represent one of the most significant rewrites of U.S. clean energy tax policy since the IRA’s passage.

Bills restricting renewable energy sources would compound existing risks, Pablo Vegas, the chief executive of ERCOT, said this month.
Mr. Trump has supported cutting renewable energy tax credits, and taken steps to block new wind projects.
“But,” he added, “they’re on the cusp of changing all that.” Legislation that has already passed the State Senate would create a new permitting process for renewable energy projects.
But he does not believe the solution is to restrict renewable energy.","Conservative states with a hands-off approach to development, such as Texas and Oklahoma, have become wind and solar energy dynamos in recent years. But a simultaneous push by Republicans in Washington and in Sun Belt state capitals to cut off tax incentives and tighten permitting regulations threatens to snuff out the red-state renewable energy boom.

The one-two punch underscores the Republicans’ move away from embracing an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy to a one-sided effort to return to fossil fuels. Its success would unwind four years of Democratic efforts to address climate change and advance a clean-energy economy.

The shift has been particularly jarring in Texas, the nation’s top wind power producer, which is second only to California in solar energy and industrial battery storage. Renewable energy companies have announced plans for $64 billion in new investments in Texas, mostly for solar and battery storage projects, since Democrats in Washington passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022. Investments in Texas alone would eclipse the next five biggest states combined.

But on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress began work on legislation that would roll back tax credits for low-carbon energy, using rules that ensure the bill could reach President Trump with simple majorities in the House and Senate.

Rather than object, the Republican-controlled State Senate in Texas has passed — and the State House is currently considering — several regulatory bills to curtail solar and wind projects in favor of new natural gas plants. Long the party of limited regulation and free markets, Republicans are now seeking to impose new rules on how electricity should be produced.

“That’s the choice these lawmakers have to make: ideology or pragmatism,” said Doug Lewin, an energy consultant who writes a newsletter focused on the Texas electricity grid. “Do you hate renewables so much that you’re willing to take out the Texas economy with it?”

Proponents of the new bills say the goal is practical — to increase reliability and balance the effects of federal subsidies for renewable power.

Representative Jared Patterson, a Republican from suburban Dallas, called it leveling “the playing field,” as he lamented the “multiple advantages in the market” enjoyed by renewable energy, at least for now. He has sponsored a bill that would force wind and solar companies to pay for backup power.

At the same time, a warming planet has generated record summer heat and added to that power demand. A heat wave this week was expected to shatter previous electricity demand records for May.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, the state’s grid manager, forecasts demand for power to possibly double within five years. Bills restricting renewable energy sources would compound existing risks, Pablo Vegas, the chief executive of ERCOT, said this month.

But the fight over energy in the United States has become increasingly ideological. Mr. Trump has supported cutting renewable energy tax credits, and taken steps to block new wind projects. Seventeen states, led by New York, have sued in response. Texas was not among them.

In Oklahoma, where companies have announced plans to invest $2 billion in wind, solar and battery projects since 2022, anti-renewable Republican legislators and the state’s attorney general are squaring off against Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who considers himself pro-business.

For years, Texas maintained its freewheeling attitude toward energy development even as other states have been issuing more restrictions on power plants. In Iowa, more than a dozen counties have effectively barred new wind turbines. California’s largest county has put a moratorium on large solar arrays.

“Texas has maintained making it easy,” said Devin Hartman, director of energy and environmental policy at the R Street Institute, a moderate Republican advocacy group. “But,” he added, “they’re on the cusp of changing all that.”

Legislation that has already passed the State Senate would create a new permitting process for renewable energy projects. New wind projects, for instance, would be required to be set back at least 3,000 feet from neighboring property lines, and state regulators would be allowed to veto new renewable energy installations.

Another bill would require utilities to offset new wind and solar generation with an equal amount of “dispatchable” capacity, meaning power generation that can be quickly switched on, usually with natural gas.

“It’s not wrongheaded to ask the question, How much dispatchable do we need for a reliable system?” said Katie Coleman, a lobbyist for the Texas Association of Manufacturers.

But energy experts caution that new natural gas plants face a global backlog on orders of gas turbines. Any new gas projects that aren’t already under development are unlikely to come online before 2030, said John Ketchum, the chief executive of NextEra Energy, one of the country’s largest power producers.

Nearly 91 percent of the electric capacity in line to connect to the grid over the next six years are solar, wind or battery plants, according to ERCOT data. Only about 8 percent are new gas plants.

Even with a state-created fund to subsidize new natural gas-fired power plants, seven of the 17 gas power projects deemed eligible last year for low-interest loans are no longer moving forward.

“Gas turbines are difficult to get,” said Rob Minter, senior vice president for government and regulatory affairs at Engie North America, which builds both renewable and gas-fired power plants. In February, the company withdrew two applications to build subsidized gas plants through the Texas fund, citing delays in procuring equipment.

“So that leaves renewables,” he added, “and we have the ability to put those on the ground in a couple years, not five or 10.”

That message has not swayed the Legislature. The Texas House could soon vote on a bill to require existing wind and solar generators to obtain backup power to supplement the hours when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. The State Senate has already passed it.

“These bills would drive a stake through the heart of the industry,” said Judd Messer, Texas vice president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a clean energy industry trade group.

Debate over electricity production has been a major political issue in Texas since 2021, when a winter storm crippled the power grid, and more than 240 people died. A federal study found the cold weather caused significant failures in natural gas-fueled plants, which can struggle in extreme heat and cold.

Many Republicans blamed wind and solar power anyway.

As with much of the country, Texas’ electricity costs have already been rising. In February, the cost of powering a typical home in the United States rose to about $149 a month, up about $4 from a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration.

And William W. Hogan, who helped design the Texas electricity market and is now a professor of global energy policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said the push to favor fossil fuel generation would most likely further drive up costs, without increasing reliability.

“It’s a new thumb on the scale,” Mr. Hogan said.

A study last month by Aurora Energy Research, commissioned by the Texas Association of Business, concluded that restricting renewable development in Texas could increase electricity prices by 14 percent by 2035, and potentially leave up to 620,000 homes without electricity during extreme weather events.

Ed Hirs, an economist and energy fellow at the University of Houston, said the state does need more natural gas capacity to run during emergencies. But he does not believe the solution is to restrict renewable energy.

“Without that growth of renewables,” he said, “the Texas grid is dead in the water, and so is the economy.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14nat-texas-renewables-1-vgmp/14nat-texas-renewables-1-vgmp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 10:11:35.975981

Xinbo Zhu, Senior VP and CFO, added, ""For the first quarter of 2025, we delivered $1.2 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 11.7%. We reported a positive HLBV impact of $26 million or $0.38 per share. The impact of tariffs combined with lower storage contribution, Recurrent Energy's ongoing transformation, and intracompany eliminations weighed on profitability, resulting in a net loss to shareholders of $34 million or $0.69 per diluted share. Our assets totaled $13.9 billion, driven by growth in project assets and solar power systems, setting the stage for long-term value generation. We concluded the quarter with a cash position of $2.0 billion.""

First Quarter 2025 Results

Total module shipments recognized as revenues in Q1 2025 were 6.9 GW, down 16.0% quarter-over-quarter (""qoq"") and up 9.4% yoy. Of the total, 413 MW were shipped to the Company's own utility-scale solar power projects.

Net revenues were $1.2 billion in Q1 2025, down 21.3% sequentially and 10.0% year-over-year, mainly due to lower sales of battery energy storage systems and solar modules.

Gross profit was $140 million, compared to $217 million in Q4 2024 and $253 million in Q1 2024. Gross margin was 11.7%, compared to 14.3% and 19.0%, respectively. Seasonally lower battery energy storage system sales volumes and trade-related duties impacted the current quarter.

Operating expenses were $195 million, down from $344 million in Q4 2024 and $204 million in Q1 2024. The decrease primarily reflects nil impairment charges in the current quarter and lower shipping and handling costs. Operating expenses represented 16.3% of revenue, compared to 22.6% in Q4 2024 and 15.3% in Q1 2024.

Net loss attributable to Canadian Solar in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Q1 2025 was $34 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $34 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in Q4 2024, and net income of $12 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in Q1 2024.

Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. (non-GAAP) was $60 million, and adjusted loss per share - diluted was $1.07 per share in Q1 2025, compared to a net loss of $99 million or $1.47 per share in Q4 2024, and a net income of $12 million or $0.19 per share in Q1 2024. Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. and adjusted loss per share - diluted in Q1 2025 and Q4 2024 exclude the recognition of income using hypothetical liquidation at book value (""HLBV"") method. The Company uses the HLBV method to attribute income and loss to its tax equity investors. Please see Recurrent Energy - HLBV for definition and About Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation to nearest GAAP measures.

Net cash flow used in operating activities in Q1 2025 was $264 million as a result of higher working capital, compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of $66 million in Q4 2024 and net cash flow used in operating activities of $291 million in Q1 2024.

Total debt, including financing liabilities, was $5.7 billion as of March 31, 2025, including $2.4 billion, $3.0 billion, and $0.3 billion related to CSI Solar, Recurrent Energy, and convertible notes, respectively. Total debt rose from $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2024, mainly due to new borrowings for capacity investment, working capital, and development of projects and operational assets. Total non-recourse debt as of March 31, 2025, was $1.3 billion.

Business Segments

The Company operates in two reportable segments: CSI Solar, focused on solar modules and battery energy storage manufacturing and products, and Recurrent Energy, focused on utility-scale solar power and battery energy storage project development and operation.

Recurrent Energy

As of March 31, 2025, Recurrent Energy held a leading position with a total global solar project development pipeline of approximately 27 GWp and a battery energy storage project development pipeline of 76 GWh.

The business model consists of three key drivers:

Electricity revenue from operating portfolio to drive stable, diversified cash flows in growth markets with stable currencies;

Asset sales (solar power and battery energy storage) in the rest of the world to drive cash-efficient growth model, as value from project sales will help fund growth in operating assets in stable currency markets; and

Power services (O&M) through long-term operations and maintenance (""O&M"") contracts, currently with 13 GW of contracted projects, to drive stable and long-term recurring earnings and synergies with the project development platform.

Project Development Pipeline – Solar

As of March 31, 2025, Recurrent Energy's total solar project development pipeline was 26.9 GWp, including 1.9 GWp under construction, 4.5 GWp of backlog, and 20.5 GWp of projects in advanced and early-stage development, defined as follows:

Backlog projects are late-stage projects that have passed their risk cliff date and are expected to start construction in the next 1-4 years. A project's risk cliff date is the date on which the project passes the last high-risk development stage and varies depending on the country where it is located. Typically, this occurs after the project has received all the required environmental and regulatory approvals, and entered into interconnection agreements and offtake contracts, including feed-in tariff (""FIT"") arrangements and power purchase agreements (""PPAs""). A significant majority of backlog projects are contracted (i.e., have secured a PPA or FIT), and the remaining have a reasonable assurance of securing PPAs.

Advanced pipeline projects are mid-stage projects that have secured or have more than 90% certainty of securing an interconnection agreement.

Early-stage pipeline projects are early-stage projects controlled by Recurrent Energy that are in the process of securing interconnection.

While the magnitude of the Company's project development pipeline is an important indicator of potential expanded power generation and battery energy storage capacity as well as potential future revenue growth, the development of projects in its pipeline is inherently uncertain. If the Company does not successfully complete the pipeline projects in a timely manner, it may not realize the anticipated benefits of the projects to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the Company's guidance and estimates for its future operating and financial results assume the completion of certain solar projects and battery energy storage projects that are in its pipeline. If the Company is unable to execute on its actionable pipeline, it may miss its guidance, which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares and its business, financial condition, or results of operations.

HLBV

The Company applies the HLBV method to account for its contractual relationships with tax equity investors in U.S. solar energy and battery energy storage projects. This method which allocates income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reflects the changes in the amounts that tax equity investors would hypothetically receive upon liquidation at the beginning and end of each reporting period, after considering any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between our subsidiaries and tax equity investors.

The following table presents Recurrent Energy's total solar project development pipeline.

Project Development Pipeline – Battery Energy Storage

As of March 31, 2025, Recurrent Energy's total battery energy storage project development pipeline was 75.7 GWh, including 9.8 GWh under construction and in backlog, and 65.9 GWh of projects in advanced and early-stage development.

The table below sets forth Recurrent Energy's total battery energy storage project development pipeline.

Business Outlook

The Company's business outlook is based on management's current views and estimates given factors such as existing market conditions, order book, production capacity, input material prices, foreign exchange fluctuations, the anticipated timing of project sales, and the global economic environment. This outlook is subject to uncertainty with respect to, among other things, customer demand, project construction and sale schedules, product sales prices and costs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical conflicts. Management's views and estimates are subject to change without notice.

In Q2 2025, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 23% and 25%. Total module shipments recognized as revenues by CSI Solar are expected to be in the range of 7.5 GW to 8.0 GW, including approximately 500 MW to the Company's own projects. Total battery energy storage shipments by CSI Solar in Q2 2025 are expected to be in the range of 2.4 GWh to 2.6 GWh.

For the full year of 2025, the Company expects CSI Solar's total module shipments to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW, including approximately 1 GW to the Company's projects. Conditional on ongoing trade policy developments, the Company expects CSI Solar's total battery energy storage shipments to be in the range of 7 GWh to 9 GWh, including approximately 1 GWh to the Company's own projects. The Company's total revenue is expected to be in the range of $6.1 billion to $7.1 billion.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""We expect second quarter performance to be bolstered by strong energy storage shipments. We continue to operate in an environment of global pricing volatility and evolving policy uncertainty that limits margin visibility. Our updated full year guidance reflects our current assessment of ongoing market and geopolitical developments, as we adhere to our profit-first strategy.""

According to the authors, Earth's crust has produced enough hydrogen over the past 1 billion years to meet our current energy needs for 170,000 years.
Ophiolites are chunks of Earth's crust and upper mantle that once sat beneath the ocean, but were later thrust onto land.
""Clean"" hydrogen from underground reservoirs has a much smaller carbon footprint, because it occurs naturally.
Earth's crust produces ""plenty of hydrogen,"" Ballentine said, and it is now a question of following the ingredient list to find it.","Recent breakthroughs suggest that hydrogen reservoirs are buried in countless regions of the world, including at least 30 U.S. states.

Finding such reservoirs could help accelerate a global energy transition, but until now, geologists only had a piecemeal understanding of how large hydrogen accumulations form — and where to find them.

""The game of the moment is to find where it has been released, accumulated and preserved,"" Chris Ballentine, a professor and chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford and lead author of a new review article on hydrogen production in Earth's crust, told Live Science in an email.

Ballentine's new paper starts to answer those questions. According to the authors, Earth's crust has produced enough hydrogen over the past 1 billion years to meet our current energy needs for 170,000 years. What's still unclear is how much of that hydrogen could be accessed and profitably extracted.

In the new review, published Tuesday (May 13) in the journal Nature Reviews Earth and Environment, the researchers draw up an ""ingredient"" list of geological conditions that stimulate the creation and build-up of natural hydrogen gas belowground, which should make it easier to hunt for reservoirs.

""The specific conditions for hydrogen gas accumulation and production are what a number of exploration companies (e.g. Koloma, funded by a consortium led by Bill Gates Breakthrough Energy fund, Hy-Terra funded by Fortescue, and Snowfox, funded by BP [British Petroleum] and RioTinto) are looking at carefully and this will vary for different geological environments,"" Ballentine said.

Natural hydrogen reservoirs require three key elements to form: a source of hydrogen, reservoir rocks and natural seals that trap the gas underground. There are a dozen natural processes that can create hydrogen, the simplest being a chemical reaction that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen — and any type of rock that hosts at least one of these processes is a potential hydrogen source, Ballentine said.

""One place that is attracting a lot of interest is in Kansas where a feature called the mid continental rift, formed about 1 billion years ago, created a huge accumulation of rocks (mainly basalts) that can react with water to form hydrogen,"" he said. ""The search is on here for geological structures that may have trapped and accumulated the hydrogen generated.""

Based on knowledge of how other gases are released from rocks underground, the review's authors suggest that tectonic stress and high heat flow may release hydrogen deep inside Earth's crust. ""This helps to bring the hydrogen to the near surface where it might accumulate and form a commercial resource,"" Ballentine said.

Within the crust, a wide range of common geological contexts could prove promising for exploration companies, the review found, ranging from ophiolite complexes to large igneous provinces and Archaean greenstone belts.

Ophiolites are chunks of Earth's crust and upper mantle that once sat beneath the ocean, but were later thrust onto land. In 2024, researchers discovered a massive hydrogen reservoir within an ophiolite complex in Albania. Igneous rocks are those solidified from magma or lava, and Archaean greenstone belts are up to 4 billion-year-old formations that are characterized by green minerals, such as chlorite and actinolite.

The conditions discussed in the review are the ""first principles"" for hydrogen exploration, study co-author Jon Gluyas, a professor of geoenergy, carbon capture and storage at Durham University in the U.K., said in a statement. The research outlines the key ingredients that companies should consider when developing their exploration strategies, including processes through which hydrogen might migrate or be destroyed underground.

""We know for example that underground microbes readily feast on hydrogen,"" co-author Barbara Sherwood Lollar, a professor of Earth sciences at the University of Toronto, said in the statement. So environments where bacteria could come in contact with hydrogen-producing rocks may not be great places to look for reservoirs, Sherwood Lollar said.

Hydrogen is used to make key industrial chemicals such as methanol and ammonia, which is a component in most fertilizers. The gas could also aid the transition away from fossil fuels, as hydrogen can power both cars and power plants.

But hydrogen today is produced from hydrocarbons, meaning manufacture of the gas comes with huge carbon emissions. ""Clean"" hydrogen from underground reservoirs has a much smaller carbon footprint, because it occurs naturally.

Earth's crust produces ""plenty of hydrogen,"" Ballentine said, and it is now a question of following the ingredient list to find it.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zwNfHnfLzP5Da8PahxVABQ.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 07:07:49.078490

The American Clean Power Association (ACP) has published its Clean Power Annual Market Report | 2024, highlighting the sector's contribution to the national economy. Leading purchasers of clean electricity included companies from the Fortune 100 and 500 lists, particularly utilities and major technology firms. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google together contracted 11.3GW of clean energy capacity in 2024—comparable to the total installed clean power in Florida, the USA’s fifth largest clean energy state. This reflects the increasing demand for renewable energy to power the expanding data centre sector.

According to the report, the clean energy industry supported 1.4 million jobs across the USA in 2024 and attracted nearly $80 billion in investment.

Key developments in 2024

Scaling and deployment:

The clean power sector deployed nearly 49GW of new infrastructure, backed by close to $80 billion in investment.

A total of 45 new manufacturing projects were launched, accounting for more than $9 billion in domestic industrial investment.

For the first time, electricity generated from wind and utility-scale solar surpassed coal, together contributing almost 16% of national electricity generation.

At the end of 2023, the USA interconnection queue totalled 2,367GW, with over 95% consisting of wind, solar, and storage projects.

Rising demand and grid needs:

New clean energy capacity will be vital to meeting short- and medium-term electricity demand, with renewables typically faster to deploy than conventional sources.

By 2040, the USA will require over 900GW of renewable energy and battery capacity, in addition to 60–100GW of new gas-fired power, to maintain grid reliability.

Economic impact:

The clean energy sector supports 1.4 million jobs—approximately 460,000 directly, with nearly one million in supply chains and related industries.

Over the past 20 years, clean power companies have invested more than $600 billion, contributing to energy infrastructure upgrades and economic growth in all 50 states.

Keith Matheny reports for Detroit Free Press.

In short:

Groundwater beneath BASF’s Wyandotte facility is discharging pollutants — including mercury at thousands of times legal limits — into the Detroit River at up to 60 gallons per minute.

State regulators say BASF is violating a 1986 consent decree requiring it to prevent this flow, but the company disputes the interpretation and insists it is in compliance.

A full cleanup plan involving a 1.7-mile underground barrier and large-scale storage tanks won’t begin construction until 2027, leaving years of continued pollution.

Why this matters:

The Detroit River, a source of drinking water and a vital ecological artery, continues to absorb toxic discharges from legacy industrial sites — a pattern repeated across the Great Lakes region. In this case, mercury and PFAS are seeping into the river from groundwater beneath the BASF Wyandotte plant, threatening aquatic life and raising alarms for public health. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can impair memory, vision, and motor skills, particularly in children and fetuses.

Not all Colorado leaders are fans of the clean energy mandates and subsidies.","Coming in seventh out of 50, is that a standing ovation or a single slow clap? Or somewhere in between?

A muted victory, perhaps, as a new national ranking puts Colorado’s performance in switching to renewable, clean electricity as seventh-best out of the 50 states.

“That puts it squarely in the leadership category,” said Henry Stiles, advocate with the Environment Colorado Research and Policy Center. The nonprofit group carried out Colorado research for a national report by the Environment America Research and Policy Center.

“That being said, given that in Colorado solar power alone could produce 183 times as much electricity as the state consumed in 2020, there’s still lots of room for renewable energy to grow,” Stiles acknowledged, in an email interview.

The study adds up electricity generated by solar, wind and geothermal sources in each state, and compares how that has grown since 2015 as clean energy policies kicked in at the federal and state levels.

The report’s hover-over national map pops up Colorado with 43% of electricity needs generated by solar and wind in 2024, up from a mere 15% in 2015. That’s impressive growth, but you’ll notice some neighboring states, with perhaps a lesser reputation for environmental progressivism, are a healthier shade of red for renewables production.

Kansas generated 74% of its electricity needs with solar and wind in 2024. Iowa was at an astounding 83% last year.

“Great Plains wind is one of America’s great renewable energy sources,” Stiles said. “Kansas and Iowa started harnessing that resource more than a decade ago to produce pollution-free electricity and to this day, those states remain top leaders of wind energy production in America.”

Wind power in Iowa in 2024 produced enough electricity for more than 4 million homes, while wind in Kansas produced enough for 2.8 million homes. That’s more than twice as many households existing in either state.

“Every state in America had enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity demand in 2020, so lack of renewable energy resources isn’t the limiting factor,” Stiles said. “Generally, renewables have grown where supportive policies have encouraged them to thrive.”

The federal and state policies that speed up the transition to renewable energy, according to the research center, include:

Setting high targets for replacing coal and natural gas power plants with clean solar and wind, as well as minimum sales of clean fuel cars and trucks. Colorado has done both, with a target of 80% renewable generation of power plant electricity by 2030, which the state is on track to meet or exceed. The state has also been on track to meet EV sales goals, though EV sales are slowing in parts of the country.

Maintaining and distributing clean energy incentives in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

Requiring utilities to support net metering for homeowners’ solar projects, compensating them for the extra electricity generated and put back onto the grid. Also making interconnection of home solar and community solar “easy and hassle-free”.

Continuing to promote energy efficiency as a way of reducing demand for new electrical generation; upgrading building codes and standards to lower greenhouse gas emissions; and appliance efficiency.

Many of those policies are or could be threatened by changes in the new Trump administration. They’ve already canceled the long-running Energy Star guides to manufacturing and buying the most efficient appliances. Republican budget negotiators are considering ending renewable energy supports like the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying new electric vehicles, and tax credits for utility-scale solar or carbon sequestration projects.

Not all Colorado leaders are fans of the clean energy mandates and subsidies. U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Republican from the 8th Congressional District, Wednesday touted his vote in favor of the Republican-led budget package that “promises to prioritize American energy, repeal Green New Deal policies, and strengthen the economy.”

The Environmental Defense Fund, though, said pulling back subsidies would stall not only environmental progress, but economic advances based on new technologies.

In 2009, it found that greenhouse gases are air pollutants that endanger public health and welfare by driving climate change. As such, gases like carbon dioxide and methane are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act.

Now, despite increasing and intensifying droughts, wildfires, and other climate-change fueled disasters, Trump’s EPA is changing course. It is seeking to withdraw the endangerment finding entirely or weaken its role in regulating pollution sources such as cars and trucks, power plants, and fossil fuel drilling.

The stakes could not be higher for the health and well-being of communities across the U.S. Earthjustice will see the administration in court if it attempts to revoke this commonsense determination.

Read on to learn more about where the finding came from and why it matters.

A Supreme Court order and a pile of scientific evidence

The EPA’s determination was the result of a historic Supreme Court case. In 2007, the court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

This meant that the EPA was required to determine whether greenhouse gases pose a risk to public health, and make rules to protect the public if so. Faced with a trove of scientific research that links greenhouse gases to a warming, chaotic climate, the agency released the endangerment finding in 2009. Since then, it has served as a basis for rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

The case for the finding has only gotten stronger

As of 2024, the last 10 years have all been the hottest on record amid increasing extreme weather events. The cost of natural disasters driven by climate change is skyrocketing. As just one example, the wildfires that ravaged L.A. this winter are estimated to have caused more than $250 billion in damage.

Meanwhile, the endangerment finding has withstood several industry-backed legal challenges, including one that Earthjustice helped defeat in court. In 2023, the U.S. Circuit Court in D.C. unanimously rejected the most recent challenge by an oil industry group and a collection of climate deniers, and the Supreme Court declined their request to appeal.

Looming threats from the Trump administration

In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would begin to “formally reconsider the Endangerment Finding” in response to President Trump’s day-one executive order, “Unleashing American Energy.” Project 2025, the polluter-friendly agenda that has guided many of the Trump administration’s policy decisions, called for exactly this move.

What are some of the major regulations that depend on the finding?

Limits on power plant emissions

Power plants are responsible for roughly a quarter of climate pollution in the country — particularly carbon dioxide, which makes up 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet until last year, these plants had a free pass to dump climate-warming emissions into the air.

In 2024, the EPA proposed standards that require new gas and existing coal-fired power plants to reduce their carbon pollution by 90%. The agency projected that the new standards would cut annual carbon emissions by the same amount as taking 328 million gas-powered cars off the road. The rule also has significant public health benefits, potentially averting up to 1,200 premature deaths a year by 2035.

Limits on vehicle emissions

Another giant source of carbon dioxide is transportation. Emissions from gas-powered vehicles make up the largest source of CO2 in the country. In March 2024, the EPA finalized new car pollution standards that move us towards a pollution-free future. The agency lowered the maximum amount of tailpipe emissions allowed from new cars, starting in model year 2027.

This isn’t a ban on gas cars; instead, it pushes automakers to increase the amount of zero-emissions vehicles per fleet each year to balance out emissions from gas-powered cars and light trucks. The new standards represent an almost 50% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to existing standards for model year 2026 vehicles.

Limits on methane emissions from oil and gas drilling

As the country transitions to a clean energy economy, the fossil fuel industry has tried to frame “natural” methane gas as a climate-friendly energy source. It’s not: Methane traps over 80 times more heat in the atmosphere than CO2. It is responsible for approximately one-third of the global warming we are experiencing today. (Both CO2 and methane are major contributors to the climate crisis, and CO2 remains the most abundant greenhouse gas.)

Each year, fossil fuel companies leak or deliberately vent 13 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere during oil and gas operations. In 2023, after years of legal advocacy by Earthjustice, the Biden administration issued a final rule that cuts 80% of methane from those oil and gas facilities, which are the main source of methane emissions.

The rule requires industries to adopt precise methane detection technology, update facility equipment to run on zero emissions, and reduce “fugitive emissions” — unintended methane emission leaks from oil and natural gas equipment, like pipelines and storage tanks.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are PFAS bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

A global study found that over a quarter of sampled river sites in 104 countries had unsafe levels of pharmaceutical contamination, including antibiotics and antidepressants.

In low-income countries with weak wastewater infrastructure, drug pollution is especially severe and can harm ecosystems by altering wildlife behavior and reducing microbial diversity.

Climate change intensifies the problem by altering river flows and increasing antibiotic-resistant bacteria through prolonged low-level exposure in warming waters.

— Michael Bertram, study co-author and behavioral ecologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences

Why this matters:

Drug pollution in rivers and oceans is a growing but largely invisible threat to environmental and public health. These contaminants, though often diluted, can alter animal behavior, disrupt ecosystems, and help bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics. Warming waters and more frequent extreme weather — driven by climate change — exacerbate these effects by either concentrating pollutants during droughts or releasing untreated sewage during floods. Antibiotic resistance, in particular, is a ticking time bomb that threatens to render some modern medicines useless. Meanwhile, contamination can ripple through the food chain, from algae and fish to top predators, including humans. These chemicals don't just vanish; they persist, travel, and interact with wildlife in ways scientists are only beginning to understand.

In short:

Cities like Jakarta are investing in cleaner, more connected bus networks, such as the TransJakarta system, and offering fare-free minibuses to encourage ridership.

Programs offering free transit, like in Tallinn, Luxembourg, and Kansas City, show mixed results, with some users shifting from walking or biking rather than from driving.

Some cities are discouraging car use through measures like congestion fees, taxes, and eliminating parking to promote public transit and reduce pollution.

Key quote:

""The major challenge here, or the major homework here, is to push people to use public transport.""

— Gonggomtua Sitanggang, Southeast Asia director, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy

Why this matters:

Cities choked by traffic and smog are facing a transportation crossroads. Private vehicles are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and their overuse contributes to urban sprawl, road deaths, and public health problems ranging from asthma to heart disease. Public transportation offers a lower-emission alternative, yet simply making buses free or adding a few routes won’t be enough. Many people are deeply attached to their cars for comfort, convenience, and social status, especially where public transit is seen as slow, unsafe, or unreliable. Efforts like redesigning cities to favor transit, adding protected bus lanes, and connecting neighborhoods through microtransit are significant steps toward shifting behavior. As urban populations rise, making it easier — and more appealing — for people to leave their cars behind may determine whether cities can meet climate goals and protect public health.

Denka Performance Elastomer has paused all operations at its neoprene-producing facility in St. John Parish, citing $109 million in losses, dwindling demand, and stricter environmental regulations under former President Biden.

The Biden administration introduced rules targeting chloroprene emissions and sued Denka to cut pollution, but President Trump’s Justice Department dropped the case in March, calling it ideological overreach.

Local residents, many of whom have lost loved ones to cancer, expressed cautious hope at the closure of the plant but remained concerned the site could be sold to another polluter with little change in emissions.

Chloroprene, the chemical produced by the Denka plant, is classified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” Though Denka claims an 80% reduction in emissions, federal air monitors consistently report chloroprene levels far exceeding safety guidelines. The plant’s suspension may offer temporary relief, but it does not erase decades of toxic exposure or guarantee that future owners won’t resume harmful operations.

In short:

A leaked draft of the Interior Department’s 2025–2030 strategic plan calls for maximizing economic output from federal lands by streamlining permits for mining, drilling, and other industrial uses.

The plan proposes returning federal lands to state control, reducing monument sizes, eliminating some endangered species protections and downplaying climate, conservation, and tribal responsibilities.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has already begun implementing parts of the plan, including opening 87,000 acres to hunting and fishing and cutting environmental review requirements.

Key quote:

“The strategic plan clearly puts extraction and sell-off of public lands first.”

— Aaron H. Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities

Why this matters:

Expanding drilling and mining on public lands increases the risk of air and water pollution, disrupts fragile ecosystems, and contributes to climate change. At the same time, dismantling endangered species protections and rolling back public input processes reduces transparency and oversight. The proposed changes revive decades-old debates about whether federal lands should be preserved for public benefit or exploited for private profit — a tension that cuts across political, ecological and cultural lines. Decisions made by the Interior Department ripple through rural communities, tribal nations, and urban water supplies alike. The Trump administration’s push, rooted in the Project 2025 blueprint, marks a significant departure from recent federal policy and could set a course that’s difficult to reverse.

In short:

Oil and gas companies used over 10 billion gallons of Rio Grande water for drilling from 2021 to 2024 — enough to supply over 100,000 Texas households for a year.

Despite voluntary pledges to reduce freshwater use, companies like Kingsley Water Company continue selling large volumes of surface water from drought-stressed rivers for fracking.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality does not track how much of this water is used specifically for drilling or fracking, raising concerns about transparency and oversight.

Key quote:

“We’re not doing any better than four years ago.”

— Martin Castro, watershed science director, Rio Grande International Study Center

Why this matters:

As drought tightens its grip on the American Southwest, water once reserved for drinking and farming is increasingly being diverted to extract fossil fuels. The Rio Grande, lifeblood for millions and sole source of water for cities like Laredo, is running dry as temperatures rise and rainfall dwindles. Meanwhile, oil and gas companies exploit legal loopholes to buy and use river water for fracking — removing it permanently from the water cycle. This shift deepens a long-standing tension between energy production and environmental protection in Texas. Farmers have abandoned crops. Towns are exploring expensive desalination and import options. Salty, low-flowing rivers are more vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss. With water rights favoring those who can pay, the system rewards short-term profit over long-term survival.

In short:

Yale researchers found that eight of the 10 most popular podcasts have shared false or misleading claims about climate change, often promoting the idea that climate policies don’t work or that global warming is beneficial.

Podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience and Stay Free with Russell Brand have minimized the environmental harm of meat production, contradicting major scientific findings linking animal agriculture to emissions and deforestation.

Experts say podcasts can foster trust through informal tones, but many lack the editorial rigor of traditional media, leaving listeners vulnerable to misinformation.

Key quote:

“Of the 10 most popular online shows, eight have spread false or misleading information about climate change.”

— Yale Climate Connections report

Why this matters:

Misinformation about climate change doesn’t need to come in the form of outright denial. Today’s most effective climate deniers don’t necessarily reject the science — they erode trust in solutions. They argue that going vegetarian won’t matter, that warming will benefit crops, or that green policies are just veiled government overreach. This narrative, broadcast by influential podcasters to millions, makes inaction seem reasonable. When celebrity voices like Joe Rogan or Russell Brand downplay meat’s climate toll or mock efforts to cut emissions, they reinforce myths that stall urgent policy and personal shifts. The science is clear: industrial meat production is one of the biggest drivers of greenhouse gases, biodiversity loss and water pollution. Yet thanks in part to media echo chambers and algorithms, even casual listeners can absorb misleading views as common sense.

In short:

Two independent adjusters said Allstate pressured them to revise damage assessments downward or replaced them with more compliant adjusters.

Homeowners described receiving initial estimates far below actual repair costs, only for subsequent assessments to be cut again after internal reviews.

Lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, called for accountability after hearing widespread claims of manipulation and underpayment by insurance companies.

Key quote:

“Frequently, these alterations and deletions are simply false. There is no room for discussion. If an adjuster resists, the claim is reassigned to someone who complies.”

— Clifford Millikan, property adjuster, Pilot Catastrophe Services

Why this matters:

As climate-driven storms become more intense and frequent, millions of Americans will rely on their insurance companies to help them recover. But when insurers appear more focused on reducing losses than helping policyholders rebuild, the public safety net frays. The testimony from adjusters and homeowners paints a troubling picture of systematic efforts to downplay damage and deny fair compensation, especially after catastrophic weather events. These allegations echo patterns seen after previous disasters like Hurricane Ian and recent California wildfires, where residents accused insurers of withholding or drastically reducing payments. With more storms on the horizon and rebuilding costs climbing, especially in under-resourced communities, delayed or denied claims can deepen trauma, prolong displacement, and force families into debt.

However, the agency now plans to extend that compliance deadline by two years, to 2031, and is launching a new outreach program, called PFAS OUTreach, to support struggling water systems through funding, technical assistance, and regulatory guidance.

“EPA will uphold strong standards to protect Americans from these chemicals while providing more time and flexibility for communities to meet them,” Zeldin said.

The move has drawn praise from water utility associations, which say the original timelines were unrealistic for communities still evaluating treatment options.

Critics, however, warn that delays could prolong public exposure to toxic substances linked to serious health risks.

Reporting from St John’s, Antigua

With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.

It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.

Nicknamed the ""Nature Island"", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.

To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.

The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.

Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.

""We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,"" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.

And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.

Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.

Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.

The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.

It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).

The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.

""Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,"" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. ""Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.""

Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.

""Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,"" Mr Blachar explains. ""It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.""

Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.

""There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,"" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process ""decimated wildlife"" including endemic frogs.

Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (£11.3m).

Dr Henderson admits that the project is ""not easy"" for a country that ""faced a big challenge"" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists ""it will be worth it in the end"".

Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.

Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.

Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become ""a hub"" for geothermal technology.

Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.

With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.

Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.

It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.

Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.

Mr John says that the facility will ""serve as a test case for an attractive alternative"" to fossil fuels. ""The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here – both what worked and what didn't,"" he adds.

The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.

OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a ""bold and visionary step"".

""As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,"" he tells the BBC.

""This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2ed4/live/2f2c1d90-3007-11f0-a64d-f72bff507fef.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 07:08:09.012393

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them.
It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in the announcement.

PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been used for decades to waterproof and stainproof a variety of products including clothing, cosmetics, upholstery and firefighting foams. They're sometimes called ""forever chemicals"" because they contain strong molecular bonds that persist for decades. Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked with harms to human health, such as certain cancers or damage to the liver and immune systems.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them. It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

Now, the EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it's rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.

""That doesn't mean that [the limits] gets weaker…when I go through a process and we follow the law, at the end of it, the final [levels] might be a lower number, not a higher number,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Congressional hearing on May 14.

Some environmental advocates expressed skepticism.

""The way the issue is being framed [in the announcement] is not about providing additional protections or making it stricter,"" says Anna Reade, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's about providing relief in terms of cost to water systems.""

Groups representing water utilities praised the move.

""We strongly support the agency's decision to rescind the regulations…and ensure future rulemakings respect the Safe Drinking Water Act process,"" read a joint email statement from the heads of the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, two groups that have sued the EPA over its PFAS regulation.

They said the process requires EPA to construct rules that ""maximize public health benefits in a cost-effective manner. This is critical for water systems and their communities, because the process helps ensure every ratepayer dollar is directed toward the most pressing public health risks.""

The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade. While she's concerned that the agency may attempt to weaken the rule regardless, ""The real damage right now is that it's delaying movement towards drinking water protections for PFAS,"" she says.

The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.

According to EPA analysis, it would cost $1.5 billion a year for water companies to comply with the regulation. The benefits of reducing PFAS in drinking water would equal or exceed the costs, the agency said, in terms of less cancer and fewer heart attacks, strokes and birth complications in the affected population.

Health advocates worry that the move will delay the removal of these chemicals from drinking water and that more people will be exposed to chemicals that may contribute to chronic health problems.

Electric vehicles (really!)

The idea behind a new partnership between vehicle-to-grid integration platform ChargeScape and software platform Leap is that EVs don’t have to be liabilities to the electric grid, but can collectively serve as assets on the scale of power plants.

The companies announced in a news release Wednesday that they’re teaming up “to accelerate electric vehicle participation in grid services programs across the United States.” ChargeScape and Leap said they’re trying to create “the largest EV virtual power plant” (VPP) in the country.

How does it work? A VPP is a pool of aggregated energy resources—like EV batteries—that can coordinate with grid operators to send power to the grid during times of need. Leap’s focus is on helping tech companies scale VPPs.

“We help them turn their millions of devices and customers into a resource that, to grid operators, looks just like a traditional power plant—only, as we all know, it’s much faster and much cheaper to build,” Jason Michaels, Leap’s CEO, told Tech Brew.

ChargeScape, meanwhile, is a platform that wirelessly connects with EVs and, in partnership with utilities, manages the flow of electricity in line with grid conditions. The startup, which launched last year, has the backing of BMW, Ford, Honda, and Nissan, with other automakers slated to join later this year.

Automakers are investing in the technology as part of the industry’s efforts to ease the EV charging experience for consumers, and deliver on the promise of vehicle-to-grid integration so that EV charging can actually benefit, rather than strain, energy grids. One of the potential benefits for EV drivers is the ability to sell power back to grid operators when demand is high.

“These automakers are committed to selling EVs, and they want to make the at-home charging experience as easy and low-cost as possible for their customers,” ChargeScape CEO Joseph Vellone, who will be participating in Tech Brew’s Power Shift event in New York City on May 29, previously told us.

Emerging vehicle-to-grid technologies allow EVs to discharge power back to buildings and grids. The opportunities around this technology are taking shape amid an increase in demand for electricity, driven in part by more EVs plugging in and construction of new data centers to support AI.

“There’s the immediate need of providing resiliency to the grid, and being able to have price-responsive loads that can reduce demand at critical times to be able to provide support to the grid and avoid blackouts,” Michaels told us. “There’s a chance for these EVs to be very responsive to grid needs and reduce loads at critical times when the grid is under stress.”

Heat wave: The initiative is rolling out just in time for summer, when the grid is especially vulnerable. PJM, the country’s largest power grid, recently warned that expected extreme heat this summer could lead to power outages. After launching in California, Michaels said the companies are eyeing Texas and New York as their next markets.

“The other solution that this brings is not so much about the stresses we have now, but how do we enable the grid to absorb 50 gigawatts-plus of data center and AI load, as well as the electrification of everything? Bringing back manufacturing, electrification of transportation—that’s all increasing electrical loads in the US in a way that we haven’t seen before,” he said. “You really need these virtual power plants.”",https://storage.morningbrew.com/gif/2022-10-31/image-c466d09da20a1c457b19ae2806d56d590c3b5f22-1500x1000-gif/electric-power-charge-0322.webp,N,,2025-05-15 07:08:15.901687

Key Takeaways:

The House Ways & Means Committee’s proposal is sure to impact companies currently relying on existing financial breaks and funding.

Companies still have time to lobby against the loss of the IRA credits.

The House Ways and Means Committee released its initial proposal for a budget reconciliation bill, and it includes massive cuts to clean energy tax credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The proposed cuts come on top of reductions proposed by the Energy and Commerce, Natural Resource and Transportation committees. They include:

Early phase-out of clean energy credits. Originally scheduled to function through 2032, the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit would begin to fall away in 2029, leaving renewable energy projects with fewer years of financial incentives and companies with net-zero targets with fewer low-carbon options to power their operations.

Pullback of Department of Energy loans. Rescinding unspent billions in funds from the Loan Program Office would severely limit the impact of the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which bolsters American auto manufacturing; the Energy Infrastructure Financing Reinvestment Program, which subsidizes new clean energy projects and the revitalization of communities affected by legacy energy production; and the Tribal Energy Loan Program.

Shrinking the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. While the EPA continues to be tied up in court as it attempts to defund the $20 billion allocated to “America’s green bank,” provider of clean energy and technology loans to local businesses and communities, the proposal would repeal any still-unobligated funds.

Limiting the Advanced Manufacturing Credit. Businesses taking advantage of this credit, which supports the development of a domestic supply chain for renewable energy technology and energy storage components, would be prohibited from importing components or raw materials from “foreign entities of concern” — most critically China, causing companies like Ford, which announced the construction of a $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan as a result of the credit, to reevaluate any current projects.

These four examples are but a fraction of the climate funding negatively impacted by the committee’s proposal. That said, companies can still lobby for the continuation of IRA credits until the House vote. In the meantime, we here at Trellis have a question for our readers:

“States — whether it’s California or any state — need the federal government as these disasters get more and more intense,” Maysmith said.
“Disasters are best when they’re managed at the state and local level,” agency officials wrote in an email.
“Dissolving FEMA would leave a void that state governments cannot pretend to fill,” Fabian wrote in a statement.
It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” FEMA officials wrote in the release.","The recent firing of the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is just the latest in a string of blows for the nation’s top disaster-response agency, which has been repeatedly undercut by the Trump administration’s efforts to rein in spending and restructure the federal government.

The dismissal of acting Director Cameron Hamilton on May 8 adds to ongoing layoffs, budget cuts, grant cancellations and leadership changes at FEMA, and officials now say the agency could run out of money as soon as July. That’s just in time for “danger season” — the time of year when extreme weather events typically peak and converge.

Experts say the turmoil at FEMA will leave millions of Americans vulnerable as climate-change-fueled disasters get worse in the months and years ahead — particularly as President Trump seeks to shift more of the burden of disaster response away from the federal government and onto the states. In the wake of January’s destructive firestorm in Los Angeles, FEMA notably opted to break from its decades-long tradition of testing soil for contaminants, as The Times first reported.

“I’m very worried about what the next few months look like for communities that are going to be impacted by a wildfire, or a tornado, or a hurricane, or a flood,” said Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. “The assistance that we have come to rely upon is no longer there. It’s just not there.”

In recent months, the president has called for shrinking or even eliminating FEMA, which he accused in a Jan. 24 executive order of overspending and political bias. At a news conference in L.A. after the fires, Trump described FEMA as a “very expensive and mostly failed situation.”

“You don’t need FEMA — you need a good state government,” he said.

But California, along with the rest of the nation, is struggling to keep pace with more frequent and destructive environmental disasters fueled by human-caused climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration documented 27 weather- and climate-related disasters in 2024 that each measured at least $1 billion in losses, just shy of the record 28 billion-dollar disasters set in 2023.

Over the last five years, California alone has suffered catastrophic atmospheric rivers and flooding, devastating drought and water shortages, deadly heat waves and record-shattering wildfires — not to mention earthquakes, snowstorms and even a rare tropical storm. The disasters have racked up billions in losses — the L.A. fires are estimated to have cost $250 billion — and experts say they are likely to only worsen in years ahead.

Responding to such disasters is more than any single state can handle, particularly smaller states but even one such as California, which has the fourth-largest economy in the world, according to Pete Maysmith, president of the nonprofit League of Conservation Voters.

“States — whether it’s California or any state — need the federal government as these disasters get more and more intense,” Maysmith said. “We all have different connections to different places that have been ravaged and savaged by floods and by fires and by tornadoes and by hurricanes, and it’s the role of the federal government to care for the people of this country when disaster strikes.”

FEMA officials told The Times that the agency is working to strengthen and enhance its partnerships with state, local and tribal governments, and that it is committed to ensuring Americans get the help they need during emergencies. But they also affirmed their plan to move more of those responsibilities away from the federal government.

“Disasters are best when they’re managed at the state and local level,” agency officials wrote in an email. “We’re ensuring our role supports decisions that need to happen at the state and local levels.”

Moore said it doesn’t have to be an either/or scenario. The government shouldn’t eliminate or hobble the federal disaster-response infrastructure — but also, states can do more to prepare for and respond to disasters, such as investing in climate resilience and expanding their emergency management capacity.

Rebalancing federal, state and local responsibilities with regard to disaster response and recovery is “a conversation worth having,” he said, but such changes would require thoughtful cooperation and a slow transition to ensure states have the budgets, staffing and supplies needed to protect the public.

“The result of the administration’s unraveling of the disaster safety net is somebody’s going to pay, and if you want to know who, just go look in the mirror,” Moore said. “It’s going to be individuals that are going to have to basically self-finance their recovery, and mayors and governors that are ... left holding the bag.”

Thousands of people agree with him. A federal review council seeking input on FEMA’s future has racked up more than 11,000 public comments ahead of a Thursday deadline, many in support of the agency.

“FEMA should be kept in place, because we are constantly having disasters strike our nation,” one citizen wrote in the public forum. “People in many places in America are in an economic position that doesn’t allow them to purchase insurance against flooding, wind damage, and or forest fires[.] Please save this great program.”

Hamilton, the former acting director, was fired only one day after he testified about the agency’s importance in Congress — stating, “I do not believe it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.”

The decision to fire Hamilton as hurricane season rapidly approaches is “flabbergasting, even for the Trump administration,” said Carly Fabian, senior policy advocate with nonprofit advocacy organization Public Citizen.

“Dissolving FEMA would leave a void that state governments cannot pretend to fill,” Fabian wrote in a statement. “Over the next few months, disasters will strike the U.S. It is not a question of if — it is simply a question of where these disasters will happen.”

Hamilton’s firing adds him to the ranks of an estimated 2,000 staffers at FEMA who have been laid off or taken a buyout this year — some 30% of its workforce, according to multiple reports. His successor, David Richardson, warned staff not to interfere with upcoming changes and vowed to “find out how to push things down to the states.”

“I, and I alone, speak for FEMA,” Richardson said during an all-hands meeting Friday, according to leaked video footage obtained by CBS News. “I am here to carry out President Trump’s intent.”

Leadership changes are only some of many recent actions the Trump administration has taken to undercut federal emergency response, including the near-total dissolution of AmeriCorps, a program that deploys about 2,000 young volunteers to FEMA and other disaster-relief organizations each year. California and two dozen other states are suing the administration over its cancellation.

The administration also decided to end a FEMA grant program known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, which was designed to help state and local governments reduce their risk of environmental hazards. The estimated loss from terminated BRIC funds awarded under the Biden administration is $882 million, according to a news release from the agency.

“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” FEMA officials wrote in the release. (Last month, a court ruled that the president’s claims of political bias at FEMA were unfounded.)

Not all of FEMA’s woes are tied to President Trump, however. This is the third year in a row that the agency is poised to run out of disaster-relief funding before the onset of hurricane season, with FEMA’s most recent monthly report projecting that the fund could dry up as soon as July or August. The fund is allocated annually by Congress, and the agency has already spent or committed $42 billion of its $67 billion budget this year, according to the federal spending database.

FEMA has also been subject to criticism from both sides of the aisle, including concerns about mismanagement and inadequate response to disasters under the Biden administration such as Hurricane Helene in 2024 and the wildfire in Maui the year before. Many lawmakers have been pushing for reform at the agency since at least 2006, when a bipartisan Congressional investigation concluded that FEMA was unprepared for Hurricane Katrina.

Such disasters have only increased in the years since then. A 2024 report from the independent Government Accountability Office found that mounting disasters have “stretched FEMA’s workforce in unprecedented ways.” The number of disasters the agency manages at the peak of hurricane season has more than doubled over the last seven years, from 30 in 2016 to 71 in 2023, the report says.

Yet the Trump administration’s response to these mounting crises is to simply stop counting them: Federal officials last week announced that NOAA will no longer be updating its database of billion-dollar disasters, outraging environmental groups.

“Billion-dollar disasters won’t stop just because we stop tracking them,” read a statement from Alex Glass, communications director with the nonprofit group Climate Power. “Trump is trying to hide the true cost of the climate crisis, while American families pay the price.”

The president’s defanging of FEMA and other climate programs will affect states across the country — including many that voted for him. The administration in recent weeks has denied requests for disaster aid following tornadoes in Arkansas, floods in West Virginia and hurricanes in Georgia and North Carolina.

Maysmith, of the League of Conservation Voters, said it is “unconscionable” for FEMA to walk away from its responsibilities, as it will not only shift the onus of recovery onto states and local governments but also to individuals.

“It means people’s lives are harder, because when, through no fault of their own, their house burns or their house floods or their house is swept away or their business is swept away — whatever the disaster might be — their life is going to be irreparably changed in so many ways,” Maysmith said. “We can’t fix it all, but the thing that they need is for the government to step up and help.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aafd642/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3752x1970+0+266/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2F78%2Fe3d501864d67943d5318a4e7e6c4%2Fclimate-april-flooding-87068.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:01:46.026021

The oil and gas industry already holds 12 million acres in Gulf of Mexico leases.
Paying more at the pump also means paying more in gasoline taxes, all in order to enrich the oil industry and help pay for tax cuts for the rich.
The proposals would repeal funds to monitor and reduce air pollution in schools, communities, and homes.
And they would end support for efforts to cut dangerous carbon pollution in low-income communities on the frontlines of climate hazard and harm.","The package calls for auctioning off public lands for private profit, boosting destructive fossil fuel production, and giving commercial logging priority over conserving our national forests.

The country's public lands are part of our national inheritance, protected over the decades by leaders from both parties so that future generations might know the natural splendor of this country. Public lands are a public trust. They should not be for sale.

These lands and forests are a critical part of the global climate solution, sucking in and storing massive amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, not to mention cleaning the air we breathe and the water we drink. This package seeks to destroy much of that.

Across the Lower 48, it would expose millions of acres of public lands to new oil and gas drilling by mandating quarterly lease sales controlled by industry. And it would force leases of millions of acres across the West for new coal mines.

In Alaska, it would vastly expand oil and gas drilling, commercial logging, industrial roadways, and speculative mining across irreplaceable wilderness. That would threaten resources critical to the life and culture of Indigenous Peoples and habitat relied on for hundreds of species ranging from the majestic caribou to spawning Chinook salmon.

The attacks don’t stop there.

The package calls for auctioning off upwards of half a million acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah to private buyers, with language suggesting even more expansive sales in the future.

And it would expose millions of acres of ocean waters to the risks of offshore oil and gas drilling, putting marine life and coastal communities at risk, off the coast of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil and gas industry already holds 12 million acres in Gulf of Mexico leases. That’s enough to cover half the state of Indiana. It’s time to reduce, not increase, the waters exposed to the risk of the next BP-style disaster at sea.

The package includes measures that would allow oil, gas, coal, timber, and mining companies to pay off the federal government to fast-track large projects and short-circuit environmental analysis and judicial review.

Hold on. “Pay off” the federal government to green light an industrial project people have to live with for decades? Correct.

Under these bills, a company would be able to pay a fee up front to rush federal review of a proposed project and to limit the opportunity for states to protect rivers, wetlands, and other resources or for impacted communities to represent their interests in court.

In practice, that could mean that federal reviewers could ignore the potential for an oil well to pollute community drinking water, for example, or for a commercial logging project to threaten an engendered species, and the public would be denied its right to challenge the review in court.

At the same time, the bills propose slashing funds used for environmental assessments required by law—cuts that are sure to slow federal project review.

For $1 million, the federal government would rubber-stamp approval for a new liquefied natural gas terminal by declaring it in the public interest—whether it is or not—with no opportunity for the actual public to contest the decision.

This smacks of the kind of corruption the U.S. government and U.S. corporations have long decried in countries where paying off public officials is part of doing business.

It should have no place in this country.

We need a modern review and approval process to support the build out of clean energy production and transmission at the pace and scale required to confront the climate crisis.

That starts with siting projects where they belong, ensuring adequate staffing levels at federal review agencies, and working with local communities to ensure that they share in the benefits of projects they must live with for all time.

The federal government, though, has a duty to enforce the laws enacted to protect the environment and public health, even when that means saying no to projects that do more harm than good. No industry should be able to skirt the law by writing a check.

The package calls for gutting federal incentives that have helped drive more than $630 billion in clean energy investment by businesses and consumers over just the past three years. This is investment in new factories to make solar panels, electric vehicles, advanced batteries and the like, or to cut home utility costs by installing heat pumps and other energy-saving appliances.

Repealing these incentives would kill jobs and hamper domestic clean energy production. It would raise household electricity prices by 7 percent on average, next year alone. By 2030, it would add $26 billion to household electricity and fuel bills—and nearly double that amount by 2035.

Every lawmaker who supports this self-inflicted economic wound is voting for higher energy bills, fewer jobs and tax increases on drivers, homeowners, energy companies and manufacturers.

. . . and hit drivers in the wallet

The package would also end popular incentives for U.S.-made electric vehicles (EVs) and repeal commonsense standards that cut dangerous pollution from cars and trucks starting with 2027 models.

This is one of the most backward-looking ideas imaginable.

It would raise the drive-away cost of a new U.S.-made EV by up to $7,500, at a time when Trump’s tariffs are already putting a new car out of reach for more consumers.

It would punish U.S. auto workers and carmakers for daring to invest in the future. It would limit showroom choices, locking more drivers into the gas guzzlers of the past—and the tailpipe pollution that threatens our future.

And it would scuttle clean car standards the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calculated would provide a staggering $2.1 trillion in public benefits over time by, for example, improving human health, reducing premature deaths, and lowering costs to drivers.

Repealing those standards would target U.S. autoworkers and -makers while increasing dangerous tailpipe pollution in every community in the nation.

It would also make sure Americans keep buying more and more gasoline. Paying more at the pump also means paying more in gasoline taxes, all in order to enrich the oil industry and help pay for tax cuts for the rich.

The U.S. auto industry has bet its future on EVs, with some $312 billion invested or pledged for new factories that make electric cars and trucks and the advanced batteries, new and recycled, that power them. The industry itself has said that repealing federal tax breaks on U.S.-made EVs would force factory layoffs.

Successful countries invest in the future. That’s why the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included tax credits that save low-income and middle-income drivers up to $7,500 off the cost of a new U.S.-built electric vehicle.

That’s common sense. It helps consumers and supports autoworkers and one of the country’s important domestic industries as it transitions to the vehicles of tomorrow.

The incentive is hugely popular, used by more than 250,000 drivers in just the first three quarters of 2024.

It’s one reason why EV sales grew 11.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared to year-ago levels, accounting for 7.5 percent of the new-car market. U.S. automakers are big winners: General Motors sold nearly twice as many electric vehicles in the first quarter of this year as in the comparable period a year ago.

The House reconciliation package would also hurt sales of used EVs, which surged nearly 40 percent in the first quarter of this year.

The federal incentives offer low-income and middle-income drivers a credit of up to $4,000 off a second-hand electric vehicle that costs $25,000 or less. The GOP plan would eliminate that incentive.

The package would gut key programs that reduce pollution known to aggravate asthma, heart and lung disease, and other illnesses that strike particularly hard against infants, children, seniors, and people required to work outdoors.

It would rescind funding going to communities, like those along Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, that have been overburdened by pollution for decades. It would slash funding for environmental reviews, making it harder for communities to know how they’d be impacted in their own backyards by proposed projects.

The proposals would repeal funds to monitor and reduce air pollution in schools, communities, and homes. And they would end support for efforts to cut dangerous carbon pollution in low-income communities on the frontlines of climate hazard and harm.

By calling for the repeal of clean car rules finalized just last year, these proposals would mean more tailpipe pollution nationwide in the future.

This is a direct assault on public health.

If these proposals prevail, our children will breathe dirtier air at school. We’ll suffer from more smog near ports, more toxic pollution from heavy industry, and more methane—a powerful climate warming gas—from oil and gas operations.

And we’ll all pay the price, in more emergency room visits, more lost days from work, more premature deaths, and more of the climate disaster that’s driving dangerous heat waves, withering drought, species collapse, raging wildfires, storms and floods, and more.",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-15 10:11:59.294651

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 14, 2025 – The Niskanen Center strongly supports the bipartisan reintroduction of the MARKET CHOICE Act, led by Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Salud Carbajal (D-CA). This legislation proposes a border-adjusted carbon tax—a transparent, efficient, and market-based strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining a competitive edge for American manufacturers.

“As the global economy moves toward carbon accountability, the U.S. must lead with policies that are economically sound and internationally credible,” said Dr. Liza Reed, Niskanen’s Director of Climate Policy. “The MARKET CHOICE Act is a pragmatic, bipartisan approach that aligns climate action with fiscal responsibility and American competitiveness.”

Key provisions of the updated MARKET CHOICE Act include:

Establishes a carbon tax starting at $40 per metric ton of CO₂, increasing annually at 5% plus inflation, with a carbon border adjustment to ensure American competitiveness

Eliminates the federal gasoline tax and aviation fuel tax, overall simplifies fuel taxes, and avoids double taxation

Suspends certain Clean Air Act regulations on covered stationary sources, providing regulatory certainty for industry in exchange for a market-based price signal

As global trading partners, including the European Union, implement their carbon border policies, the MARKET CHOICE Act ensures the U.S. remains competitive by using free-market tools to reduce emissions without undermining economic strength.

“The Niskanen Center applauds Congressmen Fitzpatrick and Carbajal for their continued leadership and urges Congress to take this opportunity to pass a market-based climate solution that strengthens both our economy and our environment,” Dr. Reed said.

Canceling the largest climate change legislation in U.S. history will affect households across the country.
Instead, the Trump administration is putting our country’s domestic manufacturing and auto industries at a huge competitive disadvantage from which they may be unable to recover.","The science explaining how fossil fuels contribute to climate change has been clear for decades. Now that communities around the country (and the globe) are experiencing more frequent and severe weather events, the realities of climate change are impossible to deny. And few do: 72 percent of American voters surveyed in 2024 acknowledged that the earth’s climate is warming—sending climate deniers scrambling to come up with a new schtick.

Enter President Trump’s second term.

President Donald Trump spent a lot of time denying science in his first term. This time around, his administration is taking a more backhanded approach: baking climate denial into how federal agencies conduct their basic duties. From attacking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) endangerment finding on climate emissions to thwarting the growing renewable energy industry and brazenly gutting federal institutions and grant programs that have played critical roles in advancing climate action, the Trump administration is trying to stop progress in its tracks.

On the very first day of his second term, President Trump asked the EPA to make a recommendation on whether to reconsider its 2009 endangerment finding that the greenhouse gases that cause climate change also threaten public health and welfare. The finding lists risks such as increases in air pollution, temperatures, extreme weather events, and food- and waterborne illnesses. Because it proved these dangers—robustly backed by the scientific record—the EPA must take action through the Clean Air Act to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and four other climate pollutants. So the agency has, in turn, set emissions caps on everything from coal-fired power plants and methane leaks from oil and gas wells to tailpipe emissions from cars and other vehicles.

While the current EPA is yet to make its decision regarding the endangerment finding, there are a few likely possibilities. “The worst-case scenario, but also probably the hardest for them to do, would be to outright deny the climate science and just take a sledgehammer to all EPA climate regulations from the last two decades,” says Meredith Hankins, NRDC’s federal climate legal director.

Another potential move would be to not fully repeal the finding but limit its scope—say, apply emissions standards to certain sources, like cars, but not to others, such as power plants. Or, Hankins says, EPA officials could acknowledge “that climate science is real, but then they try to make excuses for why they don't think the EPA should have to regulate climate pollution.”

Any of these decisions would be a blow to climate pollution reduction efforts—it’s just a question of how severe. The goal remains the same, says Hankins. “They want to make corporations money, and they don't care about the impacts on people.”

The new language of climate denial

The Trump administration is also policing the language used on government websites, grant proposals, and other communications. Climate science and pollution are on the administration’s list of words to limit or avoid in research and public-facing communications. This act of censorship tries to curb any activities that may promote climate action and, subsequently, ding fossil fuel industry profits.

Trying to cancel science

In the months since taking office, this administration has hamstrung the federal agencies and grant recipients responsible for (among other things) addressing the climate crisis. Countless programs and agencies, such as the National Park Service, have seen their budgets slashed unlawfully and their workforces illegally shrunk to a skeleton crew, hobbling the remaining staff’s ability to do their jobs.

“The dedicated professionals around the country being fired due to this administration’s reckless cuts provide services and information that are critical to all Americans,” Geller says.

Major cuts to FEMA’s disaster-response programs and NOAA’s weather monitoring, forecasting systems, and tracking of the economic impacts of extreme weather leave people across the country less able to prepare for and recover from escalating severe weather events. Meanwhile, defunding climate research at the National Institutes of Health impedes the development of more effective ways to protect people from heat waves, wildfire smoke, and climate-fueled pathogens.

Other slashed initiatives include programs that safeguard workers from extreme heat conditions and that help low-income households afford life-saving heat and air-conditioning. Together, along with discontinued environmental justice programs that helped support communities on the frontlines of climate change, these cuts essentially pave the way for more unnecessary casualties as climate change continues to ramp up.

“The Trump administration's attack on science might be seen as an effort to damage or destroy the credibility of an institution that is hard for them to control; that doesn't tell them what they want to hear,” says Dr. Timmons Roberts, Ittleson professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology at Brown University and the executive director of the Climate Social Science Network. “It's heartbreaking, really, because science is what made America great, and it will lie shattered on the ground after just a few more months of this gutting of our scientific infrastructure.”

These attacks could fragment the research landscape in this country for decades to come. And with the ousting of career staff at scientific institutions like NOAA and the EPA, “we're not just losing that individual employee. We're also losing the 10 people they may have mentored over the next four years, who would learn the system before someone retired,” says Hankins. “It's just this generational loss of institutional knowledge and expertise.”

Another, perhaps intended, consequence of these seismic shifts within federal agencies would be people losing faith in the government built to work for them. “Who is the government serving? Is it serving the people, or is it serving Big Oil and corporations?” asks Hankins. “The government’s role is not supposed to be enriching corporate America. It's supposed to save lives.”

Halting the momentum of the Inflation Reduction Act

The Trump administration is also attempting to stall clean energy development by gutting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Enacted by the Biden administration in 2022, the IRA has already generated more than $634 billion in investments and created more than 200,000 clean energy construction jobs, predominantly in rural districts in states like Georgia, Oklahoma, and North and South Carolina.

Canceling the largest climate change legislation in U.S. history will affect households across the country. In 2023, Americans claimed more than $8 billion in clean energy tax credits under the IRA, which helped people install rooftop solar, improve their homes’ energy efficiency, and complete other climate-friendly actions that also benefit their household budgets. With the future of many of the IRA’s initiatives in limbo, such economic incentives for consumers could evaporate. A recent report by the Brattle Group estimates that repealing the clean energy tax credits would raise electricity bills for U.S. households by $51 billion over the next decade. Many businesses may suffer, too, including the auto industry, which has been using IRA funding to invest in EV infrastructure and production.

On the flip side, there's a huge opportunity for other countries to jump into the renewable energy vacuum that the United States is creating and ramp up EV production and clean energy development for international markets. Instead, the Trump administration is putting our country’s domestic manufacturing and auto industries at a huge competitive disadvantage from which they may be unable to recover.

Fighting back against climate denial

In a country where the vast majority of people want climate action, the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks have not gone unnoticed. Climate change was one of several themes present at April’s “Hands Off!” demonstrations that brought millions of people—in cities and towns across all 50 states—to the streets to speak out against the administration’s actions.

Companies and local governments are taking a stand too. For example, despite President Trump pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the America Is All In coalition includes 10 states, 14 Tribal nations, and more than 3,000 businesses that are working to uphold the country’s former pledge to curb its climate emissions by 50 percent by 2030. Collectively, the coalition represents nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population. Meanwhile, governors of some states, such as New York and New Mexico, are pushing back against a Trump executive order that targets state climate laws.

But most battles in the name of climate action are taking place in court. Dozens of climate-related lawsuits are already in the works, including those filed by NRDC, and many more are likely to follow.

While even a temporary pause to climate work slows the momentum that we need to avoid the most dangerous effects of a warming world, the fight against Trump’s rollbacks parallels the fight against climate change itself. Every tenth of a degree of warming we can prevent makes us safer and more resilient to the changes to come. In the same vein, every battle won against Trump’s pro-pollution agenda could bring less harm to the planet and its people.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/eagle-creek-wildfire-flames-golf-course-washington-climate-crisis-RTX3F8AY.JPG?h=b3b2c635&itok=FdIQNsW9,N,,2025-05-15 07:08:23.552214

Energy companies from the region as well as the United States have committed to more than $100 billion in various initiatives on two busy days of lavish ceremonies and deals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, reflecting the opportunities for mutual cooperation for the industry as well as aligning with President Trump’s “Energy Dominance” agenda. Similar agreements and deals are also expected when President Trump visits the UAE later on Thursday. Here’s a quick look at the announcements so far:

DOE and Saudi Ministry of Energy sign agreement

The US Department of Energy and the Ministry of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have concluded an agreement for cooperation in the field of energy, according to the White House. The agreement builds upon their strong existing relationship; it will focus collaboration on examining the potential for innovation, development, financing, and deployment of energy infrastructure, it said.

Aramco to invest $90 billion through 34 agreements

Aramco has announced the signing of 34 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements, with a potential total value of $90 billion, with major US companies, through its Aramco Group Companies.

The MoUs and agreements cover collaborations and partnerships relating to a range of Aramco’s activities, including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), fuels, chemicals, emission-reduction technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other digital solutions, manufacturing, asset management, short-term cash investments, and procurement of materials, equipment, and services. The MoUs and agreements aim to build on the longstanding relationship between Aramco and US companies, enhance shareholder value, and foster further collaboration and innovation in the energy sector and beyond.

Some of the highlights of Aramco's deals include:

Honeywell UOP: MoU related to technology licensing for an aromatics project.

Motiva: MoU related to an aromatics project in Port Arthur, subject to a final investment decision.

Afton Chemical: MoUs related to development and supply of chemical fuel additives in pipelines and retail fuel offerings.

ExxonMobil: MoU related to evaluating a significant upgrade to the SAMREF refinery and expanding the facility into a world-class integrated petrochemical complex.

Sempra Infrastructure: MoU related to previously announced HOA regarding liquified natural gas (LNG) equity and offtake stake in Port Arthur LNG 2.

Woodside Energy: Collaboration Agreement to explore global opportunities, including an equity interest and LNG offtake from the Louisiana LNG project. Additionally, both companies are exploring opportunities for a potential collaboration in lower-carbon ammonia.

NextDecade: Final Agreement to purchase 1.2 million tonnes per annum of LNG for a 20-year term from Train 4 of the Rio Grande LNG Facility, subject to certain conditions, including a positive final investment decision of Train 4.

Amazon/AWS: non-binding Strategic Framework agreement related to collaboration on digital transformation and lower-carbon initiatives.

Procured Materials and Services: MoUs were signed to reflect the existing relationships with strategic US suppliers such as SLB, Baker Hughes, McDermott, Halliburton, Nabors, Helmerich & Payne, Valaris, NESR, Weatherford, Air Products, KBR, Flowserve, NOV, Emerson, GE Vernova, and Honeywell.

DataVolt to invest $20 billion in AI data centres

Saudi Arabian DataVolt is moving forward with plans to invest $20 billion in AI data centres and energy infrastructure in the United States, according to a White House statement. The agreement with Super Micro Computer (Supermicro) includes a multi-year partnership for delivering GPU platforms and rack systems for DataVolt’s “hyperscale AI campuses” in Saudi Arabia and the US. “We are thrilled to partner with Supermicro and build on the strong foundations laid in these first 100 days of the Trump Administration,” said Rajit Nanda, CEO of DataVolt.

GE Vernova announces $14.2 billion initiatives

GE Vernova Inc. has announced initiatives worth up to $14.2 billion for its energy equipment technology and services to support power generation and grid stability projects. The announcements include up to $2 billion in backlog or on a reservation agreement as of the first quarter of 2025, with future contracts and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for agreements spanning across the next four years. The initiatives are expected to play a strong role in supporting the Kingdom to achieve its energy goals under Saudi Vision 2030 and transition to net zero by 2060.

“As the world's energy equipment manufacturer, GE Vernova is proud to deploy world class technology to help deepen the longstanding relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, advance energy security, and strengthen the economic prosperity and competitiveness of both nations,” said Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova.

The collaborations include initiatives with Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) spanning the supply of highly efficient and flexible heavy duty gas turbines, and with Aramco to provide maintenance services, repairs, spare parts, and more to support the reliable operations of various power plants around the Kingdom.

ACWA Power signs agreements worth $500 million

ACWA Power, the world’s largest private water desalination company, has announced MoUs worth $500 million with US companies, to build on the company’s existing partnerships with American firms which now exceed $6 billion.

""ACWA Power’s strategy is driven by value-driven partnerships like these. Access to cutting-edge technology and expertise is critical as we diversify our portfolio, expand into new markets, and achieve our objectives in meeting net zero by 2050,” added Marco Arcelli, Chief Executive Officer of ACWA Power.

The U.S. and China on Monday announced a 90-day de-escalation in the trade war, slashing their respective 100%-plus tariffs on each other’s products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are cut to 30% from 145%. The 30% tariff includes the 10% baseline tariff rate for all countries, plus a 20% fentanyl-related levy.

China, for its part, is lowering tariffs on most U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.

The de-escalation in the trade war is only a temporary truce and a welcome respite for markets. But uncertainty remains high about where talks will go in the next few months and what the U.S. Administration’s ultimate goal of the trade policy with China is, analysts say.

But de-escalation will not push China to resume buying U.S. energy goods, considering the small 90-day window during which talks could go either way.

Moreover, China effectively killed imports of U.S. oil, LNG, and coal as early as in February, when it placed a 10% tariff in the first retaliatory move against President Donald Trump’s tariff escalation policy. Related: ADNOC’s XRG Takes Stake in Offshore Gas Block in Turkmenistan

The 10% Chinese tariff remains and makes energy imports from the U.S. uneconomical. In addition, the 90-day tariff truce isn’t enough to incentivize buyers of energy to return to the U.S. commodities, considering the still elevated uncertainty, analysts say.

Earlier this year, China slashed its imports of many U.S. energy and agricultural commodities as the trade war intensified.

China’s LNG imports from the United States crashed to zero in March as China slapped tariffs on American LNG and other energy products, making these uneconomical for Chinese buyers.

Last year, U.S. LNG represented about 5% of China’s imports of the super-chilled fuel.

Among energy products, imports of U.S. liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) declined by 36%, and purchases of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking plunged by 62% in March from a year earlier.

China has the ability to source its oil, LNG, and coal from elsewhere, and these commodities represented small shares of overall Chinese energy imports anyway.

Despite the tariff pause, U.S. LNG remains commercially unviable into China, Kpler says.

“Weak fundamentals, persistent tariffs, and ample inventory continue to suppress Chinese appetite for US LNG cargoes, limiting the near-term recovery of transpacific flows,” the analysts at Kpler said.

U.S. LNG exports to China crashed by 70% in the first quarter, and there have been no deliveries into China in more than 40 days. The tariff pause will not make much of a difference because U.S. LNG is still subject to a 25% tariff in China, “keeping it economically uncompetitive,” Kpler said.

Beyond the immediate future, China could restore some imports of U.S. energy if some kind of a deal similar to the Phase-One deal during President Trump’s first term in office is reached, Reuters columnist Clyde Russell notes.

Even if a deal is reached, history has shown that China failed to buy the pledged incremental value worth U.S. energy goods, also due to the period of Covid restrictions.

However, the path to any deal is long and winding as the U.S. and China are yet to begin negotiations about the details of a trade agreement.

“The current agreement is still just a pause, and specifics of a comprehensive deal remain unclear,” J.P. Morgan said.

Future progress will likely be phased and U.S. energy commodities are likely to be contentious points in talks, alongside U.S. agricultural products and strategic sectors such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, the bank noted.

“Trust between the two countries remains low, making future deals, especially on structural issues, challenging and time-consuming,” according to J.P. Morgan.

“The U.S. administration's mixed hawkish and dovish approaches suggest that future policy towards China will likely remain fragmented.”

The defendant fossil fuel companies have all denied wrongdoing.
In 2015, Inside Climate News first reported that ExxonMobil had conducted internal research confirming the dangers of climate change, even as the company led a decades-long campaign to cast doubt on climate science.
Donate Now Among the moments outlined in the UCS report: 1950s-1960s: Internal company documents indicate that fossil fuel companies learned of the potentially dangerous impacts of climate change.
ExxonMobil, for instance, did not publicly acknowledge that burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change until 2006.","A new report draws on decades of internal documents and court records to lay out how some of the world’s most powerful corporations misled the public about the dangers of climate change—and how their efforts to avoid responsibility for the harms caused by their products have evolved in recent years.

The documents and records cited in the report, released Wednesday by the watchdog group Union of Concerned Scientists, have been reported on previously. But the report’s authors say they are the first to aggregate and analyze those documents in a comprehensive way.

“This report puts together, in one place, a powerful body of evidence about what the fossil fuel corporations knew—and when—about the climate impacts of their products, and what they did in spite of what they knew,” said Kathy Mulvey, a report author and accountability campaign director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.

Mulvey said the report should add heft to dozens of lawsuits pending worldwide against fossil fuel companies over their contribution to climate change.

The report comes as the Trump administration and the U.S. Department of Justice are acting to shield those companies from legal accountability efforts within the United States.

In late April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order announcing his intent to protect “American Energy From State Overreach.” The order directs the Justice Department to review, identify and thwart state and local efforts to address climate change. In recent weeks, the agency filed lawsuits against Hawaii, Michigan, New York and Vermont, alleging those states’ lawsuits or legislation seeking to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for climate-related harms infringes on federal power.

Historically, conservatives championed states’ rights. But in recent years, the Republican Party has repeatedly sought to invoke a legal mechanism known as preemption to extinguish local communities’ and states’ rights to make decisions about environmental and health protections.

The report notes that the oil and gas industry was a “heavy donor” to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Publicly available documents indicate industry groups gave an estimated $96 million to the Trump campaign. That amount doesn’t include so-called “dark money” donations that are not publicly disclosed or contributions to the president’s meme coin, which Trump has personally profited from.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration has previously said it is “committed to unleashing American energy,” though the White House has also moved to block low-carbon energy projects like wind farms.

According to the Union of Concerned Scientists’ report, titled “Decades of Deceit,” one quarter of people in the United States live in a state, territory or municipality that has sued a fossil fuel corporation for their role in contributing to climate change.

At the heart of those lawsuits are questions about who should be responsible for paying for the deaths and damages caused by climate-intensified storms, heat waves and arctic blasts. So far, the public has largely borne those costs, including through increasing insurance premiums.

The state-led lawsuits include claims that fossil fuel companies deceptively marketed their products while privately knowing about the dangers associated with them. The suits also allege that fossil fuel companies failed to warn the public about foreseeable harm caused by their products or that companies violated shareholder disclosure laws.

The defendant fossil fuel companies have all denied wrongdoing.

Those companies have defended the lawsuits on a variety of grounds, including by arguing that climate change should be a political rather than legal issue, and therefore should be left to Congress and the executive branch. Companies have also asserted that their statements questioning climate science are protected speech under the First Amendment.

U.S. states began bringing climate accountability lawsuits in the late 2010s, soon after investigative reports revealed fossil fuel companies had long-standing knowledge about the dangers associated with their products.

In 2015, Inside Climate News first reported that ExxonMobil had conducted internal research confirming the dangers of climate change, even as the company led a decades-long campaign to cast doubt on climate science.

Cases against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and others remain pending as companies fight states over whether the cases belong in federal or state court and other procedural issues. The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected companies’ attempts to dismiss the suits or move them to federal court. Separately, the court in March rejected an effort by Republican-led states to block Democratic-led state lawsuits against oil majors.

The Union of Concerned Scientists’ report argues that fossil fuel companies have largely delayed these cases or otherwise have evaded justice in U.S. courts by deploying extensive legal and financial resources.

Mulvey drew parallels between the fossil fuel industry and tobacco companies, which for decades used powerful legal teams to fend off lawsuits over tobacco-related illnesses. The turning point came, Mulvey said, when U.S. states began suing tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs associated with treating those illnesses.

That legal pressure coincided with investigative reporting and public revelations about how the industry had deliberately targeted youth and manipulated nicotine levels to increase the addictiveness of their products. Internal documents also revealed companies’ strategy of sowing doubt about the science of tobacco-related harms.

Unlike tobacco companies, the fossil fuel industry has argued its products have a socially useful function—supplying energy.

“Imagine what the world would look like today if those companies—in 1959 or 1979 or even 1988, when they clearly knew the consequences of the choices they were making—had been forthright about what they knew.”

— Steven Eric Feit, Center for International Environmental Law

Lawyers say that the usefulness of a product does not insulate a business from needing to warn the public about potential dangers associated with the product or from needing to address actual harm caused by it. Among the ongoing impacts of climate change, the report notes, conservative estimates suggest it will cause an additional quarter-million deaths each year by worsening diseases like malaria, heat stress and undernutrition.

“They’re selling something dangerous, and their product also poisons the people living near where it is produced—saying that’s OK because their product is useful doesn’t make the harm acceptable,” said Steven Eric Feit, senior attorney at the D.C.-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law.

Feit, who was not involved in the UCS report, said it’s important to publicly document each point in time when the industry knew about the harms of its products but chose to obscure them. At each of those moments, he said, governments could have used that information as a basis to take a different pathway forward that could have minimized the climate shocks the world is now experiencing.

“Imagine what the world would look like today if those companies—in 1959 or 1979 or even 1988, when they clearly knew the consequences of the choices they were making—had been forthright about what they knew,” Feit said.

Among the moments outlined in the UCS report:

1950s-1960s: Internal company documents indicate that fossil fuel companies learned of the potentially dangerous impacts of climate change.

1979-1983: The American Petroleum Institute, a fossil fuel industry group, and oil companies operated a task force monitoring and exchanging climate research, though companies did not publicly acknowledge their products’ impacts on climate change until much later. ExxonMobil, for instance, did not publicly acknowledge that burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change until 2006.

1984: ExxonMobil scientist Henry Shaw told company executives, “We can either adapt our civilization to a warmer planet or avoid the problem by sharply curtailing the use of fossil fuels.” Exxon then scaled back its climate research and invested in a climate science disinformation campaign to mislead the public and block government action.

1988: In a private report entitled “The Greenhouse Effect,” Shell recognized that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change and warned that there was a rapidly closing window to take action. That year, the company also forecasted extreme weather events and public backlash against the industry.

1998: In a strategic “Action Plan” memo, the American Petroleum Institute laid out strategies to sow uncertainty about climate science by manipulating media and political narratives.

2019: Former ExxonMobil scientists testify before a congressional committee, telling lawmakers that the company knew about climate change but, fearing harm to its business, amped up efforts to sow doubt about global warming.

2025: Court documents allege there was a coordinated scheme to hack into the email accounts of prominent climate activists. The documents, filed by the U.S. government in a U.K. court in January, say a D.C. lobbying firm acting on behalf of “one of the world’s largest oil and gas corporations, centred in Irving, Texas” paid a consultant $16 million between 2013 and 2018. That consultant “orchestrated computer hacking crimes against over 100 victim corporations, organisations and individuals,” and the “fruits of the hacking” were used to discredit climate advocates, the filing says.

ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment. When previously asked about the allegation by NPR, a company spokesperson said it has not been “involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities. If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.” In recent years, company executives have downplayed their predecessors’ statements promoting climate disinformation.

The American Petroleum Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

A Shell spokesperson said in a written statement, “The issue of climate change and how to tackle it has long been part of public discussion and ongoing scientific research and debate for many decades. There is a vast public record of media articles, scientific journals and government reports for well over 50 years that make this clear.” Referencing the ongoing lawsuits, the company added, “The suggestion that the plaintiffs in US climate litigation cases were somehow unaware of climate change is simply not credible. The Shell Group did not have unique knowledge about climate change.”

Mulvey and Feit describe the history detailed in the report as an evolving pattern of denial, delay and obfuscation tactics that they say have continued today in more subtle forms of misinformation, often referred to as greenwashing.

“Greenwashing might sound harmless, but it’s actually dangerous,” Feit said. “Many of the so-called solutions to climate change being promoted by the industry are incomplete, lack key context or are simply not real.”

He pointed to industry claims that carbon capture can remove around 90 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from polluting projects. “No facility has actually achieved that,” he said.

Newer industry efforts outlined in the report include attempts to block state legislation that would make polluters pay for climate-related damage, a campaign to rebrand environmentally conscious investing as “woke capitalism” and efforts to revive a 2018 attempt to obtain a blanket waiver of legal liability from Congress.

“In the current political context, we have reason to believe that the fossil fuel industry and its allies will attempt yet again to pass some form of liability waiver and get off scot-free for decades of deception, pollution, and massive damage to people and the planet,” the report said.

“Congress must do everything in its power to ensure such an effort does not succeed.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2157617556-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:01:56.574290

Passing the REINS Act could do far greater long-term good than continuing the 2017 tax cuts or ending tax on tips.
The REINS Act requires any “major rule” issued by a federal agency to undergo congressional approval.

They would surely filibuster the REINS Act were it to arrive on the floor of the Senate as standalone legislation.","Republicans will throw a wrench into the administrative state if they succeed in adding the REINS Act to this summer’s massive budget bill. A conservative priority for at least a decade, the Act would suspend major agency regulations until they receive congressional approval. Not only would the Act potentially save the economy billions of dollars a year, but it would also mark an important step in restoring constitutional principles and democratic accountability to the perpetual motion machine that is our government. Passing the REINS Act could do far greater long-term good than continuing the 2017 tax cuts or ending tax on tips.

The REINS Act requires any “major rule” issued by a federal agency to undergo congressional approval. It defines a major rule as any regulation that has an annual economic impact of $100 million or more—the level at which the Office of Management and Budget, under presidential executive order, should subject it to careful cost-benefit analysis. It also requires congressional approval of regulations that cause a major increase in costs and prices for consumers, industry, government agencies, or regions, or those that have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, or innovation.

REINS is deceptively simple because most Americans, upon a quick read of the Constitution, would assume that Congress already must approve any nationwide rule that has such profound economic effects. Article I of the Constitution vests in Congress alone the authority to enact legislation. As the Court reminded in INS v. Chadha (1983), an act of government is a law if it “had the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, duties, and relations of persons outside the legislative branch.” Everything from taxes and spending, environmental rules, and criminal punishments falls within this definition of a law. In Chadha itself, the Supreme Court struck down what was known as a “legislative veto,” which had allowed a single committee of Congress to override the Attorney General’s decision whether to deport an illegal alien. Congress could only exercise the power of legislation, the Court found, when it enacted a law that passed both houses of Congress and received a presidential signature.

But the glaring exception to this principle of bicameralism and presentment, established in Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, is the administrative state. In vast areas of social and economic life, Congress has delegated its power to make laws to agencies. In the Clean Air Act, for example, Congress gave the Environmental Protection Agency the power to control air quality, under which the EPA sets everything from gas mileage minimums for cars to pollution standards for power plants. The only requirement Congress demands is that the standards protect “public health” with “an adequate margin for safety.” So long as it follows these vague standards, the EPA can impose billions of dollars in costs on the economy without having to go through the House, the Senate, or the White House.

Conservatives have long argued that the Constitution forbids Congress from transferring its legislative authority to executive branch agencies. In his Second Treatise on Government, Locke declared that “the legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands: for it being but a delegated power from the people, they who have it cannot pass it over to others.” Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 75 that “the essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other words to prescribe rules for the regulation of society” and that this power could be exercised only by Congress.

There is more to opposition to the transfers of legislative power than political opposition to progressive regulation. Broad delegation of authority to executive branch agencies reduces democratic accountability in public policymaking. If Congress must enact significant rules, voters can hold the government accountable through periodic elections. The public will know who has made the rules and what considerations went into them and can force a change if it disagrees. Progressives (of the Woodrow Wilson variety) answer that modern policymaking calls on experts, insulated from partisan politics, to make scientific decisions.

But the progressives ignored that policies often embody trade-offs, such as closing schools, which would harm the education of children, versus reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, rather than scientifically correct policies. Congress is just as institutionally capable of making such decisions as the bureaucracy is to make the trade-offs for tax rates, criminal punishments, or entitlement programs. Congress may have once delegated lawmaking power to agencies due to genuine uncertainty over its ability to regulate a modern economy. But today, as political scientists have pointed out, Congress more often delegates authority to agencies to escape difficult political choices over higher air quality, for example, and more expensive automobiles and gasoline.

Nevertheless, courts today have refused to enforce a non-delegation doctrine. In 2000, the Supreme Court upheld regulations under the Clean Air Act despite its broad mandate and vague limits on agency authority. Although Justice Clarence Thomas has led the call for the Supreme Court to revive the non-delegation doctrine, his colleagues have not invalidated a law for unconstitutionally transferring legislative power to the agencies since the New Deal. The Court has adopted a half-hearted version of non-delegation in its major questions doctrine, which cautions courts against reading vague statutes to give agencies broad powers over major economic and social questions. Announced in West Virginia v. EPA (2022), the major questions doctrine does not apply to the sweeping regulations passed before 2022, nor does it stop Congress from transferring broad powers to the agencies, so long as it does so clearly.

The REINS Act picks up the baton from the Roberts Court. For the last 20 years, the Justices have reined in the administrative state by narrowing the scope of the Commerce Clause, upon which its claim to nationwide regulation rests, and placing its officers under the direct control of the president. But the Constitution does not make the courts the only branch of government responsible for enforcing its norms. Both the President and Congress bear the same duty as the Judiciary to obey the Constitution; they implement the Constitution in the scope of their own unique duties, whether enacted or enforcing the law.

With the REINS Act, Congress can join the judiciary in placing limits on the administrative state. Congress created the basic problem by giving away its own legislative powers in the New Deal, the Great Society, the environmental laws of the 1970s, Obamacare, and the financial laws of the 2000s. It can now begin to undo the damage to democratic self-governance by restoring its sole control over lawmaking. The REINS Act will prevent agencies from issuing any regulations with major economic effects. In effect, it downgrades regulations from laws to proposals. Our elected representatives are free to adopt or reject them as they – and we – like. REINS does not mean the end of beneficial regulations on public health and safety, despite what chicken-little progressives may claim. Agencies will continue to develop expertise and knowledge, which they can apply in proposed regulations, but the constitutional and political responsibility for their enactment will remain with Congress.

Unfortunately, legislative barriers lie ahead for such a fundamental reform of federal administration. The Democratic Party has become the party of unaccountable technocratic government. Woodrow Wilson, after all, gave it life, Lyndon Johnson put it on steroids, and Barack Obama expanded it even in a time of shrinking resources and rising deficits. They would surely filibuster the REINS Act were it to arrive on the floor of the Senate as standalone legislation. But this summer’s budget reconciliation bill provides Republicans with the opportunity to restore Congress’s power over the laws – the filibuster does not apply to its provisions, so long as they address spending or revenue.

Senate Democrats will almost certainly object to the inclusion of the REINS Act in the budget bill, and it will be up to the Senate parliamentarian to decide whether it can stay in this summer’s package or must be deleted. However, Republicans will have one last move, which is to vote to overrule the parliamentarian and allow the REINS Act to stay in the reconciliation bill, where it would be enacted along with the rest of the taxing and spending blueprint, albeit with a filibuster-free status. Never will such a technical area of parliamentary rules have such a profound effect on the nation’s constitutional future.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pomerleau.AEIdeas.051325.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:02:01.372858

Ted Thomas is a former chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission and founder of Energize Strategies.

Earlier this year, the federal government announced significant layoffs across government agencies. At the Department of Energy alone, 3,500 government workers are expected to leave. These talented and skilled professionals are now on the market, looking for new careers.

Meanwhile, immense challenges loom for the nation’s energy system — from skyrocketing utility bills and surging electricity demand to aging grid infrastructure and increased cybersecurity threats. There is a growing need for talented engineers, economists, lawyers, accountants and other professionals to help tackle these challenges.

While much attention on energy issues focuses on federal action, most of the critical decisions over our‬ electricity system are taking place at the state level, at state public‬ utilities commissions, state energy offices and state consumer advocate offices. These agencies are juggling an increasingly complex and expansive set of responsibilities, from planning for‬ the buildout of energy resources and courting economic development projects to setting‬‭ electricity rates and securing critical infrastructure.‬

States bear disproportionate responsibility for maintaining affordable, reliable and safe‬ ‭electricity. And it is at the state level that departing federal workers can have the greatest impact on our energy future.

The U.S. electricity system is at a crossroads. Nearly 80 million Americans, or one in three, are struggling to pay their utility bills, with electricity costs increasing 30% since 2021. According to a new national online poll conducted by Ipsos, four in five (80%) Americans say they feel powerless over their utility bills. This trend is expected to continue, with electricity demand rising at its fastest pace in a generation, driven by data centers, industrial manufacturing and electrification. Our utility regulatory system must keep pace, managing rising utility bills while growing the economy.

State PUCs are especially critical to protecting the interests of American energy consumers. Just 200 PUC commissioners across the country oversee more than $200 billion a year in annual utility spending, investments that power the $30 trillion U.S. economy. These individuals can be considered the Supreme Court justices of energy.

State public utilities commissions are the beating heart of the energy system. These agencies regulate electric, gas, water, telecommunications and other utilities in each state and generally have the power to set utility rates, evaluate utility investments and conduct energy planning.

For example, when tech companies seek to build a billion-dollar data center that could consume a small city’s worth of electricity, it is up to PUC staff to analyze how the grid can serve this new demand, determine how to fairly allocate project costs, and ensure system affordability and reliability.

PUCs desperately need skilled energy professionals to advance economic development, energy affordability and national security objectives — goals that require strategic investments in infrastructure deployment across states. Energy professionals will serve both the public interest and their professional careers by working for state PUCs.

Today, these state regulatory agencies are understaffed, with many PUCs comprising fewer than 100 employees. By working for a PUC, engineers, economists, project managers, lawyers, communications experts, accountants, policymakers, cybersecurity professionals and others can roll up their sleeves and work on intellectually stimulating projects that offer significant professional growth while making a difference in American consumers’ lives.

State PUCs would be wise to take advantage of this new pool of highly-skilled workers that have proven their commitment to public service. Meanwhile, state-level policymakers should invest in well-resourced PUCs that can effectively serve as a bulwark against rising utility bills.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/A8kuC5O-KvZ7T4YTLJrTguu-WrPGgSkhajMRBQOEKxs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy04OTA4ODY5ODguanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-15 07:08:36.658711

One nonprofit believes if Senate Bill 197/House Bill 1389 had become law, Hoosiers would have faced higher utility bills. The Thriving Buildings Program relies on utility usage data gathered between 2021 and 2025 to help lower utility bills.

Paula Brooks, justice director for the nonprofit Hoosier Environmental Council, said conversations between community stakeholders, public officials and residents about building environments are key to the program's success.

""It gave building owners the opportunity to benchmark -- which is, make comparisons of their energy and water usage -- to be able to identify ways to save money on utility costs and most importantly, improve the air quality, reduce carbon emissions,"" she explained.

A building environment consists of building and construction materials and is a major contributor to global gas emissions. With the program's collected data, it is predicted that public health savings in Indianapolis could reach $77 million by 2030. Indianapolis is responsible for 66% of community-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

Brooks applauds the Thriving Buildings Program because residents feel their voices are being heard as their communities develop. But these voices also oppose President Donald Trump's recent executive orders to build more coal plants to boost electricity generation, and to ensure the EPA is assisting in promoting America's energy security.

Brooks believes there is another alternative to using coal as a power source.

""Renewables is not only the future, but it's happening now. This distribution model that we have now, where the energy companies hold all the power, it's only about 75 years old,"" she continued.

Renewable energy creates opportunities to look at new energy delivery models or ""energy democracy,"" with solar for microgrids. So, rather than having a huge power plant somewhere, she noted, the electricity could be in a community and owned by the community, while contributing to the electric generation for industrial use.

Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, are considering repealing the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives. Supporters of the measure say cuts would threaten jobs in Alaska. The efforts come as Alaska's liquid natural gas supplies will not be enough to meet demand in the state. That means the state may have to begin importing gas causing prices to rise.

Jennifer Hyde, federal infrastructure coordinator at the Alaska Center, hoped clean energy projects could begin benefitting the state before the crisis takes hold.

""We're hoping that communities can seize on IRA funds in order to actualize on solar projects, on wind projects, on hydro projects, on a number of other alternatives before this crisis happens,"" she explained.

Begich and other Republicans signed a letter arguing that the clean energy subsidies in the IRA will undermine America's energy dominance - and inflate energy costs. But Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has supported the clean energy incentives.

Anchorage business owner Ben Kellie is concerned about the impacts of the possible repeal of clean energy incentives on Alaska's economy, and said the incentives can mean major savings for Alaska families.

""This isn't just saving a few cents off of a bill. A lot of these projects are in communities where people are paying over a thousand dollars to heat and light small homes off the road system,"" Kellie said. ""This is real money that not only stays in the community and circulates, but helps families make ends meet through cold winters.""

In 2023, about a quarter of all Alaska energy came from renewable sources.

A new report from the Ohio River Valley Institute argued the oil and gas industry, not taxpayers, should cover the cost of plugging up hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil wells across Appalachia.

Plugging wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia could cost nearly $40 billion, with most of the burden coming from shale wells.

Dwayne Purvis, founder and principal consultant at Purvis Energy Advisors in Fort Worth, Texas, and co-author of the report, said he analyzed the Ohio River Valley along with other states, finding old shale wells are often unable to fund their own decommissioning.

""Of course, there are some shale wells are getting older and depleting, producing at slower rates, and even some that are shut in or marginal,"" Purvis explained. ""What we did in this study that was new for the first time, was to offer ideas on how financial assurance reform can address this disparity.""

Purvis pointed out there are currently more than 265,000 unplugged non-shale wells across the three states too, many of which also pose environmental risks. He added hundreds of thousands more were plugged decades ago but often to outdated standards, meaning they may still leak.

Purvis noted the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law jump-started efforts to plug oil wells but the funding was never meant to be permanent. He contended operators should pay for decommissioning the wells but acknowledged many cannot afford to do it.

""The next best option is what we've offered, that it needs to come from, the money for decommissioning, needs to come from other companies in the oil and gas business, who do have the income necessary to cover the liabilities of the industry as a whole in order to protect the public,"" Purvis outlined.

According to the report in the three states studied, Purvis' proposal would directly increase oil and gas employment by an estimated 32% and create more than 19,000 new jobs.

Supporters of the Campaign for Affordable Power are pressing state lawmakers to pass a series of reform bills aimed at big investor-owned utilities like Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric.

Edison brought in more than $1.6 billion in profit last year and has raised rates 85% over the last decade.

However, the company is still asking the California Public Utilities Commission for another big rate increase after the Los Angeles fires.

Lee Trotman, communications director for the Utility Reform Network in Oakland, said he is against further rate hikes.

""The way to stop these utilities from getting away with these rate increases is by publicly participating,"" said Trotman. ""And you can actually call in during the CPUC vote meetings. You can go online. You have to make yourself heard.""

All three utility companies say they need rate increases to cover their costs.

The California Senate Appropriations Committee is holding a hearing today on a reform bill that promotes public financing of electrical infrastructure.

Advocates for the bill argue the current method of bond financing makes projects more expensive.

Trotman said another bill to be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on Wednesday would restrict how utilities can use money earned from ratepayers.

""They'll use the ratepayers' money for lobbying, promotional advertising,"" said Trotman, ""and other non-energy related expenses out of the monthly energy bills, which so far has been legal.""

Other bills being considered by the legislature would require cost savings to be passed on to customers, and ban power shutoffs during wildfire smoke days and industrial accidents.

The energy grid in the U.S., particularly in regions like California, Texas, and the Northeast, is overstretched and increasingly unable to meet modern demands. California’s grid, for instance, is facing unprecedented strain with the sale of more electric vehicles (EVs), and air conditioning usage surging due to longer periods of high temperatures. EVs now account for 9% of new car sales in the U.S., and as the planet warms, air conditioners are running more intensively, more frequently, and for a greater number of hours. This simultaneous rise in EV charging and air conditioning usage in an increasingly hot world during peak hours places an unsustainable burden on an already fragile grid.

COMMENTARY

Unfortunately, EVs and air conditioning are not the only factors increasing stress on the grid. California’s ambitious climate policies are phasing out natural gas appliances in favor of electric ones. In Los Angeles County, as of May 2022, new homes can no longer include gas-fired stoves, water heaters, furnaces, or clothes dryers. This mandate, designed to reduce methane emissions, is a model that the rest of the state—and other parts of the nation—will follow.

The convergence of these factors—more EVs, more air conditioning, and the electrification of appliances and even whole industries—ensures that electricity demand will continue to increase. At the same time, the state’s aging transmission infrastructure, particularly high-voltage lines crossing California’s backcountry, poses a persistent wildfire risk. Studies show that over 85% of California’s wildfires have historically been caused by power line malfunctions, often during high winds when transmission lines spark and ignite dry brush below.

Clearly, California’s centralized grid model—built on 19th-century assumptions about electricity generation and delivery—is increasingly incompatible with modern realities. Unless we adopt a more resilient, localized, and sustainable energy model, the problems associated with our overtaxed grid will only worsen.

The Grid: A Flawed Legacy

The inefficiencies of today’s grid can be traced back to the debate between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison in the late 19th century. Tesla, backed by George Westinghouse, championed centralized electricity production delivered via high voltage alternating current (AC) transmission lines. Edison, on the other hand, argued for decentralized power generation using direct current (DC), which is 50% more efficient over short transmission distances and eliminates the need to rely on vulnerable long distance energy distribution networks.

Tesla’s AC model prevailed primarily because it allowed for electricity to be transmitted over longer distances. While arguably merited at that time and through much of the 20th Century, the limitations of this centralized grid model have become glaringly apparent. The reliance on long-distance power lines not only reduces efficiency, but also increases the risk of wildfires, outages, and delays in delivering power to end-users. Today, we are grappling with the consequences of that decision, with a grid that is prone to failure and a system that is incapable of accommodating the growing demand for clean electricity.

In California, the shortcomings of this aging system are painfully evident. Wildfires caused by transmission lines have already led to widespread, preemptive power shutoffs across the state. And as climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities over the coming decade, residents and businesses face the prospect of increasingly frequent and longer duration power outages.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are now being considered to replace, extend, and bury utility lines underground, without considering that the nearly 150-year-old concept upon which the grid system is based itself needs to be reimagined based on 21st century technology. Rather, to address these challenges, we must reimagine our approach to energy generation and delivery. Rather than doubling-down on the technology of the past, the solution lies in integrating localized power generation with existing infrastructure through microgrids— small-scale energy systems that operate independently as well as in conjunction with the main grid.

The World Business Academy was founded in 1986 as a result of discussions centered on the role and responsibility of business in relation to critical environmental and social challenges. Since that time, the Academy has been a 501(c)(3) non-profit that engages the business community in better understanding and practicing the role of business as an agent for positive social transformation and solutions to humanity’s largest challenges. The Academy’s focus on climate change, energy security, hydrogen, and optimized corporate governance through advocacy of stakeholder capitalism, results from an analysis of the most important threats to human survival. Its 38-year track record of leadership includes the publication of cutting-edge books, articles, podcasts, and videos discussing these topics and many other issues of primary importance to the evolving role of business in society.

Microgrids: A Resilient Alternative

Microgrids offer a modern, scalable, and resilient solution to the problems plaguing centralized power systems. By generating electricity locally and distributing it through existing substations, microgrids can eliminate the need for long-distance transmission lines and reduce the risk of grid overload and sustained outages.

In California, microgrids can dramatically enhance both reliability as well as safety. For example, Santa Barbara County relies on an aging “extension cord” transmission line that runs from Ventura through fire-prone backcountry terrain to Goleta. This line delivers 68% of the power needed for the Ventura-Goleta “load pocket” and most of the roughly 250,000 residents living in the area are blissfully unaware of the risk they face despite Southern California Edison’s public warnings that a failure of this line—due to either earthquakes, a wildfire, or severe weather—could leave the region without electricity for months.

By installing microgrids, these risks could be immediately and significantly reduced. The microgrids, powered by renewable energy sources like solar in Santa Barbara, and a combination of wind and solar in Lompoc, could also serve as a backup in the event of a transmission line failure. Similar strategies could be applied statewide to enhance grid resilience and reliability while meeting the ever-growing demand for electricity.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell-Enhanced Microgrids: The Missing Piece

While microgrids powered by renewables can reduce dependence on the centralized grid, they face a critical limitation: intermittent energy supply. Solar power is only available when the sun shines, and wind power depends on weather conditions. To ensure a constant power supply, microgrids need a reliable energy storage solution.

Batteries can provide a few minutes to hours, but providing longer-term backup is best supplied with hydrogen. Nothing can beat a hydrogen fuel cell for reliability and for the steady supply of power without surges or “noise” entering the system. This is why all modern server farms are already electing to install hydrogen-powered fuel cells. In a similar fashion, hydrogen fuel cells provide the perfect complement to renewables in microgrid systems. Rather than curtailing power when not required, using excess solar and wind energy to produce hydrogen through electrolysis affords microgrids with stored energy for later use. As needed, stored hydrogen can be used to power fuel cells and supply immediately dispatchable electricity generation with zero emissions.

In the case of Santa Barbara County, co-locating hydrogen fuel cells and storage facilities with electrical substations would provide a reliable backup power source. And supplemental hydrogen could be delivered as needed to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply, even during extended periods of low renewable energy generation.

Another advantage of this approach is the ability of microgrids to use direct current (DC) power. Unlike alternating (AC) current, which is used in traditional grid systems, as noted above, DC power is more efficient for short-distance transmission, and better-suited for modern energy applications, such as electric vehicle charging, battery storage and powering data center operations.

By adopting DC power within microgrids, we can reduce energy losses and improve overall system efficiency. This approach, which aligns with Edison’s original vision of decentralized power generation, will be more resilient, ultimately lower in cost, and more adaptable to modern energy demands.

Winners of a Decentralized Energy Future

The shift to integrated energy systems based on microgrids and hydrogen for back-up power will create significant benefits for consumers and gas utilities.

Microgrids provide reliable, locally generated power, reducing the risk of outages and enhancing resilience during natural disasters or grid failures. Additionally, since microgrids eliminate the need for long-distance transmission lines because they can port power from one microgrid to the adjacent one ad infinitum, they lower costs associated with energy delivery. Microgrids also reduce fire risk by obviating the need for high voltage lines rather than burying them underground. Over time, these savings will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower electricity bills.

This approach also provides an opportunity for utilities –and particularly natural gas transmission companies like SoCalGas– to reinvent themselves in a clean energy future. By transitioning from their 20th Century business model of delivering natural gas through trunk lines and local distribution, such companies can repurpose the existing rights-of-way they control to deliver hydrogen via upgraded pipelines to power fuel cells located at the electrical substations. Local electric lines, rather than aging gas distribution pipes, can then provide the last-mile distribution into consumers’ homes and businesses. SoCalGas could also deliver hydrogen directly to large volume users in the “hard to abate” industries like cement and steel manufacturing from a centralized hydrogen distribution system.

It’s time that the government and industry realize that the centralized grid model of the 19th century is no longer sufficient to meet the energy demands of the 21st Century. As electricity consumption rises and the risks associated with long-distance transmission lines grow, we must embrace a new approach to energy generation and delivery. By integrating microgrids with renewable energy, hydrogen fuel cells, and DC power, we can create a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy system and a path to thrive in a clean energy future, while assuring society of a reliable, sustainable energy system for generations to come.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-124816pm.png,N,,2025-05-15 07:08:46.041161

John Yang:

Geoff, the EPA has estimated that more than 158 million Americans are exposed to these chemicals through their drinking water. Last year, the Biden administration set very low limits for six common PFAS contaminants in drinking water.

Now the EPA says it's rescinding and reconsidering the standards for four of them. For the other two, the agency is giving water utilities two more years, until 2031, to meet the new limits.

Amudalat Ajasa covers environmental health for The Washington Post.

What are PFAS and how widespread are they?

Amudalat Ajasa:

They were met with challenges from the water utilities and chemical manufacturers who said that the costs were too steep and that the time was too tight for them to comply with the standards.

They were given until 2029 to do so. The EPA estimated that it would take them $1.5 billion each year to do so. The water utilities were saying it's going to take more than that. So the EPA is saying that they are keeping the deadlines for two of the more toxic and harmful chemicals that we know about, while rescinding and reconsidering four others.

Amudalat Ajasa:

Yes, the environmental groups are pretty concerned. The EPA is allowing — is keeping the maximum containment for PFOA and PFOS, which are really toxic and known, but they have also been phased out in the U.S., right?

So these environmentalists are concerned that by rescinding and reconsidering the four others, some of which are substitutes for those other harmful ones, that the health effects could be amplified. And on top of that, environmentalists are worried that the Safe Drinking Water Act has an anti-backsliding provision, which bars the agency from weakening the bill, so — weakening the rules.

So this proposal, they say, could be in violation of that.

John Yang:

And this is just one of the many differences between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on this. And, in addition, they're — along with President Trump's goal of shrinking the federal government, they're going to be cutting budgets. They're going to be cutting staff at the EPA.

""As a resident that lives near major sources of air pollution, our community desperately needs EGLE to stop ignoring the high levels of smog that are impacting my community and to follow through on their promise to do something about it.""

Ozone exposure causes serious health problems, including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, while higher ozone levels are associated with increases in asthma medication use, the number of asthma hospitalizations, and risk of death. On the Eastside of Detroit, where the NOI highlights the worst air quality, residents are in the 98th percentile or above regarding asthma hospitalizations compared to the state average.

""Every step of the way, EGLE has put polluters over people,"" said Robert Shobe, Director of Justice for Beniteau. ""They allowed Stellantis to build an auto plant less than 500 feet from my backyard even though asthma is a huge problem in my community. Then they blamed high levels of smog on the Eastside of Detroit on wildfire smoke. Now they aren't following their own pollution reduction plan. Meanwhile, my community has had to live with unsafe levels of air pollution for 10 years.""

Background

In 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated a seven-county area in Southeast Michigan as failing to meet the ozone air quality standards set by Clean Air Act. By January of 2022, the State of Michigan had requested that the EPA redesignate the same area as safe, citing Canadian wildfires as the source of violations in the air monitoring. The EPA approved the change in May of 2023, however since then air quality monitors in the designated area have continued to show regular ozone levels beyond what is defined as safe in the Clean Air Act.

Sierra Club is a national nonprofit organization that works to protect the quality of the natural and human environment and safeguard the health of communities from environmental pollution. It currently has more than 17,000 members living in Michigan and an active state chapter.

Advocates hope to avoid litigation through discussions with EGLE that will lead to meaningful action to reduce ozone pollution.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-15 09:04:59.452725

A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went towards Republican congressional districts.","House Republicans Wednesday moved forward with a tax bill to cut billions of dollars in climate-related funding, reduce regulations, and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits as part of President Trump's, ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill.""

The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Cuts would impact businesses and consumers, affecting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Concurrently, House Republicans proposed streamlining permitting for fossil fuels, rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding, and allocating $2 billion to the strategic petroleum reserve.

The Inflation Reduction Act has led to $321 billion worth of climate investment being completed, with $522 billion worth of investments still in process, according to a report from the Clean Investment Monitor. Congress was tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to fund President Trump's tax cuts.

House Republicans are hoping to have a floor vote next week prior to Memorial Day, after which the bill will go to the Senate.

Four Republican Senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune cautioning the caucus against a ""full-scale repeal"" of tax credits, adding that repealing credits would be disruptive to businesses which had made investments based on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax framework. They also added that cuts would lead to higher energy costs.

Twenty-one House Republicans wrote a similar letter in March urging against cuts to energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went towards Republican congressional districts.

Environmental groups and renewable energy companies have been on Capitol Hill lobbying to protect tax credits they say are vital to support new industries. Raghu Belur, co-founder of Enphase Energy, a solar components manufacturer, expected changes to the IRA, but didn't expect them to go this far.

""I thought there would be a glide path, I thought there would be a reasonable transition period. Instead it's become very abrupt,"" he told CBS News.

His company has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. But Belur also worries about the downstream effects on businesses that have formed around renewable energy, like solar installers, which tend to be small businesses.

Among their concerns, Belur and the Solar Energy Industries Association have been focusing on the importance of a tax credit that helps homeowners to finance solar projects. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the credit at the end of 2025. The credit was previously slated to be phased out by 2034. He says the credits help support customer demand for nascent businesses, and that the renewable energy sector finally had momentum that should be supported as promised at this stage of their industry.

""Fossil fuels have been receiving subsidies for the last 100-plus years,"" Belur told CBS News. ""I always believe that subsidies must be a catalyst, not a crutch, we are not asking for an infinite extension of this.""

The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.

""At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,"" the group said in a statement.

Several tax credits and incentives are set to be phased out early or end, impacting a wide range of projects, including solar, geothermal, nuclear, wind, and hydrogen. The $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that President Trump campaigned against will be ended, as well as manufacturing credits to produce electric vehicles.

Funding for other Inflation Reduction Act initiatives are also projected to be cut. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week that the cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports, and environmental justice grants.

Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonpartisan clean energy advocacy group, believes the version of the budget proposed by the GOP would make it harder to quickly increase energy production through renewables, and could lead American renewable energy industries to fall behind the rest of the world.

""This is largely a repeal of the inflation Reduction Act,"" Chapman told CBS News. ""What this bill will do is reduce the availability of energy, increase costs for energy that's coming on the grid, and make it more difficult to pull innovative American technologies that will produce clean energy towards the market.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/22/4221208a-1f78-4b7b-8df5-df838b92d272/thumbnail/1200x630/092df1fb01e98f5787a41fa2ecdceb26/gettyimages-489193525.jpg?v=d8ac70a2c93631c1c3223eab6ec7acf9,N,,2025-05-15 04:02:29.082937

It would be an overstatement to say this proves it’s now impossible to win support with economic policy.
But we can say that the Biden administration’s theory that economic benefits will automatically produce large political changes, at least at this moment in history, is wrong.","One of the ironies of Joe Biden’s green industrial policy, as enacted through the CHIPS Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and especially the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), was that about three-quarters of the benefits have accrued to Republican congressional districts. The point of these laws, which set out a giant array of subsidies for clean energy, infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing, was to get America back on the cutting economic edge. Advanced technological products and inputs like solar panels, batteries, and semiconductors, which very obviously are going to drive global economic growth through the rest of the century, would be brought back to the U.S. Future technologies like advanced geothermal, a new generation of nuclear reactors, and green hydrogen production would be brought online.

Despite some teething problems, it was working well. Investment in solar panels and battery storage skyrocketed under Biden’s term, and factories were going up all across the country. In just one presidential term, America became almost self-sufficient in solar panel production.

More from Ryan Cooper

But perhaps not for long. Just $321 billion of IRA spending has gone out the door, with an estimated $522 billion still at stake. Republicans in the various House committees have begun marking up their sections of the GOP reconciliation bill containing their whole legislative agenda, and this week the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees released their proposals. As Brad Plumer and Harry Stevens write at The New York Times, they amount to a near-gutting of the IRA, and hence a devastating blow to the economies of GOP districts, to pay for tax cuts for the rich.

The electric-vehicle consumer credit and the hydrogen power credit would be mostly ended this year, while the clean-energy and battery factory subsidies would be made much harder to access and formally ended in 2031, rather than 2035. What’s more, as Emily Pontecorvo details at Heatmap News, the ability to “transfer” green tax credits (making them much more valuable) would be ended, and subsidies for household rooftop solar, heat pumps, efficient appliances, and home insulation would be ended this year, along with other cuts.

In short, America’s manufacturing renaissance would be taken out behind the woodshed and summarily dispatched, so that Elon Musk and his fellow billionaires can get even richer.

Red states benefited from Bidenomics partly on purpose and partly by accident. The political theory of the law was that if a whole bunch of politically diverse regions benefited, the new factories and such would naturally develop a bipartisan constituency. This is entirely rational and arguably would have worked perfectly at most times in American history. It’s the same reason why defense contractors spread out their construction of projects like the F-35 over as many congressional districts as possible. For decades, conservative Republicans, who at all other times espouse penny-pinching austerity for the welfare state, have suddenly became New Deal Keynesians regarding weapons manufacturers in their districts.

Republican voters elected a president and Congress who are on the verge of shipping all these factories and jobs back to China.

But even more IRA investment flowed to red states than anticipated, because wages are lower in those states, and especially because land is much cheaper in depopulated regions than it is in urban areas where a chronic housing shortage has driven prices through the roof. Blue cities’ inability (or unwillingness) to build housing not only has led to skyrocketing home prices, population outflows, and a disastrous erosion in Democrats’ Electoral College prospects, but now is also strangling green investment.

As of now, before the entire Republican House delegation has decided what it wants to cut, the political strategy behind the IRA is still in play. Earlier this month, 26 House Republicans sent a letter calling for much of the law to be preserved. In response, 38 other Republican members sent their own letter demanding a complete repeal. As my colleague David Dayen points out, the GOP’s only-partly-crazed caucus and its stark-raving-mad counterpart are at daggers drawn over this and a dozen other priorities. If anything saves the IRA, it might be Republican extremists’ inability to accept a half-a-loaf compromise rather than the fact that the law benefited conservative voters.

It’s a remarkable development given the traditional narratives around Trump and trade. He came to political power and eventually the presidency against a background of decades of deindustrialization caused by neoliberal trade policy. Voting data from 2016 showed that Trump had swung many traditionally Democratic regions in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan where factories had been closed and jobs had been shipped to foreign countries. His promise of “America First” and attacks on unfair trade practices seemed to win over voters harmed by NAFTA and the China shock. Four years earlier, Barack Obama won re-election with a blisteringly populist campaign attacking Mitt Romney as a financial assassin of Missouri steel factories. The Biden administration, reasonably enough, concluded that it was high time to revitalize these regions with industrial policy.

In response, Republican voters elected a president and Congress who are on the verge of shipping all these factories and jobs back to China, if not just destroying them outright, to make budget headroom for tax cuts for the rich. In effect, these voters responded to the most comprehensive attempt to provide concrete benefits to them since the New Deal by loading an economic shotgun and pointing it directly at themselves. The proposed cuts coming out of the House committees has them groping for the trigger.

It would be an overstatement to say this proves it’s now impossible to win support with economic policy. As noted, some Republicans have at least partly come around. The benefits of the IRA were just starting to flow in 2024, and what’s more, most of the factories it had funded are still under construction. If the law had another couple of years to entrench itself, it would probably be harder to repeal.

But we can say that the Biden administration’s theory that economic benefits will automatically produce large political changes, at least at this moment in history, is wrong. As I have previously written, with the decline of local journalism and the rise of social media brain-poisoning, a large fraction of voters have never heard about IRA projects even in their own neighborhood. For their part, the Democrats are crying out for a media apparatus that can consistently deliver their messaging to voters, rather than an all-out advertising blitz for a few months every four years.

New Dealers were absolutely shameless about this kind of messaging, by the way, slapping big boasting plaques on every public works project and hiring Woody Guthrie to drive around the Pacific Northwest to write songs praising public hydropower.",https://prospect.org/downloads/22874/download/Cooper-IRA%20repeal%20051425.jpg?cb=201c8da632e720140e2c58cea7e7c59e&w=1024,N,,2025-05-15 06:02:09.653339

The lawsuit, brought on behalf of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group, argued that the deletions violated rules around citizens' access to government information.

The USDA's reversal comes ahead of a scheduled May 21 hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the agency's actions in federal court in New York.

The department had removed resources on its websites related to climate-smart farming, conservation practices, rural clean energy projects and access to federal loans related to those areas after President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.

WASHINGTON — In alignment with President Trump’s agenda to eliminate burdensome regulations and stimulate economic growth, the Department of the Interior announced today the proposed rescission of a rule governing solar and wind energy development on public lands. The proposed rescission of the Bureau of Land Management’s clean energy regulation marks a significant policy shift, aimed at removing what officials describe as federal overreach and opening the door to expanded land use and energy independence.

“Eliminating the Biden administration’s preferential treatment of unaffordable, unreliable ‘intermittent’ projects and dismantling excessive, one-sided restrictions on traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and critical minerals, will unlock the full potential of America’s natural resources,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “This step will restore balance, strengthens our energy independence, and ensures taxpayers get the maximum return from the responsible use of our public lands.”

The move would eliminate rate reductions that biased renewable energy development over other energy sources, while still allowing renewables to play a part in achieving American Energy Dominance. This action would align with the direction of Executive Order 14154 and Secretary’s Order 3418, Unleashing American Energy, which will reinvigorate the U.S. energy sector by creating high-paying jobs as well as safe, reliable, and robust domestic energy production on BLM-managed lands.

The proposed rescission underscores the Department’s broader commitment to prioritizing balanced, all-of-the-above energy development that serves the national interest. By rolling back policies seen as obstructive to traditional energy industries, the Interior is paving the way for greater innovation, job creation, and economic opportunity—while reaffirming its dedication to responsible stewardship of America’s vast public lands.

Today, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken federal limits on PFAS “forever chemicals” in drinking water. The agency intends to rescind current standards for PFHxS, PFNA, and GenX (HFPO-DA), and reconsider the regulatory approach for the Hazard Index mixture, which includes these substances plus PFBS. Additionally, EPA plans to delay compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS and introduce a federal exemption framework. According to Waterkeeper Alliance, these actions add up to a clear concession to polluters.

Marc Yaggi, Chief Executive Officer of Waterkeeper Alliance issued the following statement in response:

“Today’s decision makes one thing clear: this government is siding with polluters over people. Rolling back protections against PFAS is a direct assault on public health and clean water. Millions of people in America now face greater risks of cancer, immune damage, and other serious health threats from preventable exposure to known toxic pollutants, while EPA abandons its core duty to protect them. Administrator Zeldin has acknowledged the dangers of PFAS. If he meant a word of it, he must reverse this decision and strengthen protections, not gut them. Communities need real action, not more broken promises.”

Specifically, the Alliance cites the weakening and delay of the drinking water standard for PFAS as a violation of the ‘anti-backsliding’ provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act. Under the law, EPA can only set regulations for pollutants in drinking water that “maintain or provide for greater protection of human health.” Any new or revised standard must maintain or enhance public health protections. Otherwise, rescinding the regulations for a majority of regulated PFAS types, creating compliance loopholes, and delaying implementation would violate federal law.

EPA’s proposed extension of deadlines from 2029 to 2031, could also have serious ramifications for the economy and human health. Researchers at NYU Langone Health, estimate the economic burden of these PFAS health effects at a cost of a minimum of $5.5 billion and as much as $63 billion per year. This is an economic burden unfairly passed on to the public who is poisoned while they wait for a problem to be addressed that EPA has known about since 1998.",https://waterkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2509361309.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 11:17:26.283829

This week, the House Ways and Means Committee released and marked up its portion of the budget reconciliation bill. This is the committee we’ve been watching — and lobbying — most closely this spring to protect clean energy tax credits from repeal.

The worst outcome from this committee would have been outright repeal of all the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. We’re glad to say that the committee’s text does NOT outright repeal the clean energy tax credits.

But, unfortunately, that’s pretty much all we’re glad about. The Ways and Means Committee proposed significant changes to the clean energy tax credits that would be dismal for climate and clean energy.

These changes include things like:

Phasing out tax credits for production and investments in clean electricity and existing nuclear power from 2029 to 2032. The new clean power plants, which take years to permit and build, would have to be operational by those dates to qualify for the tax credits.

Ending tax credits for home energy efficiency and heat pumps by the end of this year

Ending the 30% tax credit for rooftop solar and batteries by the end of this year

…and much more, including many tax credits related to electric vehicles

See more details about all the changes from CCL Research Manager Dana Nuccitelli in CCL Community’s forums here.

According to an early Rhodium analysis, the committee’s proposed changes would “raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk.”

So, to be clear, CCL doesn’t endorse this legislation, and we won’t encourage members of Congress to vote for it.

But we’ve seen that our dedicated, defensive advocacy helped dodge the bullet of outright repeal. We’ve seen new allies speak up during this fight. Some Senate Republicans have already said that the Ways and Means Committee went too far in slashing the clean energy tax credits — and these are Senators who we lobbied on the tax credits earlier this year.

We can continue to build on that support. Our continued advocacy could further blunt the potential damage from this legislation. So we will double down on our defense as the budget reconciliation process moves forward from here.

Let’s take a stand before the full House vote

After an “hours-long, overnight meeting that featured heated debate,” according to The Hill, the Ways and Means Committee passed their portion of the budget with the above changes.

But it’s important to understand that the budget reconciliation process is far from over.

Other House committees have been releasing their own portions of the budget reconciliation bill and holding votes. Some have passed already, like the portions from the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

(Note that several of these other committees will affect other portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, too. We’ve focused primarily on defending the clean energy tax credits because we felt our grassroots volunteers could make the most impact and because those tax credits delivered the most significant emissions reductions of any climate measures in the IRA.)

All together, the portions passed by the committees will combine to form one big budget reconciliation bill that will head to the House floor for a vote. A House vote is not yet scheduled for the full reconciliation bill, but Republican Party leadership has suggested they are aiming to hold this vote by Memorial Day.

So, with potentially less than two weeks between now and the full House vote — this is our next moment in the process to make a stand for the clean energy tax credits.

How this could all play out

As we continue our push to preserve the clean energy tax credits, there are two main ways this could play out. Let’s take a look at each one.

Scenario 1: More support leads to lighter cuts

As negotiations progress, we could see a growing group of Republicans treat the IRA clean energy tax credits as one of their top priorities and be willing to go to bat for them. This is the scenario we’re working to make happen.

We’ve already seen many Republican voices speak up in letters in support of the tax credits — 21 House Republicans in one letter, 4 Senate Republicans, another group of 26 House Republicans, and so on. Our advocacy can continue to build on this support, potentially leading to amendments in the full House bill or to a Senate version that does not cut the tax credits so drastically.

Another possibility, is that if enough lawmakers are feeling pressure not to support this legislation (whether because of the clean energy tax credits, or Medicaid cuts, etc.), there may not be enough votes to pass the reconciliation bill at all or this process may drag on for months as they work to find a package that has enough support to pass.

If the reconciliation effort falls apart and we get to the end of the year with no deal, there would likely be a push for a bipartisan tax extenders package. It is almost guaranteed that any bipartisan package on the clean energy tax credits would be better than the current reconciliation proposals but we would remain engaged and advocating for their preservation.

Scenario 2: The cuts to the clean energy tax credits don’t change, or Republicans seek even deeper cuts.

It’s possible that lawmakers will continue to stick by these deep cuts to the clean energy tax credits. They could pass the full House bill with these deep cuts as is, and the Senate could also pass similarly deep cuts. That’s not what we want to see.

The clean energy tax credits could be vulnerable to even further cuts as the process continues to unfold.

That’s because the Republican Party has extremely slim majorities in both the House and the Senate. To pass a budget reconciliation bill, they need essentially every Republican to vote for it. So, Republicans will be looking hard to find enough spending cuts they can all agree on, and they could come back to the clean energy tax credits to find those cuts.

That’s why our advocacy remains vital. We need to make sure that lawmakers can’t ignore the nationwide support for the clean energy tax credits, so at the very least, they don’t try to cut them even more than they are trying to right now.

Make your voice heard now

We’ve set up a new action tool for you to contact Republicans in both the House and the Senate in this key period before the House vote and as the Senate begins to discuss changes they want to see to the House bill.

For Republicans in the House, we are suggesting amendments that we would like to see before the full House votes on the complete budget reconciliation package. These amendments would prevent the worst cuts proposed to the clean energy tax credits, leading to a better outcome than the current version.

Specifically, we’re asking for things like striking the repeals of tax credit transferability for clean energy tax credits, since transferability makes tax credits more efficient, and preserving the home efficiency tax credits that so many homeowners have benefitted from.

For Republicans in the Senate, we are starting with a more general message, encouraging them to work with the Senate Finance Committee to protect all of the clean energy tax credits in their version of the bill.

Don’t forget: for something to actually become law, everything needs to happen on the Senate side, too — committee votes and then passage by the full Senate. Ultimately, the House and Senate would have to agree on and pass the same version of the bill for it to go to the president to be signed into law.

Bloomberg News

(TNS)

House Republicans released their first stab at a bill to extend President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which would help pay for them by overhauling much of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law.

The draft framework put out Monday by the Ways and Means Committee takes aim at billions of dollars of incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for electric vehicles and solar and wind projects—subsidies Trump has derided as part of a “green new scam.”

Several segments of clean energy stand to lose out under the framework, which is an early blueprint and will likely see revisions during the legislative process. Electric vehicle credits would end after next year. A home clean energy credit would terminate after this year, making rooftop-solar systems more expensive for consumers who want to buy them.

But segments would fare far better than had been feared in the weeks leading up to the release of the proposal. Tax credits for making solar panels or batteries in the U.S. would, for example, be phased out just a year earlier than scheduled. The draft bill takes more of a “scalpel than a sledgehammer” to Biden’s law, said analysts with Jefferies.

Still, it’s mostly bad news for the U.S. clean energy sector and for efforts to reduce the nation’s climate emissions, which the IRA was estimated to cut by 43% to 48% below 2005 levels over the next decade, according to one analysis.

The overhaul would raise energy costs for U.S. households by as much as 7% in 2035, according to a preliminary analysis by the Rhodium Group. The plan would save the government more than $560 billion on energy tax credits over 10 years, according to an official nonpartisan congressional estimate.

The House proposal, of course, is far from final—and is already facing pushback from some Republicans in the Senate.

The plan “needs refinement,” said Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He serves on the Senate’s tax writing committee and was one of four Republicans to sign a letter last month vowing to defend the IRA’s energy tax credits. “It needs more transitions. It’s not quite what we would author out here.”

Here’s who loses big, and not quite so big, under the House proposal.

Big losers

EV makers and buyers

Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and other electric vehicle makers and their customers stand to be among the biggest losers. Biden’s climate law extended a lucrative tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV and also expanded the credit to allow used and commercial electric vehicles to qualify. The Republican tax plan would eliminate the consumer vehicle credit by the end of next year. Only carmakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs by the end of this year would would be eligible to receive it in 2026. The GOP proposal also would end credits for used and commercial electric vehicles. The repeal of all three credits would result in more than $190 billion in savings for the government over 10 years, according to the congressional estimate.

Solar-shopping homeowners

Homeowners who want to buy solar panels and other clean energy systems for their homes would lose a popular 30% tax credit at year’s end under the proposal. The move, if it becomes law, would be a blow for those who want to invest in producing their own clean energy as a hedge against rising utility bills and power outages. The tax change would also hurt solar-equipment makers such as Enphase Energy Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. The move would save the government $77 billion over 10 years, according to the estimate.

Nuclear power sector

The plan would phase out a tax credit for the production of nuclear power and completely end it starting in 2032. Proponents of nuclear say that since no new projects are expected to come online by then, operators of future plants and developers of small modular reactors likely won’t get access to the credit. A number of technology giants are counting on new nuclear plants to offer carbon-free power for their data centers to run energy-intensive artificial intelligence applications.

Hydrogen producers

A tax credit for hydrogen production, which provides as much as $3 per kilogram, is set to be eliminated starting in 2026. The credit was designed to spur a domestic industry for the clean-burning fuel, which is seen as a critical for decarbonizing steel, cement and heavy transportation. Its repeal would represent a blow to producers such as Plug Power Inc., as well as for companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and others that had been lobbying to have the credit tweaked so hydrogen made using natural gas could take full advantage of it.

Not-so-big losers

Utility-scale renewables

The Republican plan phases out and and puts new restrictions on a pair of investment and production tax credits for wind, solar and other clean electricity production. Both credits would start to phase down for projects placed in service starting in 2029, and would completely end for any projects after 2031. In addition, the Republican bill wouldn’t allow projects that use materials from foreign adversaries such as China and Russia. And the transferability of tax credits would also be pinched, which utilities developing renewables say would result in higher customer bills.

But the news for solar and wind was better than expected, since many investors had anticipated a swifter phase-out. JPMorgan analysts said the GOP plan “aligns with, or exceeds, the more bullish end of investor expectations.” Shares of First Solar Inc., the biggest U.S. solar manufacturer, climbed on Monday.

All in all, the changes are estimated to prevent more than $182 billion in government spending over 10 years, with nearly $155 billion of that coming from the investment tax credit alone.

Carbon capture and storage

A tax credit that provides as much as $85 a ton for the storage of carbon dioxide survives in the GOP plan. But the Republican proposal places new restrictions on it, disallowing the credit for projects that are owned or “influenced” by certain foreign countries, such as China. The tweak would save the government an estimated $18 billion.

Trump was reportedly anti-incentive prior to returning to office in January, and he got rid of his predecessor's EV targets as part of a flurry of early-term executive order decrees. The next step, if his party has its way, is to kill federal tax incentives for electrified vehicles.

Credits Got More Americans into EVs

These clean-vehicle credits date back to President Obama and were in place during Trump's first term. Under the Biden administration, they were expanded as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which removed per-manufacturer caps on the number of credits that could be applied to new vehicles. It also added requirements about final-assembly location and battery material sources.

Currently, buyers can still get up to $7500 off qualified new vehicles. A $7500 commercial credit applies to leases, going to the leasing company but generally being passed on to consumers in the form of a discount. As proposed, the budget would completely kill the tax credit after 2026. However, models from automakers such as GM and Tesla, which have sold more than 200,000 EVs, won't be eligible for the credit after December 31, 2025. Meanwhile, the proposed bill would also do away with tax credits for the purchase of used EVs, which are currently as much as $4000, limited to a portion of the vehicle's purchase price.

These efforts spurred more purchases of EVs (your author's included) and plug-in hybrids, while also encouraging automakers to move final assembly to North America so that their products would qualify for the full credits. Some have already done so, with others' plans in progress. Those massive on-shoring investments may prove to have been for nought.

What Happens If Incentives Disappear?

A lot has to happen before this or any budget is passed. Removing these credits obviously removes much of the financial incentive of purchasing a vehicle with a plug. This, combined with on-again, off-again tariffs on new vehicles and parts, would throw much of the auto industry further into policy-related confusion. While politicians can change the game with the stroke of a pen, it takes automakers a long time—months or years—to adjust which products they make, where, and in what volumes. Development for vehicles planned for years from now is already underway, some of which might have to be scrapped if they're no longer financially viable.

In the short term, if approved, this budget change would likely lead to a run on EV inventories through the end of next year. After that, automakers would have the choice of selling and leasing fewer cars at full price without the incentive or lowering prices (and thus profits) to keep buyers interested. As for the used market, residual values of pre-owned EVs and plug-ins are likely to take a hit without available credits. A lack of investment in EVs could also lead to a larger development gap between Chinese manufacturers and those in the rest of the world.

There's also the possibility that some or all of the credits are retained as part of congressional budget negotiations. But, given Trump's general stance towards non-Tesla EVs, it seems we may soon see EV sales boom before they go bust.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-chevrolet-equinox-ev-lt-awd-109-66d9ea71e9c02.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.171xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-14 23:00:32.261810

If it can deliver on its promise, the Slate EV could be a game-changer – not just for budget-conscious drivers, but for the entire electric vehicle movement.","Electric vehicles are often seen as sleek, high-tech machines with price tags to match. But what if you stripped away the luxury – and kept the electric? A new startup called Slate is doing exactly that, introducing a back-to-basics electric vehicle that’s not only affordable but fully customizable, starting at a potentially groundbreaking price of just $20,000 with federal tax credits.

The company’s name, Slate, plays on the idea of a “blank slate” – a vehicle that’s as bare-bones as it gets, but designed to be tailored to your lifestyle. Built on a single modular EV platform, Slate offers three distinct body styles: a compact truck, a no-frills SUV, and a practical hatchback. Each version is minimalist by design, aimed at urban drivers and first-time EV owners who prioritize function and affordability over premium features.

At its core, the Slate EV is about choice. Buyers can start by selecting the body style that best suits their needs, and then move on to customizing exterior elements. The base model ships in a neutral matte gray, but users can opt for custom vinyl wraps or partial graphic kits for a personal touch. The interior continues this modular philosophy – buyers can add only what they need and skip what they don’t.

And yes, that includes audio. The standard model doesn’t come with built-in speakers. Instead, buyers can either purchase Slate’s own speaker system or choose a simple mount for a portable Bluetooth speaker they already own. It’s one of many examples of how Slate is redefining the essentials in favor of cost savings and flexibility.

Inside the cabin, drivers will find a digital instrument display that doubles as a backup camera monitor. There’s no infotainment system – no navigation, no Netflix, no oversized touchscreen. Instead, drivers are encouraged to mount their phones and use their own apps for navigation and entertainment. Slate includes physical climate controls, a design choice that keeps costs down while appealing to drivers who appreciate tactile feedback.

The focus is on practicality. Everything included in the base model is there because it serves a clear purpose, not because it looks futuristic or checks a box on a spec sheet.

Slate’s most disruptive feature isn’t its modularity – it’s the price. The vehicle is expected to launch with a starting MSRP of $27,000. But with available federal EV tax credits, that price could drop as low as $20,000, making it one of the most affordable electric vehicles in the U.S. market. For context, many EVs still hover in the $35,000–$50,000 range or higher, even after incentives.

This affordability is crucial in the broader push toward widespread EV adoption. While many automakers have focused on luxury or performance EVs, Slate is targeting an underserved segment: drivers who want an electric car that gets them from point A to B without the frills or financial burden.

Slate isn’t trying to impress with horsepower or luxury interiors. It’s trying to change the conversation around EVs entirely – making them approachable, adaptable, and most importantly, affordable. In an industry where the average EV price continues to rise, Slate’s back-to-basics approach might just be what the market needs.

As Slate moves closer to production, the EV world will be watching closely. If it can deliver on its promise, the Slate EV could be a game-changer – not just for budget-conscious drivers, but for the entire electric vehicle movement.

But climate action advocates note that there will be new costs associated with repeal of the clean energy policy.","Congress began tearing down the most consequential climate policy it had ever passed as torrents from a 1,000-mile-long atmospheric river lashed Washington, D.C.

The worst impacts of Tuesday’s storm were far up the Potomac River. Any concerns about how the United States would grapple with the increasingly intense weather of a warming world receded to background noise, less audible than the rain pelting the Capitol dome.

Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted to repeal clean energy incentives early Wednesday after an all-night session marking up legislation they titled “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” The $4.9 trillion package would extend the tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump’s first term and add a few more, such as eliminating taxes on tips, while ramping up border security spending.

A portion of the funds to pay for the bill—about 11 percent, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s tally—would come from eradicating tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that were meant to spur a U.S. transition to cleaner energy.

Billions of dollars of private investment have poured into hundreds of new electric vehicle and battery plants and other clean energy projects in the wake of the IRA’s passage, with much of the boom occurring in Republican-led states. As President Joe Biden’s climate team left the White House, they expressed faith that this bipartisan impact would give the IRA durability, even though it had passed Congress with solely Democratic votes. The House Ways and Means Committee decisively put this notion to rest with its 389-page draft.

“Make no mistake, this bill takes a sledgehammer approach,” a coalition of environmental groups wrote in a letter to committee leaders. The legislation “guts America’s clean energy production, raises costs for families, worsens air pollution, and eliminates hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs – all to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires.”

The outnumbered Democrats on the committee focused their fight on the legislation’s other impacts—like its massive cuts to Medicaid and food assistance—with little or no mention of the energy tax credits. Republicans maintained that lowered taxes benefited the vast majority of ordinary Americans.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is the key to making America great again,” said Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “This bill wasn’t drafted by special interests or K Street lobbyists. It was drafted by the American people in communities across the country.” Smith talked about mothers, farmers and owners of small businesses who lauded the tax cuts during field hearings committee Republicans held last year. But certainly big business lobbyists also liked the package, including the American Petroleum Institute, which called it a plan “that supports American energy leadership.”

This committee vote is just the first step in a long, byzantine process known as “budget reconciliation,” special legislation that has an easier path to passage because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate. In the past decade, nearly all major policy, including the IRA, has been enacted through this route.

The bill will be changed before it hits the president’s desk because of bitter disputes among Republicans over the so-called SALT deduction cap in states with high state and local taxes and over public lands in the West. But whether any of the clean energy incentives can be saved in this process will depend largely on the clout of a few Republicans who have dared to voice support for them amid Trump’s vocal campaign to end what he calls the “new green scam.”

Here are the main points to know about the politics, the people to watch and the huge potential consequences for climate change.

“The Most Complicated Venn Diagram”

Clean energy advocates were heartened two months ago when 21 House Republicans sent Smith a letter urging his committee to maintain support for the energy tax credits that were spurring economic development in their districts. Given the Republicans’ narrow majority, their no votes could sink any attempt at repeal.

But fissures began to emerge, with some of the would-be Republican clean energy champions concerned primarily with the biofuels incentives that are popular in farm country. Biofuel tax credits were the only climate policy that got a boost from the House Ways and Means committee; it extended them to 2031, four years beyond their original expiration date.

Faring worst in the legislation were consumer credits, like those for the purchase of electric vehicles, home efficiency upgrades or solar installations; all would expire by year’s end.

“Basically the suite of consumer-focused credits is just being torn out root and branch, everything from stuff that’ll help people better insulate their homes, to get solar on the roofs, to find more cost effective transportation,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy United, which lobbies for the clean energy industry. “These are all the tools that people are using to help manage rising energy and transportation costs. We’re taking those tools away from people at a time of rising costs—that is dangerous and problematic in and of itself.”

“I will emphasize this is a starting point and it’s very unlikely this version will become law. However, a lot of this could become law, and that’s the concerning thing.”

— Chris Moyer, Echo Communications

But the Republican leadership framed clean energy incentives as something solely of interest to the upper classes, naming this section of the legislation, “Working Families Over Elites.” (In fact, Democrats had designed the IRA to extend the benefits of clean energy to working class communities, offering tax credits for used EVs for the first time and providing bonus tax credits for projects located near old fossil fuel industry sites or in low-income communities.)

The tax credits that go to businesses and investors are eliminated more slowly, with phase-out of most beginning in 2029. But since the consumer credits would help generate the market demand that developers and producers are relying on, the extra time may not help.

“This is the first concrete act of this Congress to attempt to dismantle these tax credits, and a lot of folks in the industry were hoping for a better starting point,” said Chris Moyer, a former Democratic staffer on Capitol Hill and the founder of Echo Communications, who now advises clean energy companies. “I will emphasize this is a starting point and it’s very unlikely this version will become law. However, a lot of this could become law, and that’s the concerning thing.”

He and other clean energy advocates will argue that withdrawing support for new energy projects is at odds with Trump’s energy abundance and dominance themes. The vulnerable tax credits are especially important for forms of energy that Republicans say they support, like nuclear and advanced geothermal developments, that need a long lead time.

So far, Republicans have put the big Trump tax cuts first. Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY), who called in March for preservation of the energy tax credits, voted with her fellow GOP members on Ways and Means to repeal them, even while noting that she would have liked government support maintained for the four nuclear power stations in her upstate district. “Individual priorities do not take precedence over ensuring American families, workers and businesses do not face tax hikes in 2026,” she said.

Godfrey said that if repeal of the clean energy tax credits were a standalone bill, he did not see how it could get out of the House or Senate. But the dynamic is more difficult when Republican supporters of clean energy would have to stand in the way of Trump’s promised tax cuts.

“The politics are incredibly complicated, and [it] creates an incredible amount of pressure on a member to really hone in on their particular priorities,” Godfrey said. He said advocacy on the measure involves putting together “the most complicated Venn diagram in the world” to figure out how to build a coalition of votes that can make a difference.

“The question really does become, are enough members going to say, ‘This is the hill I’m going to die on?’” Godfrey said. “That is hard to discern.”

In the coming weeks, much attention will be on the four Republican senators who last month signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota voicing support for the energy tax credits: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas. It is seen as a critical mass of support, since Republicans can afford to lose no more than three votes in the Senate, given their 53-47 majority.

Although they emphasized only one set of clean energy incentives in their letter—the investment tax credits—advocates hope they also will support the entire suite of consumer incentives as well, since they help generate the market demand that the producers rely on.

“As constituents share their practical economic benefits of going solar, we are confident that their senators will fix the House’s extreme and reckless budget,” said Glen Brand, vice president for policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors.

Pressure Points

Moyer, however, wrote in a recent note that he is concerned that only four Republican Senators have stepped forward in favor of clean energy policy, and he said it is clear from their letter that they want to work behind the scenes instead of forcing a showdown on the Senate floor. He is urging clients to ramp up public pressure and hold in-district press events until the days that votes are taken.

“The message has to be that you can’t let up,” Moyer told Inside Climate News. “And the folks who I think are the most influential at this moment are the CEOs of companies in various districts that have projects that are underway or about to be underway, and the workers in these districts. Whether it’s in Georgia or Arizona or New York or anywhere else, it’s trying to make clear to their members of Congress that there’s a lot on the line here.”

The automotive sector, in particular, has much to lose after investing billions of dollars in a transition to EVs. “The politics change very quickly, and automakers change very slowly,” said Sean Tucker, lead editor for Kelley Blue Book. “It’s really difficult for them to make adjustments when they’re working on a seven- to 10-year design cycle.”

But the automakers’ main lobbying group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, has been silent so far on the budget reconciliation bill, even after speaking out on other big policy changes in recent weeks, voicing support for rollback of California’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations and opposition to Trump’s tariffs.

General Motors, Ford, Stellantis and other big carmakers are members of one of the nation’s biggest business lobbying groups, the National Association of Manufacturers, which praised the House Ways and Means bill as “a vital step forward in securing a competitive tax environment that empowers manufacturers to create jobs, invest, grow and compete.” NAM said Trump’s 2017 tax cut bill, which lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, was “rocket fuel for manufacturers” and the new provisions get the sector closer to an effective 15 percent tax rate.

The advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, heavily financed by the petrochemical monolith Koch Industries, is running advertisements on TV in Washington declaring the decision on the budget reconciliation bill boils down to a “simple” equation.

“Lowering tax bills for hardworking families? Good. Reckless spending on green energy fantasies? Not good,” the ad says. “Eliminating Joe Biden’s Green New Deal helps pay for Trump’s tax cuts.”

The word “helps” is doing heavy lifting in the ad, given that the Joint Committee on Taxation’s calculation is that eliminating the energy tax credits saves about $559 billion, a small fraction of the $4.9 trillion cost of the tax cut package. (The JCT’s estimate is nearly double the original estimated cost of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits, the value of which always depended on how much interest they generated among developers.)

And if the only motivation for repeal of the energy tax credits were to pay for Trump’s tax cuts, it doesn’t explain why the House Ways and Means Republicans took other steps that have no revenue impact, like eliminating a provision in the IRA that allowed for “transferability” of tax credits, which widened the potential pool of investors for clean energy projects.

It will be challenging to make the case for renewable energy in a GOP-led Congress when the oil and gas industry, one of the biggest contributors to political campaigns, favored Republicans with 87 percent of its $75 million in donations in the 2025 election cycle. To combat that advantage, clean energy advocates on Capitol Hill are trying to make the business case for the clean energy incentives instead of focusing on their most profound potential—cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the nation’s economy to buffer Americans from the worst impacts of global warming.

Eliminating Incentives Could Have Stark Emissions Consequences

Repeal of all of the IRA tax credits, when combined with Trump’s planned rollback of regulations like power plant and vehicle emissions standards, would bring progress on cutting U.S. carbon emissions to a near standstill, according to recent modeling by the Rhodium Group.

Rhodium had not immediately calculated the impact of the House Ways and Means draft voted on in committee this week. But an analysis it completed late last year showed that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could be as much as 35 percent higher in 2030 than the current trajectory under a complete elimination of the Biden-era climate policy. By 2035, emissions would be as much as 71 percent higher than the path under current tax incentives and regulations. Emissions would be flat or slightly lowered due to increased efficiency, a continued retreat from coal and some uptake in electric vehicles. But they would be nowhere near the goals set under the Paris climate accord for a 50 percent cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and 61 percent by 2035.

The impact of the tax repeals are sure to be felt in the marketplace, clean energy advocates say. The current version of the budget reconciliation bill “is going to chill investment, particularly in manufacturing and critical minerals processing, advanced nuclear, in a bunch of sort of cutting- edge stuff,” Godfrey said. “And it’s going to do it at a time when we really want to ramp that sort of work up.”

Like Rhodium’s analysts, Tucker, of Kelley Blue Book, sees the repeal of the tax credits as slowing rather than halting the transition to EVs in the United States. But he notes that it is happening at a time when other countries will be moving to EVs more rapidly. “I think in the long run, the industry is shifting toward EVs no matter what politicians do,” Tucker said. “This just slows the American companies down and potentially makes them less competitive.”

House Republicans say without their budget reconciliation bill, taxpayers on average would face a 22 percent tax increase next year once the original Trump tax cuts expire. They calculate their bill will deliver a $1,300 tax cut for the average American family.

But climate action advocates note that there will be new costs associated with repeal of the clean energy policy.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said the bill will significantly raise taxes on the fastest-growing energy sector. “It imposes a sudden policy shift that would raise energy costs, take paychecks away from tens of thousands of American workers, and harm the economies of small towns across the nation,” he said.

Rhodium estimates that household energy bills will be at least 7 to 12 percent higher in 2035 than they would have been under the Biden climate policies, although that doesn’t capture all of the latest research showing upward pressure on prices due to artificial intelligence and data centers.

And then there are the costs of unabated climate change itself, which have always been difficult to calculate. They will be more difficult still to assess in the years ahead, as the Trump administration is ending government tracking of the costs of severe weather events at the same time Congress is retreating from the only steps it has taken to fend off the worst impacts of global warming.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities.
Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country.
California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.
“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Shapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.","As an ice storm slicked roads across eastern Michigan on Feb. 6, representatives from four houses of worship arrived at the offices of Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored.

The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

Energy inequality across America

The inequalities in America’s energy system go beyond the cost of energy. In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see.

Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in the Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study.

“Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods.

“I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.

Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than a million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

Solar helps cool city

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes that were never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar panels on some 3,300 homes, including low—to moderate-income households.

“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Shapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.

“Here at our office, we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

Moukawsher, Matt Robison, Kevin Sabet, Ross Rosenfeld",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/clean-tech-investments-slow-republicans-look-cut-crucial-tax-credits-2072360,"A report released Wednesday by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) shows that clean energy investments totaled $80 billion in 2024 to deploy nearly 49 gigawatts of new clean power infrastructure.
Another report released this week by Rhodium shows that the uncertainty that's been hovering over the clean energy tax credits since the election is already slowing down clean tech growth.
The monitor tracks the clean energy and transportation investment in three categories: the manufacturing, deployment and purchases of clean energy technologies.
Among the three types of clean investments, clean electricity such as solar and battery storage stayed mostly steady, as did clean tech manufacturing.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas fracking company executive, called clean energy tax credits ""a big mistake"" in an appearance last month on the Fox Business channel.","A Republican budget bill that advanced through the powerful Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives this week would sharply cut many of the tax incentives for clean energy that have triggered hundreds of billions of dollars of investments—much of it in Republican districts.

Republican House leaders opted to end many clean energy tax credits despite months of pleas from hundreds of business leaders and letters from more than two dozen Congressional Republicans asking that the credits be preserved.

The tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act support renewable energy installations, battery making, electric vehicles (EVs) and clean manufacturing. The bulk of the resulting investments landed in places represented by Republicans, including major new EV and battery facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, and solar manufacturing in Georgia and Texas.

The House bill is a major setback for clean tech business leaders who had hoped that the flow of investment dollars to red states would win more Republican support.

As Congress debated a budget proposal seeking deep spending cuts, clean energy advocates had hoped Republicans would follow House Speaker Mike Johnson's early advice to use ""a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer"" when paring back tax credits. But the bill that emerged this week brought down the hammer.

""Businesses need a stable policy environment and economic certainty in order to restore U.S. manufacturing and invest in cost-effective electricity generation,"" Zach Friedman, senior director of federal policy for the nonprofit climate group Ceres, said in a statement Monday. ""Unfortunately, the legislation under discussion does just the opposite, injecting uncertainty and confusion at a pivotal economic moment.""

Trade groups representing clean energy businesses also reacted with alarm to the bill's proposed cuts.

""At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,"" Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. ""Our nation's energy security and national security are on the line.""

Hopper's group and other renewable energy leaders have argued that the U.S. will need all forms of energy to meet surging demand for power driven by AI, data centers and the electrification of transportation, home heating and manufacturing.

More than 80 percent of new electricity generation capacity added to the U.S. grid last year was in the form of renewable energy and large-scale battery storage, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. A report released Wednesday by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) shows that clean energy investments totaled $80 billion in 2024 to deploy nearly 49 gigawatts of new clean power infrastructure.

""The Ways and Means bill is at odds with American energy dominance,"" ACP CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement that adopted language President Donald Trump used in his executive orders on energy. ""If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs.""

The independent research provider Rhodium Group released a preliminary analysis of the bill's impact on Tuesday showing the stark effects on energy costs and emissions.

""This will raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7 percent in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk,"" Rhodium's analysis concluded.

Rhodium estimated that the elimination of credits would reduce the amount of new clean capacity installed on the grid over the coming decade by anywhere from 57 to 72 percent and reduce EV sales between 16 and 38 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions could rise by 500 to 730 million metric tons by 2035.

Another report released this week by Rhodium shows that the uncertainty that's been hovering over the clean energy tax credits since the election is already slowing down clean tech growth.

Each quarter, Rhodium produces the Clean Investment Monitor in partnership with MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The monitor tracks the clean energy and transportation investment in three categories: the manufacturing, deployment and purchases of clean energy technologies.

The latest report released Tuesday showed investment across those three categories has declined for two consecutive quarters, covering the period from just before the November election.

Clean energy and transportation investment in the first three months of this year totaled $67.3 billion. That's about 7 percent higher than the same period in 2024, but it's about a 4 percent decrease from the previous quarter.

""It's kind of a mixed bag,"" Hannah Hess, an associate director for Rhodium Group's energy and climate practice, told Newsweek. ""Overall, it's a trend where these clean investments are growing over time, but that momentum seems to have slowed.""

Among the three types of clean investments, clean electricity such as solar and battery storage stayed mostly steady, as did clean tech manufacturing. But investments in industrial decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and sustainable aviation fuels plummeted from $7.8 billion in the last quarter of 2024 to just $79 million in the first quarter of this year.

""There is a huge plunge, like a really staggering decline,"" Hess said. ""Companies are reading the uncertainty on Capitol Hill around tax credits and the posture of the new administration towards these types of clean energy technologies and, as a result, not planning new projects as aggressively as they had been.""

The Trump administration is deeply critical of what President Trump calls the ""green new scam."" Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas fracking company executive, called clean energy tax credits ""a big mistake"" in an appearance last month on the Fox Business channel.

Fossil fuel interests donated heavily to the Trump election campaign and conservative political groups in the 2024 election, according to data compiled by the nonprofit campaign finance research group OpenSecrets. New data out this week from the group shows the oil, gas and other fossil fuel industries are heavily outspending the renewable energy sector in lobbying dollars on Capitol Hill.

In the first quarter of 2025, OpenSecrets reported, the mining and oil and gas industries together spent a little more than $46 million lobbying Congress while the renewable energy sector spent about $18 million.

However, the fight over tax credits isn't over yet. Clean energy advocates now pin their hopes on modifying the bill as it makes its way through the full House and on to the Senate. Four high-ranking Republican Senators sent a letter last month to Majority Leader John Thune in support of the tax credits.

""We write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development,"" Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah wrote. ""We caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2644668/blue-oval-kentucky-battery-plant.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 23:01:41.129434

Under the calls, the Commission will allocate up to €3.4 billion in funding from the revenues of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to facilitate the deployment of pioneering clean technologies.

Both launching on 3 December 2024, the Net-zero technologies call concluded with 359 applications. These projects collectively sought €21.7 billion in support, highlighting a demand that surpasses the available budget of €2.4 billion by more than nine times.

The call for electric vehicle battery manufacturing received 14 proposals, requesting €1.6 billion in EU funding, also exceeding the €1 billion budget. These figures underscore European industries’ commitment to accelerate clean technology deployment, decarbonise and strengthen industrial leadership in strategic sectors.

Net-zero Technologies call

The Net-zero Technologies call (IF24 Call) builds on the success of the 2023 edition. The 359 project proposals are located in 28 European Economic Area (EEA) countries and collectively would avoid emitting an equivalent of 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere over their first 10 years of operation.

In compliance with the Clean Industrial Deal, Wind Package, Industrial Carbon Management Strategy and the Net-Zero Industry Act, this call supports a stronger business case for European industry and climate neutral investments in decarbonisation and clean tech.

The IF24 Call featured five topics under which projects could submit proposals:

Large-scale projects received around 39% of the total proposals;

Medium-scale projects received circa 15% of the proposals;

Small-scale projects received close to 13% of the proposals;

Cleantech manufacturing received approximately 14% of the proposals;

Pilots topic received nearly 19% of the proposals

Key decarbonisation areas covered by the call relates to the following categories: Energy-intensive Industries which attracted 169 proposals, Industrial Carbon Management with 24 proposals, Renewable Energy with 67 proposals, and Energy Storage received 43 proposals. Introduced last year, the Mobility, including Maritime, Aviation and Road Transport categories received 50 proposals, and Buildings received 6 proposals. Notably, proposals for sectors such as chemicals, cement and lime, refineries, and hydrogen were high.

Electric Vehicle Battery Cell Manufacturing call

For the first time, a dedicated call was launched to support the manufacturing of electric vehicle battery cells in Europe (IF24 Battery). This highly specialised call is a response to the initiative to support the EU battery manufacturing industry by allocating up to 3 billion in EU funding via the Innovation Fund. The objective is to incentivise investment, boost demand and make the European battery manufacturing industry more competitive and resilient by reducing the risk of dependency on foreign suppliers for this strategic technology.

The IF24 Battery call received a total of 14 proposals. Considering the specialised and narrow scope of this call, this very good response showcases the readiness of industry to produce electric vehicle battery cells in Europe. The submitted project proposals are located in eight EU countries, with the highest number of proposals coming from Germany, followed by France, Bulgaria, and Poland.

This call aims to address supply chain vulnerabilities and boost competitiveness within the green mobility and electricity storage sectors. In terms of battery technology, proposals cover Lithium-ion nickel magnesium and cobalt technologies (Li-Ion-NMC), Solid State and Lithium-Ion-Iron Phosphate (Li-ion-Iron). Altogether, the proposals aim to avoid an equivalent of 138 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over a 10-year operational period.

Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate Action said

I am very happy to see industry responding strongly to the Innovation Fund call for proposals year after year. This demonstrates our collective dedication to meeting our climate neutrality objectives. Thanks to the EU Emissions Trading System, we can ensure that carbon costs paid by industry are transformed into tangible investments in our decarbonised future. It is so encouraging to see such a diverse range of innovative projects spanning over many sectors, driving competitiveness and propelling our continent towards a cleaner future.

Next Steps:

Now that the calls are closed, the evaluation process is underway. Following the eligibility and admissibility checks, the proposals will be evaluated by external experts against the call award criteria, which includes degree of innovation, greenhouse gas emission avoidance potential, manufacturing carbon footprint, project maturity, replicability and cost efficiency. The results are expected to be communicated in the second half of 2025, with grant agreements prepared and signed thereafter.

All projects that meet the evaluation criteria will receive a STEP Seal awarded the Commission, regardless of whether they are selected for funding. STEP Seal projects are promoted by the Commission to possibly attract funding from other public or private sources. Projects will be notified automatically if they have been awarded a STEP Seal following the evaluation process. There is no separate application required to obtain the STEP Seal. The list and map of current STEP Seal projects can be found here.

In addition, the Commission is encouraging Member States to consider using ‘Grants-as-a-Service', which allows them to support projects located in their territory based on the Innovation Fund's evaluation and with streamlined State aid approval. The objective is to maximise support for excellent and innovative projects across the EU to foster the clean transition.

In partnership with the European Commission, the European Investment Bank will provide Project Development Assistance (PDA) to support both promising projects that were not selected for grant funding under the Innovation Fund calls or new projects aspiring to apply. Selected projects will receive tailored technical and financial advisory support to improve their maturity and increase their chances of success in future Innovation Fund calls.

Background:

Using revenues from the auctioning of emission allowances from the EU ETS, the Innovation Fund seeks to drive investment in cutting-edge, low-carbon and net-zero technologies, supporting Europe’s transition to climate neutrality.

With a total budget of around €12 billion already committed since 2021, the Innovation Fund supports over 200 innovative projects across the European Economic Area (EEA).

The cells will have a lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which GM says is lower cost than the nickel-rich cells used today, but will still give customers the range they want in future electric trucks and full-size SUVs.

The cells will also be prismatic versus the current pouch structure, reducing the number of parts in the battery pack by more than 50 per cent, according to GM.

The Detroit automaker, which now has 12 electric vehicles in its lineup, is trying to lower its battery costs to enable cost parity with its gas-powered products by adding new types of cells and chemistries in those cells.

""We're adopting flexible chemistries for the best balance of range, performance and affordability,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM's vice-president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media briefing on the announcement.

""My mission here is to get as many EVs on the road as possible. We need to get price parity with (internal combustion engine vehicles) and then this thing's just going to take off.""

LG Energy Solution is a South Korean-based battery company that's also partnering with Stellantis at the massive NextStar Energy EV battery factory in Windsor, Ont. Some production is already underway with workers assembling batteries into groups known as modules last year. It's expected to eventually employ 2,500 people.

Despite word on Tuesday that Honda was postponing plans for its Ontario EV plant by at least two years, the NextStar plant still remains on track. However, a firm full production opening date has yet to be set.

The LMR cells for the GM facility will be made at one of the two LG-GM joint-venture Ultium Cells battery plants the companies have in Ohio and Tennessee.

LMR Technology

GM and LG are developing lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic batteries designed to pack more energy into the same space—potentially leading to longer driving ranges of over 400 miles.

The batteries are also expected to be more affordable since they use fewer rare materials like nickel, manganese, and cobalt—which is particularly expensive. This will make them more sustainable and cost-effective over time.

""We're not holding off investment,"" Paul Thomas, president of Bosch in North America and of Bosch Mobility America, said during a virtual briefing.
Bosch has more than 15 U.S. manufacturing sites employing about 20,000 people.
Bosch plans to launch production of second-generation silicon carbide microchips next year at a Roseville, California, facility it acquired in 2023.
Globally, Bosch sales revenues fell 1.4% to $101.4 billion (90.3 billion euro) last year, though after adjusting for exchange rates, the decline was 0.5% less.","North America had the largest sales increase globally for Robert Bosch GmbH in 2024, growing 5% year-over-year, the German auto supplier said Wednesday.

The privately owned manufacturer posted in North America consolidated sales of $17.3 billion (16 billion euros) and net sales of $18.6 billion, which included sales of non-consolidated companies and internal deliveries to affiliated companies. The growth moves toward Bosch's goal of having the region represent 20% of global sales by 2030 — just as President Donald Trump has increased tariffs on imported vehicles and certain auto parts.

""We're not holding off investment,"" Paul Thomas, president of Bosch in North America and of Bosch Mobility America, said during a virtual briefing. ""We're looking for some stability.""

That growth comes as Bosch and its competitors face 25% U.S. tariffs on more than 100 categories of imported auto parts, from engines and steering wheels to hinges and more. Thomas said Bosch tries to meet U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement requirements to avoid the tariff on its products and is working with customers to find the place that makes the most sense for manufacturing of its parts.

“Global trade under fair competitive conditions is very important to us and for us here in the region,"" Thomas said. ""As we invest to grow, we recognize the need for favorable trade opportunities and, more importantly, a stable trade environment to help achieve our goals. Across our portfolio, we prioritize local manufacturing to support local customers. So focus on strengthening domestic manufacturing is a good thing.""

Bosch, which marks 120 years in the United States next year, highlighted $2 billion in capital expenditures over the past five years in the United States, more than 75% of its investments in the region. Since 2023, it's also announced plans to invest roughly $6 billion in U.S.-based acquisitions.

""It's good to see that this has created a little bit of a discussion to bring manufacturing here into the U.S.,"" Thomas said, ""but it's something that we've been talking about already for the last multiple years.""

Meanwhile, Bosch has been laying off thousands of workers in Europe, especially in its native Germany, to counter slumping demand as underperforming electric vehicle sales, increased competition particularly from China, and economic pressures rattle the auto sector there.

Bosch has more than 15 U.S. manufacturing sites employing about 20,000 people. It's also expected to close this year its $8.1 billion acquisition of Johnson Controls International plc's residential and light commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning business that includes brands like Coleman and York. Bosch plans to launch production of second-generation silicon carbide microchips next year at a Roseville, California, facility it acquired in 2023.

The supplier also has a new venture capital fund called Bosch Ventures, which will have $270 million to support innovation in electromobility, hydrogen, software-defined vehicles, factory automation and other areas.

In 2024 in North America, Bosch's mobility business increased sales to third parties to $10.7 billion, consumer goods increased to $3.4 billion, energy and building technology rose to $1.9 billion, and the industrial technology sector fell to $1.3 billion.

Globally, Bosch sales revenues fell 1.4% to $101.4 billion (90.3 billion euro) last year, though after adjusting for exchange rates, the decline was 0.5% less. Operating earnings margin was 3.5%, and the group is targeting 7% for 2026. Bosch is aiming for between 6% and 8% annual growth until 2030. In the first quarter of 2025, sales revenue rose by 4%, but it's going to be a challenging year, especially given the tariff situation, the company said.

Bosch also says it continues its commitment to multiple kinds of powertrains, including gas- and diesel-powered, hybrid, all-electric and hydrogen fuel cell, as the road to increasing electric vehicle adoption has been bumpier than expected because of affordability issues, range anxiety, limited access to charging stations, and other factors. It also continues development of advanced driver-assistance systems and sensors.

""We want to provide manufacturers, and ultimately the U.S. consumer,"" Thomas said, ""with affordable options in the market, while continuing our enduring goal of increasing efficiency and reducing emissions.""

PFAS (per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) are a class of human-made chemicals that are toxic even in very low concentrations. Because they are stain and oil resistant and repel water, PFAS have been widely used since the 1950s in many common consumer products, including carpets, clothing, cookware, cosmetics, and food packaging. These “forever chemicals” are highly persistent and mobile in the environment, which means they bioaccumulate and travel unchanged through streams, rivers, and other water bodies, including drinking water sources. PFAS are linked to serious health problems including damage to liver, thyroid, and pancreatic function, immune system harm, hormone disruption, high cholesterol, and cancer.

EPA announced that it will extend the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS from 2029 to 2031. The agency will also rescind and reconsider the Hazardous Index-based regulatory approach currently in place for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (GenX), and PFBS.

EPA also announced its intention to address PFAS chemicals holistically and to hold polluters accountable through a suite of actions announced by Administrator Lee Zeldin in April. ""Weakening health protections in drinking water does not hold polluters accountable and is not a holistic approach. EPA should leave Safe Drinking Water Act limits in place and act with unprecedented speed using all its authority to keep PFAS chemicals out of our water and the environment and to eliminate their use wherever possible,” said Clean Water Action’s National Campaigns Director, Lynn Thorp.

Clean Water Action’s state offices are working to reduce PFAS use in California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Clean Water Action in Minnesota helped deliver a win in May 2023, when Governor Tim Walz signed the strongest PFAS reduction provisions in the country. This bill, known as Amara’s Law, bans some products containing PFAS in 2025 and all non-essential uses of PFAS chemicals by 2032. It also requires manufacturers selling products in Minnesota to disclose if PFAS chemicals are present. At the federal level, the organization will continue to push for aggressive federal action to keep PFAS chemicals out of the environment and curb their use.

Looks like: The C-HR was never discontinued (and elsewhere in the world, it wasn’t)

Powertrain: 338-horsepower dual electric motors; 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery; all-wheel drive

Release date: Sometime in 2026

Toyota’s subcompact C-HR SUV disappeared from the U.S. market after the 2022 model year, but the model is picking up right where it left off for 2026 — at least stylistically. The proportions and attitude-drenched body work make the little Toyota immediately recognizable, but everything under the skin is a revolution.

Related: No More 4 (or X): 2026 Toyota bZ Gets Over 50% More Power, Up to 314 Miles of Range

The 2026 C-HR is more than 5 inches longer, nearly 3 inches wider and over 2 inches taller than its predecessor. Its wheelbase has grown nearly 4.5 inches, too, which will likely mean a windfall for backseat passengers. Despite the fashionably angled roofline, the new vehicle also boasts up to 25.4 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, according to Toyota’s measurements.

Powertrain Specs and Range

Whereas the old C-HR was powered by a wheezy four-banger with just 144 horsepower, the new 2026 model is only available as an electric vehicle in a single configuration. Front and rear electric motors provide all-wheel drive and endow the tidy SUV with a total of 338 hp. That’s the same output as the recently announced 2026 Toyota bZ (nee bZ4X) in its AWD form, but in the C-HR, there is no option for front-wheel drive. The automaker says the littler EV will accelerate from 0-60 mph in about five seconds — less than half the time its sluggish forebear needed — but that seems extremely conservative. The claim for the larger and likely heavier bZ with this same powertrain is 4.9 seconds.

There’s also no smaller battery available in the new C-HR. It is fitted exclusively with the bZ’s larger optional pack, which can store 74.7 kilowatt-hours of juice. Toyota claims it will have a range of “up to 290 miles,” or 2 miles farther than the AWD bZ. Like its larger sibling, the C-HR will have a North American Charging Standard port, allowing it to refresh its battery at Tesla’s vast nationwide DC fast-charging network. On an appropriate DC plug, Toyota says the C-HR will be able to replenish its battery from 10% to 80% in about 30 minutes. Again, like in the bZ, steering-wheel-mounted paddles to adjust regenerative braking through four levels of aggressiveness will be standard, as will battery preconditioning that adjusts the battery to the proper temperature before arriving at a DC fast charger to ensure the quickest possible stop.

What Are the 2026 C-HR’s Trim Levels?

If the 338-hp AWD C-HR is sounding a bit like a performance model, it seems even more likely to be positioned that way based on the trim levels that Toyota will offer. The 2026 C-HR will only be available in SE and XSE specs, which the brand typically reserves for its sportier models.

The SE will ride on 18-inch wheels and feature a power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. Its seats will be upholstered in cloth with synthetic leather trim, and a 14-inch touchscreen with integrated climate control knobs, two wireless charging pads and six speakers will also be standard.

Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 will be standard on every 2026 C-HR. The suite of advanced safety tech includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams. Blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking are also standard.

The XSE will upgrade to 20-inch wheels and feature memory settings for the driver’s seat and fake leather seating surfaces with synthetic suede trim. It will be available in a number of two-tone exterior color schemes, all of which will feature a black roof. The XSE also features traffic-jam assist, lane-change assist and a 360-degree parking camera. A nine-speaker JBL sound system and a panoramic moonroof will be available.

What Is the 2026 C-HR’s Release Date and Pricing?

The 2026 Toyota C-HR will arrive at dealerships sometime in 2026. Toyota isn’t talking pricing just yet, but the AWD 2025 bZ4X currently starts around $41,000. Considering that the C-HR will have the equivalent 2026 model’s powertrain and much of the same cabin and safety tech, it’s hard to imagine the smaller EV starting any lower than the mid-$30,000s.

The committee voted along party lines to advance its portion of the budget framework on Wednesday afternoon, which includes measures seeking to secure Trump’s campaign promises to make the country energy dominant. Most of the proposals sought to rescind funds from going toward programs passed under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and invest some of that money instead in oil and gas drilling.

“The 2024 election sent a clear signal that Americans are tired of an extreme left-wing agenda that favors wokeness over sensible policy and spurs price increases,” Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., wrote in an op-ed on Monday. “This bill would claw back money headed for green boondoggles through ‘environmental and climate justice block grants’ and other spending mechanisms through the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department.”

The Energy and Commerce Committee has a wide jurisdiction over domestic policy, particularly relating to energy and public health. The energy and environment section of the budget framework encompassed much of the proposal passed on Wednesday, which will dictate much of how the Energy Department and Environmental Protection Agency operates.

The committee was tasked with finding at least $880 billion in spending cuts to help pay for the $4.5 trillion in tax cut extensions that Republicans hope to approve before the end of the year. With the repeal of IRA subsidies, the committee would secure $6.5 billion in savings, according to Guthrie.

Cuts to clean energy tax credits

The framework would claw back funds from key green energy programs such as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion investment that incentivizes the use of clean energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.

The framework seeks to repeal portions of the Clean Air Act, which authorizes the EPA to establish national air quality standards and develop programs for states to maintain those levels.

Notably, the bill would aim to phase out several renewable energy tax credits over the next six years — a proposal that could be a sticking point for both clean energy friendly Republicans as well as conservatives who want the IRA to be repealed in full immediately upon passage.

A handful of Republicans have warned against repealing those green energy credits in full, warning it could cause a spike in utility costs nationwide. The proposed repeals would specifically target wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass energy sources.

Included in those clawbacks is a measure to rescind electric vehicle tax credits, particularly credits tucked into the IRA that offered rewards to those who bought electric vehicles. The House Ways and Means Committee is also set to consider tax credit repeals of electric vehicles to accompany that proposal.

The clean energy rollbacks are part of Trump’s larger reconciliation package that encompasses policies on energy, border and national defense, among other things. After the Energy and Commerce Committee portion advances the committee, it will then be compiled with other House committees to craft the final package.

GOP leaders hope to get the package finalized and passed through the House by the end of next week — an ambitious timeline as there are still some remaining disagreements Republicans must iron out.

Once the reconciliation package is through the House, it will then move to the Senate for consideration — where some Republicans are already wary about the green energy credits being repealed.

Cuts to Medicaid

Also tucked into the budget portion passed on Wednesday were substantial cuts to Medicaid and other healthcare programs.

One of the most significant changes proposed in the framework is to implement new work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries. The bill would require able-bodied adults without dependents to work at least 80 hours a month or complete some other activity such as community service.

The proposal to increase work requirements carves out some exceptions, such as for pregnant women, and would only apply to those who are between 19 and 64 years old. Individual states would be responsible for enforcing work hours.

If the proposed cuts are signed into law, preliminary estimates predict at least 8.6 million people would lose Medicaid coverage over the next decade, with savings reaching at least $715 billion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The legislation would also include new restrictions on how Medicaid funds can be used, including bans on gender transition procedures for children under 18 as well as prohibitions on coverage “for individuals whose citizenship, nationality, or immigration status has not been verified.”",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/R2QEUKJN6AGRKLG23JAU5NDQ6Y.jpg?focal=0%2C0&auth=f147374d99767fd2b033bb5300e535027558ff9bc0ac8aa9f38ca8c5d362c7df&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-05-14 23:01:55.271630

Well, the joke would've been on them, as the Kia EV6 GT has established itself as a genuinely great driver. It even won the sub-$100,000 category of our 2024 Performance EV of the Year test. And now, according to a new report, Kia is offering customers an incredible lease deal on leftover model year 2024 machines, with up to $20,000 in savings.

The EV6 GT is based on the same E-GMP platform as the Hyundai Ioniq 5, and features a dual-motor powertrain delivering 576 hp and 545 lb-ft. That sort of power lets the all-wheel drive Kia rip through the 0-60 mph sprint in just 3.2 seconds. It’s not just a straight-line monster either, thanks to its electronic limited-slip differential, reworked chassis, adaptive suspension, and improved brakes. All of that extra performance hardware does come at a cost, however, with the GT starting nearly $20,000 higher than the entry-level models.

But a recent dealer initiative from Kia might help with that. According to CarsDirect, the automaker is offering a $20,000 lease cash rebate on existing 2024 EV6 GTs. The deal is specifically tied to a 24-month lease, with a slightly smaller $18,500 rebate attached to 36-month terms. There is currently no rebate for customers looking to finance the purchase of an EV6 GT, making the lease deals all the more appealing.

Kia reworked the EV6 GT for the 2025 model year, which may play a part in the discounts. The updated machines arrive with 601 hp, updated lighting, a new front bumper, and a suite of interior improvements. And while the automaker isn’t letting those machines go at a $20,000 discount, there is still a $12,500 lease cash rebate for 24-month leases, which drops slightly to $10,000 if you opt for a 36-month term.

As with any incentive program, you will need to contact your local Kia dealer for details, and the actual cash value might look different depending on your specific region. That said, the offers are set to run through June 2, which means you have a little bit of time to find the right EV6 GT.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/front3-4-img-5883-675767775c34b.jpg?crop=0.655xw:0.442xh;0.147xw,0.327xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-14 21:04:40.319360

OTTAWA--Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne remains confident in the government's growth strategy of luring electric-vehicle production through tens of billions in incentives despite a setback delivered this week by Honda Motor.

""The North Star is towards electrification,"" Champagne told reporters Wednesday when asked about concerns over Honda's decision this week to postpone by about two years an estimated $11 billion EV manufacturing project northwest of Toronto. Honda cited weaker-than-expected EV sales for its decision, and that the company would divulge more about its EV strategy next week.

Champagne said Honda remains committed to the project, which envisages production of about 240,000 EVs annually, and 36 gigagwatt hours of EV batteries.

""What you're seeing now is not unique to Canada,"" he said, adding that EV production capacity outstrips demand at this stage. The cost of EV batteries would need to decline further before demand for electric cars picks up, he said.

Late Wednesday, Industry Minister Melanie Joly said she spoke with Honda Canada President Dave Jamieson and he assured officials there would be no job losses at the automaker's Canadian unit. Besides delaying the EV project, Honda also said it was shifting some production of its CRV and CR-V hybrid models at its Alliston, Ontario, plant to a factory in East Liberty, Ohio.

Joly, in a statement posted on the social-media platform X, added Jamieson ""confirmed that Honda is still fully committed to major EV investments right here in Canada.""

Canadian officials have boasted that the country has the critical minerals needed to build EV and EV batteries at scale.

Sales of zero-emission new vehicles in Canada plunged 46% in March from a year ago, following a 41% decline in the previous month, according to data from Statistics Canada. In the first quarter, sales fell 27%.

Erik Johnson, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, attributed the sizable drops to decisions by the federal and some regional governments to either scale back or pause their EV rebate program.

EV sales rose in the U.S. in March, Johnson said, but the tide is likely to turn as tariffs are expected to push prices upward. He added that a budget proposal from Republicans in the House of Representatives would, if passed, phase out most EV tax credits as soon as the end of this year.

Research from Canada's parliamentary budget watchdog indicates that manufacturers, between 2020 and 2024, unveiled plans to invest roughly $33 billion in EV and related supply-chain production. The Canadian government pledged $22 billion in financing and tax breaks to lure those companies.

Honda isn't the first setback for Canadian officials in their push to attract EV investment.

Quebec-based Lion Electric, a maker of electric trucks and buses, has filed for bankruptcy protection roughly four years after obtaining government support for a battery-pack assembly plant. Swedish battery maker Northvolt has also filed for bankruptcy, and its planned factory in Quebec is facing a sizable delay.

In 2024, 38 House Republicans signed letters urging Republican leadership to preserve IRA tax credits that have spurred development in their districts.
Cramer's own public proposal would merely phase out wind and solar tax credits, older technologies he believes no longer need subsidies to come online.
""There has been job creation around these tax credits.""","The US House Ways and Means Committee advanced a Republican tax package that would raise an estimated $515 billion in revenue for a broader budget reconciliation bill by accelerating the phaseout of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy and electric vehicle tax credits.

The tax-writing panel passed the draft bill along party lines early May 14 following a marathon committee markup where members debated an amendment that would have entirely struck the measure's energy-related section.

""This bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, locking in lower tax rates for workers, small businesses and farmers,"" said Representative Jason Smith, Republican-Missouri and the committee's chair. ""These provisions offer the certainty and support small businesses and manufacturers need to invest in America and bring back the economic prosperity of President Trump's first term.""

Representative Don Beyer, Democrat-Virginia, called the energy-related amendment to the tax package, offered by fellow Democrat Mike Thompson of California, ""perhaps the most important amendment of the markup.""

""The energy provisions of this bill are catastrophic,"" Beyer said. ""You can't reasonably look at the changes made to these tax credits and think they support energy markets in the US.""

Democrats decry early credit phaseouts

The Ways and Means proposal would phase down technology-neutral 45Y production and investment tax credits, as well as a nuclear production credit, from 2029 through 2032.

Under Democrats' 2022 energy climate law, the 45Y production credit and 48E investment credit are subject to a four-year phasedown period that starts in 2032 or when the US power sector's emissions fall to 25% below 2022 levels – whichever comes later. The full value of the 45U nuclear credit is also available until 2033.

Notably, the Ways and Means proposal would narrow eligibility for the 45Y and 48E credits by tying the phasedowns to when a project is placed in service, as opposed to the IRA's commencement-of-construction standard.

One of the few surviving credits in the reconciliation package, the clean fuel production credit (45Z), was also subject to new two-year transferability rules, but was otherwise extended and made slightly easier for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels producers to qualify for. It would also require feedstocks to originate from the US, Mexico and Canada, preventing the use of used Chinese cooking oil in blending.

The Republican package would repeal transferability for a range of clean energy credits – including the 45Y, 48E, and 45U credits – after two years, thereby preventing them from being sold or transferred to third parties. The bill would also add new restrictions for projects receiving ""material assistance"" from foreign entities of concern.

""Between the [foreign entity of concern] provisions being unworkable and functionally killing credits, creating placed-in-service deadlines – which means no project underway can guarantee it will be done in time – and eliminating transferability, you've killed financing in the energy market,"" Beyer said during the markup. ""That's the opposite of an all-of-the-above or an energy dominance agenda.""

Representative Rudy Yakym, Republican-Indiana, however, contended that loopholes in the IRA allowed foreign actors such as the Chinese government to take advantage of the law's tax credits for electric vehicles and battery storage.

""We shouldn't allow that,"" he said.

Thompson responded by arguing that ""by not passing this amendment, you're doing exactly what you've warned against. We are acquiescing to the Chinese.

In addition to the early phaseouts for clean energy credits, the Ways and Means bill would largely end the IRA's $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles after 2025, along with credits for used EVs and clean commercial vehicles.

Thompson's amendment ultimately failed on a 19-25 vote.

Senate expected to soften approach

The Ways and Means bill's advance to the House floor hardly guarantees the committee's framework will survive.

In 2024, 38 House Republicans signed letters urging Republican leadership to preserve IRA tax credits that have spurred development in their districts. None of those members sit on the Ways and Means committee, however, and their objections to phase-outs could require revisions before full passage on the House floor.

Even if those objections could be overcome, several key Republican Senators have said the credits will likely receive different treatment in the Senate Republicans' own reconciliation proposals.

On May 13, Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican-North Dakota, an influential Senate energy policy voice, expressed public disagreement with the Ways and Means committee's aggressive phaseouts of clean electricity and nuclear credits, telling Politico that Republicans should favor incentives for advanced nuclear reactors and geothermal projects in earlier stages of market development.

""They definitely need more time than that,"" Cramer said. ""It's too short for truly new technologies. We'll have to change that. I don't think it's fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.""

Cramer's own public proposal would merely phase out wind and solar tax credits, older technologies he believes no longer need subsidies to come online.

Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican-West Virginia, also said the Senate would likely take a more targeted approach.

Barcelona-based Cupra has already had talks with the Penske Automotive Group, the United States’ third largest dealer group with about 200 outlets.
“Cupra aims to inspire the United States from its hometown of Barcelona, bringing its design led and performance driven cars to American roads,” the company said in a statement to the Free Press.

Cupra plans to build the vehicles at VW group facilities in North America.","Cupra plans US sales 'before the end of the decade.'

The brand has sold more than 800,000 vehicles since VW created it.

A little known Spanish car brand focused on electric vehicles is preparing to sell its vehicles in the United States — turmoil regarding tariffs, trade and environmental policy notwithstanding.

Barcelona-based Cupra has already had talks with the Penske Automotive Group, the United States’ third largest dealer group with about 200 outlets. Penske also operates dealerships for dozens of brands ― including Cupra ― in Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

“Cupra aims to inspire the United States from its hometown of Barcelona, bringing its design led and performance driven cars to American roads,” the company said in a statement to the Free Press.

Easier said than done, but Cupra has made an impression in the crowded European market since Volkswagen’s Seat brand launched it in 2018. Seat, known largely for practical, affordable cars, created Cupra as a sporty sub brand. The result impressed VW brass in Germany so much that there’s talk Seat may wither away, replaced by the more stylish, profitable and technically advanced Cupra.

Hybrids and EVs with a Latin flair

Cupra sells a mix of electric, hybrid and gasoline vehicles in more than 40 countries, including Mexico, where prices start at just under $37,000 for a gasoline-powered Leon compact SUV. The brand hopes an emphasis on performance ― Cupra originated as the name of Seat's racing team ― and style rooted in Barcelona's history as a center of art, architecture and design will set it apart.

“Cupra has a respectable following, but the challenges of the U.S. market are very difficult to overcome,” said S&P Global principal automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley. The United States' huge size and population make it expensive to establish a new brand, both geographically and in shoppers' minds.

Cupra has sold more than 800,000 vehicles so far.

The company’s U.S. focus will be on sporty, upscale EVs and hybrids, but Cupra may also offer some internal combustion models to generate sales and service volume.

“As the first new brand created within the Volkswagen Group, we offer an alternative to the next generation of U.S. car buyers,” the statement continued. “Positioned between the mass and premium segments, we are not based on legacy or tradition. We are an unconventional challenger brand.”

The brand plans to begin with sales in 20 states “strategically aligned with the Cupra brand.”

That presumably means states that encourage EV sales with incentives and emissions limits.

“Cupra is totally unknown to the U.S. population,” said Adam Bernard, principal of consultant AutoPerspectives. “It’s a blank slate. The brand doesn’t overlap with VW or Audi. Does VW want to spend a pile of money to establish an image for it?”

Cupra executives toured the Los Angeles auto show last November to size up the competition. After initial expectations sales would begin in 2027, the official target is now by the end of the decade.

The model line will include gasoline power, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles and extended range EVs with onboard gasoline-powered generators.

Cupra plans to build the vehicles at VW group facilities in North America. Current options for that include assembly plants in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Puebla, Mexico, and the Scout Motors plant under construction in South Carolina.

Constantly changing U.S. tariff policy will be considered, but won’t stop the brand.

“Cupra is monitoring developments closely and will comprehensively address the potential impact on supply chains and our production network,” the statement said.

Who will sell them?

VW infuriated many of its American dealers with plans to sell rugged Scout SUVs and pickups directly to consumers.

There’s no word on Cupra’s sales plan yet, but the overture to Penske is “obviously an attempt to shortcut” building a sales network, according to Brian Gordon, president of Dave Cantin Group, which advises dealerships. “A partnership with a large dealer network would be a strategic beachhead.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/07/PDTF/83503520007-cupra-tavascan-ev.jpg?crop=4999,2812,x0,y260&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-14 21:04:54.559527

While enough power is expected this summer, Ohio could face energy shortfalls by 2027 if the PJM grid isn't upgraded.

Increased demand from data centers is contributing to the potential strain on Ohio's power grid.

Although unlikely, some ""extreme scenarios"" and weather this summer could result in insufficient energy to power Ohio and Northern Kentucky, an electric grid operator is warning.

PJM Interconnection, which operates electrical transmission for Ohio and 12 other states, is forecasting summer energy use to peak at just over 154,000 megawatts. PJM should be able to able to supply enough power, according to the organization. PJM has around 179,200 megawatts of capacity this summer and around 7,900 megawatts contracted.

But, unexpected drastic circumstances could put power supply at risk, according to PJM. And the National Weather Service is predicting a hotter-than-normal summer.

In an extreme scenario, peak power load could reach more than 166,000 megawatts, which would set a record for the organization, according to PJM. Under such a scenario, PJM would rely on contracted programs to meet its needs.

“This outlook at a record peak heat scenario reflects our years-long and mounting concerns as we plan for enough resources to maintain grid reliability,” Aftab Khan, PJM executive vice president of operations, planning and security said in a press release. “All resources within PJM’s footprint should be prepared to respond when called upon.”

PJM’s record summer peak was set at 165,563 MW in 2006. In 2024, PJM’s summer peak was about 152,700 megawatts, and in 2023 it was 147,000 megawatts, according to the organization. One megawatt can power about 800 homes, according to PJM.

Although there may be enough power to go around this summer, Ohio could face an energy shortfall within two years if something isn't done to bolster the PJM electrical grid, according to a study released in February by the Ohio Business Roundtable.

If something isn't done by 2027, blackouts during severe weather could become more common, energy costs may increase and businesses considering a home in Ohio may look elsewhere, Pat Tiberi, chief executive officer of the Ohio Business Roundtable has said.

Data centers have been driving a lot of the increased demand for power in Ohio. Ohio's surge in data centers means the state could eat up so much electricity that demand for power in the Columbus region will be similar to all of Manhattan by 2030, according to American Electric Power.

With 179 data centers, Ohio has the fifth most of any state in the nation, according to Data Center Map, which tracks them. The majority of Ohio's planned or operational data centers are owned by Amazon Web Services.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/05/NCOD/81632733007-intel-plant-dciii-01.jpg?crop=4645,2612,x77,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-15 02:01:42.734126

The “Toyotathon” sales extravaganza usually happens at the end of the year, but the month of May is starting to represent another kind of product blitz for the world’s largest automaker.

Since May 1, Toyota has announced five new or refreshed products for the 2026 model year, and more might be coming in the run up to next week’s media deep dive for both the Lexus and Toyota brands at the North American corporate headquarters in Plano, Texas.

There’s the new Nightshade trim package (everyone needs a black edition, right?) for the popular Toyota Camry, as well as information about the all-new Toyota C-HR electric crossover and refreshed Corolla Cross.

Just yesterday, we learned that the (awfully named) bZ4X all-electric crossover is thankfully getting a new name, simply bZ, perhaps because Volkswagen beat Toyota to the copyright office for the name “Buzz.” And there’s a chance we’ll see an all-new Toyota RAV4, according to our colleagues at Car and Driver.

We’ve already told you about the 2026 Corolla Hatchback FX, so here we will roundup these other product announcements, keeping in mind that there will be more to come, possibly some TRD Pro news for rugged off-roaders.

2026 Toyota C-HR BEV

The Toyota C-HR started out in 2017 as a quirky subcompact crossover, and it left the US market after merely six years and meager sales.

For 2026, the C-HR will be recast for battery-electric duty, while retaining its coupe-like profile and subcompact crossover position, below the larger crossover formerly known as bZ4X.

Expect 338 hp and Toyota-estimated range of 290 miles. All-wheel drive will be standard, as will a North American Charging System (NACS) port, giving it access to thousands of DC fast charging stations nationwide.

Toyota says the new C-HR, derived from the e-TNGA platform, will arrive next year at US showrooms from a Toyota plant in Japan. Another plant in Turkey will assemble the C-HR as well.

Toyota says the new C-HR is the brand’s 20th electrified model in the lineup.

2026 Toyota bZ BEV

So long bZ4X—we won’t miss the clunky name because we could barely remember it.

Beyond the streamlined name, the 2026 bZ will deliver some worthwhile battery-electric upgrades, especially on the range front. The ’25 bZ4X offered two battery packs (71.4 kWh and 72.8 kWh), capable of range between 222 and 252 miles.

Four versions of the ’26 bZ will use a 74.7-kWh battery and achieve range of between 278 miles (with AWD) and 314 miles (with front-wheel drive). Even better, a front-drive XLE trim will be offered with a smaller 57.7-kWh battery, rated at 236 miles of range and potentially coming in at a lower price point.

Look for 338 hp combined with AWD for ’26, up from 214 hp combined on the prior AWD bZ4X. The instrument panel will also be all-new, with a larger 14-inch multimedia touchscreen. A North American Charging System (NACS) port will give the bZ access to thousands of DC fast charging stations nationwide.

Starting price for the 2025 bZ4X was $38,205, and we’ll have to wait for the new pricing until later this summer when the ’26 bZ starts arriving at Toyota showrooms, in XLE and Limited trims. Toyota builds the bZ4X in Japan and China.

2026 Toyota Camry Nightshade Edition

The Camry was all-new for its ninth generation when it launched for the ’25 model year, so understandably the upgrades for 2026 are cosmetic.

For the goth shoppers who like their mainstream sedans dark and foreboding, the Nightshade Edition will offer Midnight Black Metallic exterior features, such as the grille, air curtains, side canards, door handles, mirror caps, shark fin antenna, rear lower sport diffuser, and rear spoiler.

Of course, there’s unique 19-inch wheels and gloss black badging to complete the look. If black-on-black is just too much, then you can opt for the Nightshade Edition with Ice Cap (white) and Supersonic Red (pictured above). The ‘26 Camry also comes in a new exterior color, Dark Cosmos, a smoky blue.

Every new Camry is a hybrid (2.5-liter four-cylinder with at least 225 hp combined), so even Nightshade Editions should get a Toyota-estimated 51 mpg, depending on your driving style. Toyota builds the Camry in Georgetown, Kentucky.

So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits.
The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

(WLNS) — General Motors is promising a new electric vehicle battery that it says will be cheaper and have more range.

It’s called the LMR battery, short for lithium manganese rich. General Motors officials said there are no EVs with this type of battery on the road currently because, in the past, there have been issues with battery life and voltage decay. GM, along with its collaborator, LG Energy Solutions, says they have figured out the problems and are ready to move.

Now that one of Lansing’s assembly plants is converting into an EV facility, 6 News spoke with the President and C.E.O. of the Lansing Economic Development Corporation, Karl Dorshimer, and what this new technology could mean for demand in the area.

“One way or another they’re going to be on the forefront of automotive technology,” Dorshimer said about GM.

Hoping to be the first on the market, GM and LG Energy Solutions say LMR batteries for trucks and SUVs would drastically increase vehicle range compared to other lithium-ion batteries.

“That technology, they believe, is a better choice,” said Dorshimer.

GM said current EVs use batteries that are more expensive than the LMR battery, so people will be able to go further and get their car for cheaper. Officials said that Lansing’s two GM assembly plants plan to use LMR batteries in the near future.

“The plan is to convert them to some type of electric vehicle production and/or hybrids.” Dorshimer continued, “Either one of them would involve battery technology, and this new battery is what they want to go with.”

When it comes to producing this new battery, Dorshimer said it would be great for Lansing’s economy if production happened in the city.

“We would love for the batteries to be produced here in the Lansing area but so far, no word from GM,” said Dorshimer.

There is a battery plant currently under construction in Lansing that is owned by LG Energy Solutions, after GM sold its stake to the South Korean company. Dorshimer does not believe that the LMR batteries will be made there, though.

“Where they are going to produce those batteries and how they are going to get to Lansing has not yet been determined,” said Dorshimer.

Production plans aside, it is confirmed that Lansing’s GM Grand River assembly plant is turning to electric vehicle production, so cheaper, longer-range cars are expected to be available in a few years.

It also provides drivers and passengers alike with plenty of comfort and convenience, such as two wireless smartphone chargers and rear cabin USB ports to ensure everyone on board can be connected when on the move; rear cabin air conditioning controls; and an available panoramic roof that brings natural light to all parts of the interior.

Electrifying Performance

The 2026 Toyota C-HR BEV comes equipped with standard AWD with electric motors housed in the front and rear eAxles. Altogether, the model is expected to be capable of going from 0 to 60 miles per hour in around 5 seconds. Its coupe-like lines are complemented by a low center of gravity, thanks to the underfloor-mounted battery pack that is surrounded by a cross-framing structure for overall vehicle rigidity. In addition to the fundamental strength, rigidity and agility of the dedicated BEV platform, suspension parts have been precisely tuned for the new C-HR, including spring and damper performance and the stiffness of the anti-roll bars.

It will have a lithium-ion battery with a total capacity of 74.7-kWh and an 11-kW on-board AC charger. It will have a NACS charging port that is compatible with Level Three DC fast-charging, giving it access thousands of high-speed charging stations nationwide. When using fast charging the C-HR will be capable of recharging from 10% to 80% battery capacity in around 30 minutes under ideal conditions*. The 2026 C-HR will also be capable of charging on Level One and Level Two AC power sources.

A battery pre-conditioning function is also included on C-HR. This system brings the battery to an optimal temperature for DC fast charging, enabling faster charging in colder climates. This function can be activated manually or automatically by setting the navigation system destination to a fast-charging station.

The 2026 C-HR also features steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters to activate and adjust regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the process of converting energy created by the movement of the vehicle, also known as kinetic energy, into electrical energy. The driver can adjust the amount of regenerative braking power from four levels using the paddle shifters.

Two Style and Value-Packed Grades

The all-electric 2026 C-HR will be available in an SE and XSE grade. Exterior paint options on both grades will include the all-new Overcast and Tandoori colors, along with Cement, Midnight Black Metallic, and Wind Chill Pearl (premium paint option).

Active Safety & Driver Assist Technology

The C-HR features Toyota Safety Sense 3.0™, Toyota’s suite of active safety and driver assistance features designed to support driver awareness, decision-making, and vehicle operation. Please note that Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 systems and driver assist features are not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. The safety suite includes:

Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD): Designed to help detect a vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist, or motorcyclist and provide an audible/visual forward-collision warning under certain circumstances. If you don’t react, the system is designed to provide automatic emergency braking.

Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DCRR): An adaptive cruise control system that is designed to be set at speeds above 20 mph. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control to help maintain a preset distance from the vehicle ahead of you.

Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA): Detects lane markings or the road’s edge at speeds above 30 mph. LDA w/SA is designed to provide an audible/visual warning if an inadvertent lane departure is detected. If no corrective action is taken, Steering Assist is designed to provide gentle corrective steering for lane-keeping assistance.

Lane Tracing Assist (LTA): Designed to help keep the vehicle in the center of a lane. LTA assists the driver with steering control while DRCC is in use.

Road Sign Assist (RSA): Uses the forward-facing camera to recognize specific road signs, such as speed limit, stop, and yield signs. RSA provides sign information to the driver via the Multi-Information Display.

Automatic High Beams (AHB): Designed to detect headlights of oncoming vehicles and taillights of preceding vehicles. AHB automatically toggles between high and low beams as appropriate.

Proactive Driving Assist (PDA): Uses the vehicle’s camera and radar, when system operating conditions are met, to provide gentle braking and/or steering to support driving tasks such as distance control between your vehicle and a preceding vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist. PDA can also provide gentle braking into curves.

For complete details on TSS 3.0, please visit Toyota.com/safety-sense.

Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert is also standard. The BSM system uses rear side radar sensors installed on the inner side of the rear bumper, on both the left and right sides, to assist the driver in confirming safety when changing lanes. The RCTA function uses the same sensors installed behind the rear bumper. This function is intended to assist the driver in checking areas that are not easily visible when backing up.

Safe Exit Alert is also standard on the C-HR. This system is designed to detect vehicles or cyclists approaching from the rear and judge if there is a possibility of a collision with an open door or passengers who are exiting. Safe Exit Alert will illuminate an indicator in the outer mirror and provide an audible alert to notify vehicle occupants.

The Toyota C-HR is also equipped with Toyota’s Star Safety System, standard. This system includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Traction Control (TRAC), Anti-lock Brake System (ABS), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA) and Smart Stop Technology® (SST).

Driver assistance features include Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Change Assist, and Front Cross-Traffic Alert, standard**.

In terms of battery safety, Toyota uses many measures to help protect cell integrity, thanks to the design and a multiple monitoring system intended to protect the vehicle’s battery system. This includes:

Redundant monitoring of battery voltage, current and temperature designed to detect signs of abnormal heating to maintain optimal battery temperature and help prevent cell damage

Utilization of a high-resistance coolant circulation system is designed to help prevent a thermal event from short circuits even in high battery load conditions due to repeatedly switching between high-speed driving and rapid charging

Limited Warranty

Toyota’s 36-month/36,000-mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover the powertrain for 60,000 miles and corrosion with no mileage limitation. The Electric Vehicle Driving Components, including the traction battery, are covered for 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. Toyota dealers have complete details on the limited warranty.

The Toyota C-HR also comes with ToyotaCare, a plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance, for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first, and three years of Roadside Assistance, regardless of mileage.",https://toyota-cms-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toyota_2026_CHR_0001H-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 21:05:03.172842

Boudette, www.nytimes.com, neal-e-boudette",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/republican-budget-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html,"But a budget bill that House Republicans released on Monday would end that tax credit.
If Congress makes no changes to the tax credits, that number should climb to almost a third by 2030, the firm estimates.
Both have invested heavily in factories and supply chains with the hope of eventually producing millions of electric vehicles a year.
The elimination of the tax credits would make it much harder for the U.S. auto industry to catch up.
About 595,000 electric vehicles were leased in 2024, Ms. Valdez Streaty said, up from about 96,000 in 2022 before the leasing incentive was available.","Sales of electric vehicles have been rising in recent years, partly because of a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government that helps lower the cost of buying one.

But a budget bill that House Republicans released on Monday would end that tax credit. Their proposal would also put new restrictions on other tax breaks that have encouraged automakers to invest tens of billions of dollars in new battery plants in the United States.

By next year, the bill would do away with the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of new electric vehicles and a $4,000 credit that can be applied to the purchase of used electric cars and trucks.

If signed into law, the change is likely to increase electric vehicle sales in the coming months as consumers race to take advantage of the tax credit before it goes away. But sales are likely to slow or fall once the credits end, analysts said.

“It’s definitely going to impact adoption and slow it down significantly,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, a research firm.

Cox expects electric vehicles to make up 10 percent of all new vehicle purchases this year. If Congress makes no changes to the tax credits, that number should climb to almost a third by 2030, the firm estimates.

But if Congress repeals the credits, Ms. Valdez Streaty said, she expects electric vehicle sales to make up 20 to 24 percent of new car sales by 2030.

Losing the credits would deal another financial blow to automakers facing higher costs because of President Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and auto parts.

The Republican tax proposal would hurt many automakers that have been racing to introduce new models. General Motors and Ford Motor may be hit particularly hard. Both have invested heavily in factories and supply chains with the hope of eventually producing millions of electric vehicles a year.

G.M. has opened two battery plants, in Ohio and in Tennessee. The company built them through a joint venture with LG Energy Solution. Ford has three battery plants under construction — a wholly owned factory in Michigan and two in partnership with a South Korean company, SK On, in Kentucky and in Tennessee.

Both Detroit automakers have also invested in mining operations to secure domestic supplies of lithium, a key material for batteries.

Tesla, the largest seller of electric vehicles in the United States, will also be hurt. The company’s sales have been sliding in recent months because it hasn’t introduced new, more affordable models and because of a consumer backlash to its chief executive, Elon Musk, who has taken a prominent role in the Trump administration.

But Tesla has some advantages. While most automakers are still losing money on electric cars, Tesla has been making money on them for years. As a result, it might have more financial leeway to lower prices to prop up demand if the credits end. The company also relies less on imported parts than other U.S. automakers.

Other large automakers have been racing to catch up to Tesla in electric vehicles, including by building many new factories, mostly in states that have elected many Republican lawmakers.

Toyota has built a battery plant in North Carolina. Hyundai has started making electric vehicles at a plant in Georgia and plans to produce batteries there. Stellantis and a partner have two battery plants under construction in Indiana. The states hosting these plants have been counting on them to create thousands of well-paying jobs.

If the tax rules change significantly, automakers could scrap, scale back or delay their plans.

“If the government wants the U.S. to compete with China and the rest of the world in the inevitably large E.V. market, and wants G.M. and Ford to make large, long-term investments in E.V. development and U.S.-based production, it needs to extend the tax credit and wall it off from doctrinaire whiplash,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry.

China is the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles and is the most important source of critical materials for batteries and electric motors, such as processed lithium and rare earth minerals. The elimination of the tax credits would make it much harder for the U.S. auto industry to catch up.

“What this does globally to the U.S. auto industry and its ability to compete — I think it’s going to hurt us,” Ms. Valdez Streaty said. “I think it’s going to slow us down, and we are already behind China.”

Ford and Stellantis declined to comment, as did the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a policy group.

The federal government began offering the $7,500 credit under President Barack Obama, and it stayed in place during President Trump’s first term. The credit was renewed and expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed into law.

Because electric vehicles are more expensive than internal-combustion vehicles, the credits have been essential in getting more people to buy them.

The credit is available on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that sell for $80,000 or less and sedans that cost no more than $55,000. Cars have to be assembled in North America, and their batteries must meet requirements on which countries their battery materials come from. To qualify, individual buyers have to earn no more than $150,000 a year and couples no more than $300,000.

Many of those conditions do not apply to leased vehicles. But the tax credit on those cars and trucks goes to the company that leases the car to individuals, which is typically the finance arms of automakers. Many leasing firms have been passing the savings to their customers, a practice that has led to a sharp rise in leasing of electric vehicles.

“At the end of the day, we are saving Americans money on their EV charging,” said Vellone.","A new partnership aims to reduce the strain on the power grid while boosting electric vehicle adoption by putting money back in the pockets of EV owners.

The partnership between Leap and ChargeScape will create the nation’s largest EV virtual power plant, the companies announced Wednesday.

A virtual power plant, or VPP, combines the capacity of what’s known as distributed energy resources such as solar farms, EVs and EV chargers, batteries, household appliances, heating and ventilation equipment and others that can be flexibly charged or accessed to provide power back to the grid.

When effectively managed, a VPP can provide some of the same services as a traditional power plant.

Leap specializes in creating and managing VPPs, providing financial reward for its partners.

“What we're enabling our partners to do is monetize what we call their flexibility, their ability to control load behind the meter, control these stationary batteries, or mobile batteries and EVs, and monetize them as capacity and energy for grid operators,” explained Leap CEO Jason Michaels, in an interview.

ChargeScape’s charging platform connects power grids with automotive brands that include BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan and Tesla, also providing financial rewards to EV owners for their flexibility in charging their vehicles.

Owners sign up through the automaker’s app such as Ford Pass or My BMW, which they already use to manage charging their EVs, then enroll their electric meter with Leap.

“So we deliver all of these electric vehicles from all these automotive brands and all the flexibility that comes with their residential charging, and we plug that into Leap, and we sort of become part of their overall portfolio that they then bid into these energy markets to deliver flexibility,” said ChargeScape CEO Joseph Vellone, in an interview. “Leap will then tell us we need to either reduce demand during these hours on this day or actually the power grid needs more power. How much can we export through vehicle-to-grid charging? ChargeScape handles all of that and Leap makes sure that we get paid in the end.”

EV owners are then paid directly by ChargeScape through Venmo or PayPal.

The results are managing the strain on the power grid, especially during peak load periods such as the heat of summer when air conditioners are in high use and making it financially attractive to own an EV, say both Vellone and Michaels.

“At the end of the day, we are saving Americans money on their EV charging,” said Vellone. “By making EV charging more affordable, we are making EV ownership or leasing more affordable, reducing the total cost of ownership.”

The two systems are connected through Leap’s API and it’s that connectivity and complementary capabilities that has Michaels especially enthusiastic about partnering with ChargeScape.

“ChargeScape is a really exciting partner for us because of both their technical ability to be able to control the charging of all these different customer devices and their EVs, and also their reach and association with their OEM partners,” Michaels said. “That's where I think this gets to be really exciting for everybody, because we can do this, not just for one utility program, but really unlock scale.”

The partnership is rolling out initially in California where automakers on the ChargeScape platform can earn additional revenue through the Emergency Load Reduction Program, a five-year pilot program designed to pay electricity consumers for reducing energy consumption or increasing electricity supply during periods of electrical grid emergencies.

Revenue is also available through California’s Demand Side Grid Support program which offers incentives to electric customers that provide load reduction and backup generation to support the state’s electrical grid during extreme events from May to October to reduce the risk of rotating power outages.

Beyond California, the partners plan to expand to states such as Texas and New York, which Vellone says, have similar power structures to California’s along with a high number of electric vehicles.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6822052e019f53834416283c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-14 21:05:11.175194

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them.
It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.
The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade.
The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS chemicals, in drinking water — and reconsidering the allowable levels for others.

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in the announcement.

PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been used for decades to waterproof and stainproof a variety of products including clothing, cosmetics, upholstery and firefighting foams. They're sometimes called ""forever chemicals"" because they contain strong molecular bonds that persist for decades. Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked with harms to human health, such as certain cancers or damage to the liver and immune systems.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them. It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

Now, the EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it's rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.

""That doesn't mean that [the limits] gets weaker…when I go through a process and we follow the law, at the end of it, the final [levels] might be a lower number, not a higher number,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Congressional hearing on May 14.

Some environmental advocates expressed skepticism.

""The way the issue is being framed [in the announcement] is not about providing additional protections or making it stricter,"" says Anna Reade, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's about providing relief in terms of cost to water systems.""

Groups representing water utilities praised the move.

""We strongly support the agency's decision to rescind the regulations…and ensure future rulemakings respect the Safe Drinking Water Act process,"" read a joint email statement from the heads of the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, two groups that have sued the EPA over its PFAS regulation.

They said the process requires EPA to construct rules that ""maximize public health benefits in a cost-effective manner. This is critical for water systems and their communities, because the process helps ensure every ratepayer dollar is directed toward the most pressing public health risks.""

While she's concerned that the agency may attempt to weaken the rule regardless, ""The real damage right now is that it's delaying movement towards drinking water protections for PFAS,"" she says.

The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in the announcement.

PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been used for decades to waterproof and stainproof a variety of products including clothing, cosmetics, upholstery and firefighting foams. They’re sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they contain strong molecular bonds that persist for decades. Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked with harms to human health, such as certain cancers or damage to the liver and immune systems.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them. It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

Now, the EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it’s rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.

“That doesn’t mean that [the limits] gets weaker…when I go through a process and we follow the law, at the end of it, the final [levels] might be a lower number, not a higher number,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Congressional hearing on May 14.

Some environmental advocates expressed skepticism.

“The way the issue is being framed [in the announcement] is not about providing additional protections or making it stricter,” says Anna Reade, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It’s about providing relief in terms of cost to water systems.”

Groups representing water utilities praised the move.

“We strongly support the agency’s decision to rescind the regulations…and ensure future rulemakings respect the Safe Drinking Water Act process,” read a joint email statement from the heads of the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, two groups that have sued the EPA over its PFAS regulation.

They said the process requires EPA to construct rules that “maximize public health benefits in a cost-effective manner. This is critical for water systems and their communities, because the process helps ensure every ratepayer dollar is directed toward the most pressing public health risks.”

Honda’s postponed investments in Canada have drawn criticism from Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who last month expressed optimism that Honda would maintain production in the country.
However, in a press conference on May 13 after the plans were made public, Ford said that he would hold Honda and other automakers “accountable” for pulling some vehicle production out of Canada.
But even before tariffs were levied on imported vehicles and parts, Honda planned to ramp up EV production in the U.S. Over the past year, Honda has been retooling three facilities in Ohio to create an EV production hub.
The automaker said that each of its North America production facilities will have a “critical role” in its electrified future.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Honda is postponing its planned investments to build an electric vehicle supply chain in Canada by two years amid tariffs and slower than expected EV demand in North America, CEO Toshihiro Mibe said during the company’s earnings call on May 13.

Honda last April announced plans to invest up to $11 billion to establish an EV production hub in Canada, which included a factory with an annual output of 240,000 EVs a year and a 36 GWh battery factory in Alliston, Ontario, with joint venture partner Posco Future M Co.

“We have to observe what is happening and ultimately make the decision,” Mibe said during the company earnings call. “We are consulting with the Canadian government and Ontario Province and as for this postponement, we have already received their consent.”

Dive Insight:

The original plans for Honda’s Canada EV hub included all aspects of manufacturing and the procurement of raw materials for battery production, including a cathode active material and precursor processing and separator plant with the automaker’s other JV partner Asahi Kasei.

The revised plans come as Honda seeks to shift more vehicle production to the U.S. to avoid new U.S. duties on imported vehicles, which are expected to significantly impact its profits in the upcoming fiscal year.

The automaker’s FY 2026 forecast called for its operating profit to fall by nearly 59%, or over 700 billion yen ($4.8 billion), while its margins are expected to decline by over half.

“In the mid-term, if the tariff measures are to be in place for a long time, then we will have to increase our production capacity in [the] United States,” Mibe said. “We've already begun studies on this.”

Mibe added that Honda would reevaluate its Canada investment plans based on market conditions as they unfold.

“If the conditions were to change, at that point in time we have to revisit this,” said Mibe. “As per the specifics, what happens after two years and the starting time of the project, we have to observe what is happening and ultimately make the decision.”

Honda’s planned investment in Canada would have been its largest ever in the country.

Among the automaker’s other tariff mitigation plans shared by Mibe is moving production of the Honda Civic hybrid from Japan to its U.S. plant in Indiana.

In addition, production of the CR-V compact SUV, which was originally planned to continue in Ontario, will be moved to Ohio or Indiana due to tariffs. As of 2023, the Canada factory was the global lead plant for manufacturing the CR-V and North America lead plant for the CR-V hybrid, according to Honda. The automaker did not say which of its U.S. plants will assemble the vehicle, as the plans are still being finalized.

Honda’s postponed investments in Canada have drawn criticism from Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who last month expressed optimism that Honda would maintain production in the country. Ford said a media report that Honda planned to shift more vehicle production to the U.S. were “not accurate at all.”

“We’re going to keep Honda here, and I’ll do everything I can to protect the people and their jobs,"" Ford said last month.

However, in a press conference on May 13 after the plans were made public, Ford said that he would hold Honda and other automakers “accountable” for pulling some vehicle production out of Canada.

But even before tariffs were levied on imported vehicles and parts, Honda planned to ramp up EV production in the U.S. Over the past year, Honda has been retooling three facilities in Ohio to create an EV production hub. The automaker said that each of its North America production facilities will have a “critical role” in its electrified future.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/EJYrFsAT6Zr2XTjpghxzSWscAjkt_ZAYfA7GAzgi9Io/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DaXZpY19IZXJvX0ltZ193aXRoX1Blb3BsZS0xMjAweDgwMC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-14 21:05:31.435834

On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

EPA terminates $15M climate justice grant to Pittsburgh and Philly non-profits

The Allegheny Front

In 2024, the Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Landforce, alongside seven sub-awardees, was awarded a $15 million EPA climate justice grant to train disadvantaged individuals in landscaping and tree care, aiming to create green jobs and address environmental inequities in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The initiative planned to expand Landforce’s workforce development model, which combines environmental stewardship with employment opportunities for those facing barriers. However, the EPA recently terminated the grant, citing administrative issues, leaving Landforce and its partners uncertain about the program’s future. This decision has raised concerns about the loss of potential jobs and environmental benefits for underserved communities. Landforce, known for maintaining Pittsburgh’s green spaces, is now exploring alternative funding to sustain its mission. The termination reflects broader challenges in securing consistent federal support for climate justice initiatives, prompting local advocates to question the EPA’s commitment to equitable environmental progress.

Aramco in talks with Woodside for Louisiana LNG stake

Rigzone

Woodside Energy Group Ltd. has signed a non-binding collaboration agreement with Saudi Aramco, which includes potential offtake and ownership in the Louisiana LNG project, alongside exploring lower-carbon ammonia and other global opportunities. The deal, formalized at the Saudi-United States Investment Forum in Riyadh, aligns with Woodside’s strategy to diversify its global portfolio, leveraging Aramco’s expertise as a leading energy and chemicals company. Woodside, which acquired the project (formerly Driftwood LNG) for $1.2 billion, announced a positive final investment decision for phase 1, involving three liquefaction trains with a 16.5 MMtpa capacity, with a total project cost of $17.5 billion. Stonepeak Partners LP will invest $5.7 billion for a 40% stake. Louisiana LNG, permitted to export 27.6 MMtpa, has begun construction with Bechtel Corp. and secured a supply deal with Uniper SE for up to 2 MMtpa through 2039, positioning Woodside as a global LNG leader. [MDN: We know Trump is visiting the Saudis and saying nice things about their thug dictator leader. We don’t like the Saudis and we don’t like them owning key pieces of our energy infrastructure.

New York and New Jersey need natural gas

Wall Street Journal

President Trump’s initiative to revive the 124-mile Constitution Pipeline, connecting Pennsylvania to New York, aims to alleviate high natural gas prices in the Northeast, where New York saw rates near $20 per million Btus last winter compared to Pennsylvania’s $3. New York’s fracking ban and opposition to new pipelines, driven by environmental policies, force reliance on imported gas, inflating costs. New Jersey’s similar resistance, coupled with failed offshore wind projects like Ocean Wind 1 and 2, exacerbates energy shortages amid rising demand from data centers and electrification goals. Both states’ push for heat pumps and renewable energy is faltering due to insufficient battery storage and soaring electricity costs, making natural gas essential. Reviving pipelines and lifting New York’s fracking ban could lower costs, support economic growth, and provide relief to low-income consumers, addressing the region’s energy and economic challenges. [MDN: Politicians can no longer afford to give in to those who oppose every new pipeline proposal. We need new pipelines, NOW.]

Could Trump make it easier for DTE to build natural gas plants?

Planet Detroit

The article from Planet Detroit discusses how DTE Energy, a major Michigan utility, could benefit from the Trump administration’s relaxed environmental regulations, making it easier to build new natural gas plants despite environmental concerns. DTE’s CEO, Jerry Norcia, indicated that rolling back clean energy rules could facilitate natural gas expansion and delay coal plant retirements, aligning with the company’s plans to meet rising energy demands, particularly from data centers. However, a report by the Rocky Mountain Institute highlights that increased natural gas reliance could raise Michigan ratepayers’ bills by $37 billion by 2050 and hinder climate goals. Critics, including environmental advocates, argue this approach contradicts Michigan’s clean energy commitments, such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The article underscores tensions between short-term energy demands, regulatory changes, and long-term climate objectives, with DTE navigating a complex landscape of economic and environmental priorities.

S&P Global says USA crude oil production now expected to decline in 2026

Rigzone

An S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis predicts a decline in U.S. crude oil production in 2026, the first annual drop in a decade, excluding the 2020 pandemic, due to slowing global oil demand, expected supply surplus, and uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies. The report revises global oil demand growth for 2025 to 750,000 barrels per day, down 500,000 from prior estimates, with demand growth expected to average only 420,000 barrels per day for the rest of 2025 after a strong first quarter. U.S. production is forecasted to average 13.46 million barrels per day in 2025, falling to 13.33 million in 2026, driven by low oil prices (mid-to-low $60s for Brent, high $50s to low $60s for WTI) and potential trade barriers. The analysis warns of further risks if trade tensions persist or OPEC+ accelerates production increases, potentially deepening the downturn, though a price-driven decline could set the stage for a future recovery. [MDN: Sorry to say this, but S&P is dead wrong. Watch what will happen when the U.S. economy begins to roar later this year after the tariff deals are in place and more manufacturing and economic activity begins to kick in here at home.]

After more than a decade of little change, U.S. electricity consumption rising again

U.S. Energy Information Administration – Today in Energy

The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts a rise in U.S. electricity consumption for 2025 and 2026, exceeding the 2024 peak and reversing a nearly two-decade trend of flat demand. This growth, primarily driven by the commercial sector (notably data centers) and the industrial sector (manufacturing), follows a period where efficiency improvements and a shift to less energy-intensive service sectors offset demand increases from population and economic growth. Since 2020, electricity consumption has risen, with an expected average annual growth rate of 1.7% through 2026, led by commercial (2.6%) and industrial (2.1%) sectors, while residential growth remains modest at 0.7%. This surge is prompting expansions in solar and battery storage capacity, particularly in Texas, California, the upper Midwest, and the Northeast, alongside investments in energy efficiency, demand response programs, and high-voltage transmission lines to ensure grid reliability and balance, as reported by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [MDN: We need more electricity. Unreliable renewables are not up to the task. Only gas-fired power can fill the need.]

US oil output has peaked, but don’t expect a rapid decline

Bloomberg

The American television drama Landman highlights the Texas oil industry’s volatility, with its protagonist noting $78 per barrel as the ideal oil price. In reality, West Texas Intermediate recently fell below $60, hitting a four-year low of $55, prompting shale companies to cut spending, drilling rigs, and fracking crews. The U.S., a major global oil producer, may have reached peak shale output sooner than anticipated, potentially by 2027 or earlier, due to low prices and investor pressure to prioritize shareholder payouts over reinvestment. Despite a slowdown—evidenced by a drop in active rigs to 474 and Permian frac crews to a four-year low of 105—production declines will likely be gradual, supported by efficient drilling and stable Gulf of Mexico output. While U.S. oil production peaked at 20.68 million barrels daily in October, a significant drop is unlikely in 2025 unless prices remain low, with a modest decline more probable in 2026. [MDN: More peak oil nonsense, this time from Bloomberg. They keep wishing and predicting, and they keep being wrong.]

U.S. LNG feedgas demand dropped due to maintenance and outages

RBN Energy

Last week, U.S. LNG feedgas demand dropped by nearly 1 Bcf/d due to maintenance and outages at several terminals. Cameron LNG saw reduced feedgas deliveries, likely due to a train offline for unreported maintenance, with Sempra also conducting pipeline maintenance on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline from May 9 to May 30. Cheniere’s Corpus Christi terminal experienced lower flows from May 5 to May 9 due to pipeline maintenance, with feedgas levels still slightly below normal post-maintenance. Freeport LNG went offline on May 6 after a power supply disruption, causing volatile feedgas levels, but has since resumed operations. Meanwhile, Cove Point, Calcasieu Pass, and Sabine Pass operated at full capacity, and the new Plaquemines LNG terminal increased its feedgas from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.2 Bcf/d over the weekend. These factors highlight the impact of scheduled and unscheduled disruptions on LNG feedgas demand. [MDN: Feedgas will not be 100% all of the time. Freeport regularly goes offline for one reason or another. Other plants have scheduled maintenance once a year. It happens.]

Navigating the diverging landscape of climate disclosure laws

JDSupra

The article discusses the evolving landscape of climate disclosure regulations as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has withdrawn from defending its March 2024 Climate Disclosure Rule, creating uncertainty for companies navigating compliance. This retreat follows legal challenges and political shifts, particularly after the 2024 U.S. election, which may lead to further rollbacks of federal mandates. Meanwhile, states like California are advancing stricter disclosure laws, such as the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, requiring emissions reporting from large companies. Internationally, frameworks like the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and ISSB standards are gaining traction, adding complexity for multinational firms. Companies face a patchwork of regulations, with some proactively adopting voluntary disclosures to align with investor and consumer expectations, while others await clearer federal guidance. The article emphasizes the need for businesses to stay agile, monitor regulatory developments, and integrate climate considerations into governance to manage risks and opportunities effectively. [MDN: It’s harder than ever for O&G companies (and others) to navigate suffocating regulations and disclosure regulations. Trump is trying to make it better, but the left continues its onslaught.]

Crude rebounds over 11% from lows

Bloomberg/Rigzone

Oil prices surged, with West Texas Intermediate climbing 2.8% to $63.67 a barrel and Brent rising 2.6% to $66.63, driven by US President Donald Trump’s threats to intensify sanctions on Iranian crude exports if no nuclear deal is reached. Speaking in Saudi Arabia, Trump emphasized maximum pressure on Iran’s energy sector, while the US State Department targeted a network facilitating Iranian oil shipments to China. The rebound, which saw an 11% recovery from the year’s lowest close, was bolstered by softer US inflation, easing US-China trade tensions, and a weaker dollar, making commodities more appealing. Equity markets rose, and optimism grew as tariff impacts on demand appeared limited. However, concerns linger about a potential oil glut, as OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, plans to boost output on June 1 to discipline non-compliant members, despite mixed market signals like strong gasoline spreads and a bearish North Sea crude trading window. [MDN: All of the moaning about oil being “low” and then it turns around on a dime. As we have been saying for months, oil in the $60s is just dandy with us.

The Republican budget blueprint allowed Ways and Means to budget $4.5 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, provided that it also finds $2 trillion in cuts and assume $2.6 trillion in economic growth.

The committee’s bill, which is subject to change, falls well within that fiscal range, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it will result in roughly $3.8 trillion in lost revenue by 2034.

Republicans on the committee defended their legislation Tuesday afternoon in a markup hearing set to continue into Wednesday. They pointed to multiple kinds of tax relief for ordinary Americans that the bill provides, including making permanent the 2017 higher standard deduction, Qualified Business Income (199A) deduction, paid family leave tax credit and increased child tax credit.

The draft bill also includes some temporary tax provisions lasting four years, including boosting the standard deduction for individuals from $15,000 to $16,000 and from $30,000 to $32,000 for joint filers. The maximum child tax credit would also increase by $500 to $2,500 through fiscal year 2028.

Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., reminded committee lawmakers that allowing the 2017 tax cuts to sunset would amount to Americans experiencing the largest single tax increase in history.

“If the Trump tax cuts expire, every single American will face an average tax increase of 22%,” Smith said. “My Democrat colleagues will continue to ignore the facts and make false claims about who benefits from this bill. These are the same falsehoods they repeated after the 2017 tax cuts – under which the share of taxes paid by the wealthy increased, while lower-income Americans paid less.”

American manufacturers would also benefit from the existing version of the bill, which would allow them to deduct 100% of facility improvement or construction costs. The bill would deal a blow to large universities by increasing taxes on endowments, as well as hiking taxes on many private foundations.

Trump’s major campaign promises to end taxes on tips and overtime pay are temporarily fulfilled by the bill, which would implement those policies, plus a $4,000 increase in tax deductions for eligible seniors, for the next four years.

But Democratic lawmakers are angry that the bill phases out renewable energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act and is contingent on spending reductions for Medicaid and SNAP. The bill also doesn’t penalize higher earners enough, in Democrats’ opinion, and is predicted to skyrocket the federal debt and deficit.

“This legislation pours gasoline on a fire that’s already burning. Americans are buckling under chaos Republicans helped create. And this bill would make it worse,” Ranking Member Richard Neal, D-Mass., said during the markup. “This isn’t about growth or prosperity. It’s about protecting the ultra-wealthy – again.”

Their fiscal concerns echo those of Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who said the four-year tax credit increases mask the giant deficit impact of a permanent TCJA extension.

“This already cynical gimmick is especially egregious in combination with the plan to use a ‘current policy baseline’ in the Senate to make TCJA extensions look free,” MacGuineas said in a statement. “Lawmakers want to argue that temporary provisions currently in place should be considered permanent while new temporary provisions should be considered temporary. They want to mix and match baselines to avoid ever having to acknowledge how much they are adding to the debt.”

CRFB has estimated that the Ways and Means draft bill could add up to $5.3 trillion to the federal deficit.

As the markup continues through the night, Republican leaders will have to address concerns and demands from their own constituents as well. The bill because it raises the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction cap from $10,000 to $30,000 for single and joint filers, much lower than vulnerable New York Republicans want.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them.
It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.
The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade.
The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS chemicals, in drinking water — and reconsidering the allowable levels for others.

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in the announcement.

PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been used for decades to waterproof and stainproof a variety of products including clothing, cosmetics, upholstery and firefighting foams. They're sometimes called ""forever chemicals"" because they contain strong molecular bonds that persist for decades. Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked with harms to human health, such as certain cancers or damage to the liver and immune systems.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them. It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

Now, the EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it's rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.

""That doesn't mean that [the limits] gets weaker…when I go through a process and we follow the law, at the end of it, the final [levels] might be a lower number, not a higher number,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Congressional hearing on May 14.

Some environmental advocates expressed skepticism.

""The way the issue is being framed [in the announcement] is not about providing additional protections or making it stricter,"" says Anna Reade, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's about providing relief in terms of cost to water systems.""

Groups representing water utilities praised the move.

""We strongly support the agency's decision to rescind the regulations…and ensure future rulemakings respect the Safe Drinking Water Act process,"" read a joint email statement from the heads of the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, two groups that have sued the EPA over its PFAS regulation.

They said the process requires EPA to construct rules that ""maximize public health benefits in a cost-effective manner. This is critical for water systems and their communities, because the process helps ensure every ratepayer dollar is directed toward the most pressing public health risks.""

The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade. While she's concerned that the agency may attempt to weaken the rule regardless, ""The real damage right now is that it's delaying movement towards drinking water protections for PFAS,"" she says.

The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.

According to EPA analysis, it would cost $1.5 billion a year for water companies to comply with the regulation. The benefits of reducing PFAS in drinking water would equal or exceed the costs, the agency said, in terms of less cancer and fewer heart attacks, strokes and birth complications in the affected population.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8255x4643+0+150/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F61%2F4de96af240fea3fa04645e4e0683%2Fgettyimages-1509889349.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 18:09:54.313252

The Peoria plant will ultimately assemble the entire bus, including a newer and slightly larger 25-foot version due out in about two years, D’Hollander told the Tribune Tuesday.
At the same time, Lion Electric, which announced its electric school bus factory near Joliet with great fanfare four years ago, is facing liquidation after a short manufacturing run.","As Lion Electric faces liquidation and the auction of its shuttered Joliet electric bus factory, the state has announced another Canadian EV bus manufacturer will be opening a plant in Peoria.

Damera Corp., an Ontario-based electric bus company, plans to invest $31.5 million and create 90 full-time jobs to open its first U.S. assembly plant, backed by state tax incentives.

The leased 55,000-square-foot facility will be used to sell, service and build the Karsan eJest, a 19-passenger electric minibus with a range of 130 miles. Billed as a zero-emissions public transportation solution for suburban areas, the bus has already been deployed in several communities in the U.S. and Canada.

“Over the past six years, Illinois has pushed to solidify our status as a hub of the EV future — and put our shoulder to the wheel to get that vision off the ground and on the road,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a news release Tuesday. “Through our competitive incentive programs, workforce development, and other business attraction efforts, the state is bringing in companies like Damera that not only create jobs and opportunity for our people, but commit themselves to our communities.”

Pritzker made the announcement with Damera executives Tuesday as part of a business development trip in Washington, D.C. The company first met with Illinois development representatives at a trade summit last summer in Maryland.

Damera was incentivized to build its first U.S. plant in Illinois through the state’s Reimagining Energy and Vehicles In Illinois (REV Illinois). The 2021 legislation offers up to a 75% credit on state income tax for EV manufacturers for meeting agreed upon investment and job creation targets.

“As we continue to expand Damera Bus USA LLC’s presence in the United States, our commitment to fostering long-term growth and job creation in the Peoria area remains unwavering,” Roger D’Hollander, Damera’s chief operating officer, said in the news release. “This investment not only strengthens the local economy but also creates hundreds of new opportunities for the community.”

The company, which has its U.S. headquarters in Florida, is the exclusive North American distributor of the Karsan eJest. The minibus is manufactured in Turkey and the final assembly is currently in Canada.

Launched about two years ago, the eJest has about 80 buses in service in the U.S., including Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people on California’s central coast, whose public transit system began using 14 of the electric minibuses in 2023.

The Peoria plant will ultimately assemble the entire bus, including a newer and slightly larger 25-foot version due out in about two years, D’Hollander told the Tribune Tuesday. Once production on the new model ramps up, the company expects to employ 300 to 500 people in Peoria, he said.

The buses cost about $250,000 to $300,000 each, D’Hollander said.

Illinois has made significant strides in EV manufacturing, most notably with Rivian, which began building its full-size electric R1T pickup truck, the R1S SUV and its commercial delivery vans in September 2021 in a former Mitsubishi auto plant on the outskirts of Normal.

Rivian, which is gearing up to launch its new midsize R2 electric SUV, is expanding its plant and building an adjacent $120 million supplier park to facilitate increased production.

At the same time, Lion Electric, which announced its electric school bus factory near Joliet with great fanfare four years ago, is facing liquidation after a short manufacturing run.

Opened in 2023, with plans to ramp up production at its 900,000-square-foot plant and create 1,400 jobs, Lion Electric suspended operations in December and temporarily laid off 400 workers in Canada and the U.S.

Last week, a Canadian court-appointed monitor said the company is likely to be liquidated. An auction for the plant’s equipment is set for May 21.

On May 2, President Trump unveiled a budget plan for fiscal year 2026 that proposes sweeping cuts to agencies and programs that ocean and coastal communities rely on. While Congress will come up with its own spending plan, the administration’s wish list calls for significantly less funding in the year to come for many programs across a variety of departments and agencies, including a whopping 55% reduction in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The administration's budget aligns with his executive actions so far this year, like those calling to dramatically weaken environmental, climate research, clean energy, and environmental justice programs.

As Congress develops its budget bill for 2026, the time is now for us to urge our representatives to ensure that the federal programs critical to the health of our ocean, waves, and beaches are protected.

Why We Care

The health of our coasts and ocean cannot depend solely on the efforts of volunteers, local organizations, states, and local governments. The federal government plays an enormous role in protecting habitats and clean water, monitoring beach water quality, informing the public of health hazards like sewage spills and industrial discharges, safeguarding marine wildlife, researching climate change, and so much more.

The cuts proposed by the administration will slash spending across programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. agency responsible for managing our ocean and coasts and monitoring weather and climate, and the EPA, which implements and enforces laws that protect human health and our environment.

Without adequate staffing and funding for these agencies, critical programs for our coasts and ocean are at risk. This includes NOAA’s National Marine Sanctuaries, which protect 629,000 square miles of ocean and Great Lakes waters, and the EPA’s Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act grants programs, which supports water quality monitoring and public health protection at more than 4,500 beaches nationwide.

Here are some of the programs to be cut in the administration's 2026 budget:

Elimination of Beach Water Quality Monitoring and Pollution Prevention Programs

$1 billion cut to EPA grant programs, including the elimination of the nation’s premier beach water quality monitoring program (BEACH Act Grant Program) and binational pollution reduction program (the U.S.-Mexico Border Water Infrastructure Grant Program).

$2.46 billion cut to EPA Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds, slashing support to states to invest in their water infrastructure needs.

Elimination of Coastal Management and Ocean Protection Programs

$1.7 billion in cuts to NOAA programs that would end funding for the Coastal Zone Management Grant Program, which supports states in managing coastal resources and planning.

Defunding Research, Science, and Clean Energy Innovation

$1.3 billion cut to NOAA operations, research, and grants, terminating a variety of climate research, data, and grant programs.

$209 million cut to NOAA weather satellites and infrastructure, weakening critical weather monitoring capabilities.

$15.25 billion cut and cancellation of renewable energy funds, undermining significant investments for the transition to a clean energy economy.

$1.16 billion cut to NASA Earth Science, setting back critical climate monitoring and research.

$3.48 billion cut to National Science Foundation research in climate, clean energy, and environmental justice programs.

What’s Next

In a time of unprecedented threats to our coasts, we need more investments, not less. In the weeks ahead, Congress will debate and amend the proposed federal budget, coming up with one of their own to be signed into law. Now is the time to speak up for programs and people that protect our nation’s air, land, and water.

The area along the Detroit River from downtown Detroit to Lake Erie has been in nonattainment since 2013, according to the EPA.
Sulfur dioxide is one of six criteria pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act.
Sulfur dioxide can also react with other compounds to form fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, which is linked to cardiopulmonary problems and premature mortality.","A request has been submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to redesignate parts of Wayne County comprising Southwest Detroit and Downriver communities as in attainment for sulfur dioxide pollution limits, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy said Wednesday.

The area along the Detroit River from downtown Detroit to Lake Erie has been in nonattainment since 2013, according to the EPA.

The changes made to the state environmental regulator’s request after public comment was received include a correction to the combustion stack emission limit for the EES Coke Battery facility on Zug Island.

The EPA will review the request and decide whether it meets Clean Air Act requirements, and the federal agency has 18 months to approve or deny the request, according to EGLE.

Sulfur dioxide is one of six criteria pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. The nonattainment designation means that polluters in the area have faced stricter regulatory oversight for sulfur dioxide emissions, which can trigger asthma after short-term exposure and cause other respiratory problems, as Planet Detroit has previously reported.

Sulfur dioxide can also react with other compounds to form fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, which is linked to cardiopulmonary problems and premature mortality.

The move to redesignate the area follows the closure of DTE Energy’s River Rouge and Trenton Channel coal power plants and state and federal efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide pollution from other sources in an area that still sees high levels of industrial emissions.

The active sources of sulfur dioxide pollution included in the EPA’s model are U.S. Steel facilities in Ecorse and on Zug Island, EES Coke Battery, Carmeuse Lime in River Rouge, DTE Energy’s Monroe Power Plant, Cleveland-Cliffs Steel Corp. in Dearborn, the Dearborn Industrial Generation power plant in Dearborn, and the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery in Detroit.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water.

“More than 100 million people are drinking water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ which can cause cancer, harm fetuses and kids and pose other health hazards.","The Trump administration plans to rescind drinking water standards for several ""forever chemicals"" while extending the deadline for others.

EPA head Lee Zeldin cited ""significant compliance challenges"" as the reason for extending the deadline for PFOA and PFOS standards from 2029 to 2031.

Environmental groups criticize the move, citing potential health risks from the chemicals.

The Trump administration will move to rescind standards put in place last year to restrict allowable levels of several so-called forever chemicals found in drinking water supplies across the United States, while giving water systems an additional two years to meet rules enacted at the same time for other toxins of a similar type.

Lee Zeldin, head of Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), announced the proposed change regarding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known collectively as PFAS, on May 14. The substances, which may be linked to high blood pressure, some cancers and other illnesses, have been used widely in consumer products, including electronics and cookware, as well as in firefighting foam, and are known to build up in the environment over time.

The state of Michigan has determined the presence of thousands of potentially PFAS-contaminated sites in the state over the last decade and has put in place its own restrictions on contaminant levels in drinking water systems, though those were generally not quite as strict as those finalized in April 2024 by former President Joe Biden's administration.

Zeldin said in a news release on May 14 that he would keep in place the Biden administration's enforceable standards on two types of PFAS — perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, in drinking water at 4 parts per trillion. But in response to what he said were ""significant compliance challenges,"" he said the EPA would move to extend the deadline for meeting those standards from 2029 to 2031.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” Zeldin said. “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.""

Zeldin also announced the EPA would go through the normal rulemaking procedure to rescind enforceable standards for four other related PFAS: perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, or PFHxS; perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid, or HFPO-DA or GenX chemicals, or any of those three with perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, or PFBS.

The EPA said those were being rescinded ""to ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulation follow the legal process"" required by law, though it didn't say whether, or how, the Biden administration rules may have skirted the federal Safe Water Drinking Act.

Environmentalists denounced the move of changing the policy, which had been praised as a regulatory step forward in protecting drinking water when it was finalized last year, though water systems raised concerns about the cost and compliance timetable.

“More than 100 million people are drinking water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ which can cause cancer, harm fetuses and kids and pose other health hazards. But now the administration is going to toss out most of these long-sought protections and allow this contamination to continue unabated all at the behest of the chemical industry and water utilities,"" said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nationwide environmental group.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,"" Olson said.

Plugging wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia could cost nearly $40 billion, with most of the burden coming from shale wells.

Dwayne Purvis, founder and principal consultant at Purvis Energy Advisors in Fort Worth, Texas, and co-author of the report, said he analyzed the Ohio River Valley along with other states, finding old shale wells are often unable to fund their own decommissioning.

""Of course, there are some shale wells are getting older and depleting, producing at slower rates, and even some that are shut in or marginal,"" Purvis explained. ""What we did in this study that was new for the first time, was to offer ideas on how financial assurance reform can address this disparity.""

Purvis pointed out there are currently more than 265,000 unplugged non-shale wells across the three states too, many of which also pose environmental risks. He added hundreds of thousands more were plugged decades ago but often to outdated standards, meaning they may still leak.

Purvis noted the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law jump-started efforts to plug oil wells but the funding was never meant to be permanent. He contended operators should pay for decommissioning the wells but acknowledged many cannot afford to do it.

""The next best option is what we've offered, that it needs to come from, the money for decommissioning, needs to come from other companies in the oil and gas business, who do have the income necessary to cover the liabilities of the industry as a whole in order to protect the public,"" Purvis outlined.

According to the report in the three states studied, Purvis' proposal would directly increase oil and gas employment by an estimated 32% and create more than 19,000 new jobs.

Supporters of the Campaign for Affordable Power are pressing state lawmakers to pass a series of reform bills aimed at big investor-owned utilities like Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric.

Edison brought in more than $1.6 billion in profit last year and has raised rates 85% over the last decade.

However, the company is still asking the California Public Utilities Commission for another big rate increase after the Los Angeles fires.

Lee Trotman, communications director for the Utility Reform Network in Oakland, said he is against further rate hikes.

""The way to stop these utilities from getting away with these rate increases is by publicly participating,"" said Trotman. ""And you can actually call in during the CPUC vote meetings. You can go online. You have to make yourself heard.""

All three utility companies say they need rate increases to cover their costs.

The California Senate Appropriations Committee is holding a hearing today on a reform bill that promotes public financing of electrical infrastructure.

Advocates for the bill argue the current method of bond financing makes projects more expensive.

Trotman said another bill to be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on Wednesday would restrict how utilities can use money earned from ratepayers.

""They'll use the ratepayers' money for lobbying, promotional advertising,"" said Trotman, ""and other non-energy related expenses out of the monthly energy bills, which so far has been legal.""

Other bills being considered by the legislature would require cost savings to be passed on to customers, and ban power shutoffs during wildfire smoke days and industrial accidents.

Nevada clean-energy proponents have launched a new website to help connect Nevadans to energy and cost-saving programs.

One of the nonprofits behind getting SaveEnergyNV.org online was the Nevada Conservation League. Angelyn Tabalba, a consultant for the group, said the free tool aims to streamline the process for folks to find federal, state and utility company programs for which they may qualify.

Some of the Trump administration executive orders have stopped Biden-era funding and investments in clean-energy initiatives, so Tabalba encouraged folks to check out what's still available now.

""These programs are already making a difference for Nevada families, whether those are tax credits to help families install solar and utilize rebates to make their home energy upgrades possible,"" she said. ""The progress is fragile and the same clean-energy investments that are helping lowering costs for families and creating jobs across Nevada are now at risk.""

While President Donald Trump has targeted some parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, some Republicans in Congress are urging the administration to leave most of the IRA intact, for the jobs and economic benefits it has brought to local communities.

Tabalba called the SaveEnergyNV website a one-stop shop and said they'll launch a Spanish-language version in the near future.

Will Pregman, loan officer and program manager for the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said one of the biggest barriers to making energy-efficiency upgrades is the upfront costs - so tax credits and incentives can help reduce that burden. With summer on the horizon, he said, the new tool can help Nevadans ensure their air conditioning systems are ready.

""We see that demand escalate dramatically in the summer as people's old units start breaking down at inopportune times,"" he said, ""and SaveEnergyNV can help Nevadans be proactive and find a solution to their air conditioning issues now, before they have to scramble in an emergency.""

Pregman noted that the first step in lowering energy bills is getting a home energy audit, since all homes are different and will have different issues. For now, Nevadans are still able to claim up to $150 toward the cost of an energy audit thanks to tax credits in the IRA.

Over the past 15 years, West Virginians have been shelling out more of their income each month on electricity bills. Now, as lawmakers continue to push a reliance on coal, with support from the Trump administration, advocates say they are worried about residents' bottom line.

According to federal data, U.S. production of coal has steadily dropped over the past two decades.

Emmett Pepper, policy director for Energy Efficient West Virginia, said coal is now an expensive choice for producing energy compared with renewable resources. He adds big coal's grip on the state is costing households.

""We have monopolies in West Virginia for our electric utilities, so they should be run in a way that is the most cost effective reducing the bills for West Virginians,"" he explained.

Residents have seen their average electricity price jump by 90% since the early 2000s, according to Conservation West Virginia. The West Virginia Coal Association argues ramping up coal production will lower consumers' bills.

Last month Appalachian Power, one of the state's largest utilities, asked state regulators to raise rates to make up for operating costs. If approved, residents' bills would increase by around $5 per month. Meanwhile, Pepper noted, grants for energy efficiency and assistance are shrinking, leaving residents with few options.

""The state and federal government could be doing more to help people who are struggling with their electric bills,"" he continued. ""Instead, we've seen a budget come out that actually completely eliminates support that people have had in the past.""

More than 60% of Americans support the goal of taking steps for the nation to become carbon neutral by 2050, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last year.

But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more.
The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.
“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some “forever chemicals” in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and don’t easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

""We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden's administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities' lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.",https://media.9news.com/assets/CCT/images/abe76a58-dd08-4600-bc38-8e1178a74edd/20250514T141736/abe76a58-dd08-4600-bc38-8e1178a74edd_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 17:08:33.898810

It keeps a critical battery production tax credit in place, which is vital for automakers and battery suppliers looking to expand U.S.-based operations.","A major policy shakeup is brewing in Washington as House Republicans push forward with a proposal that could significantly reshape the electric vehicle landscape in the United States. Unveiled Monday, the plan is part of a broader tax reform package that includes scrapping the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits and rolling back key fuel efficiency standards aimed at promoting cleaner transportation.

At the heart of the proposal is a move to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for new EV buyers and the $4,000 credit for used EVs starting December 31. There’s a narrow exception for automakers that haven’t yet sold 200,000 electric vehicles. Those companies would retain access to the new vehicle credit for one more year, offering a brief lifeline to newer or smaller EV manufacturers still ramping up production.

Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, didn’t mince words in criticizing the proposal. Calling it “catastrophically short-sighted,” Cullen warned that pulling back on federal EV incentives would cede ground to international competitors—especially China—and could deliver a blow to domestic innovation, manufacturing, and job creation. “It’s an enormous market advantage for China at America’s expense,” she said.

This year alone, the U.S. Treasury handed out more than $2 billion in point-of-sale EV rebates, making these incentives a key part of the Biden administration’s clean energy strategy. The House proposal doesn’t completely pull the plug on all EV-related incentives. It keeps a critical battery production tax credit in place, which is vital for automakers and battery suppliers looking to expand U.S.-based operations. However, there’s a catch. Starting in 2027, vehicles with components made by certain Chinese companies or even using Chinese-licensed technology could be barred from receiving that credit. That provision could hit American automakers like Ford and Tesla, who have licensing arrangements with Chinese battery firms.

In addition to tax credits, the Republican plan also aims to dismantle a loan program that supports the development and manufacturing of advanced technology vehicles. The program has helped fund large-scale battery plant projects across the country, with billions already committed to joint ventures involving Ford, Stellantis, Samsung SDI, and Rivian. These loans were finalized during the final months of President Biden’s term and were seen as a cornerstone of the administration’s effort to supercharge America’s EV transition.

If passed, the proposal would also rescind corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and greenhouse gas rules set to take effect in 2027 and beyond. That part of the legislation is expected to be reviewed by the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks.

This push from House Republicans reflects broader political tensions around clean energy policy and federal spending. While proponents of the reform argue it’s time to let the EV market stand on its own without government intervention, critics fear the rollback could halt the progress the U.S. has made in electrifying its transportation sector. With China and the European Union accelerating their own EV investments, the decisions made in the coming months could have lasting implications for the U.S. auto industry and its competitiveness on the global stage.

Summary of Findings

While the annual review procedures for nondiscrimination laws, suspension and debarment, and single audit requirements follow statutory requirements, we found opportunities for the EPA to improve its oversight practices in the annual review steps devoted to subrecipient monitoring activities in these areas. The EPA provided CWSRF Program guidance that supported the three states that we reviewed in monitoring the subrecipients in their state CWSRF programs. The EPA could further support the states in their subrecipient monitoring activities by providing a guide of best practices for subrecipient monitoring and a best practices guide for helping equivalency subrecipients compliance.

We also made observations outside of our audit objective. The CWSRF capitalization grant terms and conditions could include a requirement that recipients and subrecipients must report violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations to the OIG.

There are 47 different Biden-era energy regulations set to be eliminated, including water pressure, air pollution, gas stoves and auto emissions.

Republican lawmakers say the new measures are driving up costs and lowering the quality of life for Americans, while Democrats say otherwise. There has not been a clear answer on what, or if, there will be any cost savings.

House Republicans killed a Democrat-backed amendment that called for a cost analysis study to find out what the average American would save under the plan. According to the Government Accountability Office, in 2024, efficiency standards saved the average American household about $576 on water and gas bills.

The GAO also reported that total energy consumption was down 6.4% and public water use dropped by 12.5%.

Some of the 47 regulations on the chopping block include fast-tracking permitting for oil and gas infrastructure by allowing companies to pay fees to win approvals, and on a household level, energy conservation standards for microwaves, water use standards for faucets and design requirements for ovens and stoves would all be rescinded.

Some experts say the rollbacks likely won’t make things cheaper and benefit consumers.

“I don’t think any of these rollbacks will have any significant short to medium term implications on the costs to the consumer,” Carolyn Kissane, associate dean at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, said. “Partially, that is because many of those appliances are already in production and they’re not going to suddenly change production or standards.”

While water standards aren’t being scrapped entirely, they are being tweaked to be more friendly towards utility companies. The limits on three different PFAS, or forever chemicals, in water are being removed and reconsidered by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA is still keeping some Biden-era water regulations in place, like what is considered an allowable amount of forever chemicals in water, but they are giving utility companies until 2031 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/TOP-Dome_121423_AP_J.-Scott-Applewhite-e1741728848268.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-14 21:04:22.009847

The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.
“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.","The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some “forever chemicals” in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and don’t easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that’s as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.

The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some “forever chemicals” in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and don’t easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that’s as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.

Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it intends to revoke and delay federal restrictions on PFAS in drinking water. Communities across the country continue to grapple with severe PFAS contamination in their drinking water, despite well-documented harms to human health caused by these toxic chemicals.

EPA intends to roll back the 2024 landmark regulations that set drinking water standards for the ‘forever chemicals’ known as GenX, PFNA, PFBS, and PFHxS. The agency also intends to delay the standards for PFOA and PFOS until 2031. Just last year, EPA determined that the standards for these 6 PFAS were necessary to protect public health and feasible to implement. EPA’s new plan would eliminate or substantially delay urgently needed protections for up to 105 million people across the country whose drinking water is contaminated with PFAS at levels exceeding the 2024 standards.

After decades of advocacy, communities harmed by PFAS contamination celebrated EPA’s 2024 standards—the first federal regulations to address widespread contamination of drinking water with PFAS. But lobbying groups for water utilities and chemical companies sued EPA to overturn the 2024 standards. That litigation is ongoing, and eight community groups represented by Earthjustice have intervened in the lawsuit to defend the 2024 standards.

“The Trump Administration’s decision to green light the continued pollution of our drinking water with toxic PFAS while crowing about their commitment to making America healthy is a sick joke,” said Earthjustice attorney Katherine O’Brien. “This is an illegal and cynical move that will needlessly perpetuate the epidemic of disease from PFAS contamination across our country.”

PFAS don’t easily break down and can persist in our bodies and the environment for decades or more. EPA has known for decades that PFAS endangers human health. The chemicals—which are found in the drinking water consumed by more than half the U.S. population—are associated with serious health harms. Research links PFAS exposure to a wide range of serious health issues, including kidney and testicular cancer, endocrine disruption, and immune system suppression.

Quotes from our clients:

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing. It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses,” said Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear in North Carolina. “This is a clear victory for the trillion-dollar chemical industry–not public health. Americans need to call their members of congress immediately and demand action.”

“As a PFAS impacted community advocate who has been engaged in federal policy since the first ever EPA PFAS listening session in New Hampshire, I am stunned at this administration’s course moving us backwards. The national water standards for six PFAS are based on the most rigorous science and the EPA is fully aware of the harm to health from drinking water exposure,” said Laurene Allen, founder of Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water and 2025 Goldman Prize winner. “We are exposed as a class, keeping the focus on two legacy PFAS ignores the immense body of toxicological evidence the EPA has accrued is a travesty. In an administration that claims they will ‘Make America Healthy Again’, today’s announcement is an insulting action that shows how reality is being manipulated for profits.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-05-14 13:14:29.385679

“You can’t shock the markets by doing it all at once,” he said of suddenly ending an array of clean energy tax incentives.","An ambitious House bill to cut taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars and pay for part of it by slashing Medicaid spending faces a rocky path in the Senate, where Republican lawmakers warn the changes to the safety net program could hurt rural hospitals and reduce benefits for their constituents.

Republican senators are also raising red flags about the House plan’s phaseout of renewable energy tax credits and what they’re calling an inadequate attempt to reduce the ballooning federal deficit.

Senate Republicans have given Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) space to put together a bill that can muster the 218 votes it needs to pass the House. But they’re warning that it’s going to get a facelift when it reaches the Senate, where Republicans who represent rural states say they will take a careful look at proposals that could throw millions of Americans off their health insurance.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said he’s fine with the new work requirements and antifraud provisions that House Republicans have proposed for Medicaid, but he raised concerns about their “cost-sharing” proposal, which he said would make “beneficiaries pay more.”

“These are working people in particular who are going to have to pay more,” he said.

He also questioned language in the House bill to limit states’ flexibility to use health care provider taxes to increase the federal share of Medicaid spending — a strategy many states use to draw more Medicaid dollars from Washington.

“The provider tax in particular, that could have a big impact in my state and lead to reduced coverage, so I’ve got some concerns. I think we need to look really, really carefully at that. I continue to maintain my position we should not be cutting Medicaid benefits,” he said.

A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the legislative proposal drafted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, found it could result in 8.6 million people losing their health care coverage.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who faces a competitive reelection race next year in a swing state, said the House proposal will need to be revised once it gets to the Senate.

He said he’s looking carefully at House language to cut Medicaid spending and phase out clean-energy tax breaks that have created new jobs in his home state.

“We’re going through some of the details today,” he said.

Tillis says he’s open to scaling back some of the health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that were increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, when federal spending exploded. But he doesn’t want to cut the federal health care safety net to below where it was before the pandemic.

“We just got to make sure that what we had pre-COVID as a safety net still exists and people have access [to health insurance] in the marketplace,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of work to do before, I think, the details are settled.”

Tillis says he wants to dig in to the projection that more than 8 million people could lose their insurance.

“We’re looking at that,” he said. “If it’s that many, we have to look at what’s happened — if that’s just the expansion population, if that’s work requirement.”

Paul Winfree, the president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative-leaning research group, said 1.4 million people who would lose coverage under the CBO’s projection are those who entered the country without authorization, another 1.2 million are currently ineligible for the program and 4.8 million are healthy adults who will decide not to work.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she’s inclined to support new work requirements for Medicaid, but she warned the House’s proposed reforms for how states use health care provider taxes to collect more federal money would hurt her home state.

“It looks like from a very quick review that the way provider taxes are treated would be very harmful to Maine’s hospitals,” she said.

Hawley also expressed concern about the House bill’s impact on rural hospitals.

“I’m worried about that,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of them close in my state, and I don’t want to see any more close.

“We’re a majority-rural state,” he said. “We are already — as it is, we are struggling with rural health care coverage. Republicans, we need to be making that better, not worse.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Senate Republicans discussed the “different proposals” in the House at their retreat last week.

“Everything’s a moving target until it stops,” she said.

She said her colleagues’ worries that the House reforms may hurt rural health care providers are valid.

“That’s why people like Josh [Hawley] and myself and others have weighed in very early … in saying that Medicaid cuts that hurt states like Alaska — that is heavily reliant on Medicaid — are not going to be acceptable,” she said. “How we navigate this is something we’re all trying to wander through.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters Tuesday that Senate Republicans are waiting to review the details of the bill the House finally passes but indicated the Senate is likely to make significant changes.

“We are coordinating very closely with our House counterparts at the committee level, at the leadership level. We know they have to get 218 votes, and so they’re going to do what it takes to get it done in the House,” he said.

Thune said his leadership team is exploring “various contingencies” about how to handle the House bill when it comes across the Capitol.

He said one option is “taking up the House bill” on the floor “and offering a Senate substitute.”

Some Republican senators are also raising concerns about the House GOP’s plan to aggressively phase out federal tax credits for clean energy investments. Advocates for solar and wind energy say it could cost thousands of American jobs.

For example, Climate Power, a nonprofit group, says $20 billion in funding from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act has helped create more than 17,000 jobs in North Carolina.

Tillis said that legislative language needs to be changed.

“We’ve got to look at it. We’ve got to probably work on some refinement, I think, to probably get most of our members on board,” he said. “We’ve got to be very judicious.

“You can’t shock the markets by doing it all at once,” he said of suddenly ending an array of clean energy tax incentives.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said she would take a close look at the House plan to terminate the 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit.

“We have a hydrogen hub, so we’ll have to look at that closely,” she said, referring to her state’s Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, which was slated to receive a $925 million award from the Department of Energy.",https://www.wjtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2025/05/hawleyjosh_030525gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-15 04:03:13.208951

Washington – Today, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was rolling back protections on PFAS in drinking water. The rules, set by the Biden administration last year, would have required the removal of six prevalent types of PFAS from drinking water systems throughout the country. Zeldin intends to rescind limits on four of those – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (known as GenX) and PFBS – while delaying the remaining two (PFOA and PFOS). The compliance deadline for the limits on PFOA and PFOS will be delayed for two years, until 2031, and a new rule will be issued that also establishes a federal exemption framework.

The announcement was made by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who has repeatedly stated support for stronger PFAS protections and even voted for the PFAS Action Act of 2021 to address PFAS contamination while serving in the U.S. House.

In response, Mary Grant, water program director at Food & Water Watch issued the following statement:

“Today’s decision is a shameful and dangerous capitulation to industry pressure that will allow continued contamination of our drinking water with toxic PFAS. This will cost lives.

“Zeldin and the Trump administration are illegally gutting basic water safety protections, blaming the cost of upgrades to comply with those important public health rules. Yet just last week the administration proposed to virtually eliminate the main source of federal funding that would help make the necessary water system improvements to protect from PFAS.

“Once again, the Trump administration has demonstrated that its priority is bending to corporate interests, not protecting the safety and wellbeing of everyday people. Nothing is safe from Trump’s greed-driven agenda — not even our drinking water.”

Known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are lab-made chemicals that have been linked to a large range of health problems including various cancers, altered hormone levels, decreased birth weights, digestive inflammation, and reduced vaccine response. New research comes out almost every day that indicates no amount is safe. It is estimated that about half of all Americans are regularly exposed to PFAS contamination through their drinking water.

Last year, after decades of community organizing, the Biden EPA finalized long-awaited protections to remove six types of PFAS from drinking water. In April 2024, the EPA set maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS of 4 ppt each; MCLs for PFHxS, PFNA and GenX at 10 ppt, and limits on a combination of four PFAS types (PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS and GenX) based on a hazard index. Utilities had five years to comply with the new limits.

Today’s decision to rollback the Biden EPA’s rules was in response to a consolidated lawsuit from water utility associations and industrial associations, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Chemistry Council and Chemours. The chemical lobby has long-fought regulations on these toxic substances, while not disclosing a growing body of evidence linking their products to serious health problems. A Food & Water Watch report found the chemical industry spent more than $110 million from 2019-2022 alone on lobbying Congress on scores of bills, including many to address the crisis of PFAS contamination throughout the country. The Trump administration has stacked the EPA with former executives and staff from the American Chemistry Council, including Nancy Beck and Lynn Ann Dekleva and lawyers like David Fotouhi, who have defended companies from PFAS pollution claims.

As a result of today’s action, the EPA is seeking to delay action to protect drinking water that will lead to the proposal of weaker protections. Although the EPA intends to defend the PFOS and PFOA regulations from court challenges, it also intends to propose a new rule this Fall and finalize it in the Spring of 2026. The Safe Drinking Water Act, however, has strong provisions barring the weakening existing drinking water regulations, so efforts to gut the existing PFAS rules should expect legal opposition. Further complicating matters, the Trump administration has issued an executive order requiring 10 rules to be tossed for every new regulation issued, making the future of any new PFAS protection uncertain.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/press_header_cleanwater_7b.png,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:21.198129

The White House’s EPA budget shows an absolute and irreverent disregard for their responsibilities to the American people.
And, let’s not forget the Clean Air Act hotline set up for companies to request presidential waivers.
Question 7 According to post-2024 election polling data, 88% of voters, including 81% of Trump voters, support maintaining or increasing EPA funding.
Congress can and should hold Administrator Zeldin accountable During this week’s hearings with Administrator Zeldin, Congress should stand up and take back the power of the purse.","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin is set to testify before Congress this week, and he should be held accountable for decimating bedrock environmental protections that keep our air clean, the water we drink safe, waterways we swim and fish in clean, and soil unpolluted, as he oversees massive staffing and budget cuts, an assault on agency science, and unprecedented loopholes for polluters.

The rhetoric from this administration that mischaracterizes core public health and environmental programs as wasteful or ideologically driven is a dangerous distortion of reality. Framing environmental protection as excessive or radical is a deliberate tactic to discredit science, weaken enforcement, and strip communities—especially frontline and low-income communities—of essential protections against pollution, climate risk, and environmental injustice.

In addition to all the harms that have already happened, now President Trump’s “skinny” budget for fiscal year 2026 proposes cutting EPA funding by a massive 54.5%, or $4.2 billion, and includes harmful, anti-science provisions such as cutting funding for state clean and drinking water programs, the hazardous substance Superfund program, and even removing air monitors at National Parks. If implemented, these cuts would represent a reckless and deeply unpopular assault on the health and safety of all Americans. Despite holding the power of the purse, Congress has thus far put up little resistance to President Trump’s overreach.

Zeldin’s unprecedented assault on the EPA’s ability to deliver on its mission is entirely designed to prop up big polluters, including fossil fuel interests—while the rest of us pay the price. The American public—across the political spectrum—support clean air, water and land. According to a 2024 post-election poll sponsored by Environmental Protection Network, 88% of all voters, and 81% of Trump voters want Congress to increase EPA funding or at least keep funding steady.

As Zeldin goes up before Congress, here’s what lawmakers could ask him.

Question one

How do you expect to protect clean air, water and lands while acquiescing to the lowest EPA funding levels since the 1980s, including steep cuts to critical environmental programs, which would inevitably put our children’s health at risk and place the burden of cleanup on future generations?

President Trump’s proposed budget will put children, seniors, and frontline workers in harm’s way, and Congress should reject it. Cutting EPA’s budget by greater than 50% will result in higher asthma rates, more contaminated water systems, and delayed cleanups of toxic sites. And from a historical perspective, these cuts would lower EPA funding to levels not seen since the early years of EPA’s history (EPA was formed under President Richard Nixon in 1970) when its statutory mandate was much narrower.

Over the past 40 years, regardless of political persuasion, presidential administrations have generally recognized EPA’s vital function and funded it accordingly. The Trump 2026 proposal constitutes an abdication of environmental governance and mocks the thoughtful, intentional, hard-fought process of setting up a system upholding public health priorities.

The White House’s EPA budget shows an absolute and irreverent disregard for their responsibilities to the American people. There’s a proposed 89 percent cut to EPA’s bipartisan water infrastructure programs. And major cuts to noncompetitive state passthrough grants.

No doubt, states will be forced to shoulder responsibilities once backed by robust federal programs, from clean water enforcement to toxic site cleanups, all while facing rising pollution, public health crises, and climate-related disasters. The result will be patchwork protections, deepening inequities, and greater risk for every community, especially those least able to absorb the blow.

Imagine the smokestack across the state line making your child’s asthma attacks worse, or your swim in the river unsafe because of water pollution from the state upstream.

Question 2

During your confirmation hearing, you promised to “defer to scientists,” yet you have repeatedly undercut science-based public health protections, distorted scientific facts and undermined scientific expertise at the EPA. How do you intend to ensure that the EPA’s actions to protect our health are guided by the best available science?

Administrator Zeldin is also seeking to undermine and eliminate scientific expertise and evidence, giving the Trump administration a way to avoid taking action to cut pollution despite the overwhelming proof of harms to people. By bypassing regulatory processes and silencing scientific expertise, the Trump administration is seeking to gut efforts to address the impacts and economic damage caused by climate change, and the impacts of toxics exposures to the American people. All to protect the profits of the oil, gas and chemical industries at our expense.

Question 3

You say the environment will be safer for all and “a cleaner planet for future generations”. How will EPA protect communities most in danger from pollution if there is no staff or budget in the environmental justice program left to help while you expend taxpayer dollars to dig up dirt for your appeals in the courts?

The EPA’s environmental justice office was created to challenge the historic pattern of pollution disproportionately harming low-income communities and communities of color. The office’s work is based on robust research that identifies communities most affected by pollution. Scientific data shows that, due to historic and ongoing injustices, communities overburdened by polluting industries, smog-forming traffic, and contaminated waterways and soil are home to predominantly low-income, Black, Brown and Indigenous people. Exposure to consistently higher levels of pollution increases the risk of asthma, heart and lung ailments, cancer and even death. Prioritizing limited public resources into the most overburdened communities is efficient governance.

EPA received $3 billion for Climate and Environmental Justice Block Grants through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and also had been given clear direction from the previous administration to more fairly distribute the benefits of environmental protections across the country. After doing their jobs of getting sorely needed money to communities, while complying with abundant government regulations on contracts and grants, employees were vilified, and their grantees were denied their rightfully executed funding agreements. Promises made were broken. Despite numerous court orders to turn IRA funding back on, Zeldin’s EPA has repeatedly denied funding, and instead terminated nearly 800 grants, all with environmental justice in the descriptions, without demonstrating mismanagement or negligence. Although an agency official stated that they did “an individualized, grant-by-grant review” to satisfy court orders, it is hard to see how that was possible.

Not only has Zeldin gone after the $3 billion IRA Climate and Environmental Justice grants, he has targeted $20 million of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. He has repeatedly alleged falsehoods and set the investigative power of government on a witch hunt to find fraud, waste and abuse. It seems that EPA and the Trump administration would rather search for evidence to support their legal appeals, while communities suffer the effects of climate change caused by the very greenhouse gases this program was designed to prevent.

Simultaneously, Zeldin’s team has announced their intent to shutter EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights (OEJECR) and regional environmental justice divisions by laying off or reorganizing staff effective July 31. This means leaving those living, working, studying, and playing near polluting industries, smog-forming traffic, and contaminated waterways and soil with little support from the very agency they rely on to enforce protective laws.

Thousands of people have been intimidated into resigning through the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) infamous “fork in the road,” terminating recent hires, suggesting all scientists be reclassified from positions with career civil service protections into ones that allow for easy removal, much like political positions (formerly known as “Schedule F”). The words of Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, about intentionally traumatizing federal workers, should set off alarm bells of our appropriators in Congress.

Once again, the Trump administration is sidelining both science and programs to assist the nation’s most overburdened people.

Question 4

Bedrock clean air and water protections are designed to take account of the latest science, but you’ve signaled your intent to scrap science-based standards and question the scope of EPA’s clear statutory obligations. Are you planning on taking EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation back to the 1970s?

The EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) leads a large share of the regulatory work of EPA, required by the Clean Air Act statute. In the 1970s the Clean Air Act covered only four chemicals, now it’s in the hundreds – not to mention the threat of climate change.

A recent study showed that rollbacks of just a subset of these regulations would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths by 2050 (think 20 sports arenas-full) and at least 10,000 asthma attacks every day. And the cost? For every dollar saved by corporate polluters, it would create six dollars of cost to the public from things like health care bills and the loss of a longer, healthier life—and that doesn’t even capture many known but difficult to quantify impacts.

The work of the OAR is being threatened through a drastic reorganization plan, which seeks to eliminate its Atmospheric Protection Program and disrupt other parts. The reorganization is planned with Zeldin on record saying there will be a focus on state air programs (a.k.a. expedited permitting of polluting projects). UCS has been tracking the administration’s deregulatory agenda, focusing on key regulations such as carbon rules for power plants and those limiting vehicle emissions.

Zeldin is also proposing to eradicate the climate-related voluntary programs, like the industry supported, popular Energy Star appliance labeling program that delivers huge benefits for consumers’ pocketbooks. He would also eliminate reporting programs for greenhouse gases.

Question 5

How do you expect businesses to navigate the unfair playing field you have created and stay competitive when some have complied with regulations and others can look for a free pass?

The EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance and all regional enforcement directors received notice in March that they should not follow any previous guidance documents, particularly where there are EJ concerns. Moreover, they have specific limitations on enforcing for example, methane releases coal ash contamination, reducing air toxics and pollution, and reducing risks of chemical accidents. The preeminence of oil and gas industry interests is laced throughout, as further detailed by my colleague Julie McNamara.

The effect? Enforcement cases have already dropped compared to prior administrations. Not only that, the President’s skinny budget would erase $1 billion in categorical (noncompetitive) grants across all 50 states, which provide the funding to enforce federal clean air, water, and waste rules.

And, let’s not forget the Clean Air Act hotline set up for companies to request presidential waivers. These waivers ensure that certain favored companies can operate outside the law.

Question 6

Can you explain how you plan on meeting EPA’s mission that demands unbiased science while cutting the Office of Research and Development’s budget and proposing to dismantle it?

EPA’s Research and Development Office produces independent science that’s used to keep people safe from pollution and chemical exposure. Industry doesn’t always like what’s coming out of this office. Dismantling this office by cutting its budget by $235 million and planning to remove more than 1,000 staff is a dangerous move during a period of intensifying environmental threats, wildfires, flooding, and other climate change impacts.

UCS has pointed out the threats to human health and the environment from the loss of a one-of-its-kind program, the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which provides independent reviews of chemicals like formaldehyde or ethylene oxide tied to certain health effects, like cancer. IRIS assessments are known to be a gold standard in toxicity reviews. Read this fact sheet for more information.

Question 7

According to post-2024 election polling data, 88% of voters, including 81% of Trump voters, support maintaining or increasing EPA funding. So, who exactly is served by these cuts, and why are you ignoring the public’s clear demand for stronger environmental protections?

If Administrator Zeldin goes forward with this destructive move, he will be responsible for ending decades of work intended to help set right the harmful legacy of pollution in overburdened communities in a handout to big polluters. This is also part of the Trump administration’s larger ongoing strategy to dismantle EPA and its core functions and undermine its very mission, which is to help keep all people in America safe.

Congress can and should hold Administrator Zeldin accountable

During this week’s hearings with Administrator Zeldin, Congress should stand up and take back the power of the purse. Congress must see the proposed budget for the sham that it is and hold Zeldin accountable for his promises to protect public health and the environment during his confirmation hearings. Members of Congress must show Zeldin they understand—even if he’s forgotten— the importance of EPA as a longstanding investment in our health and safety, and see through the ruse of “fiscal responsibility” and “streamlining” as just code words to gut the agency. The administration knows, and history shows, that industry will not regulate itself.

We urge lawmakers to reject these shortsighted and harmful reductions, restore critical EPA funding, and reaffirm the federal commitment to public health, environmental justice, and scientific integrity. If they don’t act, under Zeldin’s watch, the very mission of the agency will be subverted—from protecting public health, environmental justice and scientific integrity to becoming an instrument of unchecked polluting industry interests. The cost of inaction will be measured in lives, livelihoods, and long-term environmental damage.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-Blog-Lead-Image-Template192.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:25.633480

The U.S. EPA will roll back significant parts of the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation by rescinding four of the six chemicals named in the regulation.

The agency announced on Wednesday it will rescind and “reconsider” regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS and HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX. EPA says it plans to keep regulations for two other chemicals in the standard: PFOA and PFOS.

The announcement rolls back major parts of the drinking water rule set under the Biden administration last April, which set legally enforceable limits for the six types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in drinking water. The EPA has said PFAS exposure can cause numerous health problems.

The drinking water rules have become the default standard for treating a range of wastewater categories. The standards are relevant to waste facility operators because of how the rules might affect leachate management and groundwater monitoring efforts, as well as how these facilities interact with wastewater treatment facilities. The regulations also represent business opportunities for waste companies that service industrial clients.

The EPA now plans to extend compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS, saying it would give drinking water system operators more time to develop plans for complying with maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for the two chemicals.

The agency is planning a new rulemaking process to propose extending that compliance date from 2029 to 2031. EPA said it may issue the proposed rule sometime this fall and finalize the rule in spring of 2026.

As part of the drinking water standard review, EPA says it will also step up its outreach to water utilities, especially in rural and small communities and those that need capital improvements to be able to reduce PFOS and PFOA levels to the current MCL.

The new initiative, dubbed the PFAS Outreach Initiative, aims to offer “resources, tools, funding, and technical assistance to help utilities meet the federal drinking water standards,” it said. The agency also acknowledged that it sees these utilities as “passive receivers"" of PFAS, a term waste industry groups also say applies to their operations. Administrator Lee Zeldin has said he believes the EPA should support a “polluter pays” model that helps passive receivers avoid major costs to treating or mitigating PFAS at their facilities.

That move comes weeks after Zeldin told reporters he was reviewing concerns from water utilities and lawmakers about how to meet the upcoming compliance deadlines.

The agency also noted it would work toward building a “federal exemption framework,” but it’s unclear what the framework would entail or who would be eligible.

The EPA also continues to face litigation over the drinking water rules. The American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies sued the agency last year, saying the EPA did not use the most up-to-date data when crafting the standard and raised questions over whether the rule was consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. That case is expected to be back in court in a few weeks after the EPA requested an abeyance on Monday.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/0FQTQPHeP4q8fiP2vjk5ZH8U3TgXdqKSJO1MRVWhQEI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTY3MDM4NzIzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:29.032101

What You Need To Know

The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of so-called forever chemicals in drinking water

The agency, however, will keep limits on the two most common types, called PFOA and PFOS, although it will offer a two-year deadline extension for utilities to comply

They now have until 2031

The agency says the changes will help protect Americans while giving water systems common sense flexibility

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that’s as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.

Commonly called ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS are found nearly everywhere — in air, water, and soil — and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply and treat for the chemicals.

""We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

""With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,"" Olson said.

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications — among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.

Biden Jr. had, for the first time, required water utilities to start bringing down levels of six types of PFAS chemicals to near zero.
The Trump administration said it would uphold the limits for those two types of PFAS, but would delay a deadline for water utilities to meet those limits by two years, to 2031.
Government studies of private wells and public water systems have detected PFAS chemicals in nearly half the tap water in the country.
Under the Biden-era rules, water utilities were required to monitor their water supplies for PFAS chemicals.
“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.","The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it would uphold drinking water standards for two harmful “forever chemicals,” present in the tap water of millions of Americans. But it said it would delay deadlines to meet those standards and roll back limits on four other related chemicals.

Known as forever chemicals because of their virtually indestructible nature, PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals used widely in everyday products like nonstick cookware, water-repellent clothing and stain-resistant carpets, as well as in firefighting foams.

Exposure to PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, has been associated with metabolic disorders, decreased fertility in women, developmental delays in children and increased risk of some prostate, kidney and testicular cancers, according to the E.P.A.

President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had, for the first time, required water utilities to start bringing down levels of six types of PFAS chemicals to near zero. He set a particularly stringent limit of four parts per trillion for two of those chemicals, called PFOA and PFOS, which are most commonly found in drinking water systems.

The Trump administration said it would uphold the limits for those two types of PFAS, but would delay a deadline for water utilities to meet those limits by two years, to 2031.

The E.P.A. said it would rescind the limits for the other four chemicals.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. “At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” he said. “EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.”

The move to weaken some PFAS limits came after trade groups representing the chemicals industry, as well as water utilities, had challenged the Biden-era limits, saying they created an impossible standard that would cost municipal water agencies billions of dollars to meet.

The chemicals are so ubiquitous that they can be found in the blood of almost every person in the United States. Government studies of private wells and public water systems have detected PFAS chemicals in nearly half the tap water in the country.

Under the Biden-era rules, water utilities were required to monitor their water supplies for PFAS chemicals. And they were required to notify the public, and work to bring contamination levels down, if levels exceeded set thresholds: four parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS, and 10 parts per trillion for four others.

Those four chemicals include GenX, once thought to be a safer alternative to PFOA, but which has now been linked in animal studies to damage to the liver, kidneys and immune system, as well as to developmental problems and cancer. The others are PFHxS and PFNA, as well as PFBS, a mixture of the chemicals, which have also all been linked to adverse health effects.

The agency said it planned to begin a new rule-making process for the four chemicals in the fall, and to issue the new rule next spring.

The administration’s plans were first reported by The Washington Post.

Health and environmental advocates criticized the move.

“This is a clear victory for the trillion-dollar chemical industry, not public health,” said Emily Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, an environmental group that has been working to address GenX and PFAS contamination of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said. “It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses.”

Erik D. Olson, senior strategic director for health at Natural Resources Defense Council, said the E.P.A.’s plan offered “modest consolation.”

But he also said the agency’s effort to roll back drinking water standards violated a no-backsliding provision included in the Safe Drinking Water Act.

“The law is very clear that the E.P.A. can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” he said. “This action is not only harmful, it’s illegal.”

Industry groups suing the agency over the Biden-era PFAS rules — including the American Water Works Association, the American Chemistry Council and the National Association of Manufacturers — did not immediately provide comment.

But in a statement accompanying the E.P.A.’s announcement, Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, said he supported the Trump administration’s approach. The association represents drinking water program administrators in 50 states.

Mr. Roberson said states and water systems had been “struggling with the time frames” under the Biden-era rules to test for PFAS and build the necessary filtration infrastructure to start ridding drinking water supplies of the chemicals.

The moves came just weeks after Mr. Zeldin announced a spate of measures to tackle PFAS contamination, including designating an official to lead the agency’s efforts on the chemicals.

The agency said it would also create guidelines for how much PFAS factories could release in their wastewater, and engage with Congress to come up with ways to hold polluters responsible.

Mr. Trump and the White House have also weighed in on the health harms of PFAS, albeit in a document outlining a strategy to rid the country of paper straws.

Maintaining the stringent limits for PFOA and PFOS was still expected to translate to a significant cost burden for water utilities. The E.P.A. had estimated that it would cost utilities about $1.5 billion annually to comply with the rule. Utilities had said that the costs could be twice that amount, and that the public would ultimately foot the bill in the form of increased water rates.

James L. Ferraro, an environmental attorney who represents several water utilities, said the Trump administration’s approach, while representing a compromise, was “not one utilities were necessarily hoping for.”

PFOA and PFOS, for which E.P.A. maintained strict limits, “are by far the most commonly detected, owing to their decades-long, widespread use” and cleaning them up “remains a serious challenge for many utilities,” he said.

Many environmental groups say that the costs of cleaning up PFAS should ultimately be borne by the manufacturers of the chemicals. They point to how chemical companies for decades hid evidence of the dangers of PFAS, according to lawsuits, industry documents and peer-reviewed studies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14cli-epa-pfas-hcjw/14cli-epa-pfas-hcjw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:53.742925

v. EPA - Court Documents Water Utility Groups Seek to Dismantle Public Health Protections - Blog Toxic Drinking Water: The PFAS Contamination Crisis - Factsheet","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced plans to repeal health standards for four of six toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” found in drinking water and to delay implementation of the remaining two standards, reversing course on a crucial public health rule adopted last year.

About half of the U.S. population is drinking PFAS-contaminated water, including as many as 105 million whose water violates the new standards, and the EPA has known for decades that PFAS endangers human health, including kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.

The EPA restricted six PFAS chemicals in April 2024, the first time the agency issued a final rule on its own initiative for unregulated contaminants in tap water in 28 years. The chemical industry, which manufactures these forever chemicals that pollute the nation’s water, sued to block the rule; water utility trade associations, which are responsible for protecting their customers’ health from toxic chemicals in tap water, joined the chemical industry to challenge the PFAS rule. NRDC and its allies are intervenors in that litigation, seeking to protect the standards. The groups are expected to oppose the EPA’s new action, which is unlawful under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding” provision, which says the agency cannot legally weaken these rules.

The following are reactions from Erik D. Olson, senior strategic director of health at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), and Dr. Anna Reade, director of PFAS advocacy at NRDC:

“With a stroke of the pen, the EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans. More than 100 million people are drinking water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ which can cause cancer, harm fetuses and kids, and pose other health hazards. But now the administration is going to toss out most of these long-sought protections and allow this contamination to continue unabated all at the behest of the chemical industry and water utilities. With this action, the EPA is making clear that it’s willing to ignore Americans who just want to turn on their kitchen taps and have clean, safe water. The EPA’s plan to retain but delay standards for two legacy 'forever chemicals' may offer modest consolation to some, but throwing out protections against four others will be devastating. The law is very clear that the EPA can't repeal or weaken the drinking water standard. This action is not only harmful, it’s illegal,"" said Olson.

“The federal government knows toxic ‘forever chemicals’ are dangerous to our health and it’s well established that drinking water is a major route of exposure to PFAS for many people. The PFAS crisis is immense, and we need more action, not less, to protect people from this extraordinary environmental and public health threat,” said Reade.

Background:

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are widely used in an array of consumer, commercial, and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. Also known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are extremely persistent in the environment and can accumulate in humans or animals. PFAS exposure is linked to many negative health effects at extremely low levels of exposure, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, changes in hormone and lipid levels, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.

After decades of advocacy on the part of environmental and public health advocates, the EPA proposed in March 2023 to regulate six PFAS chemicals in drinking water. In April 2024, the agency concluded there is no safe level of PFOA or PFOS exposure, and the final rule covered six PFAS chemicals in total, and set individual limits for five PFAS chemicals and a limit on mixtures of four PFAS chemicals. The rule also requires water systems to monitor for the six regulated PFAS chemicals and publicly communicate their compliance with the new limits, while giving them the law’s maximum compliance time of five years to comply by April 2029. The rule is a long overdue step to address a public health crisis that threatens millions of people nationwide.

The EPA reportedly plans to repeal four of the six PFAS drinking water standards—those for GenX (the forever chemical that contaminates the drinking water source of 500,000 people in North Carolina), as well as for PFHxS, PFNA, and the hazard index, which includes PFBS. The agency says it plans to extend the compliance deadline for the other two legacy PFAS covered by the rules (PFOA and PFOS) by 2 years from 2029 to 2031.

The policy proposals were in line with past statements, and hewed closely to Trump's efforts during his presidency to encourage industrial and fossil fuel projects and cut regulations.

In response, James Singer, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said Trump wants to sell out America's energy future to Big Oil executives and that under Biden and Harris, ""American energy of all kinds has hit record production levels, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new jobs for American workers because of her leadership.""

""Trump's proposals would raise prices on consumers, pollute our air and water, and take us backwards,"" Singer said.

During Biden's presidency, U.S. oil and gas production hit the highest levels of any country ever, despite his administration's broader efforts to transition to cleaner energy. Congress passed in 2022 Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which contains hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for clean energy such as wind, solar, hydrogen, geothermal projects.

No Republicans voted for the IRA, and some in the party have introduced legislation to repeal parts of the bill.

When asked whether Trump would support the repeal of parts of the IRA, Corey Lewandowski, a Trump campaign adviser, avoided the question.

Bernhardt also said that Trump ""will put coal country back to work so that all Americans have access to affordable energy,"" without elaborating on how those workers would be put to work.

Despite Trump's promises to revive the coal industry during his administration, employment in the industry fell as power generators turned to plentiful natural gas and renewable energy.

In April, Biden's Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules targeting carbon, air and water pollution from power plants, an industry responsible for nearly 25 percent of U.S. carbon emissions. The rules will effectively require coal-fired power plants and new natural gas-fired generators in the coming decade to capture emissions before they reach the atmosphere.

Bernhardt said Trump would ""modernize"" the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed approvals for new nuclear plants and for existing ones to have their lives extended.

""There's been legislation to address some of these issues, but there's a long way to go,"" Bernhardt said.

Biden signed legislation in July to reform the agency to help speed approvals, and his administration has sought to encourage new projects, restart shuttered plants, and delay scheduled nuclear reactor retirements.",https://storage.googleapis.com/niauploadsfile/17249931322024-08-29T204309Z_3_LYNXMPEK7S0U0_RTROPTP_4_USA-COAL-LABS_11zon.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:01:43.542306

Wes Moore (D) signed what he called “the most comprehensive piece of Chesapeake Bay legislation that Maryland has seen in years,” at a time when federal cuts threaten environmental programs for the estuary.

The Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act was signed Tuesday, one of 171 bills signed into law at the fourth and next-to-last bill signing ceremony following the 2025 legislative session.

The wide-ranging Legacy Act allots “up to $900,000 per year” to a new certification program for farmers who use sustainable practices that decrease runoff into the bay, establishes a water quality monitoring program to unify current testing efforts and aims to streamline oyster aquaculture leasing, among other provisions.

“At a time when we see how our federal administration has stepped back from protecting our air and our water, Maryland is stepping up,” Moore said.

The governor also signed an abortion grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals, and a bill allowing individuals with autism and other nonapparent conditions to add an identifying symbol to their state IDs. That, and Tuesday saw the approval of a new state mineral, chromite, and a new state cocktail, the Orange Crush.

Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act

President Donald Trump (R) and his Department of Government Efficiency have already cut positions at the Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the bay cleanup, as well as at agencies whose work touches the bay, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DOGE also threw environmental grant programs into chaos by freezing funds, some of which were later unlocked.

But advocates say Trump’s proposed “skinny” budget for fiscal 2026 would go considerably further, and “devastate” efforts to clean up the estuary, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.

A ‘chrometastic’ finish for one state symbol bill

The bill would hack $5 billion from the EPA, including $2.46 billion in cuts that would “cripple” programs that help sewage treatment plants reduce pollution into waterways like the bay, according to CBF. Trump’s proposal would also slash $1.3 billion in grants and research programs at NOAA and $564 million at the U.S. Geological Survey, eliminating climate-related work to “focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals.”

Allison Colden, the bay foundation’s Maryland executive director, said the federal losses make Maryland’s Bay Legacy law even more important.

“With federal cuts and rollbacks looming heavily on our state, Maryland’s environmental leadership is more important than ever,” Colden said in a statement. “This Act will help maintain forward momentum and ensure that investments in clean air, clean water, habitats, and local economies are secured.”

The new law came in a challenging budget year, during which lawmakers had to correct a multibillion-dollar deficit by cutting programs and raising fees.

As drafted, the bill would have allocated $2 million to the Leaders in Environmentally Engaged Farming, or LEEF, program, but budget-conscious lawmakers cut that to “up to $900,000” a year. The budget reconciliation process further reduced the sum to $500,000 for next fiscal year, with some of that money contingent on the Maryland Department of Agriculture submitting a plan for program spending.

“Unfortunately, we saw less coming out of the state budget for that program than maybe we would have liked to see,” Colden said. “But the point is, we have that program established. They have some initial seed funding.”

With funding and other incentives, Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said the LEEF program will encourage farmers not only to pursue environmentally friendly practices, but to engage the community and share information about the practices with others.

“It incentivizes them in a way that we believe farmers and the community will rally behind and will make extra progress,” Atticks said.

As he signed the bill, Moore was backed by Nia Nyamweya, who brought a basket of leafy greens harvested from her Beauty Bloom Farms in Montgomery County. The produce and flower farm aims to regenerate the soils, formerly used for corn and soybean farming, with organic practices and cover cropping, according to its website.

Nyamweya leases her farm land from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Moore said. The bill codifies the practice in state law.

“That kind of partnership is rare, but the Bay Legacy Act will make these kinds of lease agreements easier,” Moore said.

The bill drew some early concerns for its massive scope, touching on everything from agricultural practices to a Japanese fish processing technique called ikejime. Delmarva Fisheries Association Chairman Robert Newberry called it “an ag bill with a side salad of fishery management and aquaculture.”

He initially balked at a provision that would have removed DNR’s obligation to produce its own fishery management plans for a variety of species, from white perch and blue crabs to croakers and horseshoe crabs, deferring to plans created by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.

The final law requires DNR to keep producing state-level plans for blue crabs, oysters, white and yellow perch, and a few other species, but it lifts the requirement for others, such as menhaden, spot and black sea bass.

In the end, Newberry supported the Bay Legacy bill. In particular, he appreciated an amendment that added specificity to an existing law preventing discrimination against groups of fishermen, adding fishing guides and charter boat captains.

Newberry has been among a group of fisherman fighting rules from the Atlantic States Commission limiting charters to one rockfish per person, beginning last year.

“I wanted to have the fisheries specifically defined,” Newberry said. “So that protects us.”

Abortion grant program

Maryland will also have a new grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals using a stockpile of unused premium surcharges, now that Moore signed House Bill 930 and Senate Bill 848 into law.

State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill

“Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,” Moore said.

The legislation prompts the Department of Health to tap into about $25 million in premium surcharges that were required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not yet been spent down.

That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million annually as collections have outpaced need.

Moore said the legislation builds off previous efforts to expand abortion access in the state, calling it the “next chapter in our work to protect and defend basic health care rights.”

Eric’s ID

Moore also signed legislation known as “Eric’s ID Law” that will let people with nonapparent disabilities, including autism, have a butterfly icon added to their driver’s licenses, to alert police officers and other officials that they are interacting with someone with a disability that may not be immediately visible.

Lt. Gov Aruna Miller noted that the “thoughtful and compassionate initiative” was inspired by Eric Carpenter-Grantham, a 20-year-old Montgomery County resident with autism, one of the nonapparent disabilities identified in House Bill 707 and Senate Bill 618.

Eric’s Law has been in the works for several years, in collaboration with members of the disability community, finally receiving House and Senate approval this past session, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) noted.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0197-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-05-14 12:23:44.073024

Rachel Frazin reports for The Hill.

In short:

Political officials at the EPA have reportedly told scientists to apply for newly posted jobs or risk termination, part of a broad restructuring under the Trump administration.

Internal communications suggest lab research in the Office of Research and Development may halt due to a lack of supplies, though the EPA disputes those claims and says research is ongoing.

The agency aims to cut its workforce by thousands and shift research responsibilities to regulatory offices, sparking concerns about the loss of scientific independence and institutional knowledge.

Key quote:

“Without the evolution of the science …we would see a difference that EPA will do less to protect public health and the environment.”

— Chris Frey, former head of the Office of Research and Development under the Biden administration

Why this matters:

The future of environmental science at the federal level looks increasingly precarious. The Environmental Protection Agency's research arm plays a pivotal role in assessing the health impacts of air and water pollution, chemical exposures, and climate change. Independent, peer-reviewed science underpins the EPA’s regulations, from setting safe drinking water standards to determining which pesticides stay on the market. The downsizing of labs and loss of expert staff would come as the U.S. faces mounting public health challenges from toxic chemicals, extreme weather, and industrial pollution.

The former government pledged to invest $370 billion (€330 billion) over the next decade to boost clean energy technology and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The impact of tariffs on the renewable sector But it is in contrast to the beliefs of the new president.","US President Donald Trump has long made his thoughts on wind energy known. But in a recent speech in Michigan marking his first 100 days in office, he made it plainer than ever before.

Commenting on his support of coal-fired power plants, he added: ""You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round.""

It marks the latest in a number of attacks the president has made on the clean energy industry since entering the White House — with much of that focused on wind.

On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order halting permits for onshore wind energy projects and leases for offshore wind farms in US coastal waters.

It's taken a toll on forecasts for the sector, with a recent Bloomberg NEF report projecting lower growth by the middle of the next decade, ""reflecting the administration's actions on permitting and seabed leases"".

It has investors and those working in the sector worried, says Hannah Hess, associate director on energy and climate at independent research provider the Rhodium Group.

""When you're seeing hostility towards a certain type of clean technology from the administration, understandably the people who are developing both wind projects and the manufacturing of components like blades and towers are deciding that maybe now is not the right time to build one of these facilities in the US,"" she said.

And that's despite the incentives currently in place through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), she added.

The clean energy boom in the US

Clean energy in the US has grown significantly in recent years. In 2024, more than 90% of new energy capacity came from wind, solar and battery storage, a figure that was boosted by investment through the IRA.

Passed in 2022, under the administration of then-President Joe Biden, it was the biggest climate investment in US history. The former government pledged to invest $370 billion (€330 billion) over the next decade to boost clean energy technology and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""That was a really exciting point of growth to see, and I think part of that is that the costs have just come down for these clean tech generators,"" said Leslie Abrahams, deputy director of the Energy Security and Climate Change program at the nonprofit policy research organization Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""Part of that has been from the IRA tax credits,"" she added.

Overall, renewables now account for more than 20% of electricity generation in the US, with wind making up almost half of that. And while it took 40 years to build capacity for utility-scale clean power to 200GW, another 100GW was added in just three years, marking a ""dramatic acceleration"", according to report from clean energy industry body the American Clean Power Association.

As demand for electricity in the US grows for the first time in more than a decade, reflecting the needs for data centers, and expanding manufacturing sector and increasing electrification for electric vehicles, for example, more power than ever is needed, say analysts.

""We are really trying to get ahead of that problem and make sure that we have enough generation capacity on the grid and the manufacturing side,"" said Abrahams, adding that she believes clean energy is the key.

""Clean energy is the fastest to get online,"" she said.

The impact of tariffs on the renewable sector

But it is in contrast to the beliefs of the new president. Even on the campaign trail, Trump promised more investment in fossil fuels, proclaiming his now-infamous slogan to ""drill, baby, drill"".

Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to stop funding already approved for green energy projects and threatened to repeal parts of the IRA.

In early April, the president proposed tariffs that in the long run could also have an impact on the clean energy industry — particularly those targeting Southeast Asia, a region where countries are facing some of the highest figures.

""Tariffs on Southeast Asia would have a quite dramatic impact on solar, in particular in the US, because some of those earlier-stage components that are critical inputs to our already quite developed solar module manufacturing sector would now be subject to high tariffs,"" said Hess from Rhodium.

""There isn't one clean energy that doesn't rely on imports,"" added Abrahams.

If put in place, the tariffs could mean companies developing renewables — but also natural gas, for example — end up paying much higher prices, and that could have a trickle-down effect, said Abrahams.

""My concern is that that's going to get passed on ultimately to the customers, to the ratepayers, at a time when affordability is a key issue in electricity,"" she said.

Although the president has since put the brakes on many of the tariffs for 90 days, that, along with the funding freezes and anti-renewables rhetoric, is ""injecting uncertainty into the future trajectory of the place for clean tech in the United States,"" she added.

In the first quarter of this year, before Trump had made his initial tariff announcements, six clean energy projects, representing $6.9 billion (€6.2 billion) of investment, were cancelled, according to Rhodium's Clean Investment Monitor, ""the highest quarterly value on record"".

The situation is ""nuanced,"" says Hess, adding there had also been a high number of new manufacturing projects announced, up from the last quarter of 2024, but lower than the same period last year.

""The uptick in new announcements, coupled with significant cancellations, highlights both the progress achieved under the IRA and the risks posed by an unstable policy environment,"" reads the Rhodium report.

Clean energy will continue to grow, but at a slower pace

Despite the headwinds facing the clean energy industry in the US, the consensus is that the sector will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Experts at Bloomberg NEF's New Energy Outlook predict that wind capacity will double by 2035 and solar will triple, while battery storage will increase from 29GW in 2024 to 175GW.

Still, the US will have to compete globally as countries all over the world move away from fossil fuels and look to cleaner energy sources.

""Ultimately, I think there's so much momentum behind clean tech right now. It's not just about climate, it's really about economic competitiveness, geopolitical leverage and national security,"" said Abrahams.

She added that if the US continued to isolate itself, the sector would push ahead without US involvement.",https://static.dw.com/image/72532268_6.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:07:44.850367

The next is due in 2027, but with the authors dismissed, the status of it is uncertain. That will make it harder for Georgia leaders, Knox said, because the climate assessment highlights the most critical threats to the region.

“If we don’t have good information about that, it’s very difficult to respond to what’s likely to be occurring,” she said. “If you can’t respond, you’re going to have more economic losses.”

Other recent changes and cuts concerned Knox as well.

Regional Climate Centers that provide key information about past weather to everyone from farmers to electric companies to historians briefly went offline last month due to a lapse in their federal funding; Knox co-authored an op-ed advocating for their restoration.

Databases full of information on ocean currents, estuaries and the Earth’s geology are becoming harder to access. Fewer weather balloons are going up. NOAA has announced it will no longer be updating its database of weather and climate disasters that cause at least $1 billion in damage, an important tool for contextualizing storm damage and showing how it has increased over time.

Knox said changes like this will make things harder, both for researchers and for forecasters at the National Weather Service.

“It’s not like they’re going to go away, but they’re just going to be hampered in their ability to do the best job that they could,” she said of NWS forecasters.

Further cuts to NOAA, the agency that houses the Weather Service, and other federal departments could be coming if Congress follows the changes laid out in the recent White House budget request.

Clark Alexander, director of the University of Georgia’s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, said the proposed cuts to the National Science Foundation would harm the research done at institutions like UGA and Georgia Tech.

The cuts would defund much of the “curiosity-driven research that doesn’t necessarily have a payoff tomorrow but may form the building blocks for great advances that might occur over the next decade or so,” Alexander said.

Some of the proposed cuts to NOAA, meanwhile, would hit closer to home for Georgia’s coastal economy, particularly the Sea Grant program.

“The Georgia Sea Grant program has been the driving force behind developing aquaculture in our state,” Alexander said, pointing to the state’s burgeoning homegrown oyster industry. “They’ve also worked with shrimpers. They’ve worked with people that work on the water in a variety of different ways.”

NOAA is involved in life and research on the Georgia coast in many other ways, too, including management of the Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary and the annual effort to track North Atlantic right whales giving birth offshore.

The agency did not respond to a request for comment, but has previously said it remains committed to providing timely information, research, and resources. The White House did not respond to questions from NPR about the National Climate Assessment.

This budget is just a proposal and still has to go through Congress, though federal research funding is already facing other cutbacks and changes, including a recently-announced change in funding for indirect expenses like laboratory maintenance that Alexander said could severely hamper researchers’ ability to pay for their work. That and many other cuts are likely to be challenged in court – likely a lengthy process.

In the meantime, Alexander said, the disruption could have long-term impacts both for the public’s understanding of science and for the new researchers and policymakers just entering their fields.

“In some ways we are slowing down the development and the training and the handing off of management and research to a new generation by cutting all these programs,” he said.",https://thecurrentga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7518-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:09:39.127063

Meanwhile, in Vermont on Tuesday morning, a state program funded by that very law announced more than $22 million of the state’s total grant of $62.5 million would go to help install solar power on low-income housing in the state.

“Currently towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner for the Department of Public Service, which controls the state’s grant, said in a statement. “That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

The funding is part of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion national initiative to lower the cost of electricity by installing solar on buildings and developing solar arrays in communities. Across the country, the program could pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.

Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But funding for the solar program has been under threat before by the Trump administration, and it could be under threat again as the Republican-dominated Congress moves to axe programs from the IRA to achieve the multi-trillion-dollar budget President Trump is calling “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”

On Sunday, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee proposed to meet the budget goals by repealing grants from a $27 billion IRA program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aims to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs in that fund is the Solar for All program.

“Donald Trump campaigned on lowering electric bills for working Americans. As president, he’s doing exactly the opposite,” Sanders said in an email Tuesday. “The disastrous reconciliation bill being pushed by Trump and Congressional Republicans would not only make electric bills more expensive for Vermonters, it would make the climate crisis worse.”

Sanders said the good news was that the budget bill couldn’t legally rescind Vermont’s $62.5 million grant that was allocated to the Vermont Department of Public Service.

“The bad news is that Trump does not respect the Constitution or rule of law,” Sanders said. “I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Solar for All funding is deployed to lower electric bills, slash carbon emissions, and create thousands of good jobs.”

The road to how the federal government got to this massive repeal process began in January, when Trump took office and issued a flurry of executive orders. Those included Unleashing American Energy, which called for a 90-day freeze on IRA funds. A letter sent a week later by the EPA notified Solar for All recipients that the hundred of millions of dollars they’d received so far was paused until further notice. Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.

“While the federal funding landscape is dynamic, we have a binding agreement with EPA and the funding is obligated,” said Randy Brittingham, grant program manager at the state energy office for the Vermont Department of Public Service, in an email. After a pause in communication and access to funds this winter, Brittingham said the state is back in regular contact with the EPA. “We’ve successfully drawn funding for this program since that February pause,” he said.

But Lee Zeldin, the new EPA administrator, has gone further since February, claiming in March that President Joe Biden’s administration had doled out billions of dollars that were vulnerable to “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Zeldin tried to claw back $20 billion from the two other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and while caught up in court battles, those funds largely remain frozen. While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General. The audit is ongoing, according to Kim Wheeler, director of strategic communications for that office.

“Solar for All was selected because it is a $7 billion program with a financing structure that is new and different for the EPA, with $25 million already spent,” Wheeler said in an email on Tuesday. She did not respond by the time of publication to a question about whether the EPA considers only $25 million of the program obligated.

While Wheeler said her office doesn’t have the authority to make or revoke funding decisions, if her office found an issue with an award during an investigation, it could make recommendations to the EPA.

“If we identified an issue during an audit (such as the project you are asking about), we could recommend that the Agency evaluate whether to suspend payment or terminate the award,” Wheeler said of the Solar for All program.

Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded this week to the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing, to make solar more accessible for low-income households.

These funds – called Multi Family Affordable Housing – will be awarded to new developers for affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefitting renters. Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.

“We know that renters have been very underserved by solar resources in the past, so it’s exciting for us as a housing funder to help developers successfully electrify their buildings and rely less on fossil fuels,” said Mia Watson, special programs manager for the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, who is supporting the Solar for All award.

Tenants who have an electric bill could see at least 20% in bill savings and tenants without an electric bill would receive an equivalent benefit, Brittingham said. He added that all residents would benefit from the climate impacts of growing Vermont’s solar generation.

Residents and developers can attend public outreach sessions hosted by the finance agency in the coming months. The finance agency in partnership with the state will submit a work plan for EPA approval by December. They expect to award funds to developers early next year.

“We’re still cautious about what may happen at the federal level, but so far the indications we have are good that this program is going to happen,” Watson said. “We’ve had strong support from the state and our congressional delegation, especially Sen. Sanders, but I think everyone involved is a little concerned that things could change unexpectedly.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/solar-for-all-1-20230628.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 09:03:29.635630

It explains: “The House Committee on Energy and Commerce laid out a proposal, which will be voted on on Tuesday, that would raise $6.5bn from the repeal of climate-related parts of the Biden administration’s massive Inflation Reduction Act legislation.” The newswire adds: “The House Ways and Means panel, meanwhile, proposed the phase-out or cancellation of several lucrative tax credits from former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, including ending a consumer-facing credit for electric vehicle purchases and a tax credit for home energy efficiency improvements, and the phase out of various key clean energy subsidies for expiry by 2031, according to a document it released on Monday.” The Hill reports: “[The proposed legislation] claws back numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs, including hotly contested ‘green bank’ funding, a $20bn programme that gave money to financing institutions so they can support climate-friendly projects. Other EPA programs targeted include a ‘methane fee’ that charges oil and gas companies for excess emissions during production, as well as programs that seek to provide monitoring outside of polluting facilities and address air pollution at schools. It also repeals a $3bn grant program that funds efforts that seek to reduce air pollution and planet-warming emissions in disadvantaged communities. In addition, the text repeals Biden-era rules expected to push the market toward electric vehicles.” E&E News says that the plans “threaten to increase carbon pollution by making it easier to build natural gas power plants and sustain some coal facilities”. Separately, the outlet reports that the legislation “would affect the Department of Energy’s loans program office, EPA’s greenhouse reduction fund and many other climate law initiatives”. Heatmap says the proposals would “effectively kill the Inflation Reduction Act”. Bloomberg says the proposal “may not be as bad for producers of clean electricity from sources such as solar and wind, who feared a more aggressive phase out”. Meanwhile, the Hill reports that “political leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have told scientists there to apply to new jobs, implying that those who do not may be fired, according to an official with a union representing the agency’s employees”.

In other US news, Reuters says that developer Equinor has “warned that it will cancel the Empire Wind facility off the coast of New York if it cannot in the coming days reach a resolution over a month-old stop-work order issued by the Trump administration”. Bloomberg also covers the news. Separately, Bloomberg reports that “clean-tech companies that were eligible for support under former President Joe Biden are now considering leaving the US as the Trump administration pulls the plug on financing, according to the former head of the program that vetted the firms”. E&E News reports that “Hawaii lawmakers are encouraging insurance companies to sue the oil and gas industry for climate damages”. This is a “first-of-its-kind state resolution – which supporters hope can be replicated elsewhere”, according to the outlet. Elsewhere, Semafor says: “A Silicon Valley weather startup will soon begin replacing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather balloons with AI-powered alternatives, a cost-cutting measure brought on by severe budget cuts carried out by the Trump administration.” Reuters quotes former head of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, who says that “US companies may not be putting their hands up, but they are still investing in clean energy”. Yale Climate Connections asks: “Can states and cities lead on climate under Trump?”

Solar and wind power projects now account for 59% of China’s energy investments in Africa, according to a new report by UK-based thinktank ODI Global, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) says. The research also finds that “one-fifth of China’s overall energy sector and also a fifth of renewable energy investment and construction activity had taken place in Africa, amounting to $66bn between 2010 and 2024”, the outlet adds. The Communist party-affiliated newspaper People’s Daily reports that South African policymakers travelled to China to discuss “large-scale renewable energy integration”, “advanced clean coal technologies” and “sophisticated grid management”. Chinese president Xi Jinping said in a speech at the China-CELAC [Community of Latin American and Caribbean States] Forum in Beijing that “China would also provide 66bn yuan ($9bn) in credit” to the region and pledged to expand cooperation in “clean energy”, SCMP reports. Electricity news outlet Dianlian Xinmei says that, in the years ahead, countries included in the Belt and Road Initiative have “tremendous potential for renewable energy development”, adding there is “broad space” for Chinese companies to participate in energy-related projects.

Meanwhile, SCMP reports that although the total number of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) exports to the UK fell by 32.6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles surged nearly 600%. Another SCMP article says India’s “fast-growing” domestic EV industry faces “renewed uncertainty”, following China’s curbs on rare earth exports. On the same day that the US and China “agreed a deal to slash tariffs”, China said that it will “strengthen controls over the full supply chains of strategic minerals exports”, Reuters reports. State-run newspaper China Daily reports that China’s production and sales of automobiles surpassed 10m units in the first four months of this year, adding that EVs accounted for 43% of new vehicle sales.

The Wire China publishes an opinion article by Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, discussing how China’s “combined wind, solar and coal bases” reflect the country’s economic strengths and weaknesses. Chinese researchers have “unveiled the world’s most advanced ocean simulation system”, which could enhance predictions of extreme weather events, SCMP says.

The UK opposition Conservative Party’s acting shadow secretary for energy, Andrew Bowie, has told the Guardian that the country’s 2050 net-zero target is “arbitrary” and “not based on science”, the newspaper reports. It adds that he also “indicated that the UK’s participation in the 2015 Paris climate agreement was up for reconsideration in the party’s ongoing review of key policies”. The outlet quotes Bowie saying: “We are not climate deniers and while we believe in getting to net-zero, what we shouldn’t do is be hamstrung by arbitrary targets such as a date of 2050, which was concocted simply because it was a good end point as a date. There’s no scientific rationale for choosing 2050 as the point to which we should reach net-zero.” The newspaper notes that, on the contrary, the 2050 date is in line with scientific advice on meeting the goal of the Paris Agreement. It continues: “Bowie said of the IPCC: ‘They’re biased towards their worldview, which is that we need to reduce climate emissions by a certain arbitrary date. That is not conducive to the overall economic wellbeing of this country.’ He added: ‘There’s quite a few scientists that say we don’t need to get to net-zero by 2050.’ Bowie and his office were unable to name such scientists when pressed.”

Separately, the Guardian covers new analysis, which it says finds that making the UK’s windfall tax on oil and gas producers permanent would raise at least £2bn per year – enough to ”fund switch to green jobs for North Sea oil workers”. The newspaper says the analysis comes from campaign group Oil Change International. Elsewhere, BusinessGreen says: “Plans for a giant 1GW [gigawatt] floating offshore wind farm in the North Sea could support over 1,000 jobs and generate nearly £11bn of investment for the UK over its lifetime, according to the developers behind the ambitious project.” The Irish Times reports that “Irish offshore windfarm developers have reacted with surprise and some alarm following the decision by the world’s largest wind developer to halt work on a vast UK project, citing rising costs and the risk of delays”.

In other UK news, the Guardian reports that “the British bioethanol industry could collapse as a result of Keir Starmer’s trade deal with Donald Trump, industry bosses have said”. Separately, the Guardian has published another article on Zack Polanski, the 42-year-old deputy leader of the Green party, who is standing in the party’s leadership election. The Press Association reports that a “huge cross-party group” of 71 MSPs and 10 MPs are “urging Rachel Reeves to deliver the money needed to progress the Acorn carbon capture and storage project in Aberdeenshire”. The Guardian reports that legal campaign group Wild Justice is “planning a judicial review against the UK government’s new planning bill, arguing it will result in a weakening of environmental protections which were fought for and created over decades”. The Daily Express reports that “highways bosses are set to permanently remove more than 140 miles of motorway lighting on some of the busiest sections in the UK – to cut carbon emission”.

BusinessGreen reports that “influential analyst firm” Cornwall Insight has published a new report, which finds that “even under ambitious timelines, it would likely take until the early 2030s to transition [the] UK market to a zonal electricity pricing regime”. The outlet continues: “The plans have been the subject of an intense lobbying battle that has divided companies and experts across the energy sector. Advocates for zonal pricing argue it could curb energy costs across the UK, deliver some of the lowest power prices in Europe to regions with surplus renewable power, and accelerate decarbonisation efforts by optimising the use of clean energy. But critics have countered such radical reforms would create uncertainty that could drive up the cost of capital for clean energy projects, delay projects that are crucial to meeting the government’s clean power goals, and create a ‘postcode lottery’ for energy bills across the UK.” The Press Association says: “Ministers are expected to make a decision on zonal pricing this summer after lobbying efforts for and against it have ramped up since Labour entered government.” The Financial Times carries a lengthy piece unpacking how zonal pricing would work and explaining the key points of the debate.

In other UK news, Euronews has factchecked the “misleading claims and conspiracy theories” surrounding new government-funded trials of solar radiation management. The outlet says: “Despite assertions that the UK’s plans are in the experimental stage, they haven’t stopped social media users from claiming that the country has already been engaging in geoengineering for years without public consent as a way to control the population. The claims also feed into the widely debunked ‘chemtrails’ conspiracy theory, whose believers insist that some vapour trails from planes contain harmful chemicals that are sprayed over the public around Europe or that others are being used to dim the sun and block out the light. EuroVerify put these notions to experts, who resoundingly rejected them.”

The Guardian reports on a new map of England’s peatlands, which shows that 80% of the regions are “dry and degraded”. The Press Association reports that scientists used “satellite imagery, artificial intelligence and in-depth data analysis” to create the map. BBC News also reports on the map. Finally, Simon Lee and Matthew Patterson from the University of St Andrews explain in the Conversation how a “blocking” weather system over the UK has “produced one of the driest, warmest and brightest starts to spring on record”. The scientists unpack how climate change may have played a role in setting up the “unusual spring”.

In a comment for the Hill, New York state senator Liz Krueger and New York assembly member Jeffrey Dinowitz write: “The foundation of American government rests on a simple but powerful principle: states are not mere departments of the federal government…President Trump’s recent executive order, which instructs the Justice Department to block state climate laws such as New York’s Climate Change Superfund Act, is a direct attack on that principle.” Krueger and Dinowitz continue: “Trump’s executive order does not simply challenge this one law, but rather the very idea that states have the right to hold powerful interests accountable when Washington will not.” They conclude: “The costs of climate change are here; the only question is who will pay those costs. States like New York are choosing fairness. We are choosing to make the biggest global polluters pay. The right to protect our communities belongs to the people and the leaders they elect, and it’s not limited by the whims of Washington insiders or oil industry lobbyists. We intend to defend that right, in the courts, in the legislature and in the court of public opinion, for as long as it takes.”

In other comment on the US, Bloomberg columnist Javier Blas writes: “For now, everything suggests the US won’t see a rapid decline in annual average oil production. A peak seems very likely; and even a slight drop could materialise if prices remain depressed. But nothing suggests that the US is about to see a repetition of the large decline in 2020, when average annual output fell almost 650,000 barrels a day from 2019.” Bloomberg columnist Gautam Mukunda writes that “slowing innovation is ruining American politics”. He says: “The administration’s new budget proposes a 55% cut to the National Science Foundation (the government’s primary arm for research outside medicine) and a 40% cut to the National Institutes of Health (America, and the world’s foremost medical research institution)…Even the flow of scientific talent into the US – long one of the nation’s greatest advantages – is reversing, with top AI minds no longer coming here and the EU allocating almost $600m to lure away top American researchers.”",,N,,2025-05-14 07:07:50.288494

Targets for rollbacks include regional haze, greenhouse gas, mercury and air toxin standards, along with wastewater pollution rules and a recently implemented set of rules designed to curb nitrogen oxide emissions.

Julia Finch, director of the Kentucky chapter of the Sierra Club, said coal plants and industries in the Commonwealth would be allowed to emit more pollution into neighboring communities.

An environmental group is voicing concern about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to tackle PFAS pollution.

The EPA recently announced steps to reduce the toxic ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water and hold polluters accountable.

Dan Firth, chair of the solid waste and mining committee for the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club, is concerned the EPA's efforts could be undermined by proposed budget cuts and regulatory rollbacks of pollution rules.

""We certainly hope that they will follow through and will improve, will strengthen the controls of around PFAS,"" Firth emphasized. ""That they will truly make the polluters pay, and that they will clean up the drinking water and protect the residents of Tennessee.""

EPA data show more than 143 million were exposed to toxic ""forever chemicals"" last year.

Firth pointed out if the EPA follows through on enforcing safe drinking water rules, it could improve water quality across Tennessee and ease the cleanup burden on taxpayers. He added the agency should also go further by treating PFAS as a class of chemicals and limit their use to prevent future contamination.

Firth noted the Tennessee Department of Environment Conservation is still in the process of revising its permit process. His group is encouraging the department to include some testing requirements for PFAS in biosolids.

""Grundy County had a bill in the legislature this year to gain local control over how they handle, whether they can permit or can deny the land application of biosolids at the local level,"" Firth observed.

Firth is calling for swift, meaningful action to improve access to clean water, noting PFAS exposure is linked to pregnancy complications and increase the risk of certain cancers.

A Michigan group is speaking out after a top congressional leader's comment that lawmakers will most likely scrap the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Ending the tax credit could deal a major blow to both the EV market and the country's clean-energy goals. Michigan automakers and suppliers have pumped more than $30 billion into the state's EV industry since 2020.

Jane McCurry, executive director of Clean Fuels Michigan, said her group joined several local and national nonprofits in signing a letter to the U.S. House Transportation Committee in support of the EV tax credits.

""Demonstrating that it's not just industry, not just individuals,"" she said, ""but large nonprofits and advocacy groups that really care about continuing to show support for the clean mobility transition.""

Despite growing Republican support for EV tax credits, some GOP senators have introduced the ELITE Vehicles Act. It would eliminate the $7,500 credit, a $4,000 credit for buying used EVs, and charging-station incentives. The senators have argued these are luxury cars and that taxpayers shouldn't foot the bill for incentives.

McCurry said it isn't just about cutting incentives. She said there are also new disincentives being pushed in Lansing and Washington, D.C. - including a proposal to increase the gas tax from 31 cents to 51 cents, which would hike EV fees.

""Because of the way that the EV registration fee in Michigan is designed, that would increase our EV registration fee by $100,"" she said, ""and that would make Michigan's EV registration tax the highest in the country.""

McCurry said her group, along with 70 companies, is working to bring back the Competitive Fuels Act in Michigan. It would reward cleaner, more innovative fuels based on how environmentally friendly they are. By 2030, hybrid or electric vehicles will be more than half of all vehicle sales in Michigan, according to the state.

Nonprofits, businesses, organizers and leaders have signed a letter calling for more climate solutions in Arizona and around the country. They claim the climate crisis is here, and say action is needed now more than ever.

Research shows most Arizonans are worried about the consequences of climate change on their own lives, and they want more renewable energy sources.

As the Trump administration takes steps to roll back environmental protections and boost domestic oil and gas production, people such as Gloria Walton, president and CEO of The Solutions Project, argue too much is at stake. Her organization is among 150 partners pledging renewed commitments to advancing climate solutions - especially from communities of color.

Walton said these are the areas disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, from their proximity to industry pollution to a lack of infrastructure to deal with extreme weather events.

""Frontline communities are literally taking a proactive stance to addressing the climate crisis, and they're thinking about the collective creativity that can change the material conditions when we work together,"" she said. ""And they're thinking about the hope and possibility of new systems that can be created that benefit people, versus corporations.""

The Solutions Project works with cooperatives and community organizers to cultivate policy and campaign wins, which Walton said work to fill in the gaps the current administration is not.

Historically, said Judith LeBlanc, executive director of the community organization Native Organizers Alliance, their advocacy work has been about defending and protecting natural resources, but added that the approach has changed in recent years.

""But what we've been moving in the direction of for eight, nine years - since Standing Rock, really,"" she said, ""is putting forward solutions, generating possible ways to continue to build up the infrastructure for rural, and therefore our reservations.""

LeBlanc said Indigenous stewards understand their inherent role and legal responsibility to take care of lands and waters for all. She added that organizing, engaging and mobilizing communities is key, ""since the majority opinion is, 'Let's get 'er done, let's take care of Mother Earth, let's invest' - especially by registered voters, who play a big role in shaping government policy.""

A Commonwealth Court panel of five judges agreed.
They argue the Commonwealth Court wrongly decided the case because it failed to consider the DEP and Environmental Quality Board’s obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA) to the state constitution.
Comitta said the Supreme Court case and RGGI would make the Supreme Court case moot, but GOP lawmakers have said the plan falls short of their goals to reduce energy costs and ensure reliable electricity supplies.","Pennsylvania’s long-delayed membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that would require fossil fuel-burning power plants to pay for carbon dioxide emissions was the subject of arguments Tuesday before the state Supreme Court.

The program, known as RGGI, established a carbon credit auction for electricity producers in 11 northeast states to pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide. The money received would go to each state for uses, ranging from utility assistance and energy efficiency projects to subsidies for alternative energy.

Gov. Tom Wolf entered the compact in 2022 over the objections of Republican state lawmakers. They raised concerns it would increase electricity prices, hasten the closing of the commonwealth’s remaining coal power plants, and not reduce carbon emissions overall, but simply force them into other states.

In a legal challenge to the program’s constitutionality, GOP leaders in the House and Senate contended the requirement to buy carbon credits was an impermissible tax. A Commonwealth Court panel of five judges agreed.

In its decision, the appellate court said that Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI must be approved through the General Assembly and that the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) does not have the authority to impose a tax.

Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration appealed, with the DEP, arguing that the commonwealth’s membership in RGGI is authorized by the state’s Air Pollution Control Act (APCA). The law empowers the state to enact rules and regulations to reduce pollution, including establishing fees used to eliminate air emissions.

Several nonprofit citizens rights and environmental groups, including Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, moved to intervene in the appeal. They argue the Commonwealth Court wrongly decided the case because it failed to consider the DEP and Environmental Quality Board’s obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA) to the state constitution. The groups also back the DEP’s argument that the agency is empowered to establish fees to enforce the APCA.

Adopted in 1971, the ERA requires the commonwealth to preserve public natural resources for the benefit of all people. It’s considered one of the strongest such constitutional protections in the nation, according to PennFuture.

Since the Commonwealth Court’s decision in 2023, Shapiro has introduced a Pennsylvania-focused alternative to RGGI called the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER) that he said would leverage the commonwealth’s status as an energy exporter to fund carbon-neutral energy development.

Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D-Chester), who plans to introduce legislation to establish PACER, said Shapiro’s alternative was developed in collaboration with Republican lawmakers and energy companies. Comitta said the Supreme Court case and RGGI would make the Supreme Court case moot, but GOP lawmakers have said the plan falls short of their goals to reduce energy costs and ensure reliable electricity supplies.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_8924-2048x1300-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:08:02.264662

Animal agriculture accounts for 32% of global emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, with the breeding of cattle for milk and meat a key driver.

Methane has been assessed as responsible for nearly half the total global temperature rise since 1750. But since it is short-lived in the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide, cuts to emissions have been identified as an urgent move in tackling climate breakdown.

However, an assessment of 20 major dairy and coffee shop chains – with combined revenues exceeding $420bn (£323bn), almost half the value of the estimated size of the global dairy industry – found most lack clear methane reduction targets, credible action plans or even basic transparency on emissions.

The food products corporation Danone came top in a league table compiled by researchers, being the only company to have a methane-specific target. The US-based company General Mills came in second place, having published a climate target but not one specific to methane. Nestlé and Arla came third, with Nestlé the only company to have explicitly supported reducing dairy consumption.

Of the companies assessed, only Nestlé and Danone claimed to have actually cut emissions, despite all but two having affirmed methane and livestock pose a threat to the climate.

“Dairy production is a rare lever to control methane emissions, but one that firms clearly don’t want to touch,” said Nusa Urbancic, the chief executive of Changing Markets, which carried out the research.

“The near-total absence of methane-specific targets and credible action plans sends a clear signal: companies are turning a blind eye to emissions of one of the most potent and solvable drivers of global heating.”

Companies in the assessment included the largest dairy companies in Europe and North America by annual revenue, the five largest coffee chains in Europe and North America, and all eight members of the Dairy Methane Action Alliance (DMAA), an industry initiative.

Urbancic added: “Our audit shows that fine words from businesses and a few voluntary actions are little more than hot air. Governments must finally grab the bull by the horns and set science-based methane cuts for the agricultural sector.

“All eyes are on European governments, given its leadership on the global methane pledge and upcoming legislation in this area.”

An Arla spokesperson said: “Alongside our farmer owners, Arla is committed to producing more sustainable dairy and has clear science-based targets in place.”

WASHINGTON—The House Ways & Means Committee released draft legislative text for markup that, if passed, would effectively kill the electric vehicle (EV) tax credits for the majority of the auto industry by the end of this year.

The targeted credits for termination include:

Section 30D (New Clean Vehicles), which provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new clean vehicle,

Section 30C (Alternative Fuel Infrastructure), which provides up to $1,000 for eligible refueling infrastructure,

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production), which subsidizes a percentage of the cost of producing certain clean energy technologies,

Section 45W (Commercial Clean Vehicle), which provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible vehicles under 14,000 lbs. and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 lbs., and

Section 25E (Used Clean Vehicles), which provides up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used clean vehicle.

EC Executive Director Ben Prochazka has issued the following statement in response:

“Today’s draft legislative text would represent a troubling step back for the automotive and the broader EV industry in the U.S. The electric transportation sector is a critical and rapidly growing part of the U.S. economy and is paramount in the global race to control the future of transportation. The U.S. must continue with an aggressive approach to policy and market incentives to ensure we can compete with fierce competition from abroad, especially China. Additionally, electrification diversifies how we power our cars, trucks, and buses, reducing our reliance on volatile oil markets and improving our economic and national security.

“These tax credits have already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of private-sector investments in domestic manufacturing, created hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs, and increased the U.S. auto industry’s global competitiveness. They have enticed companies, including auto manufacturers, battery producers and suppliers of critical minerals, to make long-term investments in the United States. Dismantling these investments would potentially strand billions of dollars of assets, challenge the economy, reduce U.S. jobs and disincentivize future investment in the U.S.

“As the Trump administration recognized, our economy and military depend on reliable supplies of critical minerals, which can only be secured by creating and maintaining a robust domestic EV industry. Hindering the development of the U.S. EV industry at a moment when China (which controls the majority of global critical mineral mining and processing capabilities) has begun to restrict exports of these materials to the United States would threaten U.S. military, manufacturing and innovation capabilities.

“While the EV market must and will eventually survive without incentives, this reversal will create an uncertain market in the U.S., potentially affecting jobs and communities across the country. We urge members of Congress to recognize the economic and national security imperative of these policies and encourage an approach that preserves the EV incentives and the future of the auto industry.”

Under the amended law, nuclear plants that could previously only operate for 40 years will be allowed to renew or extend their licenses for up to 20 years at a time, according to Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu. The revision also allows operators to apply for license renewal before or after it expires.

Energy security is a critical issue for Taiwan, which has sought to phase out its nuclear industry but has also been forced to contend with the needs of a vital chipmaking industry and an uncomfortable reliance on imported fossil fuel. Concerns have increased as Beijing exerts more pressure and the technology industry’s power demands soar.

The bill comes just days before Taiwan’s last operating reactor is set to go offline. The May 17 closure will not be averted, but Tuesday’s vote hints at a reversal that could bring the territory into line with a global trend of renewed interest in nuclear energy, seen as an effective, low-carbon solution for the world’s needs.

Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai told a locally-produced podcast that his cabinet would not oppose bringing back decommissioned reactors if the legal amendment is approved. But he added it would take 3.5 years to review safety before a restart, citing state-owned Taipower’s estimate.

The government does not have immediate plans to evaluate any nuclear plant extensions or restarts, according to a statement by the cabinet on Tuesday after the passage of the bill. That’s because detailed regulations have not been formulated yet, it said.

Using nuclear power could slash Taiwan’s reliance on imported liquefied natural gas — which arrives by sea and would be vulnerable in the event of any sharp rise in tensions with Beijing, particularly a naval blockade. It would also ease fears about energy security in the coming years as power consumption is set to grow by about 13% by end-decade, thanks to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence.

The battle may not be going their way, at least when it comes to 45U, the incentive born out of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers a credit for electricity produced at a qualified nuclear power facility.

That’s because House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in cuts to the IRA, and the 45U credit would be included in these cuts, according to a draft bill issued Monday. The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process.

Beginning with tax years starting after December 31, 2028, the value of the credit would be gradually reduced. It would decrease to 80 percent of its original amount in 2029, 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031 and would be fully phased out by 2032.

In addition to the phase-out, the legislation introduces new restrictions aimed at limiting access to the credit for entities with foreign ties. Specifically, no credit would be allowed for any taxpayer classified as a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after the enactment of the law. Further, beginning two years after enactment, the credit would also be denied to any taxpayer defined as a “foreign-influenced entity.”

The legislation also repeals the transferability of the nuclear production tax credit. After December 31, 2027, utilities and other qualifying taxpayers would no longer be permitted to transfer the credit to other entities.

According to nuclear stakeholders, the credits (including 45U) have helped catalyze efforts to reopen shuttered facilities like Palisades in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, among others.

The city says the water plant was also built with consideration of changing weather patterns.","COLUMBUS, Ohio — As the Columbus region grows, so does its thirst for water. The city says water usage has increased from about 136 million gallons of water per day in 2012 to nearly 150 million gallons of water per day in 2024.

To meet the growing demand from residential, industrial and commercial buildings, the city is beginning construction on the Home Road water plant.

“Initially, this plant will start off with about 48 million gallons per day. We have the capacity to go up to 80 million gallons per day,” says John Newsome, administrator for the City of Columbus Division of Water.

This supply will flow through more than 20 miles of underground pipelines, stretching from Delaware County through Dublin and into Columbus, ensuring homes and businesses have the water they need for decades to come.

In a move toward sustainability, the $1.6 billion plant can be powered by an array of floating solar panels.

“Actually, the entire plant can be run by that solar facility,” Newsome said.

The city says the solar panels will reduce reliance on the grid and lower the city’s carbon footprint, which is a growing trend among modern water utilities.

Currently, Columbus customers are served by three water plants. The addition of the Home Road facility will shift much of the supply for the city’s northwest, reshaping how water is delivered across the region.

“The whole region is growing as a whole, so this plant helps with all of that growth,” Newsome said.

With such a large investment, city officials acknowledge that water rates will need to rise to pay for the project. While the exact increase remains under review, residents can expect more details later this year.

Construction won’t be without its challenges. The city notes that while Scioto River water levels won’t be affected as two up ground reservoirs are expected to be built, some homeowners with wells near the construction zone may experience temporary disruptions as crews de-water certain areas to lay the massive pipes.

“During construction, we will have to de-water some of the area, so we may impact some of the neighborhood wells,” says Matt Steele, Assistant Administrator for the Columbus Division of Water. Customers who have issues should sent issues to here.

The Home Road plant is being built on the site of the former Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility, land the city purchased from the state in 2015 in anticipation of the region’s growth. Central Ohio is growing – from about 2.5 million residents today to more than three million by 2050.

HOUSTON & PORT HAWKESBURY, NS, July 13, 2022 – Buckeye Partners, L.P. (“Buckeye”) today announced that it closed on the previously announced acquisition of Bear Head Energy, Inc. (“Bear Head”), which is developing a large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production, storage and export project in Point Tupper, Nova Scotia with hydrogen electrolyzer capacity of over two gigawatts.

“Buckeye’s intention with this acquisition is to develop a large-scale green energy production, distribution and export hub,” said Buckeye CEO Todd Russo. “Given the project’s unique features and the geographic advantages of the region, including its status as one of the top locations globally for wind energy generation, we believe that this has the potential to become one the world’s premier green hydrogen production facilities. As Buckeye continues to evolve into a more diversified energy company, acquisitions like Bear Head represent an opportunity for us to invest in growth that aligns with our customers’ evolving needs and ESG priorities while leveraging our existing expertise and capabilities.”

As part of the project’s phased development, Buckeye plans to partner with on-shore and off-shore renewable energy developers to build out a large-scale green hydrogen hub for Atlantic Canada. Buckeye and Bear Head believe this development will create a significant number of new clean energy jobs in the province, help support Nova Scotia’s carbon emissions reduction targets, and establish the region as a global leader in the production of green hydrogen for domestic and export markets.

“Together, Bear Head and Buckeye have the experience and resources necessary to successfully develop, construct and operate a world class green hydrogen facility on the Bear Head site,” said Bear Head President and CEO John Godbold. “Under Buckeye’s ownership, we believe that the Bear Head project will become a premier asset in the global hydrogen value chain by matching Nova Scotia’s considerable renewable resources with the world’s growing need for green fuels.”

“Bear Head is striving to build the modern clean hydrogen economy, and every decision we make is with a focus on creating a carbon-neutral future,” said Bear Head COO, Paul MacLean. “We are proud to be fully aligned with Buckeye, who shares our core values with respect to our commitment to working with Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw communities through open communication, engagement and delivering a broad partnership on key elements of our project. With the full support from local stakeholders and our owners, we believe that Bear Head will be well-positioned to help drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.”

Buckeye established its Alternative Energy operating segment as a clean energy business that focuses on the development, construction, and operation of alternative energy projects, including hydrogen, wind, and solar-powered energy solutions. The Bear Head Project is an addition to Buckeye’s growing asset portfolio in the clean energy sector and will further diversify the company’s revenue sources and position Buckeye to meaningfully participate in the energy transition.

“Buckeye’s new and ongoing commitment to Canada is an investment in the skills of Canadian workers, in our access to global markets, and in our dedication to powering the green future,” says Katie Curran, Interim CEO, Invest in Canada. “Foreign direct investment is bringing jobs, stability and promise to some of Canada’s smaller communities, further proving that global investors will look at all corners of Canada for opportunities.”

Hydrogen, which burns without releasing carbon, is one of the most promising paths to reducing emissions from hard-to-abate industries including the maritime sector, heavy vehicle transportation, fertilizer and power generation. As the world moves steadily towards rapid decarbonization and governments around the world set new, progressively ambitious climate goals, hydrogen will play a central role in the energy, industrial and transportations sectors.

Support for Snake River dams Wright said the Trump administration is aligned with Newhouse on saving the dams, and thinking first of taxpayers and the citizens who need the power produced by the dams.

When he visits PNNL, he also will visit the Hanford nuclear site and hydroelectric dams, he told Newhouse.","The nation’s new energy secretary is “passionately in support” of leaving the four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Washington intact, he said at a hearing last week in Washington, D.C.

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., asked Secretary Chris Wright about his stand on the dams during a hearing to address the Trump administration’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget for the Department of Energy.

Newhouse also questioned him about layoffs at the Bonneville Power Administration and money for the Tri-Cities’ largest employers — the Hanford nuclear site and research at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The lower Snake River dams provide reliable, low-cost hydroelectric power and other benefits, including transportation and irrigation, Newhouse stated.

Those benefits would be lost if the four dams from Ice Harbor Dam near Pasco to Lower Granite near Lewiston, Idaho, were breached in an effort to help save endangered salmon, he said.

He argued progress has been made to increase salmon populations, showing that hydroelectric dams and salmon can co-exist.

Support for Snake River dams

Wright said the Trump administration is aligned with Newhouse on saving the dams, and thinking first of taxpayers and the citizens who need the power produced by the dams.

The energy secretary praised dams, saying such large infrastructure projects were built “when America was bold” and that a number of dams have been critical to the economic prosperity of the nation.

Hydroelectric dams produce “high-value electricity,” because it is there when you need it, he said.

They are “very valuable assets” at a time of increasingly rapid growth in the need for power for artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, he said.

The nation needs to be ready to meet that demand without driving up the costs for ratepayers, he said.

“We should not spend money to go backward to reduce our energy-generating capacity, particularly of such high value electricity,” he said.

In his prepared remarks submitted to the House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Wright said the administration is focused on energy addition, versus subtraction or even replacement.

“As government leaders, we need to be of the mindset that more is better,” he said in submitted remarks. “Replacing energy sources does not add to the finite energy supply that American families, businesses and innovators are competing for.”

The Biden administration announced in December that it wanted an updated look at findings of a four-year, $55 million federal study completed in 2020 that rejected calls to tear down the four lower Snake River dams.

A coalition of Northwest power, navigation and agricultural users that rely on the dams said what they called a “redo” of the 2020 environmental impact statement could lead to breaching the four dams.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bonneville Power Administration have began work on a supplemental environmental impact statement, considering possible changes due to species proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act and new reports, studies and information published since 2020.

Hanford nuclear site progress

Wright has pledged to visit every national laboratory, including Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, within a year of his appointment.

When he visits PNNL, he also will visit the Hanford nuclear site and hydroelectric dams, he told Newhouse.

Wright pointed out that the Trump administration’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026 includes maintaining level funding for Hanford, while other environmental clean up projects likely will share in budget cuts.

Wright has had multiple meetings with leaders at Bechtel National, the DOE contractor that is preparing to start turning radioactive waste now stored in underground tanks at Hanford into a stable glass form at the vitrification plant this summer.

He’s discussed with Bechtel the importance of bringing the plant online this year and is likely to be at the ribbon cutting, he said. Construction on the plant started in 2002.

Budget cuts and PNNL

Newhouse said he is concerned about significant cuts in programs that fund research for PNNL in Richland, including the DOE Office of Science and the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

“We don’t want to shrink or stop any of the critical research in our national labs ... from cybersecurity that (PNNL) is so strong at to fusion energy, to advanced computing, artificial intelligence, basic fundamental physics,” Wright said. “All of these things will go on, virtually unimpacted.”

But in recent years there has been growth in what he calls “political science,” because it is tied to political messaging or campaigns, he said.

The goal in the Trump administration’s proposed budget is to not touch what he called “hard science,” but “to trim out the fluff,” he said.

“The future of the national labs is very bright and the scientific and substantive output from the labs will not be reduced,” Wright said.

BPA layoffs questioned

The Bonneville Power Administration lost 200 workers who took voluntary layoffs as part of a federal program to reduce federal spending, Newhouse said.

He supports the goal of getting control of waste of federal taxpayer funds, but BPA does not receive federal funds, he said.

There appears to be the potential for the loss of grid reliability due to the loss of employees and institutional knowledge, Newhouse said.

BPA was already short staffed, Wright acknowledged. He said BPA employees were not allowed to participate in a second round of voluntary layoffs.

BPA supplies much of the electricity used in the greater Tri-Cities area and delivers it on the BPA electric grid.

Energy Star is on the chopping block, despite a government report that found the program has saved households and businesses $500 billion in energy costs since it was implemented by George H. W. Bush.

Since the early ‘90s, the federal government has been rating appliances by their energy efficiency, according to Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

Things like “refrigerators, clothes washers, dishwashers,” he said. And commercial buildings, homes, air conditioners and furnaces, too.

“And if they are certified, they can use a little blue Energy Star label, which makes it real easy for consumers to say, ‘Ah, here's a high-efficiency product.’ And as a result, sales of these products have generally increased quite a bit,” said Nadel.

Consumers who buy Energy Star products save money by reducing their electricity bills and consumption. Millions of efficient product sales later, and energy savings really add up including at times of peak demand, Nadel added.

“So it really is helping to reduce the demand for electricity and the need for power plants,” he said.

Over the years, those energy savings have helped electricity demand stay relatively flat for the last couple of decades. But that’s changing thanks to new industries, per Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist with the University of Texas at Austin.

“The electricity grid is looking to grow with new loads, like AI and data centers and all these other types of things,” he said.

Building new natural gas power plants and transmission lines and other infrastructure takes time and money. Meaning, “it would be good to continue to be efficient in places where we can, like with the Energy Star program,” he said.

Because this is the time we need all the energy we can get.

“Energy efficiency programs can help to reduce the rate at which electricity demand is growing,” said Ramteen Sioshansi, a professor in the department of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

Of course, losing Energy Star won’t have an immediate impact. Sioshansi said a lot of appliances today won’t need replacing for a while. But looking ahead, “you might see less of a drive by those appliance manufacturers to make their appliances more energy efficient.”

And it will become more challenging, he said, for consumers to pick an appliance that is more energy efficient.

Crazy!

Here’s our recap of legislative happenings related to the environment from Monday, May 12, 2025.

House floor

House Joint Resolution 138 (Alders) proposed a constitutional amendment that would prevent the imposition of a carbon tax in the state of Texas. Because it’s a constitutional amendment it needed a two-thirds majority to make it to a public vote and, fortunately!, it failed to meet that threshold. This doesn’t mean that a carbon tax is forthcoming from the legislature, but at least it doesn’t tie the hands of future lawmakers by foreclosing the possibility of a tax in the future.

The House did pass another proposed constitutional amendment. This one by Rep. Brooks Landgraf would shift 12% of the revenue generated from oil and gas production taxes, that currently go to the Rainy Day Fund, to a new Texas STRONG fund. The new fund would invest in community projects, including oil and gas cleanup and emissions reductions projects, in parts of the state heavily affected by oil and gas production.

Senate floor

The Senate passed SB 261 (Perry) which aims to ban the manufacture, processing, possession, distribution, and sale of cultivated meat. Advocates for this measure pointed to the deleterious impact cultivated meat could have on the livestock market and the state economy. Opponents of this measure argue that cultivated meat provides a more sustainable alternative to farming because it has a lower environmental impact.

In a win for water conservation, the Senate passed House Bill 517 (Harris Davila). This bill prevents Home Owners Associations (HOAs) from fining homeowners for having brown or discolored lawns when the property is subject to a watering restriction imposed due to drought conditions. Now, homeowners won’t be penalized for adhering to municipal regulations designed to conserve water. Hopefully this bill will help to alleviate confusion for homeowners as we head towards Texas’ hottest season.

Senate Committees

Senate Bill 2497 (Zaffirini) was approved in the Water, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee in the Senate. This bill is designed to address concerns regarding murky or smelly water. Although these conditions are not generally harmful to health, they still pose a threat to public confidence in their drinking water and may push consumers to purchase unsustainable plastic water bottles.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/coal-power-plant-smokestacks-546538735-Mr-James-Kelley-via-shutterstock-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:09:45.921195

The agency is shuttering its Office of Research and Development – the second largest of which operates in Corryville – and cutting off funds for its work, according to a current official, a retired official and multiple national news reports.

Research will shift to a new EPA entity, the agency announced May 2.

The new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions will be part of the Office of the Administrator and “tackle statutory obligations and mission-essential functions,” according to an agency press release.

The restructuring will save taxpayers $300 million a year by fiscal year 2026, the agency said, with some of the savings coming from job cuts.

Cincinnati will remain an EPA facility and laboratory “housing the important work of the new office,” EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou told The Enquirer.

What that means for local employment – once reported at more than 900 – remains murky.

10-story building sits on 22 acres

EPA’s Office of Research and Development employs about 1,500 people across the country.

As recently as 2017, EPA employed 980 people at Corryville's Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center, according to its website. Of them, 537 were federal employees, with a combined payroll of $58 million a year, the site profile reported.

The Breidenbach Center, named for a wastewater treatment expert who spent nearly two decades working in Cincinnati, opened in 1978. The building includes 10 stories of labs and offices, filling about 472,000 square feet. At least seven more structures sit on a 22-acre site at the corner of Martin Luther King Drive and Vine Street.

In addition to the Breidenbach Center, EPA operates sites in Lower Price Hill, Milford, Winton Hills, Blue Ash and Erlanger, Kentucky.

Current Cincinnati employment is between 300 and 600, according to Michael Ottlinger, president of Chapter 279 of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents EPA employees.

EPA’s Vaseliou did not answer questions about its current and future headcount.

But she did say Cincinnati will retain its water-related offices.

Research on water, landfills, even anthrax

EPA’s local water focus dates to 1912. That’s when a former U.S. Marine hospital, located on Third Street at the base of Mount Adams, became part of what was then the U.S. Public Health Service’s station to investigate stream pollution.

Over the following years, that office took on work related to air, industrial and chemical pollution and became part of the Department of Interior and then, with its creation in 1970, the EPA.

In recent years, EPA researchers have focused on lead and other contaminants in drinking water, along with threats to water quality from natural and man-made disasters. They’ve also focused on stream issues, including fecal contamination that threatens drinking water and closes beaches.

“Drinking water researchers are routinely called on by states and public water systems to diagnose problems and provide solutions,” the 2017 profile of local operations said.

Just two years ago, local EPA officials introduced its drinking water pilot plant to media, outlining their focus on removing PFAS, known as forever chemicals, from drinking water.

Other Cincinnati EPA research has focused on how to manage and clean up landfills and spills of oil and other chemicals.

In 2002, in the wake of 9/11 attacks during the Bush administration, EPA alarmed some officials when it added a Homeland Security Research Center in Cincinnati, to test anthrax and other biological agents.

The Corryville campus had earlier added what’s called a full containment facility to handle hazardous material research, winning approval to build it near the Breidenbach building in 1987.

'Not enough lifeboats'

Ottlinger, the union official, said local EPA employees were offered a second round of deferred retirements earlier in May.

Employees who decided against that and have not been offered a spot in the new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions may be out of luck, Ottlinger said.

“If you’re not in a lifeboat, you are going down with the ship,” he said, adding “there aren’t enough lifeboats to take everybody.”

More than EPA jobs will be lost in the agency restructuring, he said. That includes relationships with universities and contracted employees. “We’ve been canceling contractors left and right.”

Cindy Sonich-Mullin, who retired in 2019 as Cincinnati director of the national risk management research lab, is disappointed that former colleagues cannot complete current projects.

“All that research is just going to be shut down,” she said.

Earlier this year, Sonich-Mullin's former colleagues were told to slow down and wrap up their priorities, she said. Instead, some have been speeding up and aiming to publish research results – both to advance science and complete work that might help them land new jobs.

“It’s heartbreaking to see what’s happening,” she said. “The people are so good and so dedicated.”","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/presto/2023/02/15/PCIN/f1236adb-b96b-494d-8d68-5aaa35466e56-021423EPAoffice_26.JPG?crop=8639,4860,x0,y439&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-14 01:00:08.722963

Earth Day, which takes place annually on April 22nd, was established 55 years ago in 1970 after American rose up to fight against the destruction of our beautiful planet. The same protests led to the founding of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the adoption of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and most of the country’s other major environmental laws. The April 22, 1970 protests were the biggest social uprising in human history.

Over the years, though, what was originally a day of protests and teach-ins has largely become an excuse for polluters to “greenwash” their products and operations. But not this year. Given the Trump Administration’s assault on federal environmental protections, Earth Day took back some of its original character.

This year there was a rally organized by the AFGE Union Local 3907 members from the EPA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to celebrate Earth Day and to fight against the attacks on these federal agencies and workers. The rally took place just outside EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) and NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) offices here in Ann Arbor.

At the event, there were impassioned speeches by representatives from AFGE union members representing, EPA, NOAA, and USGS; Huron River Watershed Council; A2Zero: Ann Arbor Office of Sustainability and Innovations; Thurston Nature Center, and the Ecology Center with special appearances from Representatives Rashida Talib and Debbie Dingell. All speakers talked about the big role the federal agencies and workers play to make sure our planet is healthy and the negative impact the current attacks would have.

“We only won our rights by fighting for our rights.” — Mike Garfield, Director of Ecology Center

Ecology Center director, Mike Garfield, spoke about how the EC was conceived during the first Earth Day event to keep the energy of the uprising alive. He asserted that “we only won our rights by fighting for our rights,” and it is on us to continue that fight, especially now that EPA workers in the environmental justice department were recently told that they will all be fired by July. He urged everyone to continue to take a stand and raise our voices.

“We shouldn’t have to fight for clean water or air in the richest nation in the world.” - Rashida Tlaib

Rep. Rashida Tlaib stated that “we shouldn’t have to fight for clean water or air in the richest nation in the world.” While we face serious and urgent issues, she said that it gives her hope to see more and more Americans rising up. In her speech, she also gave recognition to those who may not be able to attend such events in person for various reasons, but taking action in ways they can to remind us that the collective efforts expand beyond those we saw at the rally.

There were many local residents and community groups in attendance at the event including Ann Arbor Indivisible, a non-partisan grassroots movement to protect democracy. Gus Teschke, one of the organizers of the group, stated that though they do not work specifically on environmental issues, their work understands the importance of protecting regulatory agencies like the EPA and NOAA.

“Taking care of the environment is taking care of people” — David, former EPA worker.

David was one of many retired EPA workers and former AFGE Union members that came out to the rally. He stated that while we cannot prevent the administration from making legal changes, he is concerned about the illegal and reckless actions. He also commented that we need the EPA because “taking care of the environment is taking care of people.”

Rushing continued: “Just a few weeks ago, the Trump administration touted its support for energy innovation and clean technologies like next-generation geothermal, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage.
But the legislation moving through House committees today would undermine the viability of many projects using these innovative clean energy technologies.
Contrary to the administration’s goal of American energy dominance, this legislation cedes the energy future to global competitors like China.
“The legislation could have incentivized biofuel producers to install carbon capture systems, for example, but instead would lower the bar on tax credit eligibility.","WASHINGTON – Today, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees are voting on legislation that would eliminate clean energy programs and undermine clean energy tax credits. These programs and tax credits “are essential to protecting public health and the climate, bolstering domestic energy production, and driving economic growth and global competitiveness,” according to Reece Rushing, U.S. federal policy director at Clean Air Task Force (CATF).

Rushing continued:

“Just a few weeks ago, the Trump administration touted its support for energy innovation and clean technologies like next-generation geothermal, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage. But the legislation moving through House committees today would undermine the viability of many projects using these innovative clean energy technologies. Contrary to the administration’s goal of American energy dominance, this legislation cedes the energy future to global competitors like China. Innovative clean energy projects will be abandoned and good-paying jobs lost, while energy bills go up and grid reliability goes down.”

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is voting to eliminate the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is critical to expanding nuclear energy, among other clean technologies, and repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) to reduce natural gas leaks and waste.

The House Ways and Means Committee is simultaneously voting on legislation that would undermine vital clean energy tax credits, including the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit (45U), the clean electricity investment and production tax credits (48E and 45Y) that benefit technologies like geothermal, advanced nuclear energy, and fusion energy, the 45Q tax credit that supports carbon capture and storage (CCS) and direct air capture (DAC), the 45V hydrogen production tax credit, and the 45Z clean fuels credit.

“The combination of limiting the transferability provisions and the imposition of unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern provisions included in the legislation will hinder deployment of CCS projects in the U.S., despite the Trump administration’s stated goal to support cutting edge technologies like carbon capture,” said Sam Bowers, U.S. policy manager, Carbon Capture at CATF. “The proposed reduced transferability window will cut the legs out from a key pathway to project financing. Restricting the ability to transfer 45Q credits beyond a narrow two-year window would also limit developers’ ability to extract the full value of 45Q to finance carbon capture projects, risking fewer projects and fewer carbon emissions reductions across the country.”

“Nuclear energy is one of the few zero-emissions sources that can provide reliable, grid-scale electricity and heat. Under the proposed phaseout of key tax credits for existing and new nuclear included in today’s bill, first- and early-of-a-kind projects set for deployment in the early-to-mid 2030s will struggle to qualify for incentives that are necessary for unlocking commercial nuclear projects at scale,” said Victor Ibarra, Jr., senior manager, Advanced Nuclear Energy at CATF. “In a world of growing economic demand, the viability and expansion of new nuclear depends on preserving, extending, and enhancing these federal tax credits.”

“Geothermal projects take years to plan and construct. The proposed phaseout of the investment tax credit (ITC) will functionally exclude any projects not already well underway,” said Terra Rogers, director, Superhot Rock Geothermal at CATF. “Phasing out the ITC now is like shutting down drilling rigs in the early 2000s, right before U.S. shale production surged over 700% and reshaped global energy markets. It’s just too soon to pull support for geothermal technologies that can drive American energy abundance and security. And, without preserving the ITC’s transferability clause, many early-stage developers who lack tax appetite will be unable to access the credit at all. Without these tools, leading geothermal innovators will look abroad to countries actively investing in advanced energy technologies. This would dramatically slow geothermal development in the U.S. and risk forfeiting our leadership and competitive edge in this abundant, secure, and homegrown energy resource.”

“Fusion energy is no longer decades away, with companies already building toward deployment. The proposed phaseout of 48E and 45Y pulls the rug out from under U.S. commercial fusion deployment as many American companies are actively preparing to add watts to the grid in the early-to-mid 2030s – just shy of a few years following the proposed phaseout,” said Sehila Gonzalez, global director, Fusion Energy at CATF. “Policy certainty is essential for driving American innovation, and eliminating these tax credits will harm U.S. competitiveness.”

“Eliminating the clean hydrogen production tax credit (45V) by the end of this year means essentially no facilities – including the hydrogen hubs currently under development – will qualify,” said Rachel Starr, senior U.S. policy manager, Hydrogen at CATF. “This credit, alongside other policy mechanisms, has provided momentum to grow the U.S. hydrogen industry, which contributes to domestic energy security, jobs, competitiveness, and innovation. This legislation would effectively end the U.S. hydrogen market before it’s able to take off and throw away the tens of thousands of high-paying American jobs that the hydrogen economy is projected to create.”

“Changes proposed to the clean fuel production tax credit (45Z) are both ineffective and costly. Extending the lifetime of the credit and also ignoring how increased demand for biofuels affects land use changes and the associated loss of soil carbon around the world is a dishonest way of making conventional biofuels look better than they are – all while increasing federal spending in the long run,” said Jonathan Lewis, global director, Transportation Decarbonization at CATF. “The legislation could have incentivized biofuel producers to install carbon capture systems, for example, but instead would lower the bar on tax credit eligibility. It’s a multi-billion-dollar giveaway to an existing industry, plain and simple.”

“The Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) protects public health and the climate, reduces waste, and supports American leadership on methane pollution reduction,” said Darin Schroeder, methane legal and regulatory director at CATF. “This short-sighted proposal would shelve that leadership, and not only ignores the public’s support for MERP but also the direction the world is going in demanding low methane intensity gas. There’s no reason the U.S. should take this step backward.”

The House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their long-awaited plan to extend trillions of dollars in tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of this year, as well as add the tax cuts that Trump promised during his 2024 campaign, including exempting tips from taxation. It would beef up some tax breaks – including the popular child tax credit – as well as add at least one relatively new idea, a “MAGA” savings account for kids.

Overall, the proposal would cost a little more than $3.8 trillion over 10 years, according to a revised Joint Committee on Taxation score – below the Ways and Means Committee’s target of at least $4 trillion.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Sunday unveiled the initial text of its contentious proposal to slash spending on Medicaid, though the measures did not slice as deeply into program as some conservative members would like. The plan would hit the committee’s target of reducing the deficit by at least $880 million over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis.

The two committees’ proposals aren’t finalized yet and could still change before they are voted on by the panels, which is expected to take place in the coming days.

The overall package aims to extend the GOP’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as to fulfill several of Trump’s campaign promises. To help offset these tax reductions, the House is also looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.

Republicans are also signaling they will make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation’s outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans.

Eleven House committees are working on pieces of the larger bill, which will then be assembled into the package. Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to vote on the legislation before Memorial Day — an ambitious deadline. The Senate, however, has different ideas of what should be in the package. The chamber also has stricter rules of what can be included since congressional Republicans are pushing the legislation through using the budget reconciliation process so they don’t need Democratic support in the Senate.

Here’s what we know about the initial plans that some House committees have proposed for the legislative package:

For the first time in Medicaid’s 60-year history, certain recipients ages 19 to 64 would be required to work at least 80 hours a month to retain their benefits, according to an initial version of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s plan. They could also meet the controversial mandate by engaging in community service, attending school or participating in a work program.

The requirement, which would take effect in 2029, would not apply to parents, pregnant women, medically frail individuals and those with substance-abuse disorders, among others.

Republicans have long sought to add work requirements to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to more than 71 million low-income Americans. The first Trump administration granted waivers to several states to implement such a mandate, but the efforts were halted by federal courts.

The mandate may result in millions of people losing their coverage, multiple analyses have shown. While many adults on Medicaid have jobs, they may have trouble meeting the reporting requirements, obtaining exemptions or landing enough hours each month to maintain their eligibility.

The plan also mandates states to check Medicaid expansion recipients’ eligibility every six months, instead of annually, and to require that certain low-income adults covered under Medicaid expansion pay for a portion of their care. Recipients would also have to prove they have US citizenship or legal immigration status.

In addition, the plan would penalize states that have expanded Medicaid and that provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants using state funds. These states would see a 10% reduction in their federal matching funds for the expansion population. Several states, including California, New York, Utah and Illinois, cover undocumented children, adults or both in state health plans.

And it would limit states’ ability to levy taxes on health care providers, the revenue which states use to boost provider rates and fund health-related initiatives, among other uses. All but one state levy at least one type of provider tax, which some Republicans claim is a scheme by states to get more federal matching funds.

However, the committee did not include several other controversial proposals that would have reduced the share of federal funds that states receive.

The child tax credit would rise to $2,500, up from $2,000, per child from 2025 through 2028, under the Ways and Means Committee plan.

Also, the measure would require that parents, in addition to the child, have Social Security numbers. Currently, parents can claim the credit if they have individual taxpayer identification numbers, which some noncitizens who are not eligible for Social Security numbers use to file federal taxes. The change would mean 2 million fewer children would be eligible next year, according to the JCT.

The Ways and Means Committee plan would create a new “money account for growth and advancement,” or MAGA account. The federal government would provide a one-time $1,000 credit to the accounts of children born from 2025 through 2028 who are US citizens at birth.

The annual contribution limit to the tax-preferred accounts would be $5,000, and money could not be withdrawn before the beneficiary turns 18. After that, the funds could be used for higher education or a first-time home purchase, among other purposes, and taxed at capital gains rates. After a beneficiary turns 31, the account would cease to be a MAGA account.

Certain taxpayers would be able to deduct the income they receive from tips on their tax returns, fulfilling a key Trump campaign promise, under the Ways and Means Committee plan.

But it would only apply to occupations that traditionally receive tips, in an effort to prevent employers and workers from recharacterizing their income as tips to escape taxes. The Treasury secretary would be tasked with publishing a list of such jobs.

Highly compensated individuals, who make more than $160,000 in 2025, would not qualify. The deduction would apply to 4 million tipped workers, according to a fact sheet from Rep. Jason Smith, the committee’s chair.

Likewise, many workers who receive overtime would not have to pay taxes on that extra compensation. It would apply to 80 million hourly workers, according to Smith.

Both breaks would be available to taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, who are the majority of Americans. However, the measures would only be in effect from 2025 through 2028.

Senior citizens would receive a $4,000 increase to their standard deduction from 2025 through 2028, according to the Ways and Means Committee plan. But the benefit would start to phase out for individuals with incomes of more than $75,000 and couples with incomes double that amount.

This measure is aimed at fulfilling Trump’s promise to end taxes on Social Security benefits since lawmakers cannot include such a measure under the rules of budget reconciliation, which Republicans are using to advance the package without Democratic support in the Senate.

The Ways and Means Committee is proposing a new temporary deduction for the interest on car loans, in keeping with Trump’s campaign promise.

Eligible taxpayers could deduct up to $10,000 in interest annually from 2025 through 2028. But the tax break would start to phase out for single filers earning more than $100,000 and married couples earning $200,000.

It applies to taxpayers who get car loans starting in 2025 and who buy passenger vehicles that had their final assembly in the US.

The Ways and Means Committee plan would temporarily boost the standard deduction by $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples.

And it includes some measures that would benefit wealthy Americans. It would make permanent the larger estate tax exemption, which would be set at $15 million per person for 2026 and would be indexed to inflation thereafter.

Plus, it would make permanent a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns. It would beef up that deduction to 23%, up from 20%. These so-called pass-through businesses include partnerships, such as those formed by lawyers, doctors or investors.

The Ways and Means Committee plan would also hike the current limit on state and local tax deductions to $30,000 annually for married couples, up from $10,000. But the full amount would be limited to those making $400,000 or less, before it starts to phase out.

For single filers, the cap would be raised to $15,000 for those earning $200,000 or less, before phasing out.

The change would take effect starting in 2026.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states, including California and New York, have been demanding an increase to the so-called SALT cap for years since it disproportionately hits their constituents. The limit mainly affects higher-income residents in those states. Four New York representatives said last week that raising the cap to only $30,000 was “insulting.”

Republicans introduced the cap as part of their 2017 tax cuts package as a way to help pay for the sweeping legislation. Trump had promised to eliminate the cap on the campaign trail last year, but doing so would be very costly.

The Ways and Means Committee would restore a tax break from the 2017 tax package that allowed businesses to fully write off the cost of equipment in the first year it was purchased. The incentive has been phasing out since 2023.

Also, the plan would once again allow businesses to write off the cost of research and development in the year it was incurred. The TCJA required that companies deduct those expenses over five years, starting in 2022.

The two provisions would expire after 2029.

However, the plan would limit writing off the purchases of professional sports teams.

Some universities currently pay a 1.4% tax on the net investment income from their endowments. The Ways and Means Committee plan calls for raising that rate to as high as 21%, depending on the endowment’s size.

Similarly, private foundations would see their tax rate jump to as much as 10%, up from roughly 1.4%.

The Ways and Means Committee’s plan would also raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

Congress needs to raise the debt limit before its August recess to prevent the nation from defaulting on its obligations, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote to lawmakers last week.

Under a plan released by the House Agriculture Committee on Monday, more food stamp recipients would have to work to qualify for benefits.

Currently, adults ages 18 to 54 without dependent children can only receive food stamps for three months over a 36-month period unless they work 20 hours a week or are eligible for an exemption.

The committee’s plan would extend the work requirement to those ages 55 to 64, as well as to parents of children between the ages of 7 and 18. Plus it would curtail states’ ability to receive work requirement waivers in difficult economic times, limiting them only to counties with unemployment rates above 10%.

The measure would also require states to pay for a portion of the benefit costs – at least 5% – for the first time, starting in fiscal year 2028. States with higher payment error rates would have to shoulder more of the burden – as much as 25% of the costs for those with error rates of at least 10%.

Plus, states would have to pick up 75% of the administrative costs, rather than 50%.

Advocates quickly criticized the proposals, saying recipients could lose crucial food assistance and states would be on the hook for millions of dollars, which could lead them to cut benefits and eligibility.

Some 42 million Americans are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps.

The proposals from House Republicans would effectively deal a blow to the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s major clean energy law passed in 2022.

The proposals would end consumer tax credits helping lower the cost of electric vehicles and buying energy efficient appliance, rooftop solar and insulation. It would also phase out tax credits that businesses could use to build new electricity generation like wind and solar, as well as clean energy sources that the Trump administration has voiced support for, including nuclear and geothermal energy.

Tax credits that remain largely intact include one that would allow the oil and gas industry to capture and sequester the planet-warming pollution it emits.

Elsewhere, the House Energy and Commerce committee proposed clawing back unspent IRA funds, targeting a $27 billion grant program at the Environmental Protection Agency and other EPA and Energy Department programs.

Over 20 House Republicans have called for the preservation of several tax credits that would be killed by the proposed bill, with some saying it’s a red line given how much money and jobs have come to their districts following the Inflation Reduction Act.

Here’s what we know about what other House committees have already voted to approve:

The Education and Workforce Committee’s plan would dramatically restructure the way students can borrow from the federal government for college, as well as make big changes to the popular Pell grant program. It is seeking to find about $330 billion worth of savings by limiting the federal role in the student borrowing process.

The measure would cap the total amount of federal aid a student can receive annually at the “median cost of college” and end economic hardship and unemployment deferments. Plus, it would bar loan servicers from temporarily suspending student loan payments for more than nine months over a two-year period.

The changes also include terminating the subsidized loan program for undergraduate students and the Graduate PLUS loan program for new borrowers, with a three-year exception for students with such loans. The plan would amend the maximum annual and aggregate loan limits for unsubsidized loans, as well as require undergraduate students to exhaust their unsubsidized loan options before their parents can take out Parent PLUS loans.

In addition, the measure would terminate all income-contingent repayment plans — including Biden’s SAVE plan, which has been blocked in federal court. Instead, borrowers would have a choice of a standard repayment plan or a repayment assistance plan based on borrowers’ income.

The committee is proposing alterations to the Pell grant program, including requiring students attend school at least half time and increasing the number of credit hours needed for full-time enrollment. But it would expand eligibility for such grants for students enrolled in short-term workforce programs.

And the measure would create “skin-in-the-game accountability” for colleges participating in the Direct Loan program by requiring them to reimburse the Department of Education for a portion of loans that aren’t fully repaid.

It would also establish a “Promise” program to provide colleges with performance-based grants of up to $5,000 per federal student aid recipient. The colleges must provide students with a guaranteed maximum total price for their program of study based on income and financial needs categories. The formula would reward institutions for strong earnings outcomes, low tuition, and enrollment and graduation of low-income students.

Immigrants applying for asylum and work authorization, as well as those applying for humanitarian parole and temporary protected status, would have to pay new or higher fees, under the House Judiciary Committee’s plan.

Asylum seekers and parolees would have to pay $1,000 to apply and $550 for an initial work permit, for instance. Plus, sponsors of unaccompanied children would have to pay up to $3,500.

The measure also provides $45 billion to build new immigration detention facilities, including family detention centers, to allow the detention of at least 100,000 people a day, on average. It supports hiring 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, including money for retention and signing bonuses for the agents, and provides funding for 1 million annual deportations through ground and air transportation.

And it provides $1.3 billion to hire immigration judges and support staff, as well as to expand courtroom capacity.

The House Homeland Security Committee is proposing tens of billions of dollars to bolster border security, including $46.5 billion to expand and modernize the border barrier system. Planned investments include the completion of 700 miles of primary wall, the construction of 900 miles of river barriers, and the replacement of 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers.

The measure would also provide $5 billion to acquire, construct or improve Customs and Border Protection facilities. Plus, it would funnel $4.1 billion for the agency to hire and train 3,000 new Border Patrol agents, 5,000 new Office of Field Operations customs officers, 200 new Air and Marine Operations agents, 290 support staff, and eligible retired agents and officers. It would also invest $2 billion in annual retention bonuses and signing incentives.

It would provide nearly $1.1 billion to strengthen technology to detect and disrupt the smuggling of illegal drugs and people into the US, and $2.7 billion for border surveillance technology, including tunnel detection capability and unmanned aircraft systems.

And the plan includes $1 billion for security and planning for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as $625 million for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. It would also provide $300 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the reimbursement of extra law enforcement costs for protecting presidential residences.

The plan approved by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, which is tasked with cutting at least $50 billion in spending, would require federal employees to contribute more to their pensions and make other changes to their retirement benefits.

The most significant measure would be raising the Federal Employees Retirement System contribution rate for many current civilian and postal employees to 4.4% of their salary. Those hired prior to 2014 generally contribute either 0.8% or 3.1%, while more recent hires generally already contribute 4.4%.

For new, younger retirees, the plan would also eliminate the additional retirement annuity payment they would receive until they are eligible for Social Security benefits. And it would base retirees’ pension payments on their average highest five earning years, instead of highest three years, as well as reduce retirement system contributions for employees who agree to serve “at will,” giving them fewer job protections.

Plus, the plan would institute a fee for employees’ appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which would be refunded to them if they win their appeal. And it would require a comprehensive audit of workers’ dependents enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, including the verification of marriage and birth certificates.

Under the House Transportation Committee’s plan, electric vehicles would have to pay an annual registration fee of $250 and hybrid vehicles would be assessed an annual fee of $100. The funds would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund.

But a proposal to levy a $20 annual tax on gas vehicles was dropped, after it faced swift pushback from conservatives.

The committee’s plan would also eliminate seven green programs authorized by the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including the Low-Carbon Transportation Materials Grants Program and the Federal Aviation Administration’s Alternative Fuel and Low-Emission Aviation Technology Program.

The committee is tasked with providing $10 billion in savings.

The House Transportation Committee would appropriate $12.5 billion for the modernization of the nation’s air traffic control system. The funds would begin replacing outdated technology and enhance the hiring of air traffic controllers.

The plan proposed by the House Financial Services Committee would limit the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s authority to draw funds from the Federal Reserve. Also, it would essentially eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which was established by Congress to oversee the audits of public companies, by shifting its responsibilities to the Securities and Exchange Commission and barring it from collecting fees from companies and brokers and dealers.

The House Armed Services Committee is proposing to add roughly $150 billion to strengthen the nation’s defense programs.

The committee’s plan includes nearly $25 billion for Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense initiative, which calls for developing a space-based system and quickly accelerating defense capabilities against hypersonic threats. It would provide nearly $34 billion for ship building and more than $20 billion for munitions, including ramping up the domestic production of rare earth and critical minerals.

Also, the measure would funnel more than $8.5 billion to improving service members’ quality of life, including renovating military barracks, providing supplemental payments of the Basic Housing Allowance, expanding educational opportunities and child care fee assistance, and broadening professional licensure assistance programs for military spouses.

The House Judiciary Committee’s plan would defund the enforcement of contempt orders if the judge had previously not ordered the plaintiffs in the case to put up a security bond with a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order granted in their favor. The goal is to stop frivolous lawsuits, according to a committee spokesperson.

,EVs,2025-05-14 02:01:04+00:00,TechCrunch,GM's new 'manganese-rich' battery promises cheaper EVs in 2028 | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,,,,,https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/gms-new-manganese-rich-battery-promises-cheaper-evs-in-2028/,"“With LMR, we can deliver over 400-mile range in our trucks while significantly reducing our battery costs,” Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, told TechCrunch.
The LMR chemistry will have 0-2% cobalt, 30-40% nickel, and 60-70% manganese.
LMR battery packs will contain prismatic cells instead of pouches.
The new cells will be made by Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution.
GM’s LMR research has been underway for a decade.","General Motors revealed Tuesday a new battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which it says should slash costs while delivering driving range that’s just shy of the most advanced batteries on the market.

“With LMR, we can deliver over 400-mile range in our trucks while significantly reducing our battery costs,” Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, told TechCrunch.

LMR will also dramatically reduce the amount of nickel and cobalt compared with GM’s most advanced cells, two critical minerals that aren’t readily available from domestic sources in the United States.

Today, the Chevrolet Silverado EV uses nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells to drive 492 miles on a full charge. That impressive range comes with a hefty price tag. The electric trucks start at over $73,000 for the general public (a fleet version costs less). GM is planning a version with cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells, which would drop the price by $6,000, but also cuts range to 350 miles.

The new technology would preserve the LFP price cuts without sacrificing as much range.

GM says the new cells will be cheaper for a few reasons. For one, manganese is cheaper than cobalt or nickel. The LMR chemistry will have 0-2% cobalt, 30-40% nickel, and 60-70% manganese. That’s significantly less than today’s leading NMC cells, which are up to 10% cobalt and 80% nickel.

Previous attempts at manganese-rich batteries have tended to degrade quickly. GM thinks it has cracked the problem. The automaker experimented with a range of materials and manufacturing processes to arrive at the current formulation.

LMR battery packs will contain prismatic cells instead of pouches. Today’s Ultium batteries use the latter. Kelty said switching to prismatic cells, which have a rigid shell, will help the company build a battery pack with more than 50% fewer parts.

“It’s a huge, huge cost savings we’ll get,” he said.

GM has big plans for LMR, with the chemistry potentially spreading throughout the EV lineup. Andy Oury, business planning manager at GM, said that LMR could “take up a huge chunk in the middle” of the market, pushing LFP to entry-level vehicles and pricey NMC to applications that need long range and high energy density.

The new cells will be made by Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution. Through Ultium, the two companies have invested billions of dollars in battery manufacturing in the United States.

Both have been pursuing LMR for years. GM has more than 50 patents on LMR, though LG has also been working on the technology itself. Kelty acknowledged it’s possible that LG could make its own version of LMR cells that don’t infringe on GM’s patents, making the chemistry more widely available. “It’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out,” Kelty said.

GM’s LMR research has been underway for a decade. Its efforts kicked into high gear in the last couple years as engineers successfully produced large-format cells similar to those in EVs on the road today.

GM has made about 300 large format cells so far, and its testing regime equates to around 1.5 million miles of typical driving, said Kushal Narayanaswamy, director of advanced cell engineering at the automaker.

That leaves just a few short years for the company to modify its existing manufacturing plants to accommodate the new chemistry and then scale up production. Scaling, in particular, tripped up the first Ultium cells.

Kelty is confident that GM can hit the 2028 target.

“It meets all our performance metrics, we have a partner that’s going to manufacture it, and we’ve got a manufacturing location,” he said. “The other thing is, the supply chain is much more local than high-nickel or LFP, so we’re really incentivized to do this. There’s a lot of things coming together here that really make us want to go quickly.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/A00005-3-4.jpg?resize=1200,633",N,,2025-05-13 22:05:47.463422

Blasty Bough Brewing Company, a farm-to-kettle brewery in Epsom, New Hampshire, is one of them.

Founded in the mid-2000s as a working farm, Blasty Bough blends its agricultural roots with forward-thinking energy solutions. The brewery pairs craft beer and live music with its self-described secret weapon: sheep grazing beneath rows of solar panels.

Sunshine as income

Blasty Bough’s solar array, installed by ReVision Energy, produces 800 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) more than the brewery needs each month, turning sunshine into a small but steady income stream. As the brewery continues to grow, it expects to eventually use all the power it generates — making solar not just a sustainable choice, but a strategic investment in its future.

The solar-powered setup underscores the brewery’s commitment to sustainability, serving as a model for clean energy integration in craft brewing.

Brewing with clean energy

Revision Energy first connected with Blasty Bough owner Dave Stewart in 2018, when he began exploring solar as a way to align the brewery’s agricultural roots with a more sustainable future. For Stewart, clean energy wasn’t just a practical choice—it was, in his words, “the right thing to do.” It also offered a way to lower energy expenses and support the local economy.

The solar project truly took shape in 2022, as most good ideas do, over a couple of beers. The connection was sparked at the brewery itself, where early conversations between Stewart and ReVision Energy laid the groundwork for a collaboration. Over the wooden bar, we began planning a project that paired our local renewable energy expertise with Stewart’s vision for the future of the brewery.

“Beer is no longer the only driver — people come for the full experience, and sustainability is a big part of that,” says Stewart.

We worked with Stewart to plan a system tailored to the brewery’s energy usage and future expansion. The final system was installed between October 16 and November 27, 2023. It consists of 182 QCELLS Q.PEAK DUO XL-G10.3 BFG 480W solar modules, paired with nine SMA SB 7.7-ITP-US-41 inverters and mounted on APA Ready Rack fixed-tilt ground mount racking.

The 87.3 kW direct current (DC) system produces more than 9,000 kWh of clean energy each month. It currently exceeds demand, feeding excess energy back into the grid and generating valuable credits.

Raising a Glass to REAP

Blasty Bough applied for a REAP grant during the March 2023 cycle. With our help, Stewart submitted the application just in time. Though the USDA had not yet awarded the grant, they confirmed the submission was complete, clearing the way for the project to proceed at the owner’s risk.

REAP empowers rural businesses to move forward with confidence, even before grant funds are disbursed. Once Stewart’s application was confirmed as complete, he made the proactive choice to begin construction. With Epsom’s frozen winter soil approaching, the timing proved critical. Thanks to swift coordination between our teams, the project broke ground in time, avoiding costly seasonal delays and maximizing the impact of the REAP grant.

Ultimately, the grant reimbursed roughly one third of the total project cost, making the solar installation not only possible, but financially viable at a critical time. Although REAP funding was temporarily frozen in January 2025, it was eventually reinstated — a reminder of how important it is to protect American energy incentives from shifting political winds. As funding for clean energy programs faces renewed challenges, the stakes for rural farmers and small businesses remain high.

“The USDA’s REAP program has been a game-changer for family farms and small businesses across New England — helping them lower energy costs, strengthen local economies, and reduce their carbon footprint,” says Dan Weeks, vice president of business development at ReVision Energy. “Uncertainty around future funding puts these real, community-level benefits at risk. We hope policymakers recognize how vital this program is for rural prosperity and energy independence.”

Sheep grazing a crucial element

Blasty Bough Brewing incorporates solar grazing as a practical, sustainable solution for vegetation management. Sheep from a nearby farm graze the fields beneath the solar array, reducing maintenance needs while benefiting from shade. This eliminates the need for fossil fuel-powered mowers and aligns with the brewery’s agricultural values.

“We have always kept sheep — they do their job and require almost nothing in return,” Stewart notes.

This approach not only supports local farmers and operational efficiency, but it also contributes to the site’s visual appeal and sustainability goals.

Brewing Up Future Sustainability

The brewery has plans to eventually open a bed and breakfast, transforming the property into a full countryside retreat. Stewart sees the solar installation as a way to prepare operations for future growth while offering a sustainable getaway for guests.

Blasty Bough now produces more energy than it uses, turning clean power into a dual source of savings and revenue. Looking ahead, the brewery plans to expand operations, eliminate reliance on oil heating, and operate entirely on solar power, including electric vehicle charging, further advancing its long-term sustainability goals.

Taken together, these new requirements would kill most, if not all, of the tax credits’ value.

It is also made worse by the House GOP plan to phase out the tax credits.","On Monday, the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee released the first draft of its rewrite of America’s clean energy tax credits.

The proposal might look, at first, like a cautious paring back of the tax credits. But the proposal amounts to a backdoor repeal of the policies, according to energy system and tax analysts.

“The bill is written to come across as reasonable, but the devil is in the details,” Robbie Orvis, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate think tank, told me. “It may not be literally the worst text we envisioned seeing, but it’s probably close.”

The proposal would strangle new energy development so quickly that it could raise power costs by as much as 7% over the next decade, according to the Rhodium Group, an energy and policy analysis firm.

Senate Republicans have already indicated that the proposal is unworkable. But to understand why, it’s worth diving into the specific requirements that render the proposal so destructive.

The clean energy tax credits are one of the centerpieces of American energy policy. They’re meant to spur companies to deploy new forms of energy technology, such as nuclear fusion or advanced geothermal wells, and simultaneously to cut carbon pollution from the American power grid.

The U.S. government has long used the tax code to encourage the build-out of wind turbines or solar panels. But when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, they rewrote a pair of key tax credits so that any technology that generates clean electricity would receive financial support.

Under the law as enacted, these clean electricity tax credits provide 10 years of support to any electricity project — no matter howit generates power — for the foreseeable future. But the new Republican proposal would begin phasing down the value of the credit starting in 2029, and end the program entirely in 2032.

That might sound like a slow and even reasonable phase-out. But a series of smaller changes to the law’s text introduce significant uncertainty about which projects would continue to qualify for the tax credit in the interim. Taken together, these new requirements would kill most, if not all, of the tax credits’ value.

Here are three reasons why the Republican proposal would prove so devastating to the American clean electricity industry.

1. The new proposal introduces profound uncertainty about power plant financing for individual developers.

The new Ways and Means proposal begins to phase out the clean energy tax credits immediately. The proposal cuts the value of the tax credit by 20% per year starting in 2029, and ends the credit entirely in 2032.

But the GOP proposal changes a key phrase that helps financiers invest confidently in a given project.

Under the law as it stands today, developers can’t claim a tax credit until a project is “placed in service” — meaning that it is generating electricity and selling it to the grid. But a project qualifies for a tax credit in the year that construction on that project begins.

For example, imagine a utility that begins building a new geothermal power plant this year, but doesn’t finish construction and connect it to the grid until 2029. Under current law, that company could qualify for the value of the credit as it stands today, but it wouldn’t begin to get money back on its taxes until 2029.

But the GOP proposal would change this language. Under the House Republican text, projects only qualify for a tax credit when they are “placed in service,” regardless of when construction begins. This means that the new geothermal power plant in the earlier example could only get tax credits as set at the 2029 value — regardless of when construction begins.

What’s more, if work on the project were delayed, say by a natural disaster or unexpected equipment shortage, and the power plant’s completion date was pushed into the following year, then the project would only qualify for credits as set at the 2030 value.

In other words, companies and utilities would have no certainty about a tax credit’s value until a project is completed and placed in service. Any postponement or slowdown at any part of the process — even if for a reason totally outside of a developer’s control — could reduce a tax credit’s value.

This makes the tax credits far less dependable than they are today. Generally, companies have more ability to plan around when construction on a power plant begins than they do over when it is placed in service.

This change will significantly raise financing costs for new energy projects of all types because it means that companies won’t be able to finalize their capital stack until a project is completed and turned on. The most complicated and adventurous projects — such as new geothermal, nuclear, or fusion power plants — could face the highest cost inflation.

2. The proposal imposes unworkably strict rules on the parts, components, and minerals used in clean energy projects.

The Inflation Reduction Act as it stands today attaches a “foreign entity of concern” rule to its $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers.

In order to qualify for that EV tax credit, automakers had to cut the percentage of Chinese-processed minerals and battery components that appear in their electric models every year. This phased in gradually over time — the idea being that while China dominates the EV and battery supply chain today, the requirement would provide a consistent spur to reshore production.

Somewhat ironically, the GOP proposal ditches the EV tax credit and its accompanying foreign sourcing rules. But it applies a strict version of the foreign entity of concern rule to every other tax credit in the law, including the clean electricity tax credits.

Under the House proposal, no project can qualify for the tax credits unless it receives no “material support” from a Chinese-linked entity. The language defines “material support” aggressively and expansively — it means any “any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral” that is “extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled.”

This provision, in other words, would essentially disqualify the use of any Chinese-made part, subcomponent, or metal in the construction of a clean electricity project, although the rule includes a partial and narrow carve-out for some components that are bought from a third-party. Even a mistakenly Chinese-sourced bolt could result in a project losing millions of dollars of tax credits.

Technically, the law also disqualifies the use of goods from other “foreign entities of concern” as defined under U.S. law, which include Russia, Iran, and North Korea. But China is the United States’ third largest trading partner, and it is the only manufacturer of the type of goods that matter to the law.

Solar projects would face immediate challenges under the new rule. China and its domestic companies command more than 80% of the market share for all stages of the solar panel manufacturing process, according to the International Energy Agency.

But then again, the proposal would be an issue for virtually all energy projects. Copper wiring, steel frames, grams of key metals — even geothermal plants rely on individual Chinese-made industrial components, according to Seaver Wang, an analyst at the Breakthrough Institute. These parts also intermingle on the global market, meaning that companies can’t be certain where a given part was made or where it comes from.

These new and stricter rules would kick in two years after the reconciliation bill passes, which likely means 2027.

This provision by itself would be unworkable. But it is made even worse by being coupled to the tax credit’s change to a “placed in service” standard. That’s because projects that are already under construction today might not meet these new foreign entity rules, essentially stripping them of tax credits that companies had already been banking on.

These projects have assumed that they will qualify for the tax credits’ full value, no matter when their power plant is completed, because they have already begun construction. But the GOP proposal would change this retroactively, possibly threatening the financial viability of energy projects that grid managers have been assuming will come online in the next few years.

In some ways, these two changes taken together are “worse than repeal,” Mike O’Boyle, an Energy Innovation analyst, told me. “A number of projects under construction now will lose eligibility.""

It is also made worse by the House GOP plan to phase out the tax credits. If companies could plan on the tax credits remaining on the books long-term then the foreign entity rules might spur the creation of a larger domestic — or at least non-Chinese — supply chain for some clean energy inputs. But because the credits will phase out by 2032 regardless, fewer projects will qualify, and it won’t be worth it for companies to invest in alternative supply chains.

3. The GOP proposal would end developers’ ability to transfer their tax credits to other firms.

Finally, the House Republican proposal would end companies’ ability to sell the value of tax credits to other firms. The IRA had made it easier for utilities and developers to transfer the value of tax credits to other companies — essentially allowing companies with a lot of tax liability, such as banks, to acquire the rights to renewable developers’ credits.

The GOP proposal ends that right for every tax credit, even those that Republicans have historically looked on more favorably, such as the tax credit that rewards companies for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

This change — coupled with the foreign entity and placed-in-service rules — will have an impact today on power markets by further gumming up the pipeline of new energy projects planned across the country, according to Advait Arun, an analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise.

The end to transferability “functionally imposes higher marginal tax rates on all of these projects,” Arun told me. “The prices that developers will get for their tax credits on the tax equity market today will be a lot lower than normal.”

That could significantly raise the cost of any new energy projects that get planned. And that will lead in the medium term to a further slowdown in the growth of electricity supply, just as turbine shortages have made it more difficult than ever to build a new natural gas power plant.

While many of these changes may seem academic, they will hit energy consumers faster than legislators might realize. Natural gas prices in the U.S. have been unusually high in 2025. A slowdown in the growth of non-fossil energy will further stress natural gas supplies, raising power prices.

Taken together, Orvis told me, these changes to the IRA “will increase the price of the vast majority of new capacity coming online next year,” Orvis said. “It’s an immediate price hike for new energy, and you can’t replace that with new gas.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDIwNzIwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTgwNDU4Nn0.ysB5ThxsQQimLGeiTdvtmbKRW2Q2v81hiMw7-xLLYfg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-13 22:05:58.130351

To offset extending tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, Republicans are searching high and low for spending cuts. And that means wiping away any policy initiatives — even, perhaps especially, the successful ones — that were enacted under President Joe Biden.

Republicans particularly have homed in on rolling back the substantial recent progress on fighting climate change. Many Americans are likely unaware that we are in the midst of a green energy revolution, driven not only by market forces but by government at all levels. But the GOP is determined to stop success in its tracks.

It all adds up to a future of more gas-guzzlers and more pollution.

The Trump administration, in its zeal to demolish any government program meant to address climate change, often seems to be violating existing law — for instance, by refusing to spend money that had been appropriated by Congress. As a result, many of those efforts are tied up in court. But the mega bill under consideration in Congress is moved under the budget reconciliation process, which means it can pass with a simple majority. That offers the White House and its GOP allies an opportunity to make just about whatever spending changes they like.

This week, a group of House committees released the text of their portions of the bill, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee; those two are where the assault on climate spending is centered. The fattest target for cuts is the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in 2022. Widely regarded as the most important climate law in history, the IRA established a panoply of programs for conservation, climate resilience, emissions reduction and green energy development. Yet since many of those programs roll out spending over years or even decades, Republicans can be cut them off just as they’re ramping up.

The highest-profile program may be the IRA’s $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, which the Ways and Means bill looks to repeal (though in a complicated, years-long fashion). Republicans also want to loosen auto emission standards and eliminate funding for new kinds of zero-emission vehicles. It all adds up to a future of more gas-guzzlers and more pollution.

EVs are still a small portion of the American market; the IRA sought to help U.S. manufacturers catch up with the rest of the world, where EVs are taking off in both production and adoption. The Chinese EV industry in particular has left us in the dust. Republicans, however, seem determined to keep us in the last century.

The GOP legislation would also gut the Loan Programs Office, a venture capital operation within the Department of Energy. The LPO, created in 2005 under a law passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush, funds promising companies that banks and private venture capitalists might not back. It has been successful at helping many innovative American firms develop new technologies and bring them to market. In 2010, for example, it provided a $465 million loan to a fledgling car company named Tesla.

No project is too small or unobjectionable to escape the knife.

Republicans are also looking to phase out tax credits for wind and solar development, as well as homeowner credits for things like energy audits and heat pumps. They want to claw back billions of dollars from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a kind of green bank meant to fund local projects promoting conservation and clean energy use. And while they plan to largely preserve a popular advanced manufacturing tax credit the IRA created, they want to phase it out for wind power projects.

No project is too small or unobjectionable to escape the knife; as E&E News summarized, the bills “would repeal a variety of IRA programs designed to reduce air pollution at schools and ports, reduce emissions from diesel engines and construction materials, and promote carbon monitoring initiatives.” In addition, the Ways and Means Committee bill seeks to promote fossil fuels through measures such as expediting permits for liquid natural gas export facilities.

Climate advocates had hoped that since so much of the government’s climate spending benefits Republican districts, from battery production to rural energy conservation, that spending might be spared the cuts the party is eager to make to fund its tax cut for the wealthy (which, we should keep in mind, is the primary justification for all this slashing and burning). That might happen here and there — this process still has far to go, and there may be cases where a member of Congress manages to preserve a program that benefits their district.

But the big picture on climate is grim. Unlike the Republican effort to slash Medicaid spending and kick millions of people off their health coverage, which has divided the party and generated growing controversy, climate policy attracts far less notice. The climate measures put in place under the Biden administration — as well as those that date back much further — comprise a disparate collection of initiatives spread across multiple departments, rather than one big program that millions of people understand they have an interest in preserving.

Under Joe Biden, the U.S. took great strides forward in the fight against climate change. He can legitimately claim to have accomplished more on climate change than any president before him. Republicans can’t undo all of it; some funds have been spent, and some programs are so beneficial to GOP constituencies that they’ll probably be left alone.

But the setback to our efforts to stop the warming of the planet will be severe. Unfortunately, many of these cuts will go unnoticed by most of the public, which means there will be little political cost for those who would undermine efforts to secure a stable future. And we’ll have to try all over again to use government’s power to address climate change — only we’ll be starting from even further back.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-donald-trump-mike-johnson-vl-1027a-a5d0b1.jpg",N,,2025-05-13 22:06:03.392396

This alarming outlook comes as US policymakers plan to impose a new 25% tariff on imported vehicles to bring manufacturing jobs back home.","The repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) would wipe out thousands of US jobs, especially in the booming EV and battery manufacturing sectors, according to a report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).

IRA job creation is at stake

Since the IRA’s passage in 2022, the ICCT writes that automakers and battery manufacturers have committed around $125 billion to US-based projects, creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs. (The BlueGreen Alliance’s EV Jobs Hub puts announced EV investment even higher, at $212.5 billion.)

The ICCT’s new study, “How the Inflation Reduction Act is driving US job growth across the electric vehicle industry,” projects that the IRA would drive a net creation of more than 118,000 new direct jobs across the US EV, battery, and charging industries from 2026 to 2030.

However, if key provisions of the IRA are rolled back, up to 130,000 direct manufacturing jobs would be lost by 2030. An IRA repeal would cause direct job losses of about 30,600 in vehicle production, 85,000 in battery manufacturing, and 14,200 in charging infrastructure.

Moreover, another 310,000 indirectly connected jobs could vanish by 2030. Stephanie Searle, chief program officer at ICCT, said, “These job losses would cascade throughout the economy, affecting not just autoworkers but also employees in mineral processing, retail, hospitality, and others dependent on a strong manufacturing base.”

According to ICCT’s analysis, states that have become hubs for EV and battery production – like Michigan, Texas, and Tennessee – face the most significant losses. Michigan alone can lose nearly 16,000 jobs, with Texas and Tennessee potentially shedding around 13,000 jobs. The ripple effects would extend beyond factories, impacting retail, hospitality, and mineral processing businesses.

This alarming outlook comes as US policymakers plan to impose a new 25% tariff on imported vehicles to bring manufacturing jobs back home. However, ICCT’s study demonstrates that Joe Biden’s signature policy has already achieved a domestic manufacturing boom and job creation.

“Most of the job losses associated with IRA repeal are in the Midwest and southern states, where significant EV and battery investments have been announced,” noted Peter Slowik, co-author of the report. “The 15 states where we project the greatest number of jobs at risk are Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Nevada, California, Kentucky, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Arizona, New York, and Alabama.”

Electrek’s Take

The current administration claims to want to create domestic manufacturing and jobs. It just wants to do it with the stick (tariffs) instead of the carrot (IRA tax credits). The thing is, the carrot is already working. Investors have already said they will pull out without incentives. The stick is going to beat the EV and battery industry to death, and some states are going to suffer a lot more than others. The irony is, some of those states are the biggest supporters of the Trump administration’s policies.

The city's Neighborhood Solar Initiative, launched two years ago, is now in full swing. As CBS News reported, the city installs solar panels in open patches that are near neighborhoods full of vacant properties or homes in disarray.

Homeowners in the area could then be eligible for up to $15,000 in energy-efficient upgrades.

One such homeowner, Haley Henley, told CBS her home had major electrical problems that would cost thousands of dollars to repair. But thanks to the Neighborhood Solar Initiative, she was able to replace fuses throughout her house and get a new furnace and water heater.

""I was in tears, I was so happy,"" Henley said. ""I'm just grateful. I'm thankful for everything that they did.""

The plan is part of Detroit's Transition to Clean Energy. Noting that 70% of the city's planet-warming gas pollution came from generating electricity, Detroit pledged to source all municipal electricity from clean energy sources within the next 10 years.

""This program is to help the city become more greener and to have a greener footprint,"" Detroit Department of Neighborhoods director Erinn Harris told CBS.

Community solar programs, such as those Detroit is installing, can be viable options for those who can't install solar panels at their own home. There are many reasons why installing your own panels can be tricky — you could rent or have a strict homeowners' association, may not have the rooftop space, or simply don't want to pay the upfront costs that come with solar.

Community solar involves subscribing to a local solar farm in exchange for getting clean energy through your current power grid.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the Congressional Review Act resolutions of disapproval aimed at overturning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s federal preemption waivers that led California to set unattainable standards and ban gasoline and diesel cars and trucks. These resolutions would disapprove the EPA waivers for the following regulations adopted by California: (1) Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II), S.J. Res. 45 (2) the “Omnibus” Low NOx, S.J. Res 47, and (3) Advanced Clean Trucks, S.J. Res 46. In light of the broad impact of these preemption waivers on consumers and the nationwide vehicle marketplace, among other considerations, EPA has appropriately designated them to be rules subject to Congressional Review Act scrutiny. Disapproval of the rules is essential to ensuring a unified national vehicle marketplace that promotes continued progress on fuel economy while safeguarding economic growth and consumer interests.

The ban on sales of internal combustion engine-powered cars and trucks, central to ACC II and ACT, poses significant challenges. Adding on top the Omnibus rule, combined they would severely restrict consumer choice and impose substantial costs on businesses, not only in California but also in other states that have adopted California’s regulatory programs. By mandating adoption of technologies not yet commercially viable at scale, and on a recklessly accelerated timeline, these rules risk significant increases to transportation costs and could hinder the movement of people and goods nationwide. Additionally, factors such as insufficient vehicle charging infrastructure, which are beyond the control of manufacturers, further deter market adoption of electric vehicles and exacerbate compliance challenges. Allowing California to set de facto national standards creates a fragmented regulatory landscape, complicating supply chains and compliance for businesses operating across state lines. This patchwork approach undermines the efficiency and predictability needed for thriving interstate commerce.

We urge Congress to act swiftly in passing these resolutions of disapproval to prevent the detrimental effects of such costly and impractical regulations. The Chamber is committed to collaborating with policymakers to ensure that federal regulations are fair, pragmatic, effective, and conducive to economic growth.

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by a straight party-line Democrat vote and signed by President Biden three years ago, has undoubtedly incentivized several hundreds of billions of dollars in new and pending clean energy and microgrid investments.

These energized many renewable project supporters but left skeptics wondering if the juice is worth the squeeze.

The future inevitability of IRA lighting the path toward a more decarbonized and decentralized power sector is certainly in doubt, now, as the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is crafting a new budget bill to weaken and even kill some aspects of the IRA bundle of tax credits and subsidies for renewable energy, efficiency and distributed power.

The proposed new House funding bill would phase out tax credits and funding for decarbonized energy projects such as electric vehicles and reallocate billions in funding from IRA-supported programs to other, more GOP-favored programs.

An analysis of IRA funding for microgrids, done by project developer and operations firm PowerSecure several years ago, estimated that the tax credits could help cut microgrid upfront costs by 10 to 50%. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for microgrid controllers was expanded by 30% under the IRA, according to the report by PowerSecure.

According to multiple news reports, one of the proposed changes to energy funding contained in the new bill include capping the Investment Tax Credit at 6% (compared with current potential increases to 30%). The ITC and the Production Tax Credit, which predated the IRA but were expanded by it, both would be completely phased out by 2032 and 2031, respectively.

The GOP movement, encouraged by President Trump, could curtail years of momentum-creating record installation of solar and battery storage capacity.

Some clean energy groups have urged caution at making sudden changes in policy.

""With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption,” Jason Grumet, CEO of advocacy group American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in a statement. “It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help. As the legislation moves through the process, we will work with lawmakers to ensure that the final product achieves necessary cost savings while maintaining investment certainty, energy reliability, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”

Some of the transfer provisions with the IRA could be sunset potentially as early as next year, if the House bill is signed into law. Peter DeFazio, managing partner at investor Greenprint Capital, called the GOP bill a “clear shot” at the IRA’s clean energy framework

“For developers, tax equity investors, and manufacturers: this could mean reduced liquidity, less certainty, and higher financing costs—just as IRA-backed project pipelines were gaining traction,” DeFazio wrote in a LinkedIn post outlining some of the House GOP’s more dramatic reversals of IRA funding mechanisms. “Whether this bill passes or not, it sets the stage for a fierce 2025 tax policy fight—and a potential rollback of the most ambitious U.S. climate incentives to date.”

In August 2024, the Biden Administration was still in power and touting its perceived infrastructure-building benefits of the IRA. The bill barely passed the Senate by a 51-50 vote—with then Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaker—but the Biden White House calculated that the resulting law delivered tax credits that helped more than 250,000 Americans acquire electric vehicles and that led to commercial and industrial clean energy projects totaling $900 billion in reported investments.

The Trump White House, however, has criticized the IRA for relying on intermittent energy resources when the looming industrial load requires baseload power such as natural gas and nuclear generation. Trump went as far as declaring a national energy emergency and temporarily freezing components of the IRA funding for renewable projects.

Either way, the legislative battle promises to be a ""fierce policy fight"" on both ends, as DeFazio predicted on his LinkedIn post.","https://img.microgridknowledge.com/files/base/ebm/microgridknowledge/image/2025/05/6823b47e208ba077ada5547c-capitol_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-13 22:06:11.397076

Chris Carnevale

Yesterday, the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the first draft of its section of the GOP’s “one big bill,” and it takes a chainsaw to tax credits for clean energy and transportation. In this draft, nearly all of the federal clean energy credits are taken away from Americans, the result of which would be higher energy costs we all would be forced to pay, and fewer options for taxpayers to reduce their tax bills.

Here is a brief summary of how the draft policy would harm Americans through repealing key tax credits:

Tax credits for electric vehicles (personal and commercial) would mostly be taken away after this year, depriving Americans of 7 years of availability, generally, and hundreds of billions of dollars of credits and reduced transportation costs

Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, solar, and batteries would be taken away after this year, depriving American households of 7-9 years of availability and more than 100 billion dollars

The availability of commercial tax credits for businesses, governments, schools, nonprofit organizations and more to install or produce clean electricity would be cut very short, with most future clean energy projects ineligible for the full credits

Tax credits for businesses to manufacture wind energy components get taken away 5 years early

Tax credits for businesses, governments, schools, nonprofit organizations and more to install geothermal heat pump credits would get 3 years of availability taken away

A provision known as transferability of commercial tax credits would be taken away on various timelines, depending on the specific credit, so the credits will be worth less and harder to monetize

This draft proposal harms American households and is also anti-business. Here are a few reasons why Congress must rethink this reckless approach to energy policy:

1) Clean Energy Tax Credits Lower Energy Costs For Everyone

Clean energy tax credits lower energy costs for all Americans, not just those directly filing for the tax credits. Recent research by multiple independent expert firms has found that repealing the clean electricity tax credits would raise energy costs for consumers and worsen inflation. Repealing two of the biggest tax credits is estimated to raise household energy bills by around $6 billion annually in the next five years and $25 billion annually by 2040. Put another way, annual household utility bills would increase by more than $110 on average, and businesses would see at least a 10% increase in energy costs, which would be passed on to consumers. One of these studies found that North Carolinians, South Carolinians, and Tennesseans would be particularly hard hit by higher electricity prices, facing 10-15% higher prices for residential customers in 2026 and 2029 without the major clean energy tax credits. Without these tax credits, commercial and industrial customers in these states would be paying 15-22% higher electricity prices in 2026 and 2029.

2) Clean Energy Tax Credits Are Incredibly Effective At Reshoring Manufacturing and Spurring The Economy and Job Growth Nationally and Especially in the Southeast

The current energy tax credit law is spurring the largest expansion of factory construction in American history. Companies have announced and advanced 751 new projects, $422 billion in investments, and 406,007 new jobs in the clean energy and clean vehicle industries across the nation since August 2022, when many of the clean energy tax credits were either extended or initially created.

Looking specifically at our region of the Southeast, in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, we have benefited with announcements totaling more than $73 billion in private investment into the clean energy industry supply chain, and more than 92,000 new clean energy jobs.

Repealing or compromising the clean energy and clean vehicle tax credits would jeopardize or reverse this growth. For example, expert research has found that eliminating the clean vehicle tax credits would put as much as 100% of planned construction and expansion of U.S. electric vehicle assembly and half of existing assembly capacity at risk of cancellation or closure, and could put 29-72% of battery cell manufacturing capacity currently operating or online by the end of 2025 at risk of closure, in addition to 100% of other planned facilities.

3) Clean Energy Resources Are Best Positioned to Meet Near-Term Energy Demands for Economic Growth

Power demand is surging with economic growth, seen most dramatically in domestic manufacturing and the computing needs for AI. Solar and battery projects are already in grid interconnection queues and can be built to supply these needs much faster than any other sources of new generation. Large solar and battery projects can typically be online less than 18 months after contracts are signed and permits approved, whereas gas power plants typically take multiple years and nuclear plants take over a decade.

You don’t need to take our word for it…the trade group for investor-owned utilities, Edison Electric Institute, says “In the event of a significant reduction in these tax credits, it is estimated that nearly 75 gigawatts of planned new generation capacity will be cancelled between 2025 and 2032. While some of the planned renewable generation will shift to natural gas, it is not enough to meet the anticipated energy demand during this time frame.”

Republicans in Congress Must Fix This Mess

If the goal of this bill is to lower costs for working families and grow American businesses, this draft bill not only fails miserably, but completely backfires. This bill is widely expected to be a party-line bill, meaning if it’s Republicans who pass it, then it’s Republicans who will bear the blame of these dramatic cost increases on Americans and business-stifling policies. It’s also Republicans who can fix it, starting today. Indeed, quite a number of Republican members of Congress have put themselves on the record in support of continuing the tax credits and keeping the positive impacts the credits bring about (i.e. here, here, and here).

Today is the bill’s first hearing in the Ways and Means Committee. It is expected that the bill will be taken up on the House floor next week, and then will be taken up by the Senate next month. Each of these steps gives opportunities for legislators to fix this mess and preserve the good energy policy that is demonstrably working in favor of Americans.

Repealing tax credits effectively acts as a energy tax increase.","The House Ways and Means Committee issued its proposed language for inclusion in Congress’s massive budget reconciliation package. It’s the opening attempt to reduce spending in order to partially cover the cost of nearly $5 trillion in proposed extensions and expansions of the tax cuts initially passed in 2017. While we are still analyzing the package, our preliminary analysis shows that the impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022. This will raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk.

The opening salvo in the budget reconciliation debate

After the House and Senate agreed to a budget framework last month, work commenced on sorting out how exactly to meet the budget targets established in that bill. House Ways and Means released its contribution, which per the resolution cannot add more than $4.5 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years. The Joint Committee on Taxation, the scorekeepers of the federal fiscal impacts of policy, reckons the Committee’s efforts to extend components of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and add new tax cuts, including modified tax rates, no tax on tips or Social Security benefits, changes to deductions and the alternative minimum tax exemption, as well as extending and increasing the state and local tax deduction cap, would increase the deficit by $5.6 trillion. This means Ways and Means needs to find at least $1.1 trillion in savings to meet the budget target. As a result, the Committee has, among other things, chosen to cut most energy-related tax credits way back to make up the difference.

Last year, House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that his members should use “a scalpel and not a sledgehammer” to make changes to energy-related tax credits. In recent months, he’s walked that back to “somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.” In fact, as a starting point, Ways and Means committee chair Jason Smith (R-MO) and other bill drafters have come down firmly on the sledgehammer end of the spectrum, targeting cuts to a host of provisions, including many that have attracted Republican support in recent weeks and months and historically have enjoyed bipartisan backing.

Major changes in the Ways and Means proposal that will affect energy include:

Termination of a number of tax credits at the end of 2025, including credits for clean vehicles (with a limited exception for some vehicles in 2026), commercial clean vehicles, previously owned clean vehicles, alternative fuel refueling properties, energy efficiency and clean energy improvements for homes, and clean hydrogen

Statutory phase-out of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits beginning in 2029 through 2031 on a placed-in-service basis—a shift from the current commence construction deadlines. De facto sunsetting of the credits as early as 2026 (one year after passage of the bill) with imposition of highly restrictive and administratively complex (and potentially unworkable) limits on sourcing of components, subcomponents, and critical materials used at a facility, or 2027 with the phase-out of the ability for clean energy developers to transfer or sell the tax credits they generate to other entities.

Sunset of the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2031, except for wind components, which sunset after 2027; application of similarly strict sourcing requirements aligned with those proposed for the clean electricity credits; and removal of transferability

Repeal of transferability, which reduces options for monetizing the credits, and implementation of foreign sourcing limits for a host of other credits

Phase-out of the zero-emitting nuclear credit beginning in 2029 through 2031; extension of clean fuels credit through 2031 with changes to what fuels could potentially qualify

Beyond the specific policy changes, the proposal will also require a hollowed-out federal bureaucracy to propose and finalize extremely complicated and unprecedented implementation rules before investors and developers will have the certainty they need to make investment decisions. It took the first Trump administration nearly three years to finalize regulations for implementing the 45Q tax credits for carbon capture, rules which pale in comparison to the complexity of what will be required to implement key portions of the Ways and Means proposal.

Impacts of the provisions

Since Ways and Means just released a draft of the bill yesterday, we have yet to fully model the proposal in its current form. In December, we modeled a potential legislative pathway that fully repealed all major energy components of the Inflation Reduction Act beginning on January 1, 2025. For some credits like clean vehicles and residential clean energy, the Ways and Means proposal offers just one more year of credits compared to our repeal scenario. For the technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits, the Ways and Means proposal’s harshest restrictions on material from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) are likely to begin in 2026—so two more years of credit would be available compared to our repeal scenario. Because of the high degree of consistency with the Ways and Means proposal and our previous modeling, our prior work provides useful insights into the expected direction and magnitude of impact of these policy changes. As discussed above, the administrative complexity of implementing these rules also likely puts significant downward pressure on near-term investments, further aligning our previous modeling with this proposal. We plan to refine our modeling after the Ways and Means mark-up to reflect where the committee lands.

We compare modeling outcomes with and without these changes to quantify the impact of the proposal—in both cases holding constant a “rollback” regulatory environment as a baseline where all major Biden-era environmental regulations are removed. The Trump administration and Congress have taken numerous actions to follow through on these rollbacks, the latest of which is the House Energy and Commerce reconciliation bill attempt to repeal EPA tailpipe regulations for light, medium and heavy duty vehicles. Such legislative moves are unprecedented and likely to face scrutiny from the Senate parliamentarian, though Senate Republicans could make another unprecedented move and opt to ignore her ruling.

Whatever comes of these congressional machinations, we expect the rules we identified in our December rollback scenario to be removed from current law in the near future, so we consider the impacts of efforts to change tax policy compared to a baseline where the regulations are rolled back. We report a “baseline” policy case reflecting regulatory changes made by the Trump administration and Congress and then a “repeal” policy case that estimates the incremental impact of revision and removal of energy-related provisions of the IRA beginning in 2025.

As we detail in our December note, rolling back regulations alone will meaningfully impact the energy system, increasing energy bills for consumers and businesses, reducing clean energy deployment, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In this note, we focus only on the impacts of changes akin to those proposed by Ways and Means legislation. As part of budget reconciliation, several committees have proposed policy changes that will impact the energy system, including the House Energy and Commerce’s proposed recission of funding for a number of grant programs established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, new fees on EVs proposed by the Transportation and Infrastructure committee, and the Natural Resource committee’s proposed changes to energy production public lands. We will assess the aggregate impact of the entire reconciliation bill as the complete legislation takes shape.

As in the past, to understand the range of potential impacts, we use the same three main emissions scenarios reported in Taking Stock 2024: a low-emissions scenario that pairs cheap clean energy technologies with more expensive future fossil fuel prices and slightly slower GDP growth; a high-emissions scenario that pairs more expensive clean technologies with cheap fossil fuels and as-anticipated GDP growth; and a mid-emissions scenario that cuts the difference between the two. To model these policy pathways and emissions scenarios, we use RHG-NEMS, our version of the National Energy Modeling System developed by the US Energy Information Administration.

Energy prices and costs rise for households and businesses

An often-stated goal of these changes is to bring costs down for American households. We find that repealing the energy tax credits has the opposite effect, increasing household energy costs by $95-290 in 2035—a 2-7% increase in costs that year (Figure 1). Repealing tax credits effectively acts as a energy tax increase. Higher spending on mobility energy, including motor gasoline, diesel, and electricity for charging electric vehicles, make up 41-68% of that increase. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, with fewer electric vehicles on the road (discussed further below), consumers will buy more liquid fuels, especially motor gasoline. Relatedly, this increase in demand for gasoline drives up prices at the pump by 1-5% (Figure 2), increasing costs for all drivers. Domestic crude oil production increases very modestly (less than 1%), while crude oil imports increase more meaningfully (5-11%). Electricity bills make up 25-50% of the increase, with households paying $46-72 more each year to power their homes.

Increasing demand for natural gas, particularly driven by more gas demand for power generation, increases wholesale natural gas prices by 2-7% in 2035, despite 6-8% higher gas production (Figure 2). That leads to higher retail prices for all consumers across the economy.

Despite the administration’s stated desire to bolster domestic manufacturing, we find that repealing tax credits places extra burden on industrial producers through higher fuel costs. These higher costs drive up industrial expenditures by $9-11 billion in 2035 (Figure 3). Electricity bills comprise 56-73% of this increase—a consequence of industrial electricity rates rising by 7-12% in 2035. Natural gas expenditures increase by $2 billion on average due to higher wholesale prices. At a time when trade policy turbulence is driving uncertainty around inflation, consumer confidence and the continued economic growth increasing energy costs could add to the turbulence.

Stalled progress on clean energy deployment

An outright repeal of the energy tax credits similar to the Ways and Means proposal reduces the amount of new clean capacity installed on the grid from 2025 through 2035 by 57-72% (Figure 4). The lion’s share of the decline in capacity comes from lower growth of renewables and storage, and there is no meaningful uptick in non-renewable clean capacity. A part of this decline is made up for by modestly less coal capacity retiring by 2035, though the coal fleet still shrinks by at least half from today’s levels, and no new coal plants are built. Gas capacity expands by as much as 9% in 2035, and both new and existing gas plants run more, compared to the baseline.

Our previous modeling is best suited to estimate the impact of policy change on commercially available technologies, but there are important impacts beyond commercial technologies as well. The near full repeal of energy tax credits in the Ways and Means language have an outsized effect on innovative emerging clean technologies like enhanced geothermal, advanced nuclear, long duration storage, and fusion. Developers of these technologies are counting on the long-term availability of the tax credits in current law to support initial projects that are unlikely to be placed in service before 2028. The FEOC constraints on clean electric credits and manufacturing tax credits will make it harder to develop and scale supply chains to accelerate technology deployment and drive down costs. The Ways and Means proposal will stifle innovation at a time when the US needs all the power it can get to meet surging electric demand.

In our baseline, electric vehicle sales already slow meaningfully from removal of EPA tailpipe regulations and the revocation of waivers that prevent California from pursuing more stringent standards. Repealing the clean vehicle tax credits reduces EV sales by another 16-38% in 2035 compared to baseline (Figure 5).

Manufacturing growth threatened

Taking a major step back on domestic deployment of clean energy technologies will likely impact the future of announced manufacturing facilities that produce these technologies. As reported in the Clean Investment Monitor’s Q1 2025 update, six manufacturing facilities totaling nearly $7 billion in investments were cancelled last quarter. In The State of US Clean Energy Supply Chains in 2025 released last month, the Clean Investment Monitor found that domestic manufacturing of key clean technology components including solar modules, battery modules and cells, and zero-emitting vehicles are scaling up above current levels of demand for these technologies and toward deployment levels we see in our modeling of current policy through 2035.

Between investments in these manufacturing facilities as well as investment dollars flowing from installing clean electricity and industrial facilities, $321 billion was invested from mid-2022 through the first quarter of 2025—but a total of $522 billion in investment remained outstanding as of Q1. Steep reductions in clean energy technology deployment plus the proposed material sourcing constraints on clean manufacturing tax credit eligibility could put a meaningful amount of that $522 billion in outstanding investment at risk.

Meaningfully higher greenhouse gas emissions levels

The net result of proposed tax policy changes on the energy system leads to a meaningful reduction in the pace of decarbonization. Repealing the energy tax credits increases emissions by 500-730 million metric tons in 2035 relative to the baseline and more than a gigaton compared to Taking Stock 2024. In the high emissions scenario, repeal leads to emissions that are only 23% lower than 2005 levels in 2035 (Figure 6), or just 4 percentage points lower than annual emissions in 2024—effectively no progress on decarbonization. In the low emissions scenario, emissions are 39% lower than 2005 levels.

What’s next?

The House Ways and Means Committee is considering this proposal today. Whatever moves out of that committee is one step closer to the House floor and a vote of the full House, and we’ll be tracking the bill as it evolves throughout the process. The latest Joint Committee on Taxation revenue effects estimate of the full suite of policy changes in the current Ways and Means proposal is still nearly $800 billion below its spending target, so there’s certainly room for the proposal to evolve in response to ongoing member conversations.

Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee (the equivalent tax-writing committee on the Senate side) has a meaningfully different deficit reduction target to achieve and a different set of stakeholders’ interests to balance. How the two chambers will get to passage individually and then in agreement with each other remains a very open question.

A front-wheel-drive version of the bZ is now available with a 167-kW electric motor, boosting power figures to 221 hp.
Toyota is taking advantage of this facelift to add North American Charging System ports to all of its 2026 model year bZs, too.
Screen size has also increased for 2026, with Toyota adding a 14-inch screen as standard fare to all bZs.","Toyota's only true EV, the bZ4x, is getting a makeover for 2026, and a major part of that overhaul is a name change. Well-intentioned Toyota drivers will no longer have to explain that their car is not named after the lovechild of Elon Musk and Grimes.

Instead, Toyota announced Tuesday it has opted for the classy option by dropping the ""4x"" portion of the name and simply calling it the Toyota bZ. The automaker's capitalization style is still in question, but we think that bZ is a much better name for what is a quite subtle car. Even so, Toyota hopes that some of the other material changes to its Subaru-shared EV will prompt a stronger consumer response.

Namely, the addition of a second battery size for a total of six different range options marks the most significant upgrade for the bZ. Toyota previously offered all bZ4x models with 63.4-kWh or 65.6-kWh battery packs, but now buyers can choose between an upgraded 74.7-kWh battery pack or a smaller 57.7-kWh powerplant. Opting for the smaller battery will give the XLE FWD trim of the bZ a low-end total range of 236 miles, while the highest total range of 314 miles is available on the XLE FWD trim equipped with the larger battery pack.

This increase in range is joined by a boost in power, too. A front-wheel-drive version of the bZ is now available with a 167-kW electric motor, boosting power figures to 221 hp. All-wheel-drive bZs also get a power bump up to 338 hp thanks to the same 167 kW e-motor up front and an 87 kW e-motor in the rear. That's an increase of over 120 hp for AWD versions and 21 hp for FWD variants. The quickest bZ will now sprint from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds, placing it in much closer contention to competitors like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.

Toyota is taking advantage of this facelift to add North American Charging System ports to all of its 2026 model year bZs, too. This upgrade, paired with a new battery preconditioning system on all models, should alleviate some of the criticism of the bZ4x, namely that it was behind the charging times before it was even released. A heat pump system for both air conditioning and cabin heating has been added as well, reducing strain on the driving range from internal climate controls, while Toyota has generously made front seat and steering wheel heaters standard.

The driving experience has been modernized, too. New paddles on the steering wheel control the level of regenerative braking, while a system called Grip Control uses motor drive power modulation to help the AWD versions move smoothly through loose surfaces. Essentially, the traction system will distribute e-motor power according to levels of perceived grip and road surface characteristics.

Screen size has also increased for 2026, with Toyota adding a 14-inch screen as standard fare to all bZs. Charging devices should be easier, too, with two wireless charging pads and two USB-C ports at your disposal. Limited trim models benefit from an 8-way power seat, driver's seat memory function, and a digital rear-view mirror.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/toyota-2026-bz-0002-2-682259c46cdfd.jpg?crop=0.744xw:0.501xh;0.109xw,0.246xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-13 22:06:22.734145

Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic ended any chance that China would increase its energy imports from the United States.
But the lesson is any future deal between Trump and Beijing that promises a massive increase in China’s imports of U.S. energy should be treated with a significant degree of scepticism.","The truce between the world’s two largest economies will see the United States lower its tariffs on imports from China to 30%, while Beijing cuts its levies on U.S. goods to 10% for a 90-day period.

The deal, negotiated after two days of talks in Geneva between the two sides last week, does pull the trade relationship back from the cliff it was headed towards.

But it does little to provide certainty beyond the 90-day period and it does even less to encourage China to resume buying U.S. energy commodities.

The most likely outcome is that U.S. importers of China’s manufactured goods rush to buy as much as they can under the lower 30% tariff in the next 90 days in a bid to restock.

What is unlikely to happen is that China will resume buying U.S. crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal.

Imports of the energy commodities have ground to a halt since U.S. President Donald Trump launched his trade war across the globe, but with a particular focus on China, which was hit with tariffs of 145% until the pause announced on Monday.

China’s retaliation saw it impose tariffs on U.S. goods of 125% and impose restrictions on exports of some rare earth minerals.

But while tariffs of 125% killed China’s imports of U.S. energy, they were effectively gone as soon as Beijing put an initial 10% tariff on crude oil and 15% on LNG and coal in early February, its first response to Trump’s initial tariff moves.

This means that U.S. crude, LNG and coal will remain uncompetitive in China even at the lower 10% tariff for the next 90 days.

No U.S. crude is scheduled to arrive at Chinese port in May, according to commodity analysts Kpler, while only three cargoes unloaded in April.

China imported about 242,000 barrels per day from the United States in 2024, down from about 400,000 bpd in 2023, which was the strongest year on record.

The U.S. share of China’s seaborne crude imports in 2024 was about 2.4%, meaning that the world’s largest oil importer was able to source cargoes from alternative suppliers with relative ease.

LNG, COAL

China was slightly more reliant on U.S. LNG in 2024, with imports of 4.31 million metric tons representing about 5.5% of total arrivals.

But similar to crude, China has halted imports of U.S. LNG with Kpler showing no cargoes since February.

China’s imports of U.S. coal have also dropped sharply, with Kpler showing only one cargo of metallurgical coal due to arrive in May, although this may be diverted to another country before it arrives.

China bought 10.78 million tons of U.S. coal in 2024, of which about 75% was metallurgical, which is the higher quality fuel used primarily to make steel.

This was about 2.5% of China’s total seaborne coal imports, although the U.S. share of metallurgical imports was higher at about 13% of the total.

However, China is likely able to replace U.S. metallurgical coal with cargoes from the world’s biggest exporter Australia, although it may come at a slightly higher cost as steel mills will have to draw some Australian coal away from other buyers such as India and Japan.

While the tariff de-escalation won’t be enough to restart China’s imports of U.S. energy commodities, it’s likely that they will once again be a major negotiating point in the talks expected in the next 90 days.

It’s likely that any deal between China and the Trump administration will include a commitment by Beijing to import more U.S. crude, LNG and coal.

But it’s worth noting that the agreement reached by Trump and China during his first term was massively unsuccessful insofar as China came nowhere close to buying the value of U.S. energy commodities it had said it would.

In terms of the so-called Phase 1 deal agreed in January 2020, China agreed to buy energy over and above a $9.1 billion baseline of U.S. imports in 2017, with a split of an extra $18.5 billion in 2020 and $33.9 billion in 2021, as well as some $36.5 billion in agricultural commodities annually.

Using the crude oil prices that prevailed at that time, at the peak of China’s imports of U.S. crude the shortfall was still about 50% of what would have been required, and even more for LNG and coal.

Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic ended any chance that China would increase its energy imports from the United States.

But the lesson is any future deal between Trump and Beijing that promises a massive increase in China’s imports of U.S. energy should be treated with a significant degree of scepticism.

It's still a long night ahead. Republicans are working to push President Donald Trump's signature legislative package through a gauntlet of committees over mounting opposition from Democrats, advocacy groups and even some wary Republicans themselves.

Right from the start, one meeting was immediately disrupted by protesters shouting down what the panel's top Democrat called “cruel” cuts to Medicaid.

“People feel very strong because they know they’re losing their health care,” said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., on the Energy & Commerce Committee. He asked for the police to refrain from making arrests, noting that some of the people protesting were disabled.

And on it went for hours.

It’s the biggest political and legislative debate for the Republicans leading Congress since Trump’s first term, setting up a career-defining clash over the nation’s priorities, all coming at a time of economic unease with Trump's trade war and other uncertainties.

Trump, speaking at a forum in the Middle East, struck an ambitious chord, saying Congress was “on the verge of passing the largest tax cut and regulation cut in American history.""

""If we get that, that will be like a rocket ship for our country,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia.

But to be sure, there are many more steps before the package becomes law.

At its core, the goal for GOP lawmakers is to extend — and enhance — tax cuts approved in 2017, adding the president’s campaign promises for no taxes on tips, Social Security income and car loan interest.

There's also larger standard deduction, $32,000 for couples, a boost to the Child Tax Credit and a potentially higher cap of $30,000 on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, among others.

That’s offset by $1.9 trillion in savings largely from the rollback of green energy tax credits, for a net tally of $3.7 trillion in costs over the decade, according to the most recent estimates — along with billions more in savings from the safety net cuts

Additionally, the Republicans are boosting spending on their GOP priorities, with $350 billion for Trump’s mass deportation plans and funding for the Pentagon.

At the same time, the Republicans are seeking to defray the lost tax revenue and avoid skyrocketing national deficits by with another GOP goal, which is scaling back federal spending.

The Republicans are proposing cuts of nearly $800 billion over the decade to the Medicaid health care program, which is used by 70 million Americans; $290 billion to food aid in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP; and others.

Tucked into the package is a smattering of other provisions important to the White House — including one that would allow the Trump administration to yank the tax exempt status of groups it says support terrorists, sending a chill through civil society organizations who warn it's a way to punish opponents.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of “jamming another GOP tax scam” that benefits the wealthy at the expense of programs and services used by many Americans.

Speaker Mike Johnson is determined to push the package through the House by Memorial Day, sending it to the Senate, where Republicans are working on their own version and approach.

Johnson and his leadership team have been conferring constantly with Trump at every step.

Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the Ways & Means tax writing committee said he met with Trump on Friday and went over the tax provisions “line by line.”

“He was very happy with what we’re delivering,” Smith said.

On Tuesday, the final three of 11 House committees working on the package drilled down on some of the largest components.

Tempers flared in the hearing rooms. At one point, Rep. Brett Guthrie, the Republican chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee, banned lawmakers from accusing colleagues of “lying.”

Democrats up posters of constituents with the words “Medicaid Matters.” One, Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas, put one on speaker phone to share her story — until her testimony was ruled out of order.

Estimates from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office show that at least 7.6 million people could lose health insurance with the Medicaid cuts, and potentially more with the changes to the Affordable Care Act. Mostly, the health care changes involve imposing new work requirements for aid recipients.

But Republican Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama said his side is trying to make the health care program work better by rooting out waste and inefficiencies.

“We're trying to save Medicaid,” he said.

As the minority party in Congress, Democrats unable to stop the bill, are planning to use the procedural tools available in to slow down the process. The hearings are expected to push into the morning hours.

Republicans have dissent within their own ranks over the health care and green energy cuts, which shows the pressure points ahead.

Smith suggested that some changes could be made to the bill to win over those high-tax state lawmakers from New York and California who believe the proposed SALT cap is inadequate.

“There’s a little bit of wiggle room there to try to deliver additional priorities,"" Smith said.

With the slimmest majority in the House, Johnson has just a few votes to spare, and is running into resistance from his party, including lawmakers in the Senate, which also has thin GOP margins.

The lawmakers are racing for a July 4 deadline to have the whole package sent to Trump’s desk in time to also avoid a dangerous debt default. The Treasury Secretary has said federal tax revenues are running short and Congress needs to raise the spending limit to keep paying the bills.

The package includes a $4 trillion boost to the nation’s now $36 trillion debt limit, enough to fund operations past the 2026 midterm election.

“Start/stop technology: where your car dies at every red light so companies get a climate participation trophy,” Zeldin tweeted Monday in a post that has since racked up more than 8 million views.

“EPA approved it, and everyone hates it, so we’re fixing it.”

The feature kills internal combustion engines at red lights and has been touted by proponents for being able to conserve fuel and cut down on pollution.

Critics have questioned whether the feature can wear down the car’s battery or engine more quickly.

The “off-cycle CO2 reducing” tech has its origins in a federal rule proposed under former President Barack Obama in 2012 — but didn’t take effect until new fuel economy standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions five years later.

Between 2012 and 2021, the number of vehicles produced with a stop-start feature due to the carbon credits surged from 1% to 45%.

Up to 65% of vehicles had the technology included in new models by 2023.

The smart start tech can improve fuel economy by between 4% and 5%, according to past EPA estimates.

But it hasn’t shown clear reductions in emissions tests, an EPA spokesperson noted.

If finalized, automakers could no longer receive any credits to produce the stop-start tech in new models.

Reps for the largest auto industry trade group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move follows Zeldin targeting other tax incentives from a New York climate law and green grants from the Biden administration as part of a renewable energy push.

Zeldin charged that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul unwisely ended “safe extraction” of natural gas, gas hookups on new building construction, and gas stoves — but sought to cut sales of gas-powered vehicles and block the new Constitution Pipeline’s construction.

The Honorable Jason Smith

Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means

21139 Longworth House Office Building

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Chairman Smith and Members of the Committee,

On behalf of National Taxpayers Union (NTU), the nation’s oldest taxpayer advocacy organization, we write to express our support for the Committee’s budget reconciliation proposal. While we strongly urge additional refinements that would promote more economic growth, simplify the tax code, and improve our nation’s fiscal health, the Committee Print accomplishes many core taxpayer goals and is worthy of support.

The economic benefits of this proposal are clear. This proposal renews a number of key individual and business provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that help fuel economic growth. For businesses, it renews deductions for interest payments, incentives for U.S. R&D, immediate expensing for capital investments, and makes both the small business deduction and key international provisions permanent. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, relative to allowing the tax cuts to expire, the included provisions are projected to raise real wages of American workers by between $2100 and $3300 a year, provide large increases in manufacturing wages, and unleash small business economic growth. The bill’s provisions should help U.S. small businesses add an estimated 1 million jobs every year over the next decade. Immediate expensing of R&D should add $20 billion annually in new investment, while expansions in interest deductibility will boost the American economy by over $100 billion. Overall, the bill should add over $850 billion to U.S. GDP every year over the next decade, compared to the current law baseline.

While growing the American economy, the provisions in the Committee Print will also provide continued tax relief for hard working Americans. It loosens Biden-era tax restrictions on gig workers, makes the increased standard deduction from TCJA permanent, keeps the lower tax rates from TCJA that benefited most Americans, and increases exemption levels from the death tax, which, in combination with the extension of key small business deductions, will ensure stability and job growth in small businesses and farms across the country. The extension of core TCJA provisions will keep over six million jobs from being lost, including over one million manufacturing jobs.

The Committee Print will also end a range of expensive onerous environmental policies that often helped the wealthy at the expense of most other Americans. It ends or phases out in a prudent and harmonious manner a host of green tax credits including those for luxury electric vehicles, rooftop solar and other green home improvements, and green buildings. Alternative energy projects could benefit more from permitting reform, and pro-growth, cost-recovery, and R&D tax provisions extended further ahead than narrowly drafted, complex provisions with an uncertain future. Other costly and distortionary IRA provisions should be considered for the same expedited and harmonized phaseout to prevent attempts to extend them in a future Congress.

While NTU strongly supports most provisions in this “One Big Beautiful Bill,” there are a few measures included that warrant additional consideration or refinement. We strongly urge the cost recovery provisions—full expensing, R&D, and interest deductibility—to be made permanent to maximize economic growth. Additionally, the new deduction for certain structures should be expanded to all structures and made permanent.

We urge removal of the increased tax proposal on private foundations, many of which provide invaluable services and education to communities across the country.

We believe that the revenue dedicated to the “no tax on tips,” “no tax on overtime,” and “no tax on auto loan interest” measures should instead be used to further increase the standard deduction, thus providing across-the-board tax relief to all workers regardless of their line of work. While we are pleased to see a cap on the SALT deduction, we urge the $30,000 figure to be further limited. With that in mind, despite the shortcomings of these few measures, NTU strongly supports this Committee Print.

Extending and building on the pro-growth elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while controlling our mounting debt crisis are the most pressing legislative matters that this Congress will address this year, and we commend the Committee for authoring a set of comprehensive, thoughtful, and serious solutions to tackle these critical issues. More reforms are needed in the nearer and intermediate term to bring federal spending growth under control.

NTU urges Committee members to SUPPORT this pro-taxpayer proposal as part of the larger tax reconciliation package. Thank you for your leadership on this important legislation and please do not hesitate to contact NTU should you have any questions.

Sincerely,

David Timmons

They're cheap, packed with boatloads of tech, and are arguably a pretty amazing value proposition for the money. It's kind of obvious why U.S. automakers are worried about the thought of these cars ever hitting the U.S. market.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Today, U.S. auto execs foresee Chinese EVs eventually hitting U.S. streets, China's version of cash-for-clunkers tops 10 million trade-ins for NEVs, and Tesla Employees call for CEO Elon Musk's resignation. Let's jump in.

30%: U.S. Automakers Agree: Chinese Cars Will Enter U.S. Market

Photo by: Patrick George

It turns out the suits in Detroit aren't sweating whether or not Chinese EVs will make it to U.S. soil. Despite the attempts to implement protectionist measures (like tariffs) to keep China's biggest automakers at bay, the vast majority have just accepted Chinese cars as an inevitable competitor on their home turf.

The notion comes straight from Kerrigan Advisors' 2025 OEM Survey, a study that polls some of the top talent in automotive executive leadership on industry trends. According to respondents, a whopping 76% of automakers believe that Chinese carmakers will eventually begin selling vehicles in America. And perhaps equally as concerning, at least for legacy automakers, is that 70% say they're concerned about the financial implications it will bring.

Let's be clear, this isn't just some random paranoia that a bully is coming to take your lunch money. Chinese brands like BYD and Geely are already muscling their way into global markets like Europe and Latin America. They're using ruthless tactics like low costs, solid tech, and extremely fast production cycles to quickly penetrate the local market share.

This is just the start of a shifting industry. The survey also suggests that the way automakers sell cars will change.

That doesn't mean legacy automakers will get out of the dealer sales model they're stuck in. Instead, OEMs are looking to shrink their dealer networks to have a few hundred large dealers to do business with, rather than a few thousand smaller ones. In fact, only 14% of respondents said that they anticipated their dealer networks to grow.

Here's a great synopsis of the theory from Automotive News:

Another new question on this year’s survey found a third of automaker executives expect to have fewer dealers in their network in the next five years; just 14 percent expect to have more. And in another new question, 28 percent said they will exercise a right of first refusal—a tool that allows an automaker to refuse a potential store buyer and replace them with a buyer of their choice—more than a quarter of the time in the buy-sell deals they receive.

“It’s certainly consistent with what we have observed in the buy-sell market and in our conversations with OEMs where certain OEMs are vocally saying ‘We want fewer, larger dealers,’” Kerrigan said. “As we see it, the OEMs are retreating from the idea that they will be the direct-to-consumer seller.”

When China's finely-tuned industrial machine finally does land here at home, Detroit will be in for a wake-up call. There's a reason these brands spend so much time doing reverse engineering on cars coming out of Guangdong—China is very good at this whole ""make-a-car"" thing. And if their automakers can do it better than U.S. companies at a fraction of the cost, legacy brands are in trouble.

60%: China's Version Of Cash-For-Clunkers Gets 10 Million Trade-Ins

Back in 2009, the U.S. had this crazy scheme to stimulate the economy while also simultaneously lowering emissions around the country. Cash For Clunkers was a brazen way of offering Americans a boat load of cash on the hood of just about any new car, so as long as the vehicle they traded-in towards it sucked down fuel more quickly. The program bled through its entire funding in just two months. The total number of cars crushed for the program? 677,081.

Last May, China decided to try its own take on that model and basically supersized America's success. According to Car News China, its year-long program had a whopping 10 million crusty combustion cars traded in for shiny, state-of-the-art New Energy Vehicles (NEVs).

Here are the facts from Car News China:

According to recent figures from the Ministry of Commerce, China’s vehicle trade-in scheme has received more than 10 million applications since the policy began in 2024. As of May 11, 2025, 3.225 million applications were submitted this year, including 1.035 million for scrapping older vehicles and 2.19 million for trade-in replacements.

The policy has had a notable impact on vehicle purchasing behaviour. Data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) shows that in April, nearly 70% of private car buyers utilized the trade-in scheme, while first-time buyers accounted for just 31%, suggesting a shift in demand toward vehicle upgrades.

[...]

Two major trends are currently shaping the automotive sector. First, consumer interest in green and smart vehicles is increasing. New energy vehicles (NEVs) accounted for over 53% of all trade-in transactions. NEV sales totalled 3.324 million units from January to April, up 35.7% year-on-year. Market penetration for NEVs reached 48.4%, a 0.8 percentage point increase from 2024.

Second, the recycling activity has expanded significantly. Between January and April this year, 2.767 million scrapped vehicles were processed for recycling, representing a 65% year-on-year increase. This reflects greater attention among consumers to environmental issues and resource reuse.

China's goal was pretty much the same as America's program. It helped reduce vehicle emissions while simultaneously boosting domestic auto production of BEVs and hybrids, something that China is propping up as its automakers prepare for world automotive domination. As the numbers alone can probably tell you, the plan is working.

This is also kind of a big flex against America, which is pretty audibly fighting over whether or not to keep the EV tax credit alive. Stateside automakers have backed off of otherwise ambitious EV goals when consumers weren't biting, while China doubled down to support domestic manufacturing and growth. If auto executives are worried about China's EV dominance, perhaps the success of this program shows that the real fight should be lobbying in Washington to advocate for more effective support.

90%: Tesla Employee Fired After Calling For Elon Musk's Resignation

Photo by: InsideEVs

At Tesla, the concept of being open to feedback seems to stop somewhere between ""there's a safety problem with the Model S"" and ""Elon should resign."" Recently, one employee tested that line when he published an open letter to the CEO calling for his resignation due to the seeping of Musk's personal brand onto that of Tesla's.

Meet Matthew LaBrot. He's a Tesla employee who drives a Cybertruck, owns a Model Y, has Tesla Solar, and believes in the company's mission—albeit without Elon Musk at the helm. LaBrot found himself growing increasingly frustrated with Musk over the past few months (a sentiment similar to many would-be Tesla buyers who chose to avoid the brand due to Musk's political involvement).

The employee went on to publish a website called Tesla Employees Against Elon that called out the CEO's recent behavior as grounds for him to resign and let someone else take over the automaker. That public call-out quickly got him fired.

Here's an excerpt from the site:

The damage done to Elon’s personal brand is now irreversible and as the public face of Tesla, that damage has become our burden. We are now at a crossroads: continue with Elon as CEO and face further decline as customers abandon the brand, or move forward without him and allow our products and mission to succeed or fail on their own.

We vote for the latter. It’s time to say the quiet part out loud.

Elon’s recent claim that he is “refocusing” on Tesla is not only tone-deaf, it’s insulting. It implies that the hardships of the past six months stem from a lack of his attention, not from his actions. It shifts the blame onto the very people who have held this company together. Let’s be clear: we are not the problem. Our products are not the problem. Our engineering, service, and delivery teams are not the problem. The problem is demand. The problem is Elon.

[...]

Now those very cars are sitting unsold, growing week after week. Production is running better than ever. Quality is high. Processes are strong. Demand is what’s broken. This is not a product problem. It is a leadership problem.

We want to be clear: none of this erases the impact Elon has had on Tesla’s journey. He helped create something extraordinary. The mission we’re fighting for exists in large part because of his early vision. But that doesn’t mean he’s the right person to lead us forward now. In fact, it’s clear he’s not.

After publishing the site (which is signed as if it were penned by multiple employees), LaBrot attended a protest at a Tesla facility. He spray-painted his personal Cybertruck with his website and the slogan ""pro clean energy, pro sustainability, pro EV, pro Tesla, anti Elon"" and parked it outside the Tesla facility where the protest was held. The next day, he got a call from Tesla's HR that his employment at his ""dream job"" was terminated. His account on X—owned by the self-proclaimed ""free speech absolutist"" CEO—was also suspended.

Now, it wasn't actually publishing the website that got LaBrot fired. According to Business Insider, LaBrot was told that the reason he was let go was because he used ""company resources to build a website that did not align with the company's perspective."" LaBrot denied using Tesla resources to build the site in an interview with Business Insider.

The claims made on LaBrot's site aren't exactly hot takes. They're lukewarm at best, and Tesla is well aware of the public perception of its CEO since he began his involvement in U.S. politics. In fact, Tesla even acknowledged that ""changing political sentiment"" was affecting demand for its vehicles in some markets.

It's not difficult to connect the dots here, and LaBrot's firing highlights Musk's zero tolerance for dissent. In this case, an employee disagreed with the guy at the top of the company, publicly aired grievances, and experienced a professionally lethal blow to his career. It seems that if the CEO has carved his public image into stone and the board won't take measures into its own hands to improve sales, then it's going to be up to the public to determine Tesla's future. Judging by the recent drop in vehicle demand, public opinion has already issued a verdict.

100%: Are You Excited For Chinese EVs?

Photo by: Patrick George

The other day, the crew here at IEVs was having a conversation about Chinese EVs. And after hearing all about Patrick's George's time in China, it finally struck me: those China-market-only models were a mistake. The entire world should be getting these cars.

Personally, if you offered me a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra for the price that the home market is paying, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Name another car with the style, features, and 1,548 all-electric horsepower you can nab for under $75,000 brand new.

The fact that auto executives are forecasting Chinese EVs hitting the U.S. means we're about to get some serious competition. If America wants to stay ahead, then our automakers need to become pioneers again. You know what they say, ""innovate or die.""

So, finally, we come to the big question: are you excited for Chinese EVs to make it to the U.S.? Let me know why (or why not) in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/QeKN6O/s1/xiaomi-su7-us-flag-hero.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 21:01:54.694800

The proposal, she said, would deliver ""an enormous market advantage"" to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.
Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past.
But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.
While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them.","On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed lowering emissions requirements while also ending federal tax incentives pertaining to all-electric vehicles. This initiative is being led by House Republicans and would be executed under more comprehensive tax reform legislation.

The proposal is being reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee at the time of this writing and seeks to end the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to $4,000 credit for used models by the end of this year. However, the plan will allow a grace period (ending in 2027) that would permit automakers who had not yet reached 200,000 EV sales to continue taking advantage of the program.

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China. EV batteries produced within the United States would be fine. But any units manufactured under Chinese licenses or using components made by select Chinese companies will be deemed ineligible.

According to Reuters, this still sent some groups into a tizzy. While environmental organizations have become less enamored with EVs due to the ecological concerns surrounding the manufacturing and disposal of batteries, some of the largest entities still support them unconditionally. But it was the industry groups that had the most to say about the proposal thus far.

From Reuters:

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans ""to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.""

The proposal, she said, would deliver ""an enormous market advantage"" to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

There is certainly a case to be made that the U.S. would be foolish to totally abandon embracing new technologies. But it could just as easily be argued that China still has the most to gain from global electrification, regardless of where the manufacturing takes place, due to how much of raw materials required for battery production pass through its borders. China presently holds a staggering 70 percent of the world lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity. That effectively means Central Asia controls the global supply chain.

Ergo, China likewise benefited from the manufacturing incentives initiated under Joe Biden. But many of those joint ventures fell through as additional scrutiny was given to industry partnerships and those efforts have only ramped up under Trump. Still, billions upon billions in government subsidies have likewise gone to South Korean companies as part of subsequent joint ventures with U.S. brands to build batteries domestically. A significant amount of money is still technically being sent offshore to swiftly increase U.S. battery production and determining how much of that is necessary will be tricky for legislators who want to see more electric vehicles produced as soon as possible.

As part of the House proposal designed to curtain emissions and end EV tax credits, there are likewise provisions to eliminate some of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Programs, including those pertaining to battery production.

Working against the House Republicans’ efforts is the fact that the automotive-related inclusions only represent a fraction of what’s in the larger bill. It’s not inconceivable that other components could serve to undermine its passing. This is ultimately a budget reconciliation bill and includes items pertaining to cutting back Medicaid, numerous welfare programs, and loads of environmental spending. Bipartisan support likewise seems to be lacking and isn’t anticipated to come up due to how much the proposal targets climate and ""environmental justice"" initiatives.

However, both the House of Representatives and Senate presently have Republican majorities. The likelihood of President Trump signing off on the legislation, should Congress pass it, is strong as well. He attempted to reduce U.S. fuel economy standards during his first term on the premise that it would allow manufacturers to build less complicated and more traditional vehicles boasting lower price tags. He contended that this would simultaneously boost American manufacturing, due to the fact that those products could be less reliant on foreign-made electronics.

Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past. But the assumption at the time was that they would eventually exhaust themselves as part of the vehicle quotas they were attached to. However, the 200,000 car limit was done away with during the Biden administration (which made pivoting America to EVs a major platform) and EV subsidies effectively became indefinite, if manufacturers could adhere to the content requirements. That latter aspect is likely something Team Trump would have probably supported. But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.

While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them. The assumed reasoning is that Tesla was the first automaker to manufacture enough electric vehicles to exhaust the quota and has little to gain by allowing legacy brands to continue benefiting from government subsidies.

The final angle to this ludicrously complicated issue pertains to how the automotive lobby ultimately responds. The industry is incredibly influential in terms of setting policy and has some deep pockets. Whether we’re discussing restrictions on imported trucks via the “Chicken Tax,” creating emissions loopholes via the “Footprint Rule,” extending EV subsidies, or securing billions of dollars in bailouts after going bankrupt in 2008, the automotive sector has a tendency of getting its way.

However, the industry cannot control everything and even the best-laid plans can sometimes backfire. For example, the response to aggressive emission mandates from Western governments was to have the auto lobby help carve out special exemptions for larger vehicles and subsidize electrification indefinitely. While this temporarily boosted profit margins on just about every vehicle sold, automakers are now confronting a situation where a large amount of new product is out of reach for the average customer.

Small, affordable vehicles boasting superior reliability have effectively evaporated from the North American market. Tiny, increasingly complex powertrains are simultaneously becoming the norm and mandated technologies help balloon MSRPs. The push toward EVs has likewise failed to progress at a pace industry leadership assumed would be financially viable. While nothing can be truly assured, much of the public has signaled they’re not altogether pleased with the direction the industry has been heading and we’re starting to see vehicle sales reflect that.

It’s plausible that the industry would absolutely embrace a reduction in emission requirements at this juncture. But there is still a lot of free money (for lack of a better term) from the taxpayers being left on the table if the subsidies are done away with. Meanwhile, the fact that this is all part of an expansive budget reconciliation bill means it’ll undoubtedly go through numerous changes before the matter is settled.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/05/13/14301/social-44513860.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-05-13 22:06:33.981248

Wisconsinites can unlock thousands of dollars by engaging in the rebate and tax credit programs below.

Home Energy Rebates

Wisconsin was one of the first states in the country to roll out the Home Energy Rebates, which are separated into two programs: the Home Efficiency Rebates (HOMES) for whole home upgrades and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) for purchasing and installing new appliances. These rebate programs are still available for Wisconsinites and should continue to be until the funds allocated to our state – totaling $149 million – run out.

HOMES provides rebates of up to $10,000 for energy-saving, whole-home improvements. This program requires homeowners to receive an energy assessment, which helps determine what upgrades will be best for the home. Upgrades can include insulation, high efficiency heating and cooling appliances, and window replacements. Households of any income level can participate, but households with lower income levels and higher projected energy savings qualify for larger rebates. In some cases, households that have already made efficiency upgrades can retroactively receive HOMES rebates. To find out more, visit Focus on Energy’s website.

HEAR provides rebates of up to $14,000 to low- and moderate-income households for the purchase and installation of energy efficiency equipment and appliances. Qualifying appliances include heat pumps for heating and cooling, electric stoves and heat pump clothes dryers. These rebates are available for existing home appliance upgrades and for new home construction. Electric wiring, insulation, ventilation and air sealing upgrades in existing homes are also eligible for upgrades. Households must be below 150% of the area median income to qualify. To find out more, visit Focus on Energy’s website.

HOMES and HEAR are available for single-family homes and Focus on Energy has begun to roll out HOMES for multifamily buildings as well. The HEAR multifamily roll out will begin later this year.

Tax Credits

There are many federal tax credits available until 2032 for home and transportation upgrades such as renewable energy systems, energy efficiency upgrades and electric vehicle purchases. Credits exist for homeowners, renters, businesses and non-taxable entities such as places of worship. Tax credits can be claimed by filling out form 5695 (home upgrade tax credits) and form 8936 (vehicle upgrade tax credits).

Residential Clean Energy Tax Credits are available for Wisconsinites who install renewable energy systems on their property. This credit equals 30% of the costs of new clean energy systems such as solar panels, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage. In 2023, over 7,000 households in Wisconsin benefited from this program. Find out more here.

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credits are available for certain energy efficiency home upgrades. This credit equals 30% of the cost of upgrades such as door and window replacements; insulation and air sealing; certain energy efficient heating air conditioners, boilers, furnaces and water heaters; heat pumps; and energy audits. In 2023, more than 60,000 households in Wisconsin benefited from this program. Find out more here.

New Clean Vehicle Credits are available for anyone under a certain income level who purchases qualified plug-in EV or fuel cell electric vehicles. The credits are up to $7,500 and the credit amount depends on vehicle battery capacity and critical mineral requirements. In 2023, over 3,000 Wisconsinites benefited from this program and received an average credit of $6,767. Find out more about the tax credits here, and search for qualifying vehicles here. A similar credit exists for the purchase of used clean vehicles.

“That’s really going to be critical to growing and unlocking this market.” GM started research on the new battery cells in 2015, building prototypes at its tech center.
Last year, he said, GM researchers applied 1 ton of LMR cathode materials, which equates to roughly 300 large-format LMR prismatic cells.","General Motors says it has developed a new battery cell with joint venture partner LG Energy Solution that will bring down costs on mainstream electric vehicles without compromising on range.

The cell, called lithium manganese-rich, or LMR, is expected on the market by 2028 starting with pickups and full-size SUVs. It also will be the first commercial application of prismatic EV battery cells by Ultium Cells LLC, the companies’ joint venture.

GM’s current-generation EVs are powered by pouch-style lithium ion batteries, with cathodes made from nickel, manganese, cobalt and aluminum. GM said LMR cells are cheaper because manganese costs less than nickel and cobalt, and because prismatic cells are more efficient and simpler to assemble.

“It unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost. It’s a game-changing battery for electric trucks,” Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, told reporters at the automaker’s Global Technical Center in Warren, Mich. “We believe we can deliver more than 400 miles of range in a single charge in a truck, while significantly reducing our battery costs.”

To date, GM has used the same battery chemistry and form across its entire EV lineup, underpinning everything from the Chevrolet Equinox EV compact crossover to the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.

Kelty, who joined GM last year after spending 30 years working with lithium ion batteries at companies including Panasonic and Tesla, has said the automaker’s future EVs will incorporate a range of form factors and chemistries. GM envisions lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, cells in some smaller, entry-level EVs to provide an estimated 350 miles of range at a lower price, Kelty said.

Nickel-rich formulas, meanwhile, can be reserved for the longest-range and highest-performance EVs, with range reaching 490 miles, GM said. The Chevy Silverado EV full-size pickup, for instance, tops out at this range.

LMR cells cost about the same as the LFP batteries but offer 33 percent more energy density and greater range — at least 400 miles, GM said, allowing an EV with an LMR battery to weigh hundreds of pounds less than one with an LFP battery offering similar range.

Expanding GM’s battery options is part of the automaker’s effort to reduce EV costs, improve range and charging performance, and further localize its battery supply chain, Kelty said. GM, for instance, in 2023 signed a deal with Australian supplier Element 25 to source manganese sulfate through a facility in Louisiana.

Prismatic packs require half as many parts as pouch-style batteries, Kelty said. The automaker also is preparing to build prismatic cells at a joint venture plant with Samsung SDI starting in 2027.

Other companies are exploring LMR cells, including Ford Motor Co., which in April said it planned to use them in EVs within this decade.

Kelty said GM wants to offer multiple battery configurations on the same vehicle to give customers choices on price and range.

High-nickel batteries will “continue to be well-suited to specialty or premium applications, or customers who absolutely want the highest range,” said Andy Oury, a GM battery engineer and business planning manager.

“What’s exciting about LMR is that we can take that affordable chemistry and we can expand it much further across the portfolio,” Oury said. “That’s really going to be critical to growing and unlocking this market.”

GM started research on the new battery cells in 2015, building prototypes at its tech center. LG Energy Solution also has gotten more than 200 patents related to the technology since 2010, the companies said.

“This is a good strategy for the industry,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. “LMR provides a really nice compromise in a lot of ways between LFP and the nickel-rich cells that have been dominant in the North American market.”

Kushal Narayanaswamy, GM’s director for advanced battery cell engineering, said the automaker’s work on LMR cells has accelerated in the past five years.

Last year, he said, GM researchers applied 1 ton of LMR cathode materials, which equates to roughly 300 large-format LMR prismatic cells.

In 2023, 3.4 million Americans used federal tax credits for clean energy or energy efficiency home improvements, saving more than $8 billion while contributing to cleaner air.

Pollution from burning fossil fuels was estimated to be responsible for the deaths of more than 350,000 Americans in 2018. Clean energy incentives have helped triple the amount of power the U.S. gets from the sun, wind and geothermal over the past decade, with growth occurring in all 50 states. But upfront costs remain a barrier to Americans who want to choose clean energy.

If the legislation passes, houses of worship, cities, school districts and businesses would also face higher costs and more barriers to go solar, electrify their fleets or improve the efficiency of their buildings. Credits for electric school buses, police cruisers and other commercially used EVs would end this year, while incentives for large-scale renewable energy projects would phase down starting in 2029.

Bad River says blasting and filling wetlands will harm water quality Bad River argues the project would affect its water quality by blasting bedrock, dredging or filling wetlands and disrupting groundwater flows.
He said distance from the reservation doesn’t mean the company would comply with water quality standards.","Federal environmental regulators and a Canadian energy firm say data doesn’t support a northern Wisconsin tribe’s claims that rerouting an oil and gas pipeline will violate water quality standards on its reservation.

Tribal officials and experts argue those conclusions rely on inaccurate information that underestimates the project’s effects on the watershed and number of wetlands impacted.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a virtual hearing Tuesday after the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa objected to permitting Enbridge’s planned Line 5 reroute under the Clean Water Act.

Enbridge proposed relocating Line 5 after the Bad River tribe sued the company in 2019 to shut down and remove the pipeline from its lands. The pipeline runs 645 miles and carries up to 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily from Superior through northern Wisconsin and Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario.

Information submitted by the tribe didn’t support the Bad River’s finding that the project would violate its water quality, according to Tera Fong, water division director for Region 5 with the Environmental Protection Agency.

“The materials EPA reviewed did not provide data, studies or modeling analysis that showed and quantified impacts of distance from any given discharge point to water quality on the reservation, the likelihood of discharges, including discharges of pollutants traveling from groundwater to surface waters and then to the reservation boundary,” Fong said.

The EPA in 2009 approved the tribe’s water quality standards, which go beyond state standards. Bad River Tribal Chair Robert Blanchard argued that permitting the project would cause irreparable harm to its lands and all living things.

“As Anishinaabe, we believe every living plant or animal has a spirit. Even the water has spirit. Whatever happens upstream from our reservation will affect the waters that we and many others depend on for survival,” Blanchard said.

The Line 5 reroute is slated to cross more than 200 waterways, and it will affect 101 acres of wetlands in Ashland and Iron counties. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in November issued permits and a water quality certification, which the tribe and environmental groups are challenging. The tribe said the agency didn’t consider its standards.

Bad River says blasting and filling wetlands will harm water quality

Bad River argues the project would affect its water quality by blasting bedrock, dredging or filling wetlands and disrupting groundwater flows. The tribe and its experts say work could increase water temperatures, runoff, invasive species or contamination from PFAS and mercury. They also fear aquifer breaches and inadvertent releases similar to those that occurred on Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement in Minnesota.

Joe McGaver, Enbridge’s environmental projects manager, said effects to wetlands would be temporary and only an area roughly the size of a small house would be permanently filled. Enbridge and its consultants said it doesn’t expect conditions similar to those that led to aquifer breaches on Line 3 and designed the project to avoid releases.

“We don’t want to have inadvertent [releases] as much as anybody because of the impacts and then the extra effort to clean it up and other social implications with having a release,” McGaver said.

Matt Horn, principal scientist for engineering firm Tetra Tech, which is working for Enbridge, said such releases related to drilling to install the pipeline could result in more sediment runoff in waters more than a mile upstream of the reservation. Enbridge’s consultants also said the project wouldn’t result in increased levels of mercury, PFAS or nitrates flowing into the tribe’s boundaries.

The tribe’s experts disputed findings from Enbridge’s consultants, including Esteban Chiriboga, environmental specialist with the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission. He said distance from the reservation doesn’t mean the company would comply with water quality standards.

“Because contaminants can and do persist in the water column for fairly large distances,” Chiriboga said. “The land alterations caused by pipeline construction and operation will cause some changes in water quality, and the close proximity to the reservation means that there’s little opportunity for dilution.”

The company’s consultants also said the project wouldn’t result in measurable effects to flow rates or temperatures of surface waters flowing into the reservation. They added that blasting won’t affect groundwater or nearby wells. Experts for the tribes disputed that.

The hearing continues Wednesday with an opportunity for the public to weigh in online from noon to 7 p.m.

The Line 5 reroute is expected to cost more than $500 million. Enbridge said it will generate millions of dollars in local spending during construction and create more than 700 jobs, but it’s still locked in a legal battle with the tribe.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/line_5.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 19:09:14.091333

Manufacturing Manufacturing investment dropped by 11.5% from Q4 2024, though it remained up by 7.7% compared to Q1 2024.","Summary

In the first quarter of 2025, clean energy and transportation investment in the United States totaled $67.3 billion, a 6.9% increase from the same period in 2024 but a 3.8% decrease from the previous quarter. Despite this second consecutive quarterly decline, clean investment continues to represent a significant share of US private investment, accounting for 4.7% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods in Q1 2025.

Investment activity was driven primarily by retail consumer purchases and installations of clean technology, which accounted for nearly half of the total at $33.5 billion. This segment saw 17.4% growth compared to Q1 2024, though investment declined 2.2% from the prior quarter. Investments in manufacturing were up 7.7% relative to Q1 2024, but down 11.5% compared to Q4 2024. Investments in utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies declined by 7.7% from Q1 2024, but stayed roughly flat compared to Q4 2024.

The pipeline of new project announcements offered a mixed outlook, with $41.3 billion in new utility clean electricity projects, mainly in solar and storage, a level roughly on par with average quarterly clean energy announcements during 2024. New industrial decarbonization announcements declined sharply to $79 million, compared to $16 billion in Q1 2024 and $7.8 billion last quarter. Companies announced $9.4 billion in new manufacturing projects, 23% below the value announced in Q1 2024, but a 46% increase from Q4 2024. Six clean technology manufacturing projects, representing $6.9 billion in investment, were cancelled in Q1 2025, as detailed in our recent clean energy supply chains report.

This report also highlights the jobs created by clean investments. The Clean Investment Monitor database expanded this year to track both the construction and operational jobs generated by completed facilities and those jobs expected from announced facilities that have not yet come online. The data, available at the state and congressional district levels, are derived from publicly reported facility-level data and supplemented by modeled values where necessary.

Our analysis highlights the significant role in job creation of the 2,369 new manufacturing, utility-scale clean electricity, and industrial decarbonization facilities that have opened across the US since the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Spurred by $321 billion in company-driven clean investment, those facilities have created nearly 13,000 operational jobs in Texas, more than 12,500 in Georgia, and more than 7,500 in North Carolina and Michigan. Looking ahead, $522 billion of outstanding investment remains to be spent on construction and installation for announced or under-construction facilities. This pipeline includes 2,217 facilities that are expected to generate significant employment opportunities in South Carolina (14,013), Kentucky (11,795), Tennessee (9,632), Ohio (9,622), and North Carolina (9,299).

Investment trends

Actual clean energy and transportation investment in the US in Q1 2025 totaled $67.3 billion (Figure 1). While this represents a 6.9% increase from Q1 2024, it is the second consecutive quarterly decline, with a 3.8% decrease from Q4 2024. In Q1 2025, clean investment accounted for 4.7% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods nationwide, down slightly from 4.9% in Q4 2024 but up from 4.5% in Q1 2024 (Figure 2).

We categorize our clean investment tracking into three segments: investment in the manufacture of GHG emission-reducing technology (“manufacturing”); investment in the deployment of that technology, both to produce clean energy or decarbonize industrial production (“energy & industry”); and investment through the purchase and installation of that technology by individual households and businesses (“retail”). Each dollar figure in this report reflects actual investment—the real dollars spent in the given quarter on retail purchases, facility construction, and equipment purchase and installation. For facilities, we track actual capital expenditures invested over the construction timeline once a project breaks ground. In the following sections of this report, we summarize actual and announced investments, which provide context and insight into potential future actual investments.

Retail investment again drove clean investment in Q1 2025, accounting for 49.8% of total clean investment at $33.5 billion. While actual retail investment decreased 2.2% relative to the previous quarter, it was up 17.4% compared to Q1 2024. In the energy & industry segment, $19.8 billion was invested in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization, roughly the same level as the previous quarter, but a 7.7% decline compared to Q1 2024. Manufacturing investment decreased by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter to $14.0 billion invested, though it remained up by 7.7% compared to Q1 2024. Notably, six clean technology manufacturing projects, representing $6.9 billion in investment, were cancelled in Q1 2025, as detailed in our recent clean energy supply chains report.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing investment dropped by 11.5% from Q4 2024, though it remained up by 7.7% compared to Q1 2024. The electric vehicle (EV) supply chain—critical minerals, batteries, vehicle assembly, and charging equipment—remained the dominant force in clean manufacturing investment, accounting for $13 billion (93%) of the total $14 billion in actual investment (Figure 4). Battery manufacturing investment fell by 11.4% quarter-on-quarter to $10.4 billion, though it was up 14% relative to Q1 2024. Solar manufacturing investment dropped slightly to just under $1 billion, a 23.3% decrease from Q4 2024 and a 41.5% decline relative to Q1 2024, marking the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.

Companies announced $9.3 billion in new manufacturing projects in Q1 2025, a 46% increase from Q4 2024, but 23% below the value announced in Q1 2024. Of these Q1 2025 announcements, 75% were in the EV supply chain. The new pipeline includes $2.3 billion in solar manufacturing and $0.1 billion in wind manufacturing investment, the first new wind manufacturing projects announced since Q3 2023.

Energy & industry

In Q1 2025, the US saw a total of $19.8 billion in new actual investment in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization, down 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and down 7.7% relative to the same period in 2024. Within this segment, $18.3 billion (92%) went toward clean electricity and $1.5 billion (8%) supported industrial decarbonization projects, a distribution consistent with previous quarters.

Utility-scale solar and storage investment dominated clean electricity investment, accounting for $14.4 billion, a 5.3% decrease from Q4 2024 and a 15.4% decline from Q1 2024 (Figure 5). In contrast, wind investment recorded a third consecutive quarterly increase, rising by 26.8% from the previous quarter to $3.9 billion in Q1 2025.

Industrial decarbonization investment declined 3% quarter-on-quarter, but increased 5.4% relative to Q1 2024. Industry actual investment continues to represent a small fraction of the total value of announced projects, with most facilities not yet started and a small number of facilities moving into construction and operation. Hydrogen led actual investment in industry at $0.5 billion, up 3.4% from the previous quarter and 40.5% compared to Q1 2024. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investment dropped by 22.9% quarter-on-quarter to $0.4 billion, a 42.1% decline from Q1 2024. The remainder of Q1 industry investment included carbon management at $0.5 billion and clean fuels at $0.1 billion, reflecting the highest quarter on record for the latter. Another $0.1 billion was invested in clean iron and steel production.

The pipeline of new energy projects expanded with the addition of $41.3 billion in new utility electricity project announcements, roughly on par with the quarterly average value of announcements in 2024. Most of these announcements ($36.5 billion) were for solar and storage projects. In contrast, industry announcements were at their lowest since Q2 2020. Companies announced $79 million in new projects in Q1 2025, roughly 1% of the value of industry announcements in Q4 2024.

Retail

Consumer spending on zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), distributed renewable electricity generation and storage, and heat pumps totaled $33.5 billion in Q1 2025, a 2.2% decline from Q4 2024, but a 17.4% increase compared to Q1 2024.

Investments in ZEV registrations (a proxy for sales) declined by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter to $23.0 billion, predominantly driven by a substantial 21% decline in sales by Tesla. Despite overall ZEV registrations declining quarter-on-quarter, this level represents a 15.2% increase from Q1 2024 (Figure 7).

Distributed electricity generation and storage investment reached a new post-IRA peak in Q1 at $5.6 billion, up 57.4% from Q4 2024 and 48.3% compared to Q1 2024. Heat pump investments also saw modest growth, rising by 4.2% quarter-on-quarter to $5.0 billion, a 2.9% increase compared to Q1 2024.

Jobs tied to clean investments

Since the enactment of the IRA in Q3 2022, $321 billion has been invested in manufacturing, clean electricity, and industrial facilities, and 2,369 new facilities have opened across the US. Looking ahead, $522 billion of outstanding investment remains to be spent on construction and installation for announced or under-construction facilities. This pipeline includes 2,217 facilities that have yet to come online.

The Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) expanded tracking earlier this year to provide insights into the employment generated by these post-IRA clean technology investments across the US. By adding state and congressional district jobs data—covering both the construction and operational jobs that are directly tied to specific facilities—we provide a clearer understanding of the local economic impacts of the IRA.

For this report, we use CIM data through Q1 2025 (March 31, 2025) to report the operational jobs created so far in each state at completed manufacturing, utility clean electricity, and industrial decarbonization facilities that have come online since Q3 2022, when the IRA was enacted. Additionally, we report the jobs expected from facilities with outstanding investment, reflecting announced projects that are not yet operational. This jobs data is derived from publicly reported facility-level data and supplemented with modeled values where necessary.

Table 1 ranks the top 20 states by the operational jobs created since Q3 2022, with states that have attracted significant clean technology manufacturing projects leading. Table 2 focuses on the pipeline of outstanding investment, ranking the top 20 states by expected operational jobs if these projects come online. Texas, Georgia, and Michigan ranked among the top 5 on both lists. Within the top 10 on both lists sit Tennessee, Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Indiana. All these states stand out for the significant role that clean technology manufacturing investment is expected to play in job creation in these regions.

In Texas, for example, $62.3 billion has been invested in new or expanded facilities since the IRA passed, and 29 manufacturing facilities and 209 clean energy and industrial decarbonization facilities have come online during the same period. These facilities have created 12,931 jobs. Companies have announced projects worth $128.5 billion, which are not yet online but are expected to generate 15,384 operational jobs.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e31ae6c5fd44b10ff405a7/682274146ce1bc29bbbbe090_cim-q1-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 10:10:52.097943

Louisiana Revolving Loan Program

The Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources offers low-cost financing for retrofitting and alternative fueling projects. If you’re a business or a public entity, you can apply for a loan with a 2% fixed interest rate for a term of ten years or less. This offers businesses a great way to finance workplace and other commercial EV charging projects!

Louisiana EV Rebates

Louisiana does not currently offer a state-level EV rebate. However, one local utility is encouraging customers to go electric by offering a credit for buying an EV:

Dixie Electric Membership Cooperative

Whether you are buying or leasing an EV, you can get a $100 rebate for simply registering an electric vehicle within this utility’s service territory.

Louisiana EV Tax Credits

Louisiana does not have a state-wide EV tax credit, but residents may qualify for federal EV tax credits like the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit for new vehicles, or the $4,000 used clean vehicle tax credit. Income restrictions as well as battery component and critical mineral restrictions may apply. Be sure to speak to a qualified CPA or tax professional to check your eligibility.

Additionally, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit provides a federal tax credit up to $1,000 to offset costs related to installing an EV charger at home. Businesses can claim EV charger tax credits worth up to $100,000.

Louisiana EV Charger Rebates

Charging your EV at home is both affordable and convenient. To achieve the best charging speed with your residential electrical infrastructure, it is essential to install a Level 2 EV charger with the help of a qualified EV charger installation professional.

Three utility providers in Louisiana offer EV charger rebates, with average an rebate amount of $250 dollars:

Cleco Power EV Charger Rebates

Cleco Power, which serves 24 parishes and 295,000 customers, offers several ways to save on EV charging. As a residential customer, you can claim a $250 rebate toward a Level 2 charger.

Cleco can also help your business transition to electric with a free fleet assessment. Plus, you may be eligible for a $1,000 rebate when installing a Level 2 charger at a multifamily property, workplace, fleet site, or public location. The utility also offers a rebate of $3,500 to support your DC Fast Charger project.

Entergy EV Charger Rebates

With a presence in five states, Entergy is a key provider of electricity for the state of Louisiana and offers some noteworthy Louisiana EV rebate programs. You can earn $250 toward a Level 2 charger with Entergy’s EV rebate program. However, if you live in New Orleans and enroll in the utility’s time-of-use plan, you’ll become eligible for a $350 rebate instead.

Businesses can claim a $250 rebate toward a Level 2 charger, get $750 for a DC Fast charger with a capacity of 50 kW or less, or qualify for a $1,500 rebate for a DC Fast charger with more than 50 kW in capacity. Commercial customers in New Orleans can claim a rebate of up to $2,500 per public, fleet, or multifamily Level 2 charger. Financial incentives for DC Fast chargers range from $2,500 to $12,500, depending on the charger’s capacity.

Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) EV Charger Rebates

Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) is also working to bring greater electrification to Northwestern and Central Louisiana residents through rebate programs. SWEPCO offers a $250 rebate to help you save on a Level 2 at-home charger. SWEPCO also offers a $250 rebate toward multifamily Level 2 EV charging projects.

EV Charging Rates in Louisiana

To further help EV owners reduce charging costs by encouraging off-peak charging, utilities in Louisiana offer time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates designed to lower the cost of charging EVs.

These TOU plans incentivize vehicle charging during off-peak hours, making EV ownership more affordable.

Dixie Electric Membership Cooperative

The cooperative offers a residential time-of-use rate to help customers save money by charging when electricity demand is low. You can contact the utility directly to learn more about this program.

Entergy (New Orleans Customers Only)

Entergy offers a $7 cash incentive if you can switch your EV charging to off-peak hours, which last from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and all day long on weekends and holidays. The utility even allows you to charge your EV outside these hours three times a month without losing your incentive.

Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWPECO)

If you enroll in SWEPCO’s time-of-use plan, you’ll save the most by charging your EV at night. From May to October, you’ll pay $0.16 between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Your rate will drop to $0.10 from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. You’ll only pay $0.03 per kWh during off-peak hours, which last from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.

Between November and April, an on-peak rate of $0.09 per kWh will be effective from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. Outside of these hours, you’ll pay $0.03 per kWh.

Public EV Charging Stations in Louisiana

How Many Public EV Charging Stations Are in Louisiana?

As of May 2025, Louisiana has over 200 public charging stations including 194 Level 2 and 78 DC Fast stations. There are 768 public EV charging ports, 19 Tesla Supercharger stations and 199 Tesla Supercharger ports in Louisiana.

For Ford EV drivers, the Ford BlueOval network has many options, with nearly 100 locations in the New Orleans area alone.

How Much Do Public EV Charging Stations Cost in Louisiana?

Charging cost is mainly dependent on where you’re charging. For example, the charger located at 5001 Johnston Street in Lafayette costs $3 for an hour of charging. There are also more affordable options, such as the charger at 6889 Corporate Boulevard in Baton Rouge, which only costs $1 per hour.

Be sure to read our article discussing the Cost of Charging an EV at Home vs. Public Charging.

Are There Free EV Charging Stations in Louisiana?

You can find some free EV charging stations located throughout the state. In fact, the city of New Orleans operates some free EV chargers in partnership with Entergy. You can find these stations at Bayon Oaks at the City Park Driving Range on Filmore Avenue, as well as at the City Park Reunion Shelter on Friederichs Avenue.

Where Are Public EV Charging Stations Located in Louisiana?

Since the state is still developing its EV charging infrastructure, most charging options are in large cities and along major highways such as New Orleans, Shreveport, and Baton Rouge. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t find charging stations outside of major cities.

Visit the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center Map of EV Charging Station Locations in Louisiana, which can be sorted and filtered based on public access, charger type (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast), and connector type (NACS, J1772, CCS, CHAdeMO).

Home Electrification Incentives in Louisiana

Combining EV ownership with other electrification projects, such as upgrading your home with solar panels & battery storage, or investing in a heat pump, will help you save even more while reducing your environmental impact.

You may qualify for home electrification incentives through your local electricity provider in addition to the U.S. federal government. Scroll down to read tax credit and incentive details for specific home electrification technologies.

Battery Storage

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of new battery storage systems size 3kWh and larger.

Electrical Panels

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit provides a federal tax credit for electrical panel upgrades needed to complete electrification projects like heat pumps and heat pump water heaters (up to 30% of project costs, capped at $600). The 25C tax credit can be used by renters, and homeowners making upgrades to their primary or secondary home.

Qualifying electrical panels must meet the standards of the National Electric Code (NEC) and have a capacity of 200 Amps or more. This means that your new/upgraded panel must be able to serve a load of at least 200 Amps, but you don’t need 200 Amps of incoming utility service. Smart panels may qualify if they allow you to serve a load of 200 Amps.

If you’re claiming 25D for a residential solar or battery storage project and the installation required you to upgrade your main panel, you may be able to apply 25D to electrical panel costs as well.

Heat Pumps & Heat Pump Water Heaters

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit also applies to heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. A 30% federal tax credit is available (capped at $2,000 dollars). Eligible technologies must meet certain energy efficiency requirements.

Solar Panels

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit also provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems.",https://qmerit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/louisiana-draft.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:06:46.515283

It’s a long day and night ahead. Republicans are working to push President Donald Trump’s signature legislative package through a gauntlet of committee hearings over mounting opposition from Democrats, advocacy groups and even some wary Republicans themselves.

Right from the start, one hearing was immediately disrupted by protesters shouting down what the top Democrat on the committee called “cruel” cuts to Medicaid and other programs.

“People feel very strong because they know they’re losing their health care,” said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., on the Energy & Commerce Committee. He asked for the police to refrain from making arrests, noting that some of the people protesting were disabled.

It’s the biggest political and legislative debate for the Republicans leading Congress since Trump’s first term, setting up a career-defining clash over the nation’s priorities — some $5 trillion in tax breaks, including the president’s promises for no taxes on tips, Social Security income and car loan interest, offset by $1.9 trillion in tax savings largely from green energy rollbacks, for a net tally of $3.7 trillion in taxes, according to the most recent estimates.

Trump, speaking at an forum in the Middle East, struck an ambitious chord, saying Congress was “on the verge of passing the largest tax cut and regulation cut in American history.”

“If we get that, that will be like a rocket ship for our country,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia.

But to be sure, there are many more steps before the package becomes law.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of “jamming another GOP tax scam” that benefits the wealthy at the expense of programs and services used by Americans.

“It is an egregious and outrageous bill,” Jeffries said.

At its core, the goal for GOP lawmakers is to extend — and enhance — tax cuts approved in 2017.

Additionally, the Republicans are boosting spending on their GOP priorities, with $350 billion for Trump’s mass deportation plans and funding for the Pentagon.

At the same time, the Republicans are seeking to defray the lost tax revenue and avoid skyrocketing national deficits by with another GOP goal, which is scaling back federal spending with nearly $800 billion cuts to health care, $290 billion to food programs and billions in the Biden-eras green energy investments that millions of Americans rely on in states across the country.

And tucked in is a smattering of other provisions important to the White House — including one that would allow the Trump administration to yank the tax exempt status of groups it says support terrorists, sending a chill through civil society organizations who warn it’s a way to punish opponents.

Speaker Mike Johnson is determined to push the package through the House by Memorial Day, sending it to the Senate, where Republicans are working on their own version and approach.

With the slimmest majority in the House, Johnson has just a few votes to spare, and is running into resistance from his party, including lawmakers in the Senate, which also has thin GOP margins.

“In the current form, I can’t support it,” said Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a deficit hawk who wants deeper spending reductions.

On Tuesday, three House committees will gavel into session for what is expected to be marathon hearings on the three largest components of the package — the Ways & Means tax writing committee; the Energy & Commerce Committee that handles health care and energy policy; and later in the evening, the Agriculture Committee that has proposed the food stamps cuts.

Advocacy groups are protesting the cuts and Democrats, as the minority party in Congress unable to stop the bill, are planning to use the procedural tools available in to slow down the process.

The lawmakers are racing for a July 4 deadline to have the whole package sent to Trump’s desk in time to also avoid a dangerous debt default. The Treasury Secretary has said federal tax revenues are running short and Congress needs to raise the spending limit to keep paying the bills.

The cells will also be prismatic versus the current pouch structure, reducing the number of parts in the battery pack by more than 50%, according to GM.

The Detroit automaker, which now has 12 electric vehicles in its lineup, is trying to lower its battery costs to enable cost parity with its gas-powered products by adding new types of cells and chemistries in those cells.

""We're adopting flexible chemistries for the best balance of range, performance and affordability,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media briefing on the announcement. ""My mission here is to get as many EVs on the road as possible. We need to get price parity with (internal combustion engine vehicles) and then this thing's just going to take off.""

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, is demanding that Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin halt plans to dismantle landmark federal climate programs, citing newly revealed documents and warning of harm to American industry and consumers.

According to documents obtained exclusively by Democratic staff on the Senate EPW Committee, the EPA is preparing to shut down the Climate Change Division and Climate Protection Partnership Division within the Office of Atmospheric Protection. These divisions oversee the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and the widely used Energy Star Program, which has saved Americans more than $500 billion and prevented nearly 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over three decades.

“For the past 15 years, the GHGRP has collected facility-level emissions data from over 8,000 facilities, supplying vital information to policymakers, scientists, investors, and the public,” Whitehouse wrote in a letter to Administrator Zeldin. “These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies’ climate disclosures.”

Whitehouse warned that the proposed rollback would remove a competitive edge for U.S. manufacturers. GHGRP data has shown that American facilities are less carbon-intensive than foreign competitors. Eliminating this program, he argued, would strip U.S. companies of data that allows th

em to market themselves as cleaner than global rivals, including those in China.

“[E]limination of the GHGRP would likely harm the very companies supposed to benefit from fewer reporting requirements,” Whitehouse added. “You will rob American industry of data giving [it a] competitive advantage.”

The documents indicate the agency’s justification for dismantling the GHGRP is based on feedback from industry trade associations, citing a desire to reduce regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas producers. Critics, including Whitehouse, argue the move aligns with the interests of fossil fuel companies, which supported former President Donald Trump’s campaign with significant funding and lobbying efforts aimed at environmental rollbacks.

“EPA’s recent actions—including the elimination of the GHGRP—continue the pattern of allowing polluters to dictate environmental policy,” Whitehouse stated. “Dismantling the GHGRP prioritizes polluter interests over the international competitiveness of American steel, aluminum, fertilizer, cement, and chemicals industries.”

Now, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, says he's going to ""fix"" the feature because ""everyone hates it.""
Things get weirder when you realize that the EPA doesn't actually mandate AST tech.

He's vowed that the agency will ""fix"" it.

How that will be executed is an unknown, but AST tech isn't really broken to begin with.

If you've ever driven a gas car with Auto Start-Stop (AST) tech, you know just how annoying it can be. You roll to a stop and after a slight delay, the RPMs drop to zero until you let your foot off the brake and the engine quickly roars back to life. It shouldn't seem like a problem, but it's widely regarded as one of the most disliked eco features on modern gas cars. Now, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, says he's going to ""fix"" the feature because ""everyone hates it.""

Here's the thing: it might be annoying to some people, but it's not actually broken.

Zeldin announced that the agency was looking into the feature via a post on X. He didn't supply any real information on how the EPA was looking to solve the supposed problem, though, He just hinted that the EPA was responsible for fixing it, since the agency approved and promoted the use of AST systems to begin with.

Things get weirder when you realize that the EPA doesn't actually mandate AST tech.

Yes, you read that right. There's no actual federal rule that requires automakers to implement AST features in cars, but there are incentives in the form of carbon credits for automakers that do. And automakers gobbled that up as an easy win to offset emission standards. Plus, AST drives down fleet-wide average emissions, which is important to automakers.

In a report published by the EPA in 2023, the agency noted that AST was rapidly adopted by automakers once the agency began offering carbon credits for implementation. In 2016, just 9% of cars had the tech—that ballooned to more than 60% by 2022. One could also argue that it's pretty much industry standard at this point.

Here's an excerpt from the now-deleted EPA paper (which has since been removed from the agency's website):

The implementation of stop/start has been increasing rapidly, as discussed in Section 4, which aggregates and reports on these systems regardless of the regulatory eligibility for credits. In model year 2022, 60% of new vehicles qualified for and claimed this credit, resulting in a fleetwide CO2 reduction of about 2.2 g/mi. Twelve manufacturers installed stop start systems on at least half of their model year 2022 vehicles.

You may have caught an important figure above. The EPA itself shows that AST tech actually does what it's supposed to do—it reduces tailpipe emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy even published a separate report showing real-world testing of the tech compared to cold starts and idling. Unsurprisingly, it resulted in a significant reduction of emissions.

It has also been shown to save fuel. The same report from the DoE claims that if each gas-powered car registered in the U.S. idled for 6 minutes per day, it would waste around 3 billion gallons of fuel annually (that's around $9.9 billion, or $42.50 per licensed driver).

National Resources Canada also had similar findings with claims that AST tech cut fuel consumption by between 4% and 10% during city driving. Edmunds put this to the test using some of its long-term test cars and found that each vehicle tested managed to save at least 9% more fuel when AST was enabled in ideal conditions. One vehicle even reached 10.9% savings. SAE International even says its tests show that the feature can save up to a whopping 26.4%.

So why the backlash? Partly because drivers hate unpredictability. If we're being real, AST can feel like an engine stall even if it restarts in milliseconds. It's also an always-on feature by default that requires drivers to turn it off every time they turn on the car (or buy a small device to disable it; or code it out using tuning software). It makes people feel like they've lost control of their car, and that's not an easy sell. Plus, consumers worry that it puts extra wear on their vehicles, even though vehicles with AST are built differently to support the feature.

AST is actually a great leap in fuel-saving tech that took off in the last decade. Hell, it might be one of the best—low cost, low tech and it's effective. Automakers have also gotten significantly better at implementing the feature in a less intrusive way. But nevertheless, it's still a change to the way a car works that irks drivers.

If Zeldin wants to implement a ""fix"" (if you can call whatever the EPA decides to do that), the best route certainly isn't to eliminate the feature altogether. Maybe it's to encourage OEMs to implement a memory feature or software ""opt-out,"" or maybe even demanding smoother, consistent execution across brands But eliminating something that shows very measurable real-world results? That's a personal vendetta that just doesn't make sense.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbYVLb/s1/auto-start-stop-hero.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 18:10:19.344543

MONTPELIER, VT - Vermont Department of Public Service","Vermont Business Magazine The Vermont Department of Public Service is pleased to announce a $22.34 million subaward with Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) as part of the federal Solar for All Program (SFA). This funding represents over a third of Vermont's $62.45 million federal grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and will support affordable housing solar initiatives across the state.

SFA was created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It will offer $7 billion nationally to help lower the cost of electricity through solar power, which has historically been out of reach for low-income households.

The initiative was championed by Vermont's Congressional delegation, particularly by Senator Bernie Sanders who introduced the Solar for All Program.

“Solar for All will not only combat the existential threat of climate change by making solar energy available to working class families,” said Senator Sanders. “It will also substantially lower the electric bills of Americans and create thousands of good-paying jobs. This is a win for the environment, a win for consumers, and a win for the economy.”

Under this partnership, VHFA will award grants and loans to affordable housing developers to support installation of solar arrays on building rooftops, on-site ground-mounted arrays, or participation in larger off-site community solar installations.

""We are pleased to partner with VHFA to deliver solar options for affordable housing residents,"" remarked Department of Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson. ""Currently, towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar. That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

""VHFA is excited to participate in this historic program,"" said VHFA Executive Director Maura Collins. ""The program will assist our residents, who can expect to receive a long-term reduction in their utility costs or equivalent benefits. Solar power will also help affordable housing developers become part of the climate solution by offsetting the increased costs associated with heating with electricity.""

In the coming months, VHFA will hold public outreach sessions with housing developers, residents, and other key stakeholders to further inform the design of the program.

About Vermont’s Solar for All Program

Vermont's application to the EPA includes three separate programs:

The VHFA affordable housing solar initiative, referred to as the Multi-Family Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) Program;

The Affordable Community Renewable Energy (ACRE) Program, which is an existing community solar program run through utilities and will be expanded through the funding made available by SFA; and

The Residential Assistance in Solar Energy (RAISE) Program, which will offer low-income single-family homeowners the opportunity for direct ownership of net-metered rooftop solar installations of up to 5 kilowatts.

Marston Associates LLC that resolves a February 2024 incident where the company spilled approximately 1,680 gallons of biodiesel into a storm drain from a fuel truck on the Bates College campus in Lewiston, Maine.

The biodiesel reached Jepson Creek through the storm drains, and an oil sheen was observed in the Androscoggin River in alleged violation of the federal Clean Water Act.

P.S. Marston will pay a $49,528 civil penalty to resolve this case.

“This settlement holds accountable a company that polluted Maine waterways and was not able to contain all of the spilled biodiesel before it reached Jepson Creek and the Androscoggin River,” said Mark Sanborn, EPA’s regional administrator for New England.

“This case exemplifies EPA’s core mission to protect human health and the environment and ensure clean air, land and water for every American,” Sanborn said.

The spill occurred while a truck driver with the fuel-delivery company was conducting a transfer of biodiesel to Bates College.

The driver did not follow the company’s standard operating plan and walked away from the transfer.

Immediately following this, the truck and the transfer hose disconnected from one another and released an estimated 1,680 gallons of product.

The biodiesel flooded a parking lot, flowed into storm drains and eventually reached nearby waterways.

Following the spill, Bates College called the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and reported the spill to the federal National Response Center.

P.S. Marston reported that some, though not all, of the spilled oil was recovered.

Recovery of the oil in the Androscoggin River was not possible due to high levels of water and ice, and Maine DEP placed booms in the affected storm drains and in accessible areas of Jepson Brook.

DEP would still have federal funding remaining for conventional oil and gas well plugging under the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Act for its primary well plugging effort and to plug orphan conventional wells, unless Congress acts to rescind the funding.

US House Committee Action

The MERP's waste emissions charge is estimated to raise $7.2 billion in federal revenues and save American families and taxpayers tens of billions in avoided health costs.

In response, EEN Action President & CEO Rev. Dr. Jessica Moerman submitted the following letter urging members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to oppose efforts to delay or repeal this cost-effective fee on wasted natural gas and instead come together to optimize the MERP program to generate federal revenue, create jobs, and defend the health and lives of our children--

Dear Member of the House Committee for Energy and Commerce,

On behalf of the more than 600,000 pro-life Christians who have voiced their support for methane pollution safeguards over the last decade, I write to urge you to oppose efforts to repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and delay implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) in the forthcoming budget reconciliation package.

As evangelical Christians, we believe that all human life is sacred and worthy of protection.

We are committed to defending life, especially that of our children both born and unborn, from all harms.

This includes harms from pollution from carbon-based energy, which medical research finds is the leading environmental threat to children’s health.

Air pollution emitted with wasted natural gas is linked to the development and exacerbation of asthma, other respiratory diseases, cancer due to exposure to carcinogenic benzenes, heart disease, premature death, and poor birth outcomes including birth defects, low birth weight, and premature birth, and even stillbirth.

Together, air pollution associated with methane waste emissions from the oil and gas sector is estimated to cost Americans $77 billion in health impacts each year, with energy-producing regions most affected.

While some have called the WEC a tax on natural gas that companies will pass on to consumers; in truth consumers are already paying a natural gas tax: through $77 billion per year in health costs, poor health, and the grief of losing a loved one early from exposure to toxic pollution that can be avoided by capturing wasted natural gas.

To defend the health of our children, energy workers, and their families, our country must curtail needlessly wasted natural gas.

The MERP is a fiscally responsible, market-based measure designed to curb methane waste that will raise billions in federal revenues and save American families and taxpayers tens of billions in avoided health costs.

While the current draft text extends the WEC through 2035, it simultaneously delays its start date by a full decade—pushing the first year of covered emissions from 2024 to 2034 and effectively gutting the program’s impact for the next ten years.

The delayed implementation of the fee until 2034 would eliminate $7.2 billion in projected federal revenue and allow for another decade the egregious waste of $1 billion in lost commercial value per year.

While concerns have been raised that a fee to encourage the oil and gas sector to capture wasted natural gas could negatively impact small producers, the MERP was specifically designed to support small producers in reducing their methane waste.

As part of the program, only the largest producers would be assessed a fee, which would end once methane waste emissions are sufficiently reduced.

Furthermore, federal taxpayers have already provided generous financial assistance to assist industry in reducing methane waste, with much of the $1.55 billion in MERP grant funding already out the door.

Much of this assistance was aimed at lowering the bar for small producers to put in place waste reduction technologies.

Wasted natural gas is not only poor stewardship of our energy resources but robs our children and loved ones from reaching their full God-given potential.

Excessive methane waste should be assessed a fee to defend the health of our children, ensure taxpayers are compensated for the loss of a valuable American resource, and encourage oil and gas partners to address the energy emergency by bringing more gas to market instead of wasting it into thin air.

Now is not the time to put a significant federal revenue raiser on the sidelines.

We urge you to oppose efforts to repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and delay implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC).

We instead urge the committee to come together for discussion and dialogue on optimizing the implementation of MERP to generate federal revenue, create jobs, and defend the life of our children.

This Clean Air Month, the DNR’s Air Management Program is highlighting the nonattainment challenges facing Wisconsin and sharing resources available for individuals, businesses and communities to stay informed about air quality.

Wisconsin’s air quality successes over the last 20 years include an 88% decrease in sulfur dioxide concentrations, a 26% decrease in fine particle pollution and a 21% decrease in statewide ozone concentrations. Still, even as air pollution has declined over the past few decades, that trend has slowed in recent years. Longstanding issues such as unique geography and meteorology and transported emissions continue to impact the air quality along Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan shoreline.

Additionally, impacts from increased wildfire activity make it more challenging to meet today’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality standards.

Ozone pollution remains a particularly complex challenge for Wisconsin. The EPA estimates Wisconsin contributes no more than 10% of the ozone concentrations measured in ozone nonattainment areas, while other states contribute as much as 50% (the remaining contributions are from non-state sources, like emissions from natural sources).

Ozone forming pollutants – volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – are emitted by upwind states and transported over Lake Michigan, where they react and form ozone, which is then carried onshore via lake breezes. This process can often lead to elevated ozone levels in Wisconsin’s lakeshore counties, even though a large portion of that pollution comes from other states, explains DNR Air Management Program Director Gail Good.

Wisconsin continues to seek effective federal rules to address and control pollutant transport. “Though Wisconsin does not emit the majority of the air pollution currently in the state, we are responsible for meeting federal air quality standards regardless of where the pollutants originate,” Good said. “The State of Wisconsin is working to ensure that rules addressing ozone transport adequately and fully resolve ozone transport obligations for Wisconsin and ensure Wisconsin businesses are not held responsible for nonattainment issues they have no control over.”

How The Public Can Help

Clean Air Month is a great time to focus on actions the public can all take to contribute to better air quality and learn how air quality can affect human health.

The DNR’s updated air quality data map, launching in June 2025, will make it even easier to access the near real-time data from the state’s air monitoring network and understand when air quality events may be impacting your health.
