On a quiet street near the marsh in Charleston, South Carolina’s Rosemont neighborhood, Luvenia Brown watches the weather reports more than she used to. She’s lost lawn mowers, bikes and outdoor furniture to the rising waters that have repeatedly crept into her yard.

Brown’s home is elevated, so the water hasn’t reached the interior. Not yet. But she’s deeply worried about what the future will bring.

“If the water continues rising the way it is, I don’t want to be here,” said Brown, 58, who works as a medical driver. “I love my area. But I think my life is more important.”

Just a half mile to the south, a massive new development – expected to bring stores, offices and 4,000 homes – is springing up. Brown worries that all the new concrete and pavement will only make flooding where she lives worse.

Charleston is one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities – and one of the most flood-prone. As climate change prompts sea levels to rise and storms to grow more intense, this historic city has become a warning bell for what’s to come along America’s coasts: Some neighborhoods will retreat and others will be protected, and still others – often lower-income communities – may be left behind.

In Charleston, those futures are colliding. The city and the federal government are planning a $1.3bn sea wall to defend the iconic downtown peninsula with its regal, pre-civil-war mansions and majestic moss-covered live oak trees.

But under the current plans, the wall would not extend to lower-income neighborhoods like Rosemont, a historically Black community bordered by a freeway and hemmed in by industrial sites. That could leave those families more exposed to rising waters than ever.

“I’ve seen how all those floodwaters demolish people’s houses,” Brown said. “I don’t think I want to be part of that.”

Dozens of coastal cities from New York to California face similar threats. Driven largely by sea level rise, flooding in the coastal United States is projected to occur 10 times more often over the next 25 years, according to a recent analysis by the non-profit Climate Central. An estimated 2.5 million Americans could be forced to relocate over the next 25 years, the group found.

Nationally, poor communities are disproportionately affected by hurricanes and flooding, research shows.

The increasing floods are prompting insurance companies to raise premiums and decline policy renewals, creating incentives for residents to leave their homes. In fact, zip codes in coastal South Carolina are among those with the highest insurance non-renewal rates, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.

Rising water, growing crisis

Charleston was built along the confluence of three rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, on marshland and mud flats. Flooding there was once far less frequent.

But now, even an afternoon thunderstorm or an unusually high tide can overwhelm drainage systems and submerge streets. The sea level in Charleston rose about 13in over the past century, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and by 2100 it’s expected to rise about 4ft more.

Charleston is also one of the most rapidly sinking cities in the United States, mainly because of groundwater pumping and the settling of natural sediments and filled marsh areas. That double threat – rising seas and sinking land – leaves the city increasingly exposed to flooding.

According to Climate Central’s Coastal Risk Finder, more than 8,000 people and 4,700 homes in Charleston county will be at risk of annual flooding by 2050, even under moderate climate action scenarios. By 2100, more than 60,000 people could be affected.

Rapid development, meanwhile, is paving over forests and wetlands that once soaked up stormwater. Every new subdivision and strip mall replaces absorbent ground with impervious surfaces – asphalt, rooftops, parking lots – that send rainwater rushing into neighborhoods such as Rosemont.

The uneven fight against the sea

After Hurricane Matthew sent water surging over Charleston’s Battery wall in 2016, city officials consulted with Dutch flood experts and developed a comprehensive plan to protect the city against flooding. Federal officials proposed an eight-mile-long, $1.3bn sea wall to shield the city’s historic peninsula from future storm surges and sea level rise.

The city’s share will probably be $455m, Charleston’s mayor, William Cogswell, recently told a city committee.

But neighborhoods like Rosemont – just beyond the wall’s reach – would remain exposed. Parts of the neighborhood are projected to be underwater by the end of the century. And some have voiced concerns that the wall could actually make flooding worse in unprotected areas.

Skip Mikell, a longtime community leader in Union Heights, a historically Black neighborhood near Rosemont, stood at the end of Peace Street in Rosemont, looking out over the marsh.

“In 70 years, where we’re standing, if nothing’s done, it’s going to be water,” Mikell said, adding: “The gentry of Charleston have connections, they have money, they have a voice. These communities are voiceless.”

The long road to retreat

Retreat has already started to happen in Charleston. About 11 miles west of Rosemont, a tranquil expanse of weeds, marsh grasses and black-eyed Susans is all that’s left of Bridge Pointe, once a compact community of 32 townhomes. Beginning in 2015, the neighborhood experienced a succession of floods, and in 2017, Fema authorized $10m to buy out Bridge Pointe’s residents and some of their neighbors.

The neighborhood had experienced four major floods by then, making homes “really unsellable”, said John Knipper, one of the displaced residents.

It took nearly four years after buyout discussions began for residents to get money for relocation. A typical buyout can take more than five years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The US Government Accountability Office, meanwhile, found that there’s no national strategy for relocating people from flood-prone areas.

As wetlands disappear, risks grow

As former Bridge Pointe residents piece their lives back together, new homes will soon go up in another flood-prone area just a mile away.

Long Savannah is expected to bring up to 4,500 homes. It’s one of several massive projects rising across Charleston county, including Magnolia Landing and Cainhoy, 4,000- and 9,000-home developments. The developers of Long Savannah have received approval to fill and excavate wetlands, which environmentalists say are crucial to soaking up rain and keeping flooding in check.

The developers of Long Savannah and Magnolia Landing did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Cainhoy noted that the project was on higher ground than other flood-prone areas, and that 3,500 acres of wetlands will be preserved.

In the Cainhoy case, a federal judge in 2022 dismissed flooding concerns, citing a US army corps of engineers report, which concluded the development has a “high percentage of wetlands and … numerous direct outfalls to tidal waters that will minimize the potential for heavy rains to overwhelm its infrastructure.”

“Charleston has a history of building in repetitively flooded areas,” said Robby Maynor, a climate campaign associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which, along with other environmental groups, contested a decision by state environmental officials to allow new development on wetlands in the Long Savannah project. “We absolutely must stop building in low-lying and flood-prone areas to avoid making an already difficult situation even worse.”

City floodplain officials didn’t respond to requests for an interview. But in a brief email to Floodlight, the city floodplain manager, Caroline Schnell, pointed to flood protections – such as higher elevation standards and better stormwater systems – for new buildings in flood-prone areas.

‘Canary in a coalmine’

Ana Zimmerman has also been vocal about the dangers of letting developers fill creek-beds and build on low-lying areas.

In 2005, she and her husband bought their modest one-story home in a close-knit James Island neighborhood, just south of downtown. Like much of the area outside the city’s historic core, it falls beyond the protection of Charleston’s planned sea wall.

The first sign of trouble came early one morning in October 2015. It was still dark when she put her feet to the bedroom floor, water lapping at her ankles. A powerful storm had overwhelmed the street. Zimmerman rushed to save photo albums and the family cats, but the house suffered more than $80,000 in damages.

With the insurance payout and their own labor, the Zimmermans repaired the home.

But when Tropical Storm Irma hit two years later, Zimmerman remembers hearing neighbors screaming as 7in of floodwaters poured into her home – causing it to be declared a total loss.

Ultimately the couple abandoned the flood-damaged home and let it go into foreclosure, walking away from 12 years of equity. They now live nearby in a house on an elevated foundation. Zimmerman, who calls herself an “unintentional flood activist”, has pressed public officials for stricter building rules and clearer flood-risk disclosures.

She says her experience is a “canary in a coalmine” for other low-lying coastal communities.

“Entire neighborhoods will have to move,” said Zimmerman, a college biology professor. “But the vulnerable among us, there will be no one there to help them, save them, and they will not be able to save themselves.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8c0b1577daaa8af05b13694dee2eb22b43de6b9/773_0_3663_2931/master/3663.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8abb468fb9641481d0bd5d097647738",N,,2025-09-09 11:02:57.273999

Alongside him were attorneys general Kris Kobach of Kansas, Liz Murrill of Louisiana, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, and then-attorney general of Alaska, Treg Taylor.
The attorneys general said they are also concerned by lawsuits from states and local governments that could result in financial penalties against fossil fuel companies for disasters attributed to climate change.
A group of Republican attorneys general, led by McCuskey, sued New York in February.

“I think that the group of people that are on this panel are all united in making sure that all of the expertise in all of our offices are being utilized to make sure that this doesn’t keep going, because it’s very, very dangerous,” said J.B. McCuskey, attorney general of West Virginia, at the annual meeting of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.

Alongside him were attorneys general Kris Kobach of Kansas, Liz Murrill of Louisiana, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, and then-attorney general of Alaska, Treg Taylor.

The attorneys general said they are also concerned by lawsuits from states and local governments that could result in financial penalties against fossil fuel companies for disasters attributed to climate change.

Vermont made history in 2024 when it enacted a law that allows the state to hold fossil fuel companies financially liable for the negative impacts of climate change on that state. New York followed suit with a similar law later in the year.

Under both laws, fines levied by the states and paid by fossil fuel companies would go into a large fund that would be spent on projects that could mitigate natural disasters or subsidize clean energy projects.

Other Democratic-led states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey and California, are considering similar laws.

“Now that we have a friendly EPA and a friendly administration, the blue states are deciding that they’re now going to be the EPA,” McCuskey said, speaking at a different panel hosted by the Republican Women of Anchorage.

The attorneys general, plus Ken Paxton of Texas, who was not present at the industry panel, nodded along as McCuskey spoke.

“Their argument is that every single permitted operation that happened in Alaska caused $75 billion worth of damage to the people of New York. It’s completely outrageous. And the problem isn’t just that it’s New York, it’s that Illinois has one. California is going to have one. Vermont’s going to have one. Massachusetts is going to have one. You name a place that has radical environmentalists running their government, and then it becomes an amount of money that’s not withstandable,” McCuskey said.

Taylor, who has since resigned as Alaska’s attorney general and is expected to run for governor, said he believes that in states with budget holes, “it’s pretty convenient just to raise taxes on oil and gas, right? And those states that don’t have oil and gas, that’s their way of dealing with their budget shortfalls, is to take it out of oil and gas through these types of acts.”

Fossil fuel businesses and trade groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed suit last year against the Vermont law.

A group of Republican attorneys general, led by McCuskey, sued New York in February. Another McCuskey-led suit, filed in May, targets Vermont.

The Trump administration has also gotten involved by filing lawsuits against both states and against states like Hawaii that have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.

Those suits say companies should be financially liable for harm caused by climate change.

Speaking at the Alaska oil panel, Kobach said he’s concerned about climate lawsuits filed by cities and counties and believes they’re being encouraged by national environmental law firms and groups.

“The reason I’m so energized about fighting back against that is Ford County, Kansas, which you probably never heard of, where Dodge City is — little tiny county, rural county, very low population — somehow, they were convinced by some very well-heeled attorneys in California to be a plaintiff in one of these lawsuits. And so we’re chasing them around. My office is chasing them around, trying to get them kicked out of court because they don’t speak for the people of Kansas,” he said.

Taylor said he sees the same issue.

“We’re seeing those opportunistic plaintiffs’ attorneys convince municipalities and boroughs and cities to take on litigation that’s really not in their best interest and really puts money into their own pockets,” he said during the panel discussion.

McCuskey, of West Virginia, said his state is considering a law that would restrict the ability of local governments to sue.

Nationally, the fossil fuel industry is lobbying Congress to pass a liability shield law akin to the one passed in 2005 to protect the gun industry against lawsuits attempting to hold gun manufacturers responsible for gun crimes.

In June, McCuskey and other attorneys general wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney General to offer support for a national liability shield to protect fossil fuel companies.

The National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities have each adopted resolutions opposing such a liability shield. Both organizations say that local governments should retain the power to file lawsuits.

McCuskey, speaking at the oil panel, got a laugh from the audience when he asked attendees what they thought West Virginians would say if New York tried to collect a fine from the state of West Virginia.

“Our big joke is that the people in New York are literally looking down on us from the skyscrapers that were built with coal from West Virginia,” McCuskey said at the oil and gas association panel. “So they’re not just looking down on us figuratively, but both literally and figuratively, and they just have no contemplation of why their economies were built by the people who do the work that’s happening here.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250828-attorneys-general-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 11:03:24.738535

VinFast Auto Ltd. expects to open its delayed North Carolina plant in 2028 while the Vietnamese electric vehicle maker continues to seek equity investors, according to Chairwoman Le Thi Thu Thuy.

As part of its shift to Asia amid growing losses, VinFast last month inaugurated the company’s first overseas factory in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu that will have an initial production capacity of 50,000 vehicles a year. It expects to open another assembly plant in Indonesia’s West Java by October.

Thuy confirmed that the company will announce a $200 million loan from Indian state-owned banks soon, she said in a Bloomberg TV interview. Bloomberg News reported in May that the automaker was seeking the loan from state-owned institutions.

VinFast is “constantly looking for other ways to fund the business,” she said. “So it’s still looking to bring in the equity investor at the price that is acceptable to us.”

As the company expands, it will “continue growing our credit profile,” Thuy said.

VinFast was poised to raise $1.5 billion by selling certain research and development assets to founder Pham Nhat Vuong. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year, VinFast said.

The billionaire has already pumped more than $2 billion of his own money into the EV maker and has said he’s willing to support it until his money runs out.

VinFast posted a net loss of about 20.34 trillion dong ($770 million) in the second quarter, 15% wider than the first quarter and 8.4% from a year ago, according to an exchange filing.

Vuong said in April the automaker will prioritize Asia — including India, Indonesia and the Philippines — over North America and Europe, where high logistics costs weigh on margins.

VinFast, which announced last year it was delaying a North Carolina EV factory until 2028, is “pushing forward” with the plan to open the plant at that time, Thuy said.

Parent company Vingroup JSC is considering expanding its entire business ecosystem — which includes developing mega cities, schools and hospitals — to India, she said. VinFast is committed to manufacturing automobiles and setting up EV infrastructure in the country, Thuy said.

That also includes the launching of taxi company Green & Smart Mobility JSC, or GSM, in the country. The taxi company is owned by Vuong.

In January 2025, EO 14008 was revoked, thereby terminating the Justice40 Initiative.
As of December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had taken actions to implement the Justice40 Initiative.
For example, in 2022 USDA established an Equity Commission that identified barriers to inclusion or access to USDA programs.
We were also asked, prior to the initiative's termination, to review implementation of the Justice40 Initiative.","What GAO Found

Executive Order (EO) 14008, issued in 2021 and revoked in January 2025, directed federal agencies to take action to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related, and other cumulative impacts on ""disadvantaged communities."" Specifically, the EO established the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to such communities. Benefits could include, for example, improved health, lower home energy costs, or restored wetlands. The EO referred to this all-of-government effort as the Justice40 Initiative. The initiative did not itself create programs or provide funding. In January 2025, EO 14008 was revoked, thereby terminating the Justice40 Initiative.

As of December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had taken actions to implement the Justice40 Initiative. These actions included integrating related goals and strategies into agency plans, taking steps to address barriers underserved communities face in accessing federal programs, issuing internal guidance, and modifying programs covered by the Justice40 Initiative. For example, in 2022 EPA issued guidance directing the 28 National Estuary Programs receiving funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create a strategy describing how the funds would be used to increase benefits to disadvantaged communities, as well as how those benefits would be tracked.

The agencies also conducted outreach to Tribes, community groups, state and local governments, businesses, and the public to inform these efforts. For example, in 2022 USDA established an Equity Commission that identified barriers to inclusion or access to USDA programs. USDA then took steps to address those barriers, such as by publishing a guide to help underserved farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners better understand and access programs and resources available to them.

The three agencies also took preliminary steps to assess the results of their actions to implement the initiative. These steps included identifying data needed to evaluate barriers to and progress toward the Justice40 goal, and reporting on some programs' funding to and impacts on underserved communities. For example, Interior reported that as of fiscal year 2024 approximately 44 percent of the more than 9,600 abandoned oil and gas wells plugged by state and local partners with funding from Interior's Orphaned Wells Program were in disadvantaged communities.

With the termination of the initiative in January 2025, the overall results of agency actions remain unknown. According to GAO's review of agency and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) materials, by December 2024 EPA, Interior, USDA, and OMB had not reported on what benefits resulted from each program, how those benefits were measured, or what the overall amount of funding or benefits was delivered to disadvantaged communities. Further, as of December 2024, neither the three agencies nor OMB had reported any assessments of agency actions to implement the initiative. The three agencies faced a variety of challenges identifying and measuring benefits across programs that operate at various geographic and time scales—benefits that may be difficult to attribute or quantify and may take years to manifest.

Why GAO Did This Study

Federal agencies were tasked with implementing the Justice40 Initiative for their programs—including those established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—that made investments in certain areas, such as clean transit and training and workforce development. By November 2023, 19 agencies had identified 518 programs that made qualifying investments, such as grants and loans, to Tribes, states, individuals, organizations, and other entities. According to the Executive Office of the President's 2023 Environmental Justice Scorecard, Congress appropriated approximately $618 billion total for the programs for fiscal years 2022 through 2027, including supplemental appropriations such as the IRA.

The IRA included a provision for us to support oversight of the distribution and use of funds appropriated under the IRA and whether the economic, social, and environmental impacts of those funds are equitable. We were also asked, prior to the initiative's termination, to review implementation of the Justice40 Initiative. This report provides information on the actions that three of the agencies with the most covered programs had taken, as of December 2024, to implement the initiative and related efforts, as well as steps they had taken to assess those actions. The three agencies GAO examined are EPA, Interior, and USDA. This report also provides information on how OMB had used the agencies' data on Justice40 implementation as of December 2024, prior to the initiative's termination in January 2025.

GAO reviewed documents from and interviewed officials and staff at EPA, Interior, USDA, and OMB to understand the actions each had taken as of December 2024 to implement and assess the Justice40 Initiative.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 09:59:51.603030

His comments, which were first published as part of an interview with the Financial Times on Monday, come as Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum prepare to travel to Milan, Italy, for the Gastech energy conference.

""Net zero 2050 is just a colossal train wreck … It's just a monstrous human impoverishment program and of course there is no way it is going to happen,"" Wright said in remarks shared by the U.S. Department of Energy on social media platform X.

Net zero refers to the goal of achieving a state of balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere and the carbon removed from it.

More than 140 countries, including major polluters such as the U.S., India and the European Union, have adopted plans to reach net zero by various timelines.

To meet the critically important warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, as prescribed in the landmark Paris Agreement, global carbon emissions should reach net zero by around the middle of the century, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit non-profit.

For high-income nations such as the U.S., this means reaching net zero by 2050 or earlier. Low-income countries can meanwhile achieve the feat by the 2050s or 2060s.

A former oil and gas executive, Wright has recognized climate change as a global challenge that ""deserves attention,"" while criticizing what he has described as ""climate alarmists.""

Scientists, meanwhile, have challenged Wright's comments on climate change, describing them as ""a regurgitation of misinformative talking points.""

Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, are the primary cause of climate change.

The Trump administration official, who is scheduled to deliver an address on the U.S. vision for global energy security at Gastech on Wednesday, has reportedly warned that European climate rules could threaten the EU's trade deal with the White House.

The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the world's first carbon border levy, and the bloc's regulation on methane were among some of the measures cited by Wright as potential risks to the U.S.-EU trade framework, according to the Financial Times.

A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, declined to comment.

Under the terms of the U.S.-EU trade pact, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described as a ""good deal"" when it was struck, the EU has said companies in the 27-nation bloc have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion in various sectors by 2029.

Bottom Line The EV credit has been a driving force behind the rapid adoption of electric vehicles.
If you’re serious about buying an EV—whether new, used, or for your business—act before September 30, 2025.
Because as of October 1, the road to EV tax credits closes.","If you’ve been eyeing an electric vehicle (EV) as your next ride, the clock is ticking. The federal EV tax credits—worth up to $7,500 for new vehicles, $4,000 for used ones, and as much as $40,000 for commercial fleets—will officially expire on September 30, 2025.

That means buyers and businesses have just a few weeks left to cash in on one of the most powerful clean energy incentives in the tax code. After that? Unless Congress acts, it’s gone.

What’s Available Now

⦁ New EVs (Clean Vehicle Credit, Section 30D): Up to $7,500, depending on whether both the battery sourcing and critical minerals requirements are met. MSRP limits apply: $55,000 for cars, $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and trucks.

⦁ Used EVs (Section 25E): Up to $4,000 (or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less). Eligible vehicles must cost $25,000 or less, be at least two years old, and purchased from a dealer—not a private party.

⦁ Commercial EVs (Section 45W): Up to $7,500 for light-duty EVs and a whopping $40,000 for heavy-duty vehicles.

Who Qualifies

Income limits (based on modified adjusted gross income, MAGI) apply:

⦁ New EVs: $150,000 (Single), $225,000 (Head of Household), $300,000 (Married Filing Jointly).

⦁ Used EVs: $75,000 (Single), $112,500 (Head of Household), $150,000 (Married Filing Jointly).

The Fine Print (and Loopholes)

⦁ Delivery Loophole: If you sign a purchase contract and make payment by September 30, 2025, you still qualify for the credit—even if your car isn’t delivered until later.

⦁ Leases: Consumer leasing is no longer eligible. The credit goes to the leasing company, and that “leasing loophole” ends with the credit on September 30.

⦁ Commercial Fleets: Same deadline. If your company is considering electrifying, now is the time.

Why You Shouldn’t Wait

⦁ Inventory pressure: As the deadline approaches, expect a surge in EV demand, limited availability, and fewer options.

⦁ No guarantees: Unless new legislation extends it, this incentive disappears.

⦁ Immediate impact: A $7,500 reduction in your tax bill is real money—and for businesses, the $40,000 commercial credit can dramatically improve ROI on fleet upgrades.

Bottom Line

The EV credit has been a driving force behind the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. But like all good things in the tax code, it’s temporary.

If you’re serious about buying an EV—whether new, used, or for your business—act before September 30, 2025. Sign that contract, make the payment, and lock in the credit while you still can.

Because as of October 1, the road to EV tax credits closes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. oilfield services firm Baker Hughes is collaborating with Controlled Thermal Resources in California to develop one of the world's largest single geothermal power projects, with plans to market the electricity to data centers, the companies said on Tuesday.

Energy-intensive data centers, which are used to produce the next wave of artificial intelligence technologies, are driving U.S. power demand to record highs and propelling the advancement of electricity sources that had been in decline or sparsely used.

CTR has been working on the development of its ""Hell's Kitchen"" geothermal power and critical minerals project for roughly 13 years. The privately-held company has about 4,500 acres (18.2 square kilometers) in and around the Salton Sea in Imperial County, California for development.

Baker Hughes has signed onto the second phase of Hell's Kitchen, which involves producing 500 megawatts of power, or enough to power about 375,000 homes, with the possibility of expanding from there, CTR told Reuters.

Baker will deploy high-temperature drilling technologies, power systems, and services historically used for oil and gas field production to help streamline and lower project costs, CTR CEO Rod Colwell told Reuters.

""That kind of expertise is very powerful,"" Colwell said.

Baker will also assist in raising capital for the project.

While geothermal energy has been used in the U.S. for decades, it remains less than 0.5% of the country's electricity supplies due partially to high upfront costs.

Recently, however, geothermal power producers have found new customers in Big Tech as the Silicon Valley companies scour for the vast amounts of electricity needed for their AI expansion plans.

Meta, in June, said that it had signed power purchase agreements for advanced geothermal in New Mexico for its data centers. Google reached an agreement last year for geothermal power in Nevada.

Conventional geothermal energy production involves drilling wells deep into the earth to release extremely hot salty brine, which produces steam that can be used to propel power turbines.

Geothermal power plants, according to the Energy Information Administration, emit about 99% less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel power plants.

CTR declined to provide details on the total project costs.

CTR is nearing a final investment decision on the first phase of Hell's Kitchen, which involves producing 50 MW of electricity that has been committed to the local electric utility. Commercial operations for that phase are supposed to begin in 2027.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters-finance.com/3ec6b3e05f1cdc4a0e38aa521257f79d,N,,2025-09-09 09:59:47.952912

Abiy assured his neighbors on Tuesday that Ethiopia does not plan to hurt them, and that they will have shared prosperity.","ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — Ethiopia on Tuesday inaugurated Africa’s largest dam to boost the economy, end frequent blackouts and support the growth of electric vehicle development in a country that has banned the importation of gasoline-powered vehicles.

As reservoir waters flowed into the turbines of the Grand Renaissance Dam, Ethiopians dressed in colorful regalia viewed the ceremony on large screens across the capital, Addis Ababa, and celebrated the achievement with dancing to traditional music.

“We will have enough power to charge our electric vehicles from the new dam,” said Belay Tigabu, a bus driver in Addis Ababa’s main bus terminal.

The almost $5 billion mega-dam, located on a tributary of the River Nile in the northwest of the country, near the border with Sudan, will produce more than 5,000 megawatts and is expected to double national electricity generation capacity, according to officials.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, speaking during the launch, said the dam was a “big achievement” that would show the world what Africans are capable of accomplishing. Dozens of visiting African heads of state and government joined Abiy for the inauguration, with many expressing interest in importing power from Ethiopia.

“I am proud to announce we will soon be signing an agreement with the government of Ethiopia to receive electricity from the dam that will benefit our hospitals and schools,” said South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir.

Kenyan President William Ruto said his nation is looking to sign a power purchasing agreement with Ethiopia based on the resources of the dam project, which he said was a “pan-African statement.”

Already an importer of Ethiopia electricity, Ruto said Kenya is seeking to alleviate the electricity deficit his country is experiencing. He said the dam “exemplifies the scale and ambition of African-led infrastructure and aligns with the Africa Union’s vision of continental energy connectivity.”

But Ethiopia’s new dam has faced controversy, with neighboring Egypt expressing concerns over reduced water flows downstream.

Egypt has long opposed the dam because of concerns it would deplete its share of Nile River waters. The Arab world’s most populous country relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its more than 100 million people.

Tamim Khallaf, a spokesperson for Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told The Associated Press that the dam posed an “existential threat.”

“There was no prior notification, proper consultations, or consensus with downstream countries, thereby constituting a grave violation of international law,” he said.

Abiy assured his neighbors on Tuesday that Ethiopia does not plan to hurt them, and that they will have shared prosperity.

“I assure you that Ethiopia will never take away your rightful share,"" he said. ""Today, I make this promise before my people. The hunger of our brothers in Egypt, in Sudan, or anywhere else is also our hunger. We must share and grow together, for we have no intention of harming anyone.”

There is a strong sense of pride in what Ethiopia has managed to accomplish with the completion of the dam.

A 20-year-old university student, Yabsira Misganw, who was advertising a new online shopping mobile app, said the new dam “will provide stable electricity and improve online services.”

Most geoengineering ideas are climate Band-Aids at best.
Any plan must be able to grow to a scale that truly helps within the next few decades to help reach global climate goals.
Many climate scientists were alarmed that some of the geoengineering ideas, no matter how far-fetched, seemed to be gaining traction with a few policymakers.
In an email, Kirkham wrote that most geoengineering ideas had long been “dismissed and ignored” by the mainstream climate science community.","A team of the world’s best ice and climate researchers studied a handful of recently publicized engineering concepts for protecting Earth’s polar ice caps and found that none of them are likely to work.

Their peer-reviewed research, published Tuesday, shows some of the untested ideas, such as dispersing particles in the atmosphere to dim sunlight or trying to refreeze ice sheets with pumped water, could have unintended and dangerous consequences.

The various speculative notions that have been floated, mainly via public relations efforts, include things such as spreading reflective particles over newly formed sea ice to promote its persistence and growth; building giant ocean-bottom sea walls or curtains to deflect warmer streams of water away from ice shelves; pumping water from the base of glaciers to the surface to refreeze it, and even intentionally polluting the upper atmosphere with sulfur-based or other reflective particles to dim sunlight.

Research shows the particle-based sunlight-dimming concept could shift rainfall patterns like seasonal monsoons critical for agriculture in some areas, and also intensify regional heat, precipitation and drought extremes. And the authors of the new paper wrote that some of the mechanical interventions to preserve ice would likely disrupt regional ocean ecosystems, including the marine food chain, from tiny krill to giant whales.

Lead author Martin Siegert, a glaciologist at the University of Exeter, said that to provide a comprehensive view of the challenges, the new paper included 40 authors with expertise in fields including oceanography, marine biology, glaciology and atmospheric science.

The paper counters a promotional geo-engineering narrative with science-based evidence showing the difficulties and unintended consequences of some of the aspirational ventures, he said. Most

geoengineering ideas are climate Band-Aids at best. They only address symptoms, he added, but don’t tackle the root cause of the problem—greenhouse gas emissions.

“I think it’s fair to say that the promotion of some of these ideas have not provided a sense of just how difficult it would be,” Siegert said. “So what you get is the maximizing of the potential of doing it and minimizing the challenge of it ever happening. It becomes a sort of distorted, one-sided proposition.”

To assess the feasibility of five specific concepts, he said they developed a set of questions that could also apply to geoengineering proposals in areas other than the poles. In nearly every case, they found that the costs and logistics are prohibitive, and that there’s no reason to think they would be effective in protecting ice or reducing the impacts of global warming in other ways.

The first question, he said, is whether the idea would even work in practice. Then, it’s important to think about risks, both the obvious ones and the unexpected side effects that might come with any intervention large enough to affect the climate. Money is an obvious factor, since these kinds of projects could cost tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.

Size and timing matter, he continued. Any plan must be able to grow to a scale that truly helps within the next few decades to help reach global climate goals.

“We have to avoid giving people false hope by suggesting that climate change can be fixed without cutting carbon emissions, which is the only real solution,” he said, adding that special care is also needed in the polar regions because of their harsh conditions, logistical hurdles and delicate ecosystems. In places such as Antarctica, he added, international treaties meant to protect the environment would make large-scale interventions very difficult, if not impossible.

“It’s not that we wanted to do this study, but there is a very small minority that is really pushing this,” said co-author James Kirkham, chief science advisor for a group of more than 20 countries that first joined together at the 2022 COP27 U.N. climate talks in Egypt to focus more attention on the threat of melting ice and rising sea levels.

The following year at COP28 in Dubai, he noted that numerous events promoted concepts that are generally grouped under the term “geoengineering,” which refers to artificially and intentionally intervening with parts of the climate system. Many climate scientists were alarmed that some of the geoengineering ideas, no matter how far-fetched, seemed to be gaining traction with a few policymakers.

In some cases, the presentations were designed to look like they were sponsored by national pavilions, “even though at least the people we’ve talked to within these administrations don’t want anything to do with this at all,” Kirkham said. “The thing that really wound us up was that they were pitching these fringe ideas as if they had the backing of the entire research community.”

The assessment shows that “no current geoengineering idea passes an objective and comprehensive test regarding its use in the coming decades,” he said.

In an email, Kirkham wrote that most geoengineering ideas had long been “dismissed and ignored” by the mainstream climate science community. But in recent years, “there seems to have been a shift … with a lot more money flowing into these sorts of projects and the hiring of experienced and slick PR people to get these ideas out there into the media,” he said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2162493437-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 10:00:44.037299

“Right now, young trainees in public health and environmental health are looking at what’s going on and saying, ‘Does it make sense for me to put in the years of effort that it takes to earn a doctorate in environmental health if there’s not going to be a career?’” she said.","Jane Clougherty has dedicated the majority of her professional life to researching the health effects of air pollution and, more recently, extreme heat. But in May, she got an email from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that ground her potentially life-saving work to a halt.

Sitting on her parents’ back porch in Boston, the Drexel University professor learned her research had been cancelled — effective immediately.

“There was no discussion, there was no warning, simply an email that said, ‘You’re done. This project is no longer within the administration’s scope. Cease and desist activities as of today,’” she recalled over the phone.

The email, which was riddled with typos, disgusted Clougherty, who was spending her final days with her father who was in hospice care. “It was horrible and traumatic and a very unprofessional way to handle the elimination of these grants,” she said.

But she also wasn’t surprised. For months the Trump administration had been hacking away at any work related to equity, climate change and environmental justice. Her research — which analyzed emergency room visits across New York State to understand the impacts of heat and air pollution on children’s health — was focused squarely on all of the above.

When asked about the grant cancellations, an EPA spokesperson told the 19th in a statement: “Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing the EPA’s core mission.”

Clougherty, who had a final year of research left on the multi-year federal grant, is one of thousands of researchers whose work has been affected by the administration’s cancellation of research grants across agencies including the National Institute of Health, the EPA and the National Science Foundation. Among the research casualties was a grant to study how to reduce the health risks of wildfire smoke near schools, and another that would research how to help children in rural areas who are at increased risk of exposure to pesticides and pollution.

It’s work that would have helped some of the country’s most vulnerable children at a time when extreme weather events are becoming more common and the gains made in protecting environmental health are being overrun by a pro-fossil fuel administration that is cutting regulations that curb air and water pollution.

These issues disproportionately impact low-income communities of color. And, it’s moms who typically end up having to juggle their jobs and caring for their children’s health issues.

Now much of the work will instead gather digital dust as researchers look for new funding sources, or potentially abandon their research altogether. At particular risk to these changes are children, whose still-developing bodies are more susceptible to environmental dangers.

Extreme heat is taxing on children’s bodies, because they have a harder time regulating their body temperature. Heat can also amplify air pollution by trapping it in place, which can affect kids with asthma or other respiratory issues.

If Clougherty’s work had been completed, it may have helped communities across the country better understand how to protect kids from these health issues, she said.

That’s because in addition to analyzing how children in the state were being affected by extreme heat and air pollution, Clougherty and her team were also studying community assets that could buffer children from these same hazards by analyzing large data sets that provide insights into a community’s characteristics.

They could analyze whether children lived in neighborhoods with a lot of green space, and how that correlated to their health when exposed to heat or pollution, she said. “We can also look at the characteristics of the schools that the children attend, and economic and other assets in their communities, such as access to grocery stores, Head Start programs, proximity to hospitals or health care services [and] quality of housing.”

By calculating which of these assets could have the best protective effect on children’s health, it would have helped local leaders plan where to target limited resources “to create the most bang for their buck,” Clougherty said.

For advocacy groups like the Children’s Environmental Health Network, the ability to point to data is crucial to reaching policy makers. “We’re not used to having this granular, local level, children-specific research that we can use,” said Kristie Trousdale, the deputy director of the organization. “It just would have really helped us in our messaging to have these findings that are actionable and that can be used in a preventive way. Because we’re always reacting.”

The Pediatric Environmental Health Team at the Mount Sinai health system in New York said in an email that they also rely on this work to inform how they develop solutions. “[Our] team responds to many inquiries from worried families and concerned health professionals about how to keep children safe. We draw from research like this to craft our responses and develop clinical tools.” (A member of this team is also a co-researcher on Clougherty’s project.)

Clougherty said the cancellation of grants does not affect just the current research but the field as a whole. “Oh, my God, the ramifications are extraordinary,” she said. “Scientific laboratories are not something you can turn on and off in short order. This is a lot of infrastructure being lost, a lot of lab-specific knowledge being lost, and staff are losing jobs.”

She also worries the country could lose early-career researchers who would carry this work into the future. “Right now, young trainees in public health and environmental health are looking at what’s going on and saying, ‘Does it make sense for me to put in the years of effort that it takes to earn a doctorate in environmental health if there’s not going to be a career?’” she said. “We are potentially losing a whole generation of scientific skill and knowledge.”

When grants are cancelled so abruptly, taxpayers lose out, too. Clougherty had been awarded a $1.35 million grant, and had already spent nearly a million of that funding when she received the cancellation notice. Clougherty has appealed the EPAs decision, but won’t find out until December whether her funding could be restored.

For Trousdale, who also sits on the EPA’s Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee, the threats feel even more existential than cutting research grants, it’s the potential disregard of science altogether.

She worries about the EPA plan to rescind the endangerment finding, a determination made previously by the agency in 2009, that found that fossil fuel emissions were threatening public health. It required the agency to take action to regulate sources of this pollution and was based on a robust body of scientific evidence.

“It seems to me that we are abandoning science now,” she said. “If we do that, I’m not quite sure how we are going to really keep our kids safe from our changing climate and environmental hazards in general.”

Now, to complete the work, Clougherty is left to look into private funders and foundations to make up the nearly $400,000 she lost. But she’s not optimistic . “It is not realistic to expect foundations or private funders to pick up the degree of infrastructure that’s being destroyed with the loss of federal funding right now,” she said.",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jane_Clougherty.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 09:59:55.326675

Pollution from the company threatened the South Yamhill River, a drinking water source for thousands.

The company also faced penalties from the Oregon Department of Justice and the EPA.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has fined a Yamhill County wood treating company $1,055,825 for numerous violations of environmental regulations for water quality, hazardous waste and spill response and cleanup.

DEQ issued the penalty to Stella-Jones, located in Sheridan, because wood preserving chemicals pose a risk to public health and the environment when not properly managed, the department said in a news release Sept. 8.

Those chemicals include pentachlorophenol (penta or PCP), a human carcinogen.

Most of the fine, or $877,225, is for costs and expenses the company avoided by not complying with environmental regulations.

In 2023, DEQ issued an order requiring corrective action, which the company complied with. It has since issued three pre-enforcement notices outlining additional violations.

The enforcement action cites 23 violations, including some addressing pollution to the South Yamhill River, which supplies drinking water to about 6,000 nearby residents.

DEQ also found that Stella-Jones sent hazardous waste to Riverbend Landfill in McMinnville between 2013 and 2021 and to Coffin Butte Landfill near Corvallis between 2021 and 2022. Neither landfill is permitted to accept hazardous waste.

The order requires Stella-Jones to address:

Hazardous waste violations, by reporting accurately, paying fees, and addressing the storage of hazardous waste in tanks.

Water quality violations, by taking several actions including increasing monitoring and reporting for certain chemicals, upgrading its stormwater treatment system, and improving its operations relating to preventing overflows of the stormwater treatment system.

“This enforcement not only addresses the company's past violations, but also requires the company to revise its operations plan, conduct additional monitoring, and take other preventative measures to ensure it stays in compliance going forward,” said Erin Saylor, interim manager of DEQ’s Office of Compliance and Enforcement.

In addition to the DEQ penalty, Stella-Jones and the Oregon Department of Justice agreed to a settlement in late August 2025 in a parallel state criminal case based on water quality violations. The company pled guilty to 10 misdemeanor counts of unlawful water pollution for violations of its state-issued water quality permit.

It will pay a $250,000 fine, $50,000 of which will be suspended if it avoids certain permit violations during the next three years.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also recently reached a settlement agreement with Stella-Jones that includes a $98,000 civil penalty.

Once Stella-Jones receives the enforcement action from DEQ it has 20 calendar days to file an appeal.

ALSO: Local governments push state agencies for 1,4-dioxane regulation

After issuing a notice in May, the Environmental Protection Agency is rescinding regulations previously established for GenX, PFHxS, and PFNA. The EPA issued a notice last week stating its intent — the first step in the rulemaking process, to be followed by a public review period and then formalizing the new rule.

The EPA plans on proposing the formal rule this fall, with the goal to finalize it by spring of 2026.

The move comes as Chemours, the chemical company accused of polluting the region’s drinking water, issued a revised permit application in August to increase production of PFAS compounds at their Fayetteville Works Plant.

The EPA wants to rescind the PFAS regulations because it believes the original rules were not scientifically and legally sound, making them vulnerable to being overturned by the courts.

In a statement to Port City Daily, the EPA Press Office said, while the agency cannot “pre-determine the outcome” of the rulemaking process for the PFAS compounds, “it is possible the result could be more stringent protections.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in May the EPA’s decision was a strategic move to create new, legally-defensible regulations to ensure any resulting drinking water rules follow the legal process laid out in the Safe Drinking Water Act. This process requires a 30- to 90-day public comment period, scientific review, and meeting specific criteria for health and risk reduction.

The PFAS regulations for GenX, PFHxS, and PFNA were established in 2024 during the Biden administration, setting maximum containment levels (MCLs) measured in parts per trillion (ppt) under the Safe Drinking Water Act. A part per trillion is a small measurement, equivalent to a single drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

In 2024, the EPA set legally enforceable MCLs for PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) at 4 parts per trillion (ppt) each, and PFNA (perfluorononanoic acid), PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid), and GenX (HFPO-DA) at 10 ppt each.

When the Biden administration put forth the regulations, it also included a Hazard Index of 1.0 for mixtures of two or more of PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS. The Hazard Index is a tool used by health and environmental agencies to understand the combined risk of multiple chemicals in a mixture. If the Hazard Index is less than 1.0, it means the combined levels of the chemicals are likely safe. If the Hazard Index is greater than 1.0, it suggests there might be a health concern.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, exposure to PFAS compounds have been linked to a variety of health problems, including an increased risk of certain cancers, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, and adverse reproductive and developmental effects.

Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, told Port City Daily the EPA’s withdrawal intent is not surprising but still concerning.

“This is just kind of a now very firm and clear direction that this EPA under Trump no longer wants to defend the drinking water standards that were established under the Biden EPA,” Donovan stated.

Additionally, Donovan worried abandoning the regulations could complicate arguments on a legal level for entities suing Chemours and other PFAS dischargers. Multiple parties, including local municipalities such as Brunswick and New Hanover counties, and the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, filed lawsuits in late 2017 against Chemours and its former parent company, DuPont.

Specifically, the lawsuits aim to recover the millions of dollars municipalities and water authorities have spent on new and upgraded filtration systems to remove PFAS from the drinking water supply. CFPUA installed a $43-million granular activated carbon system in 2022 to filter out “forever chemicals” like GenX from the Cape Fear River. Since installation, the system has been effective, reducing PFAS in raw water consistently under detectable levels.

Just last week CFPUA was recognized for its system by NCDEQ, receiving the Area Wide Optimization Award for the tenth year in a row.

The lawsuit CFPUA is part of against Chemours seeks future costs and punitive damages, with estimates potentially exceeding $174 million.

“Our water utilities have been stuck in a near eight-year court battle and Chemours has been fighting it every step of the way,” Donovan said. “They forced us ratepayers to have to pay for clean water.”

With federal regulations in place for the compounds, Donovan said it strengthens their case because it provides a clear, legally enforceable standard the polluters can be held accountable for violating. If the federal regulations are absent, their argument is weaker because they can no longer prove polluters violated a federal law, a key part of recovering sought damages.

Representatives with CFPUA could not comment on the pending litigation, but explained to Port City Daily any changes to these federal regulations will not impact their current operations. CFPUA sent a letter to EPA Administrator Zeldin in April urging the agency to defend and continue using the National Public Drinking Water Act regulations for PFAS.

While intending to withdraw regulations, the EPA does have plans for further action to “combat” PFAS. According to a press release from Zeldin in late April, the agency plans on “strengthening the science” on PFAS over the next year by advancing research and testing, as well as supporting investigations into violations to hold polluters accountable. The agency also launched an initiative in April called “PFAS OUT” to provide financial and technical assistance to public water systems in need of upgrades to address PFAS contamination.

In support of the EPA’s decision, Chemours communications leader Jess Loizeaux called the science behind the 2024 regulations “flawed,” stating the agency under the previous administration used “selective science.” Loizeaux cited a previous determination completed by EPA peer reviewer David Warren on the 2024 regulations, which indicated they were “excessive” and “extreme.” She noted Chemours “wholly supports” scientifically justified PFAS MCLs for drinking water.

Donovan said the science is already there.

“If you’re not trying to weaken the standards, why are you withdrawing them?” Donovan asked. “They are solid. They’re backed by science and the science hasn’t changed. If anything, the science has gotten better and clearer at just how dangerous these chemicals are.”

Katherine O’Brien, senior attorney with nonprofit environmental law firm Earthjustice, is representing Clean Cape Fear against the EPA. Earthjustice is intervening in the case to defend the EPA’s 2024 PFAS regulations, currently challenged by chemical companies like Chemours and trade groups like the American Chemistry Council.

In regards to the EPA intending to rescind regulations, O’Brien said the federal agency is effectively “turning back the clock.” She explained the Safe Drinking Water Act has what’s called an “anti-backsliding” provision, which would not allow the EPA to withdraw regulations. It states the agency cannot revoke or install regulations that would roll back protections or not maintain or provide for the greater protection of the health of the general public.

The EPA Press Office said the agency is committed to ensuring any rulemaking follows the Safe Drinking Water Act, including the anti-backsliding provision, reiterating rulemaking could result in stronger protections.

Another worry of Donovan and Clean Cape Fear is Chemours submitting a revised permit application in August for increased production of fluoropolymers, specifically PFA (perfluoroalkoxy alkanes), at its Fayetteville Works plant. PFA is a compound manufactured using GenX chemicals. Chemours previously submitted the application in 2022, but NCDEQ returned it in January of 2024 for being incomplete.

PFA is a type of “forever chemical” used in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips and other electronics. The company has stated the expansion is to support the production of specialized ionomer membranes used for hydrogen production. Chemours’ revised application is currently under review by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

According to Loizeaux, the updated application would not increase fluorinated emissions at the Fayetteville Works Plant and overall emissions could see a 15% decrease due to emission control technologies. However, the expansions would increase the Fayetteville plant’s vinyl ethers south production line capacity by 33% and vinyl ethers north production line by 50%. Vinyl ethers are a class of compounds used as a chemical building block for fluoropolymers (PFAS), used in products like Teflon.

While many PFAS concerns are related to the water, vinyl ether emissions are instead put into the air. The emissions can eventually fall onto the ground and make way into the water supply after rainfall.

In response to Chemours’ revised permit application, Donovan and Clean Cape Fear started a petition pressuring the state to hold the chemical company accountable for its actions.

“I think people need to be concerned, and I think they need to push back and dig deep and recognize that this fight is not over,” Donovan stated. “These chemical companies thrive on the fact that they think communities will burn out and get tired, and we deserve better, and we’re stronger than that.”

US President Donald Trump has established a knack for killing off manufacturing jobs here in the US, and his latest misadventure isn’t helping. On September 4, Trump ordered up a massive immigration raid on a construction site in Georgia, where hundreds of workers are, or were, building a new EV battery factory under the Hyundai umbrella. The new factory is supposed to create more than 8,000 new jobs in Georgia once operational. It will most likely be operational, eventually. In the meantime, though, work has halted.

A New EV Battery Factory In Georgia: How It Started …

The new EV battery factory is part of Hyundai Motor Group’s sprawling “Metaplant” manufacturing complex, located in the unincorporated community of Ellabell, in Bryan County near Savannah. The complex broke ground three years ago with an initial investment by Hyundai of $5.54 billion, making it the single biggest economic development project in state history. “Non-affiliated Hyundai Motor Group suppliers will invest approximately another $1 billion in the project, delivering approximately 8,100 new jobs to Georgia’s coastal region,” noted the Georgia Department of Economic Development in 2022.

Metaplant is also a key showpiece for Republican Governor Brian P. Kemp and his job-creating skills as he contemplates his next move in politics.

In 2023, Kemp celebrated the addition of another $2 billion investment in Metaplant through a joint EV battery venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution. “In a single year, we broke ground on the largest project in state history, landed multiple suppliers across the state for Hyundai’s Metaplant, and welcomed LGES to Bryan County,” he said.

“These types of major investments ultimately go to hardworking Georgians in the form of paychecks, improved schools and infrastructure, and more. Thank you to Hyundai Motor Group and LGES for again recognizing that the No. 1 state for business is a good investment,” Kemp added for good measure.

… How It’s Going

Well, that was then. The September 4 raid on the construction site may not bring Hyundai’s plans for the new EV battery factory to a screeching halt altogether, but it will certainly throw off the timeline and delay the fruition of new paychecks for hardworking Georgians.

The raid is also a major, potentially career-killing embarrassment for Kemp. The governor will be term-limited out of office after the 2026 elections. Just a few months ago he publicly declined an opportunity to make a run for the US Senate, leaving his next move up in the air.

With the Senate out of play, the door is open for Kemp to throw his hat into the ring for the next presidential election cycle in 2028. Or, maybe not. He certainly did not have much to say about the matter over the weekend.

The Savannah Business Journal asked the govenor’s office for a statement on September 5. On September 6, they reported that the following statement was relayed through a spokesperson:

“In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws. All companies operating within the State must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation.

“The Department of Public Safety (State of Georgia) coordinated with ICE to provide all necessary support for this operation, the latest in a long line of cooperation and partnership between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement.”

Send In The National Guard!

The Korean press, on the other hand, had plenty to say. Most of the 475 workers reportedly detained at the EV battery factory construction site were citizens of Korea. According to news reports, most if not all were in the US legally, and/or were in the process of establishing their legal status.

The Chosun Daily (the English edition of the longstanding Korean news organization of record, Chosun Ilbo) was among those excoriating the “U.S.’s structural hypocrisy,” for “demanding massive investments from South Korean companies while remaining passive on follow-up support, such as work visa issuance.”

Chosun Daily was also among those noting that on September 3, just one day before the raid, Kemp went on record praising the Korean firm JS Link America for investing $223 million in a new factory in Columbus, Georgia, bringing more than 520 additional new jobs to the state.

“We are excited for the continued growth of manufacturing in west Georgia,” Kemp said. His office further noted that the jobs created by JS Link include engineering, production, construction, administrative, and management positions, with the factory expected to commence operations before the end of 2027.

No word yet on whether or not the governor’s office will be excited to help JS Link expedite visas for Korean workers needed to oversee training, contracts, and other operations so the project can get underway promptly.

He was, however, excited to announce that 300 members of the Georgia National Guard will march on Washington, DC, to pick up trash and help President Trump terrorize local residents. “Georgia is proud to stand with the Trump administration in its mission to ensure the security and beauty of our nation’s capital,” Kemp stated on September 5.

“We share a commitment to upholding public safety and are grateful to these brave Guardsmen and women, for the families that support them, and for their dedication to service above self,” he added.

Doing the math, that makes Georgia the fifth Republican-controlled, Confederate state to participate in the invasion of Washington, a feat they were unable to pull off back in the 1860s. The other four former members of the Confederacy are Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina. Two other states under Republican control, Ohio and West Virginia, have also sent troops.

So, What Will Happen To Hyundai’s New EV Battery Factory?

Trump and the Republican Party have already snuffed out a good deal of the enthusiasm they garnered from Latino voters during last year’s elections, and now it appears that Asian Americans will be next to turn their backs on the formerly business-friendly party.

Hyundai’s footprint in the US goes well beyond the new EV battery factory, employing thousands of US workers in other parts of the auto industry as well as steel, robotics, energy, and other related concerns.

Perhaps sensing something was afoot, on September 1, the company announced the addition of another $5 billion in new investments into its US operations overall during the next three years, bringing the total amount of its three-year plan to $26 billion since Trump took office.

And this is the thanks they get!

Nevertheless, so far, Hyundai seems willing to take its lumps, appease the Trump administration, and throw its contractors and suppliers under the bus. In an official statement of about 270 words, the company asserted that to its knowledge none of the detained workers are under its direct employ.

“Hyundai has zero tolerance for those who don’t follow the law,” Hyundai stated. “As we continue to invest in American manufacturing and create thousands of jobs, we will do so in full accordance with U.S. law and in a manner that reflects our values of treating all people with dignity and respect.”

But in the aforementioned memo, the Trump administration told federal agencies to use the “good cause” exemption to skip that process altogether and issue final rules without first accepting comments from the public.
Roughly 45 percent of these were final rules issued without notice, where comments are usually not accepted.
Our analysis also found that federal agencies are often using two types of final rules—“direct final” and “interim final”—instead of notice and comment.
The US public needs fair access While federal agencies may not currently be empowered or equipped to meaningfully engage the public in decisionmaking, state and local governments can still do so.","Last month, the federal government eliminated an online tool that allows advocacy groups like UCS, as well as businesses and other organizations, to collect and submit public comments on rules and other actions by federal agencies. Without this tool, it is harder for Americans to have their voices heard in policymaking. It is just one of many ways that the Trump administration is shutting out the US public from sharing their experiences, expertise, and evidence to shape public policies.

According to a new UCS analysis, Access Denied: How the Trump Administration Is Eliminating Public Input, under President Trump’s leadership, federal science agencies are routinely and inappropriately bypassing notice and comment when updating or removing regulations. This means that regulations that may impact our air, water, climate, food, health care, transit, and communities are being changed, and often eliminated, without input from the public. This violates one of the most basic, legally enshrined rights that the US people have in our democracy – to have our voices heard in government decisionmaking.

President Trump directs federal agencies to ignore the public

Just over six months into his second term, President Trump has issued a flurry of deregulatory executive orders, including one that directed federal agencies to eliminate regulations deemed “unlawful” or “unnecessary.” The White House later issued a memo that told federal agencies to use a loophole called the “good cause” exemption—which has historically been allowed in very few instances, like emergencies—to roll back rules “without notice and comment.”

Usually, when a government agency issues a new a regulation, or proposes to eliminate a regulation, the agency is required by law to notify the public about the proposal, allow people and organizations to submit comments on those proposals, and respond to the substance of those comments when issuing a final rule (this is often referred to as “notice and comment”). But in the aforementioned memo, the Trump administration told federal agencies to use the “good cause” exemption to skip that process altogether and issue final rules without first accepting comments from the public.

Uninvited and ignored

Our analysis looked at rules issued between January 20 and July 31, 2025 by six key science agencies: the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), the Interior (DOI), and Transportation (DOT), as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We found that notice and comment was bypassed in nearly 31 percent (182 out of 591) of final rules issued by these agencies, with DOT doing so most often. Roughly 45 percent of these were final rules issued without notice, where comments are usually not accepted.

Our analysis also found that federal agencies are often using two types of final rules—“direct final” and “interim final”—instead of notice and comment. In direct final rules, the agency issues a final rule without notice, but retroactively accepts comments on it for a specified period. If the agency receives at least one adverse comment, the agency is supposed to withdraw the rule; otherwise the rule takes effect at a future date. In interim final rules, the agency issues a final rule that is effective immediately but accepts comments for a specific period and may choose to amend the rule based on those comments. However, our analysis found that, so far, federal agencies have largely not withdrawn or changed direct or interim final rules as a result of comments received, though some are still under review.

We also found that in nearly two-thirds of these actions, federal agencies cited the “good cause” exemption for bypassing notice and comment. And in roughly a quarter of the actions, agencies gave no explanation at all. DOE, HHS, and USDA most often failed to provide a reason for bypassing notice and comment.

A threat to our democracy

Our research shows that these six agencies are abusing the “good cause” exemption (or in some cases, providing no explanation at all) to change or eliminate regulations without letting the public know or providing us with an opportunity to weigh in. (Even in those instances in which agencies did allow for public comment, these regulations were largely implemented without any acknowledgment of the comments or adjustments in response.)

In some cases, agencies state that they are eliminating outdated or obsolete regulations, but this doesn’t matter. Whether it’s creating a new rule or repealing an existing one, we, the US public, have a legally enshrined right to be given notice about a federal agency’s actions, to be given an opportunity to weigh in, and to receive a response from the agency on substantive comments.

Cutting out the public from decisionmaking is not democratic: it is authoritarian. And ensuring the US public has the right to notice and comment is not a high bar: it is the bare minimum. Agencies can also provide town halls, accept oral comments, and organize alternate forums to gather input, but this is not happening either. It is just one of many ways that the Trump administration is dismantling our democratic safeguards in favor of corporations and the ultra-wealthy that stand to benefit from deregulation. Federal science advisory committees are being dismantled, scientists and agency staff who review comments and update our regulations have been fired en masse, science-based information removed from government websites, and technical assistance funds and grants to communities blocked. These actions show that the administration’s campaign rhetoric about transparency and accountability are insultingly empty promises, masking a blatant grab for power.

The US public needs fair access

While federal agencies may not currently be empowered or equipped to meaningfully engage the public in decisionmaking, state and local governments can still do so.

As demand for energy rises — driven by population growth, industrialisation, and the electrification of transport — nations are looking for solutions that are both reliable today and adaptable for tomorrow’s low-carbon future.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) sits at the heart of that equation. It is the foundational brick upon which opportunity, resilience, and prosperity can be built — delivering cleaner-burning energy to regions that need it most, while supporting the transition to more sustainable systems.

At Argent LNG, we believe that our work at Port Fourchon, Louisiana will play a pivotal role in advancing that vision — not only for the United States, but for our allies and partners around the world.

The rising demand and the rising stakes

Global LNG demand is projected to grow steadily through 2050, with the most pronounced increases in Asia, Europe, and parts of the Middle East and Latin America. This surge is driven by several converging factors:

Coal-to-gas switching in power generation to lower emissions. Energy diversification to reduce dependence on single-source suppliers. Rapid industrial growth in emerging economies. Backup reliability for intermittent renewables like wind and solar.

Yet this growth comes with challenges. Energy systems must be resilient to geopolitical disruptions, extreme weather, and price volatility — all of which have intensified in recent years. The war in Ukraine underscored how quickly a major supply disruption can cascade into global price spikes, industry shutdowns, and social instability.

The message is clear: securing diverse, dependable energy supply lines is no longer optional — it is an economic and strategic imperative.

Why Port Fourchon and Argent LNG matter

Port Fourchon is already a critical nerve centre for America’s offshore energy production. Located on Louisiana’s southernmost tip along the Gulf of America, it provides unparalleled access to the U.S. natural gas pipeline network and the shortest shipping routes to the Atlantic and European markets.

Argent LNG’s 25 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) export terminal, set to begin deliveries by 2030, will leverage this strategic location to deliver LNG more efficiently and reliably than many existing Gulf Coast facilities. This means:

Shorter voyages to European, Mediterranean, and North African ports, reducing both shipping costs and emissions. Faster response times to supply crises or seasonal surges in demand. Improved price stability by removing transport bottlenecks and enabling closer points of supply of LNG.

By positioning supply closer to key markets, Argent LNG strengthens not just physical energy security, but also the economic predictability that industries and governments rely upon to plan for the future.

LNG as the foundation for opportunity

Too often, the conversation around LNG focuses solely on molecules and markets. But energy is also about people. Each cargo of LNG represents:

Affordable electricity for homes and businesses.

Fuel for industrial expansion in regions striving to create jobs and raise living standards.

Economic development for coastal and port communities that support the global trade system.

In many parts of the world, reliable LNG supply unlocks manufacturing growth, enables modern hospitals and schools, and supports cleaner air by replacing coal. The positive ripple effect reaches across supply chains, from shipbuilders to steelworkers, from engineers to port operators.

For Louisiana, Argent LNG’s “Louisiana First” procurement policy — prioritising local contractors, suppliers, and workforce — ensures that the economic benefits begin at home. This approach de-risks project execution while creating thousands of high-quality jobs across fabrication, engineering, logistics, and services.

Sustainability as a Strategic Goal

Energy security and sustainability are not opposing forces — they are complementary. LNG, with roughly 50% lower CO₂ emissions than coal when used for power generation, is a critical tool for countries seeking to meet climate targets without sacrificing reliability.

Argent LNG is committed to integrating low-emission design principles and leveraging modular liquefaction technology to enhance efficiency. The project is being engineered for flexibility — so it can adapt to advances in emissions reduction, renewable integration, and carbon management technologies over time.

By helping nations switch from higher-emission fuels today, while preparing for a more decarbonised tomorrow, Argent LNG offers a bridge to a balanced and sustainable energy mix.

A Global Partnership Approach

The challenges of the 21st-century energy system cannot be met by individual nations acting in isolation. They require deep partnerships built on shared values — transparency, reliability, and mutual economic benefit.

By providing a dependable American LNG supply to allies, Argent LNG strengthens not only energy security, but also the diplomatic and economic ties that underpin global stability. In an era of increasing geopolitical tension, this role as a trusted energy partner is strategically invaluable.

Conclusion: Building for Generations

At its core, Argent LNG’s mission is simple: deliver reliable, cleaner energy to where it’s needed most, while creating lasting benefits for the communities we serve. From the dockworkers of Port Fourchon to the households in Europe or Asia turning on the lights, the value of this work is measured not only in cubic meters of gas, but in the opportunity, resilience, and stability it brings. As the world looks toward a sustainable energy future, LNG will remain a foundational component — and Argent LNG, with its strategic location and commitment to community, is ready to help build that future.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/0nvle3mw/adobe-express-file-1.png?center=0.22414875200871767,0.49310350495442584&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134012762618400000",N,,2025-09-09 09:03:22.836708

And so, we need to rule things in.” The clean energy transition While Chevron specialises in oil and gas, it also advocates for the importance of renewable and clean energy too.
Chevron is expanding its global gas business to meet this demand.
“If you think of the global energy system, it’s a key component,” says Brian Essner, Chevron’s General Manager of LNG Origination & Commercial.","While the push for renewables and clean energy continues at pace, Chevron still believes the need for oil and gas is equally as important.

The energy firm's Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth recently emphasised its dual mandate in a series of interviews, including on CNBC’s Power Lunch with Brian Sullivan, where he said: “We have to meet the demands of the economy today, even as we invest in technologies for tomorrow.”

This simple principle underpins Chevron’s strategy to provide reliable, affordable energy while also lowering the carbon intensity of its portfolio and building out new lower carbon solutions.

Meeting energy needs today while investing for tomorrow

Global energy demand continues to rise due to population growth, industrialisation and the increasing needs of digital infrastructure.

In 2025, Chevron expects to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin in the US, as well as bring on additional projects in the US Gulf of Mexico and achieve first oil at the Future Growth Project in Tengiz, in Kazakhstan.

Mike also told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan: “We don’t control demand, we supply demand. And so, we will grow our oil and gas business over the next five years.”

While continuing this growth, Chevron is also accelerating investment in reducing operational emissions and scaling new energy technologies.

“We need to reduce the emissions from traditional energy, which we’re doing by reducing our carbon intensity of oil and gas that we produce today,” said Mike.

“At the same time, we’re investing in new technologies to grow new sources of supply as demand for all forms of energy continues to grow.”

Why this balance matters

The world is already witnessing record energy demand, with last year’s oil demand at an all-time high and this year's demand set to be even higher, according to Chevron.

Oil and gas are projected to remain a substantial part of the world’s energy mix to 2050 across a wide range of future scenarios published by the IEA, OPEC, EIA and others.

Sustaining energy security while lowering emissions is therefore essential.

Chevron is advancing multiple pathways to lower carbon energy, including:

Methane reductions: working toward reaching its upstream methane-intensity target by 2028, after reducing the methane intensity of its oil and gas operations by more than 50% since 2016.

Renewable fuels: now the second-largest producer of renewable fuels in the U.S.

Hydrogen and storage: investing in a hydrogen project that enables utility- and industrial-scale storage of renewable energy.

Mike emphasised that durable climate progress requires pragmatic policy that “rules in” more solutions, not fewer.

“There are three things that really matter when you talk about energy: affordability, reliability and the environment,” he said during an interview with Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global.

“If you have an energy policy that focuses on only one of those, you can create unintended consequences and have something that is not sustainable.”

Just as important are scalability and speed. “If we can’t scale them up, they can’t make a difference,” he said in the interview.

“And then if you get solutions that work on scale, we need to do it with some speed and that’s where capital markets come in and you harness private investment.

“If you start to rule parts of the solution out, you’re never going to solve the problem. And so, we need to rule things in.”

The clean energy transition

While Chevron specialises in oil and gas, it also advocates for the importance of renewable and clean energy too.

“We have to be able to do both,” said Mike, speaking at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Summit.

“One of the big challenges for an energy company like ours is we’ve got a big business today that meets the needs of the world, and we’ve got customers and economies around the world that depend on what we do to keep the lights on and the trains going.”

Natural gas is central to enabling an affordable, reliable and lower carbon system. It powers homes and industry, supports manufacturing, fertiliser production and hydrogen generation, and is widely used to generate electricity.

With US electricity consumption projected to hit record highs in 2025–2026 and global electricity demand rising through 2026, gas-fired power provides dispatchable capacity that complements variable renewables and helps integrate more clean energy.

Chevron is expanding its global gas business to meet this demand.

Crux estimates that solar PV accounted for more than US$7 billion in tax credits generated in H1 2025, covering credit generation years 2024-2026.
Most of the deals where for 2025 solar tax credits with US$4.7 billion, while 2024 tax credits accounted for US$2 billion and forward commitments for 2026 nearly half a billion dollars.
“As tax credit policies shift, project developers and investors need clarity, optionality, and execution.
Crux now offers access to tax and preferred equity, debt, and transferable tax credits, all in one place,” said Johnson.","Despite many policy changes this year – led by the passing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act – interest in clean energy financing continued to grow in the first half of 2025.

One key takeaway from the report, The State of Clean Energy Finance: 2025 Mid-Year Market Intelligence Report, is that the total transferable tax credit market grew more than twofold between H1 2024 and H1 2025, to over US$20 billion.

Solar PV accounted for the highest share across all technologies and advanced manufacturing in H1 2025, with 34.4%. Crux estimates that solar PV accounted for more than US$7 billion in tax credits generated in H1 2025, covering credit generation years 2024-2026. Most of the deals where for 2025 solar tax credits with US$4.7 billion, while 2024 tax credits accounted for US$2 billion and forward commitments for 2026 nearly half a billion dollars.

The majority of solar PV deals were for investment tax credits (ITCs), with more than 95%. Even though solar production tax credits (PTCs) continue to represent a small share of the tax credit market, Crux said these are “beginning to transact with greater frequency,” especially in large utility-scale solar projects.

“Sponsors typically opt for PTCs when high-output projects can earn more value through ongoing production credits than a one-time ITC. Additionally, a growing number of investors are now set up to underwrite PTC-based solar, making it easier to access that path of financing than a few years ago,” Crux told PV Tech.

In terms of sectors, utility-scale accounted for the majority of the solar tax credits in H1 2025 with 75.9%, followed by residential solar with 16.3%, while community solar and commercial & industrial (C&I) accounted for 7.8% of all solar tax credits sold.

However, the share of solar PV tax credits in H1 2025 compared with the same period in 2024 dropped, while solar-plus-storage grew quickly in 2025 to 20%.

Hybrid solar-plus-storage and standalone energy storage ITCs accounted for 26% of tax credits sold in H1 2025, when they only made up 9% of the market in H1 2024.

“Massive investments in energy infrastructure are being realised at the very moment the US needs more electricity and manufacturing capacity,” said Alfred Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Crux.

“But the new policy environment is challenging, especially for developers of wind and solar. Transferability helped knit together what were once fragmented financing submarkets into a larger, more dynamic, more integrated market; this integration has opened new opportunities and different strategies across the capital stack.”

Furthermore, the company recently launched its new tax and preferred equity offering. Through the new offering, Crux aims to help developers raise capital, supports investors deploying tax and preferred equity, and connects buyers with quality, vetted tax credit opportunities.

As Tesla’s stranglehold over the U.S. EV market may be weakening, so too is its hold on the international market.","Preliminary data from Cox Automotive for August, first shared with Reuters, shows that the month was the best for EVs in U.S. history, with just over 146,000 units sold, comprising almost 10% of total car sales that month. At the same time, Tesla’s share of the EV market hit its lowest recorded level, down to a (still sizable) 38%.

Cox’s data puts Tesla sales at 55,000 for the month, which is up a little more than 3% from July but down over 6% from a year prior, while the company’s total market share fell from just over 40% in July and 45% in the first half of the year. In 2020, by contrast, Tesla’s share of U.S. EV sales was about 80%. Overall, Cox estimated that Tesla sales in the U.S. are down about 9% so far this year.

“The U.S. EV market is in a far more dynamic place than a few years ago,” Corey Cantor, the research director at the Zero Emission Transportation Association, told me in an email. “Most automakers now offer electric vehicle models in multiple segments. There are multiple electric vehicles available below the average price point of a new car at $48,000.”

Entering this new phase means that the EV market is getting less Tesla-centric, almost by definition. Morgan Stanley reported that electric vehicle sales were up 23% in August from a year ago, while overall car sales were up 7.5% — although even amidst this industry-wide growth, Tesla sales fell more than 3% year over year, while electric vehicle sales were up 42%.

Much of that EV market growth comes down to timing. “Early indications are that EV sales are in fact surging over the past two months, following the changes that will phase the credit out at the end of this month. We’ve seen record sales for EV models last month, such as the Honda Prologue,” Cantor said. This likely means some portion of these sales are being “pulled forward” from buyers trying to beat the deadline and these sales numbers will not persist through the rest of the year.

As Tesla’s stranglehold over the U.S. EV market may be weakening, so too is its hold on the international market. Thanks to CEO Elon Musk’s association with right wing politics in the U.S. and abroad, and to fierce competition from Chinese EV leader BYD, Tesla’s sales have fallen dramatically in Europe. Globally, BYD overtook Tesla in sales last year.

None of that seems to matter much to Tesla’s leadership, or to its shareholders. On Friday, the company’s board of directors put forward a new compensation plan for Musk that would boost his ownership of the company to around 25% and put him in line for a $1 trillion payday if he meets growth and performance targets over the next decade.

A Delaware court last year threw out an earlier Musk pay package, arguing that Musk was too close to the board of directors for them to objectively determine his pay in the interest of all the company’s shareholders. (He subsequently relocated Tesla’s official headquarters to Austin, Texas, explicitly to avoid Delaware jurisdiction.) Musk has said that he wants to own about 25% of the company, a significant upgrade from the roughly 15% he owns currently.

Tesla’s board said in a recent regulatory disclosure that Musk had “reiterated that, if he were to remain at Tesla, it was a critical consideration that he have at least a 25% voting interest in Tesla,” and that “Mr. Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.”

The board’s disclosure also confirmed that Musk sees the future of Tesla as going far beyond selling cars to people. The filing said that “through its discussions with Mr. Musk,” the special committee in charge of coming up with his compensation had “identified four core product lines that would drive Tesla’s future transformation”: Tesla’s vehicle fleet, automation (i.e. Full Self-Driving) software, its robotaxi product, and humanoid robots. Tesla’s robotaxi service is available on a select basis in Austin, with no date yet indicated for a wider rollout, while its humanoid robots — which Musk has said will one day make up 80% of the company’s value — are due to reach “scale production” next year, Musk said on a recent earnings call.

Tesla stock actually rose on the news of the proposed compensation package, likely because Tesla shareholders viewed it as a way to retain Musk and keep his attention on the company.

Longtime Tesla bull Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in note to investors that the compensation deal now means that Musk “has an incentive to focus on Tesla more than ever.” Jonas also, like many Tesla bulls, sees its business of selling cars to people as just a small portion of its overall value — in his case, $76 a share, compared to his $410 a share price target or the roughly $346 a share price the stock was trading at on Monday afternoon.

Still, the company today is largely a pretty normal car company, at least according to its income statement. In the second quarter of its current fiscal year, some $16.6 billion of Tesla’s $22.5 billion in revenue came from cars, with $2.8 billion coming from its energy business and $3 billion coming from “services and other revenues.”

Declining market share in its biggest product line isn’t completely meaningless, even if many Tesla shareholders see a glorious future for the company beyond the automobile trade.

Looking ahead, Cantor said to expect the EV market to get even more diverse.

“Moving forward, we will continue to see automakers innovate in the EV space. Timelines may change and models will vary by automaker, but high-profile launches expected over the next year include the Rivian R2, a new version of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, as well as more affordable models by Lucid and Kia,” Cantor said in his email.

“While the 30D [consumer electric vehicle tax] credit’s phase out will have a real impact on sales the next quarter or two here in the U.S.,” he added, “the long-term trend of excitement and innovation continues to be in the launch of new electric vehicles.”

“You are already poorer because of this idiocy, you just don’t know it yet,” Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer wrote in a post on X, in response to a video of ICE agents chaining workers at the wrists and ankles. “This will crush American manufacturing know-how.”

2. Four big-state governors call on nation’s biggest grid to streamline connections

Political pressure is mounting on the nation’s largest grid operator to make hooking up new power sources easier amid surging demand. In remarks made as part of a public process for overhauling the grid’s rules, the governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Illinois called on the PJM Interconnection to streamline the process to connect new resources to the grid, citing ERCOT, the independent power system in Texas, as an example of a successful model. “We must open all feasible pathways to bring additional electrons to our grid,” the governors said in a public comment highlighted on X by energy researcher Tyler Norris.

The push comes as PJM is fending off criticism from big tech companies and data centers over a proposal that would allow the grid to encourage big power users to pare back consumption when demand is particularly high. The backlash isn’t surprising to Abraham Silverman, a former lawyer for the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and an assistant research scholar at Johns Hopkins. As he explained to Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin: “The existing rules are financially very favorable to the data centers.” The focus on adding new generation rather than curtailing new load is consistent with that more traditional approach.

3. Trump is taking credit for Biden’s infrastructure law

Trump once called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act former President Joe Biden signed in 2021, better known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, “a loser for the U.S.A.” that “patriots will never forget.” Now he’s taking credit for the projects it’s funding. In recent months, signs have gone up around the U.S. bearing the president’s name on bridge projects in Connecticut and Maryland, rail-yard improvements in Seattle, Boston, and Philadelphia, and the replacement tunnel on an Amtrak route between Baltimore and Washington, according to The New York Times. “PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP” a sign by the road in southern Connecticut reads. “REBUILDING AMERICA’S INFRASTRUCTURE.”

Republicans had previously balked at similar signs bearing Biden’s name. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote, “Senator Ted Cruz of Texas lodged a grievance with the Office of Special Counsel alleging Biden had violated the Hatch Act by using taxpayer dollars to pay for ‘nothing more than campaign yard signs.’” Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa (who recently announced her intention not to seek reelection after becoming a target of Trump supporters) gave the signs one of her monthly “squeal awards” last year, demanding to know how much they cost.

4. Orsted’s shareholders approve $9.4 billion financing plan

Orsted’s shareholders on Friday backed the company’s plans to shore up its finances by raising $9.4 billion on the stock market to fend off attacks from the Trump administration. The approval came even as the world’s largest offshore wind developer cut its profit guidance for the year as lower-than-expected wind speeds dinged the company’s planned power output for the year. At an investor meeting in Copenhagen that the Financial Times described as “extraordinary,” at least 98.5% of shareholders voted in favor of authorizing the issuance of new shares.

5. The nation’s deepest carbon storage well successfully completed

The Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub completed drilling for the nation’s deepest carbon storage well in Wyoming. The project, a collaboration between the University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources and the company Frontier Infrastructure holdings, reached a vertical depth of 18,437 feet. Preliminary data from the well “is highly encouraging,” according to the nonprofit newsroom Oil City News. “This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries,” said Robby Rockey, president and co-CEO of Frontier.

Still, as I reported in this newsletter last week, the new research from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and Imperial College London found “a prudent global limit” of around 1.46 trillion tons of CO2 that can be safely stored in geologic formations. That’s “almost 10 times smaller than estimates proposed by industry that have not considered risks to people and the environment.”

THE KICKER

A long-term study spanning more than 50 years found that beavers that have returned to the Evo region in southern Finland increased habitat biodiversity as a result of how they engineer the ecosystem with dams. “While the positive effects of the changes brought about by beavers in the boreal region are significant, their long-term effects on biodiversity dynamics remain partly unknown. This is why long time series are needed to understand the far-reaching ecological effects of these changes,” Petri Nummi, a senior lecturer at the University of Helsinki and an author of the paper, said in a press release.

The idea may be counterintuitive, given the prevailing narrative about voracious appetite for electricity. EVs do require a lot of energy. Electricity demand for EVs in the U.S. jumped 50% from 2023 to 2024 alone as more Americans bought electric, and the research group Ev.energy says demand could triple by 2030. Studies suggest that replacing every internal combustion vehicle in the country with an EV would eat up as much as 29% of American electricity.

Meanwhile, the grid is struggling to keep up — it is, after all, much more difficult to add more megawatts to the capacity of our power system than it is to put a few more EVs on the road. The obvious inference would then seem to be that a battery-powered car fleet could cause an energy crunch and spike in prices.

A new report from Ev.energy, however, argues that if we got smarter about how and when we charge our cars, their presence could actually cut costs for the average American by 10%. The gains could be even better if EVs reach their true potential as a way to give the grid a unique kind of flexibility and resilience.

Compare an electric car to a data center, the other application painted as a ticking time bomb for electricity prices. Worries about the energy-gobbling habits of AI-powering servers are well-founded, given their 24/7 appetite. An EV, however, needs to charge only once in a while. In fact, most people don’t need to charge every day, given the range of modern EVs and the driving habits of the typical American.

As we've covered before, it’s when you charge that matters. Optimizing EV charging can be a helpful way to ease pressure on the power grid and align EV charging with the availability of clean energy.

Here in California, which has far and away the most EVs in America, TV commercials remind us to use less energy between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m., when the state is dealing with rising residential energy use just as solar power is tapering off for the day. It would cause a grid crisis if every EV owner charged as soon as they got home from work. Having EV owners charge their cars overnight, a period of low demand, helps ease the pressure. So does charging during midday, when California sometimes has more solar energy than it knows what to do with.

When EVs charge in this mindful manner, using energy during times of day when it’s cheap for utilities to provide it, data suggests they can effectively push down electricity prices for everyone. Says one recent report from Synapse Energy: “In California, EVs have increased utility revenues more than they have increased utility costs, leading to downward pressure on electric rates for EV-owners and non-EV owners alike.” As the NRDC points out, California has revenue decoupling in place for its utilities, so “any additional revenue in excess of what was anticipated is returned to all utility customers — not just EV drivers — in the form of lower rates.”

Those rosy figures depend upon drivers following this model and charging during off-peak hours, of course. But with time-of-use rates giving them the financial motivation to charge overnight rather than in the early evening, it’s not an outrageous presumption.

And there’s something else that differentiates EVs from other applications that consume lots of electricity: Thanks to their ability to store a large number of kilowatt-hours over a lengthy period of time, electric vehicles can give back. EVs can be a cornerstone of the virtual power plant model because the cars — those equipped with bidirectional charging capabilities, at least — could feed the energy in their batteries back onto the grid to prevent blackouts, for example. In Australia, the Electric Vehicle Council recently crunched the numbers to argue in favor of incentivizing residents to install vehicle-to-grid infrastructure. Their math indicates Australia would reap more than the government invests because these connected EV would cut everyone’s electricity price.

It’s getting more expensive for the individual to own an EV — the federal tax credit for buying one disappears at month’s end, and punitive yearly fees for EV ownership are coming. Yet it seems that driving electric might be doing your neighbors a favor, and not just by clearing the air.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTU3NDYyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzgzNjg4Mn0.kfpkrhdeF_wB4BV3NjvUIiaVM3uIauNlboiatI7U04w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-09 09:01:37.896661

While he did not openly criticise the EU's deadline to halt sales of new combustion engine cars in a decade, Merz said he wanted to see ""more flexibilty"" in European regulation.

""We are of course committed to the transition to e-mobility,"" the conservative leader, who took office in May, told the show.

But he added that ""we need smart, reliable and flexible European regulation -- it is more necessary than ever"".

""We want to achieve climate protection as cost-effectively as possible through technological openness. Unilateral political commitments to specific technologies are fundamentally the wrong economic policy approach.""

Markus Soeder, the leader of Bavaria state where the motor show is taking place and a political ally of Merz, was more blunt.

""This combustion engine ban is wrong,"" he told the show.

""We need other options because, to be perfectly honest, combustion engines still have a future. Electric mobility will prevail in the long term but we need significantly more time to organise the whole thing in Europe.""

- 'Supportive' speeches -

Jan Vlasak, who works in software for a German carmaker, praised the speeches as ""really supportive of the automotive industry"".

The 35-year-old agreed the 2035 ban should be reviewed, calling for it to be pushed back by five to 10 years.

A stuttering shift to EVs is one of the major challenges facing Europe's auto sector. Manufacturers have invested huge sums in the transition, but sales have grown far more slowly than anticipated.

On top of that, the industry has faced rising production costs at home along with fierce competition in China from BYD and other EV makers that has eroded sales for foreign manufacturers in the world's biggest auto market.

In Germany, the auto sector has already shed more than 50,000 jobs over the past year, according to EY.

Volkswagen is planning 35,000 layoffs between now and 2030 and taking the unprecedented step of halting production at two of its sites in Germany.

Plans for redundancies have been coming thick and fast at Porsche, Audi, and at hundreds of German auto sector suppliers.

Merz is planning to host meetings with key auto sector players soon to chart a way forward.

""Our goal is for Germany to remain one of the world's leading places for automotive and manufacturing in the future -- we want to shape the transformation of the automotive industry,"" he said.

- Chinese competition -

On the other side of the argument, more than 150 businesses in the EV sector wrote an open letter to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Monday urging her to ""not row back"" on the 2035 target.

When the IAA winds down on Friday, carmakers are expected to have a meeting with von der Leyen in Brussels to discuss how to save the sector.

Underlining the competition the German car sector faces, more Chinese carmakers are expected at the fair than ever before.

Fourteen Chinese carmakers -- as opposed to just 10 European ones -- are displaying new models.

Around 100 of the 700 firms taking part overall in the IAA will be from China, up 40 percent from the last show in 2023.

Chinese carmakers there range from BYD, whose sales in Europe rose dramatically in the first half of this year, to GAC, which is taking its first steps in the European market.

BYD on Monday presented its compact Dolphin Surf model, which has been on sale in Europe since May for around 20,000 euros ($23,500).

From later this year it will be produced in a new facility in Hungary, with the company hoping to avoid EU tariffs on Chinese imports.

Volkswagen is trying to fight back with its own models at the more affordable end of the market.

As the climate warms and glaciers and ice sheets melt, sea levels are rising, and many coastal communities are flooding.

Mitchell: “That flooding is going to get worse in the future. How fast it’s going to get worse depends a lot on where you are.”

Molly Mitchell of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science explains that seas rise at different rates along the coast because of variations in factors like ocean currents, temperature, and whether land locally is rising or sinking.

In San Francisco, for example, the sea is rising about two millimeters per year. But in Rockport, Texas, it’s rising about three times more quickly.

The advantages of renewable energy have been demonstrated and have earned significant momentum over the past decade.
“On a stand-alone basis, renewable energy sources are intermittent and can’t serve loads that require 24/7 power,” Rappaport says.
“In reality, these issues are addressed with a combination of energy storage, active energy management solutions and diversity in energy supply.","Misinformation at times has blocked building owners from specifying and deploying renewable energy technologies in institutional and commercial facilities.

Renewable energy technologies have become more popular in recent years as cleaner and more sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Every technology has advantages and disadvantages, and alternative technologies must provide overwhelming advantages over current technologies.

Renewable energy is no different. The advantages of renewable energy have been demonstrated and have earned significant momentum over the past decade. These include upside in terms of technical improvements, economics and finance, resource availability, and human health.

But as with any emerging technology, renewable energy has been the subject of myths and misconceptions among building owners and facility executives that at times have blocked specification and installation in institutional and commercial facilities.

Understanding options

The transition to renewable energy has not come without challenges, but the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, and a growing number of owners and executives have embraced the transition.

“The transition to renewables is healthy, and currently I’d categorize it as cautiously optimistic,” says Matt Higgins, lead energy and utility consultant with Henderson Engineers. “Institutional facilities are further along because they own their buildings, often for longer than 20 years.” Acceptance in these facilities has been aided by design standards that can support a renewable energy system, as well as in-house subject matter experts who can weigh in on how a technology might impact their facilities, Higgins says.

“There’s also help from energy codes,” he says. “Some of our codes now require solar and have been for a couple of years in California, but in other parts of the country that’s helping. Even with some of the tax credits expiring, modules will now last healthfully over 20 years, and they have bankable warranties that will support that.”

Brian Rappaport, executive vice president, energy advisory, at JLL, says distributed energy resources (DER) and microgrids, such as onsite solar power and battery storage, are increasingly finding their way into facilities and can help businesses achieve energy management goals.

“These facilities can be paired with active energy management systems that can optimize these resources, such as net-metering and demand response, serving as virtual power plants and providing energy and stability to the grid,” Rappaport says. “To boost resiliency and support 24/7 loads, rooftop solar and battery storage can be paired with other forms of onsite dispatchable power generation.”

Higgins says one renewable energy technology has drawn a great deal of attention recently from institutional and commercial facilities — battery energy storage systems (BESS).

“They’re more closely aligned with how we think about a battery in a flashlight or in home electronics that will last a given duration and provide a given amount of power output,” he says. “Generally, they’re a two- to four-hour solution, so you’re not going to get a day’s worth of power out of them.

“In the commercial sector, we’re seeing a lot more installation for folks who are saying, ‘I’m going to put in that battery system because I want to move my peak demand to a different part of the day or bank my solar energy and then discharge it when the sun is down or going down.’ ”

Money myths

Among the most prevalent myths surrounding renewable energy technologies involve cost considerations.

“When tax credits at the federal level were really healthy, (cost) wasn’t as big a concern,” Higgins says. “But now that we’re seeing those wane a little bit, some of our projects are starting to ask, ‘Can we get cash flow like we used to on a solar-only project, or do we need to combine it with storage?’

“The first cost is a little bit higher, but storage will not only still be eligible for tax credits. They also help you with the most expensive part of your utility bill, which is your demand charge. While the first cost of solar has come down significantly — the cost per Watt has dropped really fast in the last several years, making it much more attainable — that payback has now lengthened on solar-only projects.”

Despite ongoing economic uncertainty since the beginning of the year, renewable technologies have continued to draw interest from owners and executives.

“Renewables, storage and DER costs have fallen sharply, with access to financing proving resilient in the backdrop of tariff and supply-chain uncertainties and policies that support clean energy investments,” Rappaport says. “Businesses have pledged to reduce emissions as part of their ESG goals, while states have also adopted programs to support clean energy investments and reduce costs, such as renewables, investment tax credits, state renewable portfolio standards, carbon-pricing programs, (electric vehicle) rebates, demand response and other energy efficiency measures.”

Availability and reliability questions

Renewable energy technologies also are hampered by ongoing questions related to the availability of renewable energy for facilities.

“On a stand-alone basis, renewable energy sources are intermittent and can’t serve loads that require 24/7 power,” Rappaport says. “In reality, these issues are addressed with a combination of energy storage, active energy management solutions and diversity in energy supply. This includes pairing renewables with other sources of power generation that can operate on a dispatchable basis, balancing the intermittency of renewables while reducing the amount of energy storage required onsite.”

Higgins points to an ongoing misconception that facilities will not be able to get as much production or energy out of a system unless they are in the West or the Southwest United States or Florida.

“That is becoming less true,” he says. “There is a type of module on the market right now that is a bifacial module, which will generate electricity on the top and the bottom side if you have a reflective surface that the module is sitting over. You’re able to do things with technology to bridge the gap that 10 years ago, a standalone commodity panel couldn’t do, and we’re beyond that.

“There are many locations in the Midwest and on the East Coast that we’re working on where solar is part of the conversation, and we’re very confident that it’s going to perform well.”

Owners and executives also raise questions about system reliability when it comes to committing financial resources.

“The big one is, ‘I’m going to buy this big system for a couple million dollars or however much it costs, but it’s not going to last 20 years. It’ll be in the sun all day, it’s going to crack and warp, and the sun is going to degrade it. Hail is going to degrade it, and they won’t even make it through the warranty. I’m going to be replacing my panels before the warranty’s even over,’” Higgins says. “That’s not the case. There are many instances where these modules are lasting their warranty period and beyond and still producing energy.”

More misconceptions

While cost and reliability are likely to remain topics of debate for owners and executives, they are hardly the only areas of renewable energy discussions that are fostering myths and misconceptions. Higgins points to the myth that “all batteries are going to catch fire.”

“There have been a couple of battery fires that have been tragic and very disconcerting for the industry, but the root cause has been found in those instances, and there was a shortcoming either in the design or the manufacturing that the industry is learning from,” he says. “Again, it’s less than 1 percent of the time that that happened. Just like anything else, like the advent of the automobile, I’m sure there were fires and things that happened in the early days of the automobile. There are ways that our industry is learning.”

Rappaport says another myth involves the impact of renewable energy technologies on the nation’s electric grid, and the truth about that impact actually offers hopeful news for owners concerned about the long-term future the grid’s reliability and performance.

“Investing in renewables will not destabilize grids but can’t solely be relied on as a primary source of electricity,” he says. “The need to invest in energy storage and cleaner forms of dispatchable energy will be crucial to unlocking more investment in renewables and reducing the strain on our grids.

“DER and microgrids can be a flexible resource to help balance the grid and protect facilities against grid outages from climate, peak demand, and cyber attacks. In the longer term, utilities and grid operators may be able to defer capital expenditures on transmission and new power generation as more decentralized energy solutions are added, making our grids more efficient and durable.”

The company, which launched in June, is under scrutiny because of the connections of its supporters and the size of its planned “HyperGrid” campus near Amarillo, Texas, which envisions a massive gas and nuclear complex. Fermi also is eyeing using solar and batteries at the 5,263-acre site on land owned by Texas Tech University. If successful, the company could set a precedent for rapid construction of power for data centers and give a jolt to the nuclear industry, a priority of the Trump administration.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fermi said the site was on track to secure 1 gigawatt of power for its operations by the end of next year, including 200 megawatts through a deal with local utility Southwestern Public Service. The filing referred to the company as Fermi Inc.

“We believe the Trump Administration’s renewed focus on expedited permitting and the expansion of nuclear infrastructure in the United States presents a favorable backdrop for Fermi to replicate its business model,” the filing said. Ultimately, the company wants to generate Manhattan-size power at the complex, or 11 GW.

Fermi said it is in the “pre-approval” process with DOE’s loan office, which it is looking to “finance key components” of its energy infrastructure. The company filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for deployment of up to four Westinghouse nuclear reactors at the site, saying initial feedback from NRC staff has been supportive. In a statement Monday, the NRC said it is exploring “innovative approaches” to environmental reviews, including through a pilot program with Fermi.

The project is initially focusing on gas to build 1 million square feet of data center capacity by the end of next year, with support from solar, batteries and grid-supplied power. The company plans to then construct a second million square feet with support from an on-site gas plant. A nuclear unit would begin operating at the site in 2032, according to the filing.

By 2038, Fermi envisions nuclear powering 56 percent of the complex, with gas at 43 percent. Most would be “behind the meter,” meaning the technology companies would draw power directly from co-located power plants.

Whether the company can get close to delivering on its promises is uncertain. “The devil is in the details,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist and grid expert at the University of Texas, Austin.

“I expect something to be built. … Whether they get all the way to the 11 GW is an open question,” he said. “There’s a lot of steps,” including environmental assessments, he added.

In the filing, the company outlined multiple risk factors for its plans, including obtaining capital, ensuring a supply of gas-fired turbines, getting regulatory approvals, and having adequate materials and workers.

The first phase of the project through 2027 could require $2 billion, it said. The last large traditional nuclear reactor to come online in the U.S. was a unit of Plant Vogtle in Georgia.

Another wild card is that Fermi hasn’t generated revenue to date, and its business model is contingent on striking deals with large technology companies for power.

“Our ability to attract high-credit-quality tenants — particularly large AI developers, hyperscalers, and sovereign compute platforms — is critical to achieving scale and recurring revenues,” the filing said. “If no potential near-term tenant enters into such binding agreement with us, our planned construction and operation of Project Matador could be significantly delayed.”

Fermi said it is “actively negotiating” letters of intent with technology companies, and it is pursuing financing through state programs. It also has inked agreements with multiple companies, including an Energy Transfer affiliate for a framework to supply natural gas. Historically, the company’s financial support has come from “capital raises and equipment financings,” it said.

In August, the company announced it raised $100 million in a funding round led by Macquarie Group. UBS Investment Bank, Cantor and Mizuho are backing the IPO offering, according to a press release.

The company said the project’s proximity to Pantex, a facility operated by the Department of Energy assembling nuclear weapons, would help build its workforce.

A DOE tool?

Data centers are expected to consume growing amounts of the nation’s power as AI advances. Texas is a growing hub for the technology, particularly in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, according to McKinsey and Co.

The IPO announcement comes as the future of DOE’s loan office is murky. Since Trump took office, DOE has not finalized any new loans and recently canceled a conditional loan for a major transmission project in the Midwest, the Grain Belt Express.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, however, has said he sees the office as important to help support nuclear power and other administration priorities.

“It is really the most efficient tool we have in the department to help emerging energy technologies,” Wright told House lawmakers in May.

Fermi is looking to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The company’s team includes leaders in investment and private equity firms, including President and Chief Executive Officer Toby Neugebauer; Chief Power Procurement Officer Larry Kellerman; and Perry’s son Griffin, who oversaw more than $1 billion in investments in U.S. shale basins at Grey Rock Investment Partners.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6c/1a/5d9a42cb439c81b26f7148c7d682/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1185668285,N,,2025-09-09 08:01:17.767325

Similarly, in Austin, the city lists multiple municipal parking facilities with public EV chargers available for $.09 per kWh.
Public charging serves not just city employees but also residents, especially those without garages or at-home charging access.
How To Find (And Use) Free Chargers So how do you locate these hidden gems?","“Not the fastest, but it is free.99.” That’s the verdict from a TikTok EV owner who’s become a fan of plugging in at city-owned chargers during errands, lunch breaks, or slow workdays.

Atlanta-area EV owner Cameron Clarkson (@thecameronclarkson) offers the tip in a popular clip where he’s looking out for other budget-minded drivers.

Hacks For Budget-Minded Drivers

Clarkson’s TikTok, which has garnered thousands of views, offers a refreshingly practical reminder: EV infrastructure doesn’t always have to be flashy to be functional. In the video, he walks viewers through the logic of using local government buildings—such as city halls, town halls, and public libraries—as charging stations. Many of these locations offer Level 2 chargers that are free to use and rarely crowded.

That’s a mindset shared by many EV owners looking to avoid the rising costs of public charging. As utilities adjust time-of-use pricing and more EV drivers hit the roads, public charging fees have steadily increased, especially for drivers who don’t have access to home charging setups. According to NerdWallet’s analysis of Electrify America pricing, a 10%-80% charge on a 77 kWh battery pack can run anywhere from $15 to $25, depending on time of day and membership tier.

Clarkson’s advice taps into a growing trend of “charging literacy,” where experienced drivers swap tips on how to get the most out of the still-growing EV infrastructure. It also highlights the importance of community chargers—especially those installed with public funding.

While many drivers focus on commercial charging networks like Electrify America, ChargePoint and EVgo, local governments have quietly built a secondary charging network, often funded through sustainability grants or green fleet programs.

Dozens of U.S. cities, from Sacramento to Asheville to Ann Arbor, have installed publicly accessible Level 2 chargers in municipal parking lots or adjacent to government offices. In many cases, these chargers are made available for free as part of broader climate initiatives, often through grant programs such as the Volkswagen Settlement Fund or the Department of Energy's AFDC initiatives.

In California, the city of Fremont at one time offered free EV charging at City Hall, with signage encouraging use by both staff and the public. Those rates are now listed for the 17 dual-port Level 2 ChargePoint chargers at $0.35 per kWh. Similarly, in Austin, the city lists multiple municipal parking facilities with public EV chargers available for $.09 per kWh.

Public charging serves not just city employees but also residents, especially those without garages or at-home charging access. “Free” may not be the official policy everywhere, but many cities simply haven’t activated fee collection or intentionally leave stations complimentary to encourage usage.

Not Fast, But Smart

There’s a tradeoff, of course. These municipal chargers are usually Level 2, offering 6-10 kW of power, meaning they can add 20 to 30 miles of range per hour, depending on the vehicle and conditions. That’s a far cry from the 150 kW or 350 kW options offered by DC fast-charging stations like those from Tesla’s Supercharger network or IONITY, but it’s often more than enough for midday errands or parked work hours.

According to the Department of Energy’s EV charging speed chart, Level 2 chargers are ideal for situations where drivers plan to be parked for at least an hour. And because these spots tend to be underutilized, they’re also less likely to come with the “charger anxiety” of pulling up to a broken or occupied station—another growing frustration among urban EV drivers.

Even if the power is slow, the savings add up. Over time, a once-a-week free top-up at a city hall charger could save a driver hundreds of dollars annually.

How To Find (And Use) Free Chargers

So how do you locate these hidden gems? Apps like PlugShare, ChargeHub and even Google Maps allow users to filter by cost, location and charger type. Searching for stations near civic centers, libraries or municipal buildings often reveals unexpected finds.

Some cities, like Durham, North Carolina, even maintain their own interactive charging maps. But in many cases, the best discoveries come from community posts, user reviews, and TikTok clips like Clarkson’s.

There are a few best practices to keep in mind:

Check posted signage before assuming a charger is public or free—some may be limited to staff or fleet use.

Don’t overstay if the station has a time limit.

Be courteous, especially if it's a two-stall setup in a small-town lot.

As the EV charging landscape evolves, these city-supplied stations could become a bigger part of the ecosystem, especially for renters, low-income drivers, or anyone without home charging access.

Doug Lewin (01:10:02.178) Doug Lewin Energy, please follow me in all the places.","Utility bills are rising faster than ever. In the first half of 2025 alone, utilities requested $29 billion in rate increases, already a record for any full year, with months still to go. That’s more than double the pace of 2024.

If you’re wondering why, you’re not alone. I hear this question constantly: “If renewables lower costs, why is my bill going up?”

The answer: transmission and distribution. The costs of poles, wires, substations, and local infrastructure that move electricity from plants to homes is rising quickly, while the cost of generation is flat or declining in most places.

To unpack why — and what can be done to help struggling consumers — I sat down with Charles Hua, Director of Powerlines, a new national consumer advocacy group focused on modernizing the regulatory system.

The Real Reason Bills Are Rising

“Generation is not what’s driving up bills. It’s really the transmission and distribution piece.” – Charles Hua

Utilities are pouring capital into poles, wires, and substations. Much of it is necessary, but some isn’t. And because utilities earn profits on capital expenditures, they’re incentivized to build more; they are not incentivized to find cheaper alternatives.

The data is striking: wholesale electricity prices have been flat, or even declined, over the past 15 years. Nationally, retail prices for households, meanwhile, have jumped from about 12¢ to 16–17¢ per kWh. And gas utility bills have been rising faster than electric bills. Those gaps are revealing.

All Regulation Is Incentive Regulation

Utilities make money by earning a rate of return on capital projects. But operational expenses, like vegetation management that could prevent outages, or cloud-based outage trackers, do not generate profits. The result is a bias toward big builds instead of low-cost, reliability-focused fixes.

This is the system we have created and that needs reform.

Consumers know something’s broken. Powerlines’ survey shows 4 in 5 Americans feel powerless over their utility bills, across Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike. Many don’t know what’s driving costs, and rate cases remain opaque and inaccessible.

Short-Term Fixes: Squeezing More Juice from the Grid

We don’t have to accept runaway bills as inevitable. There are proven tools available now:

Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs): Sensors and software that increase the capacity of existing lines. Charles calls them “ibuprofen for the grid.”

Distributed energy resources (DERs) and virtual power plants (VPPs): Solar, batteries, and smart devices coordinated to reduce peak demand and defer new builds.

Energy efficiency: Still the cheapest, fastest way to cut bills, though underutilized in Texas compared to other states.

Each of these solutions stretches the grid we already have, reducing the need for constant billion-dollar expansions.

Long-Term Reforms: Aligning Incentives with Outcomes

Fixing incentives is key. Options include:

Performance-based regulation (PBR): Tying utility profits to outcomes like affordability and reliability, not just capital spending.

Distribution system planning: Opening the “black box” of utility investment so alternatives like DERs can compete with substation expansions.

Return on equity reforms: Expanding utility profit opportunities to operational solutions, not just capital-intensive projects.

None of this is simple, but without it, the trajectory is clear: higher bills and growing consumer backlash.

Why Texas Matters

Texas is ground zero for this debate. Utilities like Oncor have outlined multi-decade capital plans that could quadruple spending by the 2030s. If nothing changes, those costs land squarely on customers.

At the same time, Texas leads the nation in renewables, is building out batteries faster than any other state, and has the independent streak to pioneer smarter utility models.

As Charles put it, “Now is the time for consumers to get engaged.”

Final Thoughts

Utility bills do not have to keep spiraling upward. We need investment in the grid, yes, but smart, efficient investment that maximizes resiliency while protecting affordability.

This is where public utility commissions come in. Their decisions determine how much we pay, how reliable our grid is, and how fast we can adapt to rising demand.

The challenge is real. So is the opportunity. If we get this right, Texas and the U.S. can build a grid that is stronger, smarter, and more affordable.

Let’s make sure consumers have a voice in shaping it.

Doug Lewin (00:04.78)

Welcome to the Energy Capital podcast. I'm your host, Doug Lewin. My guest this week is Charles Hua, the director of Powerlines. Powerlines is a fairly new organization now, a little over a year old, that is focused on helping people understand the critical and important job that public utility commissions do day in, day out to increase reliability and hopefully keep electricity prices lower. I really enjoyed this conversation. Charles is incredibly smart.

Doug Lewin (00:33.942)

and insightful. And we got into what I think is probably the most common question I get on Twitter and LinkedIn. Sometimes questions, sometimes arguments about why electricity prices are going higher. Spoiler alert, it is not because of renewable energy. It's because of the increased costs on the transmission distribution system, particularly on the distribution side. We did get into a lot of charts and figures and things like that. So if you're not already watching on YouTube,

Doug Lewin (01:03.522)

And last but not least, please do leave a five-star review wherever you listen. And with that, here is my interview with Charles Hwang.

Doug Lewin (02:08.814)

Charles Hoi, welcome to the Energy Capital Podcast. Let's start from the beginning. What is Power Lines? And tell us a little bit in that intro to Power Lines about this fantastic report you guys have out. Utility bills are rising, an analysis of utility bills and how they're affecting American energy consumers and who determines them. So what is Power Lines? And tell us a little about this fantastic report on utility bills.

Charles Hua (02:11.384)

Doug, thanks for having me.

Charles Hua (02:35.95)

Sure. Well, thanks again, Doug. So Powerlines, we're about a year old actually, a national organization where national consumer advocacy group focused on modernizing the utility regulatory system, really with two key objectives in mind. One is to lower utility bills and second hand in hand is to advance economic development and growth. You and I actually met August of 2024 in Houston during a very hot and humid summer. So that was a month before we had launched. And I think

Charles Hua (03:05.9)

the topics that we had discussed then very much, if anything, have only intensified in the national discussion since, which is the confluence of load growth and affordability challenges and how that's playing out both in Texas, but also nationally. This issue clearly isn't going away anytime soon. And so we put out two reports over the course of this year, one looking at Q1, the second, course, Q2 data showing that utility rate increase requests during the first half of 2025.

Charles Hua (03:35.95)

totaled $29 billion, which has already set a record for any year with, of course, half the year left to go. It's about two and a half times the same amount during the first half of 2024. And so some of these challenges that we're seeing play out in terms of rising utility bills, rising electricity prices have very much materialized, unfortunately. And the trend lines suggest that this issue is only going to get worse over time.

Charles Hua (04:03.416)

There are, I do think many opportunities though to be hopeful. And I know we're going to get a little bit into some of the solutions available today, but at a very high level, what I find optimistic is the fact that there is a lot of available juice on our existing grid that we are not fully taking advantage of. And that might be one way for us to address some of this problem of both meeting this insatiable demand for electricity, but also putting some downward pressure on our electricity prices.

Doug Lewin (04:33.698)

Yeah, the confluence of affordability and the data center issues, my goodness, has your timing been amazing for establishing this organization and working on the issues you're working on? Let's just start with, so you gave a pretty eye popping number there, right? $29 billion more than any other time that we could find in recorded history. Why are utility bills rising that much? What is the cause?

Doug Lewin (05:03.598)

of these rising costs. And I'll just say for the listener, we're going to put this one on the YouTube channel, Doug Lewin Energy. So I'll have some slides up during this if you want those visuals with it, but we'll talk about it so you can understand. what's driving this, Charles?

Charles Hua (05:18.456)

So I think this is a really important question and we are seeing a lot of different responses to this question. And, you know, I think it's important just to break down what even goes into a utility bill, of course. So there is the transmission piece, there's the generation piece, there's the distribution piece writ large, and of course some other fees and costs. But just focusing on those three components of our grid, it is really the transmission and distribution costs. So the

Charles Hua (05:46.51)

grid infrastructure, the poles and wires, both the long high voltage poles and wires across highways that make up our transmission system, as well as the local poles and wires in your backyard, in your neighborhood that make up the distribution system. That is very much the lion's share of what utility capital expenditures are going towards. There was a statistic from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in 2023 that said, if you zoom in just on the distribution piece, that made up

Charles Hua (06:13.742)

44 % of all utility capex in 2023. so there's a real need to take stock of what exactly is going on there in terms of the grid spending, what is driving that increase and what do do about it? So on that piece, in terms of why grid spending is going up, well, there's several factors here. One is just the fact that a lot of our grid infrastructure is at the end of its useful life and needs to be replaced, particularly on the distribution system. And so

Charles Hua (06:43.552)

Some of this is just replacing aging assets and that cost is something that we're just going to need to eat up. Otherwise we are going to experience power outages and blackouts. But in addition to that, there are new dynamics, including for instance, rising electricity demand that is creating this near term urgency and pressure that a lot of the utility and other grid operators are feeling to build out some more grid infrastructure to able to accommodate new load. And it's not just data centers.

Charles Hua (07:13.294)

You're going to need to, of course, upgrade the distribution system and those poles and wires for electric vehicles, for other sources of electricity demand as well. And then, you know, needless to say, the intense and more frequent extreme weather events are creating significant challenges for our existing grid. You know, you don't need to look any further than Texas for examples of that and the life or death implications of not investing in the grid infrastructure. So these are...

Charles Hua (07:42.542)

very material contributors to this challenge. And what you're seeing in this graph here is that really in the last three to four years, this issue of utility rate increase requests really picking up. It's as you can see, you're almost tripled, doubled certainly since the start of the decade. And so when you then look at that figure in 2025 around utility rate increase requests,

Charles Hua (08:09.014)

in the first half being at $29 billion and this trend showing no signs of relief, I think it really does raise questions around how can we better scrutinize these costs and make sure that on a dollar for dollar basis, any investment that we do make is ultimately benefiting consumers at an even higher clip than what we're spending into the system.

Doug Lewin (08:28.568)

Charles, I can't tell you how many times I see in Twitter and LinkedIn comments and all of that, that, the, you know, renewables, keep saying renewables are lower costs, but how come my bill keeps rising? I want to put a finer point on this. It's a complicated confluence of different things, but to make it as simple as possible, the biggest driver is the T and D system transmission and distribution. And among those, correct me if I've got this wrong.

Doug Lewin (08:56.46)

distribution is actually driving those costs higher, faster than even transmission. So if you're ranking them, it's like distribution, transmission, then a bunch of other things, three, four, five, six below that. Is that accurate or not?

Charles Hua (09:09.582)

That's right. Okay. That's right. And you you wouldn't necessarily come to that conclusion if you're just looking in the news around debates over generation as it clean energies and fossil fuels. Frankly, the data shows that really generation is not what's driving up bills. It's really the transmission and distribution piece. So I do think that that level setting around the facts of what is contributing to these rate increases is critical.

Doug Lewin (09:35.426)

Yeah, absolutely. All right. So, and we kind of know this in your reports, break this down really well because there are different types of utilities. And this is a really important thing to talk about for Texas. In Texas, we have lots of different kinds of utilities, right? There are transmission and distribution utilities like Encore and CenterPoint, AAP, TNMP. Those are regulated monopoly poles and wires companies within the competitive areas. Then we also have...

Doug Lewin (10:05.006)

municipal and co-op utilities within ERCOT. We have vertically integrated utilities outside of there. And as if that wasn't complicated enough, then there's gas utilities, right? And so gas utilities in Texas, most states have the PUCs regulate all of this. Texas has the Railroad Commission regulating gas utilities. So that was a little bit of a 101. I'm going to ask you to do a little 101 on rate making. are going to get, for those that are...

Doug Lewin (10:31.31)

been in this a long time and we'll have timestamps on there and you can fast forward through this, but I think it's really, really important to level set on all of this. One of the reasons we know that renewables are not driving the prices higher is because you can look at the gas utilities, the local distribution gas utilities, their prices have risen at a faster rate. believe your report has it at roughly 40 % over the last five years compared to like

Doug Lewin (10:58.414)

30 % on the electric side. And if somebody would like to argue to me that renewables are making gas utility bills higher, meaning your gas bill at your home, if you're in Texas, that would be Atmos or Texas Gas Service, like the gas for heating that is directly to your home. If somehow renewables is driving that price higher, I would love for somebody to explain that to me. That is one data point that kind of proves this, but you guys are in the data.

Doug Lewin (11:25.331)

What else are you relying on to show that it is distribution and transmission and not renewables that are driving up bills?

Charles Hua (11:32.45)

Well, if you also look at what utilities are explaining in some of these rate case filings, for instance, in terms of why they are even proposing these rate increase requests, they are also saying that it's a lot of the transmission distribution infrastructure. You you point out the different types of utilities in Texas. Clearly everything is bigger in Texas, including the number of different types of utilities. But as you can imagine, if you are

Charles Hua (11:58.664)

a utility company that only owns transmission and distribution assets. you earn a, so just to dive into kind of the profit and business model of utility companies, generally speaking, you utilities earn a rate of return on capital expenditures and operational expenditures. And so when you have an opportunity to invest in capital expenditures around new transmission and distribution infrastructure, that is how

Charles Hua (12:27.306)

utilities in general capture more profits. And so from that standpoint, you can clearly see that there is an inherent hunger and motivation for those utilities to invest in new transmission and distribution. Now, to be absolutely clear, I think as we laid out the need for those investments is clear, especially clear in a state like Texas that is unfortunately grappling with some of these reliability concerns and these increasingly intense hurricanes and other extreme weather events.

Charles Hua (12:56.59)

At the same time, we ought to take a look, given some of these affordability pressures of, well, how do we minimize just the amount of new capital spend that we're doing and maximize the efficiency from the existing grid that we have on the transmission system? How do we take them, not just to look, but really accelerate our action on grid enhancing technologies across the whole spectrum? And I know that Texas has advanced some measures on that front that are quite promising.

Charles Hua (13:25.644)

And then on the distribution system side, there's a whole slew of both policy and technology interventions, and then we'll get into them later. But the notion of energy efficiency as sort of something that maybe in the last couple of years has lost the shiny appeal that I don't know if it ever had that shiny appeal, but it certainly ought to be a solution that we take a much closer look at now, especially when the need for electrons of all sizes, shapes and colors, although I think, you know, they're the same size, shape and color, but

Charles Hua (13:55.506)

Getting electrons on the grid now via efficiency is one such way that we don't need to just over invest in new capital infrastructure that's ultimately going to flow through consumers utility bills. And again, we're to need some of that, but the rate at which those bills increase is going to be quite important going forward as these affordability challenges intensify.

Doug Lewin (14:17.442)

Yeah, so you've just teed up so many of the things I want to talk to you about, including the OPEX versus CAPEX and energy efficiency. We're going to get into all of this. Before we move away from this though, I do just want to show this is another, and again, this is from the Powerlines report. We'll have a link to it in the show notes, but if you just Google Powerlines, utility bills are rising, it'll come up. What this shows for those that are just listening is the wholesale electricity prices are

Doug Lewin (14:45.87)

basically flat across the last 15 years. There's a huge spike in 2022, and you'll correct me if I've got this wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's the Russian invasion of Ukraine driving gas prices higher. And that looks like an outlier. looks like a particular event that was driving wholesale electricity prices higher. Texas had an increase that year for sure, but probably not as extreme as this is a US number. But basically, if you look at 2010 and

Doug Lewin (15:14.606)

2025, if I'm looking at that right, Charles, it actually looks like 2025 is lower. I don't know if you've inflation adjusted or anything like that. could talk about that, but basically like lower wholesale electricity prices 15 years later, what could you think of that has actually gone lower in the last 15 years? But meanwhile, retail residential electricity prices are up significantly. This is a U S average from 12 cents kilowatt hour all the way up to

Doug Lewin (15:40.91)

16 or 17 cents. Anything else you want to say about this particular chart from your report?

Charles Hua (15:45.646)

Charles Hua (15:46.326)

Yeah, I think this pairing of charts is really important because you can see certainly on the right the retail residential electricity prices. They've only gone in one direction. It is only increased and this creates all sorts of questions in terms of how come and certainly during certain periods like wholesale electricity prices at minimum you can see very clearly on that chart in last couple of years have decreased yet this is also coincided with one of the

Charles Hua (16:12.482)

fastest growing periods of retail residential electricity price increases. So that raises some questions in terms of the, you can call it regulatory gap, essentially from wholesale prices and how that flows down to ultimately the price that you and I pay for our utility bills at the end of the month. And some questions around, well, how do those costs actually flow through the value stack essentially? And how do we make sure that

Charles Hua (16:38.882)

we put some downward pressure on retail residential electricity prices because those are only going up based on that chart, but it doesn't have to increase at the rate that it has in the past couple of years for a variety of reasons.

Doug Lewin (16:51.222)

Yeah, that makes sense. And I also just want to show this one. This is also from the report. And what this one shows is it's kind of a heat map of the average US monthly electric bills by state. Texas kind of pops out at this one. It's not the very highest electric bills in the country, but it's in the top quartile. And this is an interesting one because this is where we need to distinguish between rates and bills, right? Texas rates are actually below the national average.

Doug Lewin (17:18.55)

Our bills are actually above the national average, and that's a function of it's a really hot state. And so we use a whole lot of air conditioning, and that's one A. One B, not to be lost, is we do a lot less energy efficiency than other states. So there's a whole lot of energy waste that is going into these very, very high bills. Anything you want to say about this one, and then we're going to pivot and talk rate making 101 and all that good

Charles Hua (17:42.264)

that. Yeah, absolutely. mean, I think there's this general perception that electricity bills are only high in a couple regions, notably New England and California. And while some element of that is true, I think we can see that there are many regions across the country that are struggling with this issue of, of utility bills exactly in part for the reason that you talked about in terms of the fact that bills are what people ultimately pay and, and are

Charles Hua (18:10.622)

and have sensitivity towards not rates. You rates are more relevant perhaps for commercial and industrial customers, but for your average residential consumer, you care about your utility bills. So it does raise some questions around what we can do on rates, what we can do on energy usage, what we can do on bills. And I know we're again, we're going to talk more about that, but I think it's very clear that we need to be very specific when we talk about energy affordability and for whom and in what metrics we're using to define that.

Doug Lewin (18:40.43)

I also want to point out that in Texas, we just had a slide up that showed the average US rate is something like 16 cents. Last I checked, it was a month or two ago, but I don't imagine it's much different right now. The state does have a website to help people shop for electricity. Again, we have different kinds of utilities. If you're in Austin, San Antonio or a co-op area, you can shop. But if you're in Houston or Dallas or Corpus or Laredo or any number of other places within Texas, you can.

Doug Lewin (19:06.09)

And you can typically find 13, 14 cents on there. You want to be careful, redefine print. Some of them have a minimum usage. There's all sorts of gimmicks out there. I have done a couple of podcasts with retailers like Base Power and Octopus that are offering different kinds of rate structures, including things for like EV owners. think some of the big ones, the TXUs and Reliance and that have some interesting rate offerings as well. And I bring that up, Charles, because one of the most striking things to me in your report

Doug Lewin (19:35.916)

was the polling or survey work you did. And I believe the number was, I should have written this down before we started, but something like, was it two out of three or four out of five customers felt like they didn't have control over their bills. Like it was happening to them and they didn't feel like there was anything they could do. And that's really where both energy efficiency and retail choice and maybe some other things, maybe you can talk about that. Like what are some things that exist now and maybe could exist through some policy change?

Doug Lewin (20:05.758)

would give customers more control over their bill.

Charles Hua (20:10.68)

So this I think is really important, right? Because, so the exact stat was that four and five Americans, which was a consistent number across Democrats, Republicans, and independents feel powerless over rising utility bills. And I suspect that there are a few reasons for that. One of which is that unlike many, if not any other products that you consume on a regular basis, the month to month fluctuations in volatility are very pronounced and confusing for a lot of folks.

Charles Hua (20:40.344)

There's also very oftentimes limited visibility in terms of what's actually driving those costs to the extent that that's spelled out on a utility bill. lot of people, you know, certainly how should we expect everybody to know what a fuel adjustment charge or a transmission charge or a delivery charge is? It's not like it's explained on the bill. And there's also very few products where you know how much you're paying for it as you're consuming it. So I think there's something that's

Charles Hua (21:09.72)

fairly distinct about electricity and gas as a consumer product that somebody consumes that makes this a particularly frustrating expense. know, there's certainly more expensive items like rent, for instance, but I think as the egg price new cycle showed, it's not necessarily just the most expensive thing that leads to the most frustration. And why that matters is on a going forward basis, if there's going to be all these utility rate increase requests and there's not a

Charles Hua (21:39.448)

commensurate effort to make sure that consumers actually feel represented in the process and the decision making and the outcome and they know what the PUCT and ERCOT is and they know what's actually driving these costs, then there's a huge risk that there's going to be consumer backlash where folks will simply not want rate increases of any level.

Charles Hua (22:03.65)

I think there's an extreme version of that where then we don't invest in any grid infrastructure and that's not good either. And so I think what this does mean is that there's an urgency to make sure that on a going forward basis as the set of constraints around our utility regulatory system and grid infrastructure buildup become more and more constrained that we actually center consumer interests in all of these decisions going forward.

Doug Lewin (22:27.852)

All right, cool. So we're going to back up one step because we're going to come back to participation. Let's do the real quick Ray Making 101 though. A lot of people know this, but I think it's always good to have a refresher. And you're an expert, Charles, and you're a great communicator. I appreciate this very much about you because this is hard stuff to explain. But let's talk about, you started talking about this a little bit earlier. How do utilities make their money? There are certain things that they get merely reimbursed for, and then there's other things that they...

Doug Lewin (22:57.024)

not only get reimbursed, but plus a rate of returns as CAPEX and OPEX. And talk a little bit about some of the problems and tensions that are in the system that really has now been with us, what, a little over 100 years, right? We're going back to Samuel Insull, like the basic pillars and structure of rate making.

Doug Lewin (23:22.298)

are pretty much what they were 100 years ago, and I think there's very serious cracks starting to show. So describe the way it is now, and where might this head to have a better system that actually fits better with our modern needs.

Charles Hua (23:36.172)

Yeah. So the way that utility rates currently, what that rate making process and infrastructure looks like is, and this is going to be somewhat of a, of a simplification, but you generally have two major buckets of expenditures. So capital expenditures and operational expenditures. The capital expenditures are new power plants, not in Texas, this case necessarily new poles and wires, those transmission distribution projects that we talked about. So just new infrastructure build essentially.

Charles Hua (24:05.516)

The operational expenditures can vary anything from operations and maintenance of some of those, some of those infrastructure projects to fuel costs, to labor. And so in general, capital expenditures are what receives a return on equity for the utility companies. Essentially, you know, one can think of that as their profit. And that metric is really important for utilities and investors because that essentially determines

Charles Hua (24:33.974)

If you're an investor of the utility, want the number to be higher because ultimately that is in some sense what return you can expect for investing in the utility company. And the operational side, you you need to prove you being the utility in this case, need to prove that those costs were prudent. They're just and reasonable that they were incurred and you're not just, you know, passing off any type of costs. So there's some level of.

Charles Hua (24:59.35)

scrutiny involved, but in many cases, generally, as long as there's some level of reasonable defense for those operational expenditures, you'll get, you you use the word reimbursed, essentially, you'll get cost recovery or reimbursement essentially for those for those costs. I've actually seen in some cases, like in, I think it was New York where utility started offering Zempik as part of, as part of its employees healthcare benefits, and that actually made its way into the rate case in terms of

Charles Hua (25:26.86)

what was recovered as a cost. so, but there's other things. There is things like, you know, political expenditures and things like trade association dues and other components of operational expenditures. You know, I think it'd be an interesting exercise for there to be a systematic look at exactly what all is in there. But the point is that utilities are really focused on the capital piece because that is where they earn a return. Now, as you can imagine on the

Charles Hua (25:55.508)

operational side for something like gas or other resources that have a fuel component and is subject to volatile global and domestic markets, then those price increases, there's a moral hazard there in terms of how those oftentimes just get passed on directly to consumers. And some states have essentially this fuel adjustment such that the utilities can pass on a one-to-one basis those costs. so they don't

Charles Hua (26:24.224)

either make profit or lose money off of volatile prices, but consumers do pay the price no matter what. But going back to the capital piece, this is why in the case like some of the utility companies that are seeking rate increase requests like Encore that are on the TND side, why the notion of spending more capital on transmission and distribution and infrastructure is very exciting is because that does represent an opportunity to earn that rate of return on that increased

Charles Hua (26:51.042)

capital that comprises the rate base for utility companies.

Doug Lewin (26:55.064)

Charles, what are we seeing around the country in terms of returns on equity, ROE, right? So this is when you're talking about the capital expenditures and this is generally where the utilities get excited because they can earn their return there. What are you seeing around the country as far as like a range of those and is there some kind of a... I'm not asking for you to know this like perfectly, but like kind of roughly and where is the median that you're seeing?

Charles Hua (27:21.806)

Yeah, it's generally it's been hovering around nine to 12 percent. We have seen in a couple of states definitely recently some rate case requests land on the higher end of that spectrum. And so there has been more analysis around what a healthy return on equity is for utilities that can still ensure that utilities remain financially solvent and can attract capital from Wall Street shareholders. But in general, it's hovered around nine to 12 percent.

Doug Lewin (27:50.88)

And I want to just drill down a little bit more. We're going to talk about Encore in just a minute, because that is an active rate case in Texas right now. And I do want to dive into that a little bit. But I want to just give a couple examples for the listeners of the different kinds of OPEX versus CAPEX. So many of the listeners of this show are in Houston. Houston last year over the summer with Hurricane Barrel, several hundred thousand people were without power.

Doug Lewin (28:20.066)

for a week. One of the things that emerged from the hearings after that, there was a hearing at the Senate, by the way, where they talked quite a bit about different kinds of performance-based regulation, which we'll talk about in just a minute. A lot of senators were very interested in trying to figure out how to better align utility incentives with the outcomes that their customers want and expect and deserve. But one of the problems that was cited a lot, both at the commission and in the Senate hearings,

Doug Lewin (28:49.186)

And there was a commission hearing that happened in Houston, by the way. I want to talk about that too, spreading commission. I know this was in your report of like commissions don't have to meet. Actually, I think you brought that up. I think I've heard you speak on a podcast, Volts, David Roberts, a great one. If people don't get enough of Charles Hois from this one, go listen to the Volts podcast, which was a great one too. And you talked about how typically commissions don't get out of their own cities. This was the first time in a quarter century, to the best of my knowledge, they got out of Austin, they went to Houston.

Doug Lewin (29:18.57)

One of the things that came up over and over again in that hearing in Houston, and I listened to all eight to 10 hours, whatever it was of it, was vegetation management. They were not trimming the trees well enough. the hurricane came through, it was a category one, but that caused widespread outages. Vegetation management is an operational expense. A utility does not earn a return on equity for trimming trees.

Doug Lewin (29:45.39)

So they have this sort of bias. And I want to be real clear. There are some things utilities do that I think are downright nefarious. And we can talk about those things too. I don't think this is necessarily a nefarious one. This is just like all regulation is incentive regulation. And their incentives are to spend more on capital and less on operational expense. I'll give one more example that I think makes this really clear. During Hurricane Barrel, their Outage Tracker, CenterPoint's Outage Tracker, famously failed.

Doug Lewin (30:13.848)

People were using Whataburger app to figure out where there was power because where the Whataburger was open, they knew that there was power in that area or power was coming back in that area as it were. Center points didn't work. And part of the reason is they were trying to house the servers themselves because that's a capital expense. If they had done it in the cloud with somebody that would have had much better uptime, that becomes an operational expense. I think that is as clear an example.

Doug Lewin (30:42.474)

of the problem here. And some may quibble and say, that's not exactly the way it was. But the point is the illustration of that should bring home to the listener, like there's a problem here. If you are driving utility to spend more and more on capital, need to have a system of regulation that drives to the outcome, not to the kind of dollar that you're spending.

Charles Hua (31:08.002)

I totally agree. mean, and I will flag that I have used that Whataburger map in many presentations and talks that I have given since, because I do think to your point, it is a stark illustration in how the energy capital of the world, in the wealthiest country in the world, that we are relying on fast food chain maps for where there's electricity. I think that's a pretty stark dynamic there. But to your point, I think this is something that is

Charles Hua (31:33.622)

certainly not expressed enough, which is that all regulation is incentive regulation. We are, whether intentionally creating what I like to say, capital I incentives versus lowercase I incentives in terms of the capital I incentives being that ROE being the rate base, what goes into all of that. And the lowercase I incentives also being things like regulators asking the right questions and doing their jobs to make sure that costs are properly scrutinized and things like that. The point is whether or not we are

Charles Hua (32:00.782)

you know, creating a performance based regulation regime or not, there are incentives at play. And I think it's very important to know what those are because the vegetation management piece is something that has come up, not just in Texas, but also in California. And frankly, as the risk of wildfires just significantly increases across the West, that's only going to become more more relevant and more and more regulators are slowly starting to ask those questions. But in a state like California, the question is, do we bury all of these power lines?

Charles Hua (32:30.114)

Do we trim our trees more effectively? And so this is a very real dynamic. And I think the bottom line is like, it's going to cost money for all of this stuff because we do want more reliable energy. We don't want a power grid that's going to fail. Back to your point about, you know, defining and being very crystal clear about what the outcomes are. think affordability and reliability is something that everybody should agree on. I think is something that everybody has agreed on. Unfortunately, as we're seeing across the country,

Charles Hua (32:57.824)

in many cases, neither are being met. And so I think it really calls into question, is this utility regulatory paradigm as presently constructed, working the way that it should be if we are ultimately keeping the end user in all of this in mind, that being the consumers and that's the residential consumers, that's the small business consumers, that's the commercial consumers, that's the industrial consumers, that's the whole spectrum of consumers, everybody wants affordable and reliable energy.

Charles Hua (33:25.162)

And it's incumbent on the regulators and the regulatory system to make sure that those outcomes are met. So in some cases, as you alluded to, states have introduced legislation or regulatory action to create a performance-based regulation paradigm, which as the name or phrase suggests, is trying to tie utility earnings and profits to their performance, to specific outcomes and metrics that the commission is defining and creating incentive structures around. There aren't

Charles Hua (33:54.316)

that many states that have gone through the full kind of checklist of what would constitute the full spectrum of PBR, let's say, that includes things like performance and setting mechanisms, multi-array plans, et cetera, where there's multiple components and in different ways to define that. Sometimes you can have too many metrics. Sometimes you can have too few metrics. Sometimes there's concerns about loopholes or gamification of metrics, but

Charles Hua (34:20.194)

I think the bottom line is regardless of what the exact solution looks like in any given state or utility or PUC territory, that it's critical that we keep those end outcomes in mind, which is affordability and reliability.

Doug Lewin (34:31.982)

Absolutely.

Doug Lewin (34:32.843)

So we're going to talk more about performance-based regulation and what some of the intermediate steps could be to crawl, walk, run towards better alignment of incentives. But before we do that, I want to talk about Encore. We talked just a minute ago about how there's a rate case there. What I'm showing on the screen right now, describing for the listener, those that are viewing on YouTube could see this, but there's a slide from Sempra's investor call. This was from

Doug Lewin (35:00.11)

I it's from February of this year, and they were telling Wall Street what their earnings opportunities are going forward, and they show a capital plan that has, I think the number is 36 billion in it over the next five years, including this year, with another potential for $12 billion in spending. They also have a potential capital opportunities 2030 to 2034.

Doug Lewin (35:25.71)

of somewhere between 55 and $75 billion. So that would be somewhere between 11 and $15 billion a year. I went ahead and put this into a chart to look at what they've spent over the last five years, what they are planning to spend over the next five, and what that would look like in the 2030s. And so for those listening, what you're looking at by the 2030s is a 5X increase over what was in the 2020s.

Doug Lewin (35:54.634)

If this doesn't bring home to the listener or the viewer, the imperative to do something around changing the business model. And I want to be real clear here. I want to be fair to the folks that are working at utilities. Again, I am not ascribing anything even close to evil motives here. There is, as Charles, as you said earlier, there is a great need for more investment in the system. Let's just put that out there. Like spending is going to go up on the grid.

Doug Lewin (36:24.866)

The question is by how much and at what point do consumers just kind of break, right? Because if you're telling me four to five don't feel like they have any control and also from your survey, Charles, and maybe you can get these numbers a little better, was, well, why don't I just ask you, what did people say about whether or not their bill was fair or at the right size or was too high? It was something like half thought their bill was too high or something like that, right?

Charles Hua (36:54.638)

Because three and four were concerned about utility bills rising. And one thing that also flagged is that 60 % of respondents, again, consistent across blue, red, and purple, Democrats, Republicans, and independents, said that they didn't believe that the state government was doing enough to protect their interests as consumers. I want to be clear, the fact that that was consistent across party was actually pretty surprising to us in terms of

Charles Hua (37:22.232)

for something like your views on your state government and whether that's protecting your consumer interest. think the bottom line is people don't care about all of the specifics on how to bring about more relief in terms of more affordable utility bills. They just want more affordable utility bills. And this chart that you're pointing out is very staggering because as we've talked about, expenditures are going to go up. That is a pretty significant 5X increase. mean, I don't want to undersell that point.

Charles Hua (37:51.82)

really we're looking at is a bar chart that shows how much people are going to pay for all of this, because it's at the end of the day, is consumers that, that foot the bill here. And so I think it's, it's a sobering forecast of what things could look like. And there are, you know, not to make this too gloomy, there are thankfully solutions that exist today that are cheaper today that we can deploy today that can put some downward pressure on those bars. And with the idea that

Charles Hua (38:20.942)

Hey, if we can spread out those costs over more consumers, such that the numerator of electricity prices being those capital expenditures and the denominator being consumers that we're serving. That's a huge point. could actually decrease. like that is on the table, but we are far from that scenario right now for a variety of reasons that we've gotten into and can continue to get into during this episode.

Doug Lewin (38:44.43)

A huge

Doug Lewin (38:44.71)

point, and I appreciate you making it because that actually is kind of a ray of hope or sunshine here. Well, sunshine, A, we've got a lot of renewables in Texas and that is going to put some downward pressure because renewables are putting downward pressure on the generation side. But on the T and D side, the transmission distribution side, you're absolutely right as you do get additional large loads and things like that into the system. If the system of transmission to distribution cost allocation, which is something the commission

Doug Lewin (39:12.768)

is going to be taken up this year, if that's done right, you could see those costs spread over more entities. And at least maybe that wouldn't cause prices to go down, but could at least relieve some of the pressure. But Charles, this is, I think, a good lead in to what I think is one of the most important points, and I think is really, at least as I perceive it, at the heart of power lines and maybe speak to whether that's true or not and how you guys are working on this, but how is the public engaged?

Doug Lewin (39:40.908)

Because I can tell you for a fact, as somebody that has worked in this space for decades, I still find these utility convenings very, very difficult to follow because there are rate cases every four years, but that in between there are DCRFs, the distribution cost recovery factors, which is basically just a way to like, okay, we spent all this on the distribution grid, let us recover that plus the rate of return.

Doug Lewin (40:05.638)

cost, transmission cost of service, EECRFs, energy efficiency cost recovery factors, which by the way, the utilities just got $100 million in bonuses last year on $150 million in utility incentive spend. There's so much going on and it is so difficult for me to keep track of it. I write a damn newsletter on this stuff and have a podcast on it and I have trouble keeping up with all this stuff. What is the average person to do? The person who's just like

Doug Lewin (40:33.816)

those four out of five that say, don't have any control over my ... How do they participate in these processes and how can the state policymakers and regulators make it easier for people to participate? And before you answer that question, I just want to say this. We were just talking about Encore and you saw or heard about all those rate increases coming. To my knowledge, there is not one single meeting in the Dallas Fort Worth area

Doug Lewin (41:03.022)

that the Public Utility Commission, a neutral arbiter, will hold in that entire service territory. Dallas, Fort Worth, or West Texas, they serve way out into West Texas as well. And that is standard practice. When these rate cases happen, there are no meetings. Now, the utility may hold some meetings, but the Public Utility Commission does not. We have got to find ways to make this more comprehensible to people and to bring them into a process that has such a huge impact on their lives.

Charles Hua (41:30.72)

absolutely. And to give you an example in a neighboring state in Louisiana, there was a hearing on an energy efficiency rule that was held closer to Texas, that it was to the heart of Baton Rouge and New Orleans and where, who was going to be impacted by energy efficiency. was, it was essentially a ruling to, without getting too into the weeds there, got the notion of a independent program for energy efficiency. So there are ways also to abuse this in the other direction, but I think.

Charles Hua (41:59.298)

The point is that doesn't really make sense in our small D democracy here in terms of whether consumer interests are actually being represented when folks who are ultimately being impacted by those decisions don't really have any meaningful way to participate. would say that it is not fair to expect consumers want to do all the work to figure out what a public utilities commission is and what a electricity market is. And then to be able to show up to a meeting, especially if it's not held during

Charles Hua (42:28.494)

you know, convenient times for folks. And if there's no opportunity for folks to travel to that meeting, I mean, these things in a way sound squishy, but I just want to reinforce the fact that to your other question around how the public is engaging with this, they have fundamentally engaged with utility and energy affordability issues in 2025 in a way that I have not seen to this degree ever before. And this is now blowing up in TikToks on social media.

Charles Hua (42:57.006)

If you just look at the national and local news coverage on utility rate increases, certainly I can speak to the national level that has significantly proliferated in 2025. And, you know, we have a great comms team and I would like to take credit for our comms team on their behalf and their incredible work in trying to catalyze that national discussion. But frankly, this, conversation is just happening out in the open in a way that it hasn't been. so the mismatch there though, the challenge is that if consumers lose trust in the

Charles Hua (43:26.658)

viability of this utility regulatory system, which again was set up in theory and in practice to protect the interests of consumers as the beneficiaries of the invention of and commercialization of electricity. But if we lose sight of that, then I think this whole project around our utility regulatory system has significant risks. I have seen both chatter from policymakers and consumers to abolish

Charles Hua (43:54.008)

public service commissions. mean, like some of this is not necessarily based in granted in reality, but the fact that these discussions were even happening, I think is cause for concern about the downside risks of not getting this right. And I do think that the question of creating more opportunities and accessibility for consumers and members of the public and not just them, but also other stakeholders that have interests at play here, local governments and large corporates that have significant energy use. If we don't

Charles Hua (44:22.99)

create pathways whereby they can engage or at minimum that their perspectives can be incorporated, then what are we doing? And I think that to your point there on that specific example, there is a need for public utility commissions to also be proactive about identifying which communities, consumers and stakeholders are impacted. And then proactively go solicit that feedback and not just have this notion that, if they're not coming to us, then that means that they're not.

Charles Hua (44:49.314)

particularly concerned or motivated around these issues. In fact, it's quite the opposite.

Doug Lewin (44:53.75)

I think that's exactly right. And I think just like the commission held a meeting in Houston last year, they need to get up to the Dallas-Fort Worth area and West Texas during this rape case and hear from people. And I know there's all sorts of Byzantine rules around rape cases and what could be discussed with interveners and all that kind of stuff, but they can hear from the public and take their input. They need to hear that real life experience of...

Doug Lewin (45:18.818)

people. will say Charles, I will give some credit to Texas on a couple of fronts. Number one, there was a bill passed during the session, Senate bill 1664. That requires going forward any utility to describe to their customers in plain language what is happening to their bill in a rate case. Doesn't go in and affect it till September 1. Encore has already filed their rate case, so it won't apply to this one. But for any rate case going forward, there'll be some additional requirements to explain to the public the impact.

Doug Lewin (45:48.434)

on their bills. In Texas, you can put a comment into the Public Utility Commission without a lawyer. I used to work at a company where I led regulatory, and there were a bunch of states where you couldn't even comment unless you had a lawyer. That is not the case in Texas, and there is a pretty good guide on the PUC website for how to submit comments. We will link to that in the show notes for folks that And I will put a link to the docket number for this Encore rate case. But I think you're precisely right. The commission needs to do more

Doug Lewin (46:17.166)

productive outreach again. I don't mean this to just be critical because they are under-resourced. They do need more resources to do this. They did get additional resources in a recent session after Winter Storm URI, and they did establish an Office of Public Engagement. We will link to that office, which I think is really an important step. But getting consumer voices more involved is really, really important. I want to talk about a couple other things that I think ... I want to talk about this, Charles, in terms of like a crawl walk run, because

Doug Lewin (46:46.358)

I think like, you we're talking about performance-based regulation and that's like, like you said, just as you were talking about it, I'm like, my God, this is really complicated. It really is. There's just no other way about it. It's just really complicated and it's not the kind of thing that's going to happen in a few months or even a few years. That kind of thing will take time. But there are some things that we can do along the way. I want to give a couple of examples and then I want you to either talk more about those examples or add other ones that you think would be useful for...

Doug Lewin (47:15.276)

the commission and for advocates and the general public in Texas to think about. Distribution system planning would be one of those. The data is showing us that the largest increase in utility bills are on the distribution side. How does the distribution system get planned? It gets planned internally at a utility with very, very little transparency. I would go as far as to say it's basically opaque. And so there are times where there could be a solution.

Doug Lewin (47:44.638)

that a competitive provider out there could, instead of building this brand new substation, we could put out grid enhancing tech. Well, that would be like, instead of upgrading a transmission line, but like we could have distributed energy resources that would obviate the need for this new infrastructure or reduce the size of that substation. Maybe it doesn't need to be a $50 million. Maybe it could be a $30 million if we put these DERs out there and those cost less than the $20 million Delta.

Doug Lewin (48:14.104)

But how would you know that? If you're a competitive provider in the space, you don't know what the utility's planning to spend outside of these great big aggregate numbers that we're talking about. I think there's also a ton of, mentioned earlier PIMS, that's a good acronym for people to know, performance incentive mechanisms, right? There could be smaller ones that just say, hey, we're going to give you a cash reward if you achieve X. Like you're just going to make more money. Again, all regulations, incentive regulation, put the carrot out there.

Doug Lewin (48:43.234)

get that outcome. The most recent, well, when this comes out, it might not be the most recent, but the most recent podcast of the day we're recording that went out was one with Octopus Energy US CEO, Nick Chassett. And we talked about they have a special EV charging rate for some of their customers that have EVs, but the transmission distribution charge is still the same, whether it's two in the morning and there's plenty of power or it's eight.

Doug Lewin (49:10.986)

in the evening and the sun's gone down and we're in a period of high prices, the distribution charge is exactly the same. You could have some kind of time varying opt-in kind of a rate that would be revenue neutral, not required of customers, but people could opt into it. That would give them an incentive to use more when it's cheap, to use less when it's not. And then the public participation. Like to me, those are all things that could happen in the next six to 12 months without a massive heavy lift.

Doug Lewin (49:40.13)

that would make a real difference, maybe six to 12 months is not realistic, whatever, in the short to medium term that would make a real difference. Comment on any of those you want or add to the list with things that you think in the short and medium term might make sense in the crawl of the crawl walk run.

Charles Hua (49:57.2)

totally. mean, I fundamentally agree with everything that you just said. You know, there's a couple of different ways to think about near-term solutions that can provide some immediate relief on the, on the technological side. You listed a couple of them. I described grid enhancing technologies or GETs as the ibuprofen for the grid in the sense that it can provide some immediate near-term cost relief in that it gets more juice out of our existing grid. can accommodate some of, and meet some of this rising demand on a near-term basis. Those very

Charles Hua (50:24.792)

customers want grid enhancing technologies, it's beneficial for consumers, it's an OPEX oriented solution. And so that's why in part, the notion that utilities are preferential towards capital investments that does come into play. But I think there's a near term dynamic where if we want some immediate relief on, on bills, this is one solution. You mentioned a couple others, virtual power plants, distributed energy resources, Texas, obviously actually in many ways leading the country in those fronts with still opportunities to further.

Charles Hua (50:53.878)

accelerate and we also touched on energy efficiency. Why are we not taking advantage of all of the available electrons that we have on our grid? You you've had Tyler Norris on your podcast. He's had obviously an incredible great paper with, some of the other colleagues at Duke university where ERCOT's load factor is around 53%. What that means is that there's an opportunity for more juice for us to squeeze from the existing grid and let's do that. And then on the policy front.

Charles Hua (51:21.262)

The two that you mentioned in particular, distribution system planning and rate design reform, are two of the ones that we would certainly champion and espouse as things that states should at minimum be looking at, if not implementing, if it's right for the regulatory system in that particular state. That's only going to get more more important, especially around the question of distribution capbacks.

Charles Hua (51:45.134)

Transmission planning is something that in general also is highly relevant in terms of taming some of the transmission costs and making sure that consumers are benefiting from new transmission investments at a national level. know, some of the things that we're talking about here are for quarter 1920, which certainly doesn't apply in this context. But there are ways for us to just continuously improve transmission planning, interconnection. And this is also an opportunity maybe for AI

Charles Hua (52:13.846)

and positive AI use cases for the grid to come into play to just speed up some of these processes as well in terms of getting more electrons on the grid to accommodate more load, but doing so in a way that actually again puts downward pressure on rates, which we are very far from in practice right now. And then I think it's really important just at a macro level, what I would just continue to emphasize is that consumers aren't really represented in the utility regulatory process right now.

Charles Hua (52:38.662)

in a meaningful way. And I think there is a huge need and an opportunity as more and more consumers are concerned about these issues or engaged on these issues, but maybe don't know what the PUCT is or maybe don't know what ERCOT is to understand that there are bodies beyond utilities that have a role to play here and they should engage. They should provide public comment in some of these proceedings because at the end of the day, it's a two-way street too.

Charles Hua (53:06.838)

like for consumers to be represented, agree with you that public utility commissions in general should be resourced to be able to be more proactive in soliciting consumer feedback and input on decisions. But also in the meantime, in the absence of that, as consumers, we all should get more engaged ourselves to the extent that we can and participate as well.

Doug Lewin (53:28.654)

Yeah, absolutely. And I would point out that in that Encore Raid case, there are a number of intervenors, organizations that have members. AARP is an intervenor. So if you're a member of AARP, you might look to get involved through that organization. Texas Consumer Association has members. They are an intervenor. Environmental Defense Fund. There is a state agency in Texas, the Office of Public Utility Counsel. Obviously most states have these. That is a residential and small commercial rate payer advocate.

Doug Lewin (53:58.26)

you can reach out to them. That is a state agency that exists for you if you are a residential consumer. And I would also point out there are cities, there's two different groups of cities that intervene. Now, they typically intervene looking out for the bills that the city pays, but there's no reason why they couldn't have a little bit more expanded role and look out for their citizens as well and what their bills are. So I would encourage folks to reach out to your city and to ask if they are an intervener in the rate case. So those are just some avenues.

Doug Lewin (54:26.424)

that know it can be intimidating. And obviously, you could put comments in, but if you're not an intervener, that comment will be seen, but it actually won't really be considered within the cases as part of that sort of Byzantine setup. So I would still encourage people to do that, to participate. One other note on this, Charles, again, there's a lot of negativity in a lot of these conversations, certainly not on your part. You've done a great job, but I sometimes feel like Dougie Downer in these things of all the, showing all these ...

Doug Lewin (54:53.51)

showing all these charts of prices going up. But I do want to say that Texas is making progress, and I don't want to give short shrift to where there are good things happening. Some of the reforms after Winter Storm, Yuri, there is a public comment period now on everything that comes up at the PUC. People rarely use it. You do have to come to Austin to use it. They don't give you a remote call-in option.

Charles Hua (55:12.366)

people.

Doug Lewin (55:17.23)

But if you're in Austin or near, or going to be visiting Austin, or whatever the thing might be, or if again, part of one of these organizations, you might coordinate with them to actually ... Because that is important. The legislature intended for the Public Utility Commission to hear more from people. It's kind of shocking that wasn't part of the normal way of doing things before, but it is now. At the beginning of the meeting, they hear general comments from the public, if there are any, and on every single docket they bring up, they've got to create ...

Doug Lewin (55:45.25)

that space for people to speak. So Texas has kind of taken some steps towards this. I think this is going to become just so vitally important because, and this is where I want to get to the walk and the run. Like what are the kind of longer-term things? Because Charles, as I've said a few times, and I'll say it again, there is this kind of tension here because I don't think anybody can look at the grid of the United States of America and say, yeah, we don't need a substantial investment in the grid. Like the grid

Doug Lewin (56:15.092)

needs investment. We need to put more dollars into the grid. That is a good thing. And I want to be generally supportive of that. We don't have any extra high voltage transmission lines in the state of Texas. In countries around the world, they're putting up hundreds and even thousands of miles of these things that we've got zero. Ohio has some, Texas, we have none. We need those, and that costs money. There's no free lunch. But we have to come up with ways to balance that to make sure that the bills aren't rising.

Doug Lewin (56:43.828)

so fast that people can't keep up with that. So part of that is what you talking about earlier is making sure that some of the large loads are paying the cost. But then there's some other things too. So let's talk about walk and run. I'll throw out a couple ideas. I've heard you talk about these things, but I want to get your reaction to them. And again, you can kind of add to the list. One is to potentially go to a lower return on equity, but actually make that return on equity for what's called totax. Instead of

Doug Lewin (57:11.054)

just paying, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, but I think I am. Instead of capital expenditures being the only place you can earn a return on equity, you would earn on capital and operational expenses, which would remove that bias towards capex. So then you'd be more likely to spend on things like cloud-based solutions or AI solutions or grid enhancing technologies or vegetation management or any of those things that aren't earning a return now, but in exchange,

Doug Lewin (57:37.41)

you would then have to have a lower ROE overall because like Encore and their rate case is asking for like 10.5, 10.6, something like that. If you spread that out over all the OPEX, now they're making a ton more money. So there'd have to be some balance point there. I also think figuring out a way, and this is, think, related to the distribution system planning piece, where alternatives, what are often called non-wires alternatives, they're just, it's basically just a basic principle of can we have some competition in the system

Doug Lewin (58:06.874)

And importantly, so that the utility just doesn't see this as a zero sum game and they're losing, some performance incentive mechanism tied to that. Hey, anytime you save your rate payers money, you could actually just get a cash payment. Let's say you just saved everybody 10 million by doing a bunch of DERs, we'll give you an extra million. Your customers still save nine, and that million wasn't even on capital you had to expend. So Wall Street loves that, right? That's pure margin, right? So there are win-wins to be...

Doug Lewin (58:35.938)

devised there, if you can get to some kind of, and I think that all Charles kind of comes down to something that fits under the umbrella of PBR, of performance-based regulation. There has to be some kind of, maybe we need a different term to describe it, maybe the words aren't right, but that's kind of fundamentally what it is. So those are a couple of things that I think are longer. They're probably going to take a lot of like

Doug Lewin (59:02.606)

meetings, and hopefully commission can open dockets and start to explore these things. take time, but react to those. And then again, if there's other things that you think are on that longer term period, but we've got to start working towards now, I'd love to hear what those ideas are.

Charles Hua (59:19.916)

Well, I actually like the term PBR in part because I think one thing that the energy space should have is PBR happy hours. And that'll attract folks for perhaps two reasons. So I think that in general though, to your point, the notion that all regulation.

Doug Lewin (59:35.928)

I just

Doug Lewin (59:36.339)

got that. I'm embarrassed how long passed through the ribbon. Okay, took me a minute. I'm embarrassed at how long that took me. Yes, okay, good. I saw it.

Charles Hua (59:46.424)

I saw

Charles Hua (59:46.694)

it in your eyes for those watching on YouTube, maybe extra incentive for you to watch it on YouTube, There you go. It goes to show that there's two types of people in the world. Those who think that PBR is performance-based regulation and those who think that it's a beer. And there's nobody in between.

Doug Lewin (01:00:06.446)

We have to have all of them involved for this to be successful. We're going to need the people in this too.

Charles Hua (01:00:10.734)

Exactly.

Charles Hua (01:00:12.274)

And much more of the latter because as you know, not small the former is, we need much more of the latter. But I think that's exactly right. And again, going back to what you raised, is all regulation is incentive regulation, which is the fact that another way that I would put it is, let's keep in mind why we are doing all of this. All of this being our utility regulatory system where we're building new power plants and new poles and wires and serving customers is because at the end of the day,

Charles Hua (01:00:40.29)

we are providing in this whole system a critical resource, notably electricity and gas for consumers. And the for consumers part is critical because if you don't have affordable energy and if you don't have reliable energy, then you are breaking that that sort of social and consumer and public trust in the system. And so I do think that there's a need here to really course correct and make sure that as we tackle these issues going forward that we do keep that in mind now.

Charles Hua (01:01:08.91)

That's a little bit abstract. think in practice, some of the things that we want to see more states doing include developing an affordability action plan and being proactive about it. You know, this is something that as we're facing this inflection point of load growth and affordability and the potential rate of increase on both fronts really kicking into high gear, the need for this kind of quote unquote planning on the affordability question is only going to become more paramount. Some states

Charles Hua (01:01:37.516)

have actually done a proactive job to investigate some of these questions around energy burden, energy costs, and how it's impacting consumers. This is something that in general, the PUC could do on its own, of course, is develop a kind of just North Star action plan for how to tackle this and stagger those recommendations short, medium, long-term. Part of why I say this is because the exact contents of that plan will look different depending on the state because we didn't really emphasize this necessarily, but

Charles Hua (01:02:06.892)

the reasons why bills are going up does differ depending on the region and the specific profile of those drivers of transmission, distribution costs, extreme weather events, et cetera, fuel costs, just availability, things like that. So in New England, there's going to be a different set of reasons why bills are going up than in Texas, not to mention the differences, of course, in the electricity market structures in those different places. And so this is something where

Charles Hua (01:02:32.608)

I do think there is a level of engagement from governors and congressmen on these issues in a way that we also haven't seen to this degree in a while, where I have seen governor Cox in Utah, governor Shapiro in Pennsylvania, governor Yonkin in Virginia, gubernatorial candidate Mikey Sherrill in New Jersey, governor Pritzker, governor Healy, governor Hokel in New York. I don't think that that group that I just mentioned hangs out together all that much, but

Charles Hua (01:03:00.226)

This is a really bipartisan group of governors that are concerned in part because they're hearing from consumers about these issues. So to the point also about near-term things that you as a listener can do. One of them is after you've finished providing public comment on a rate case in front of the PECT is to go out and also let your other elected leaders know that this is a challenge that you're concerned about. And then this is something that we truly need.

Charles Hua (01:03:26.794)

at the state, local, and national levels, a bipartisan framework to understand that this is a problem, that we do have near-term solutions like those technologies and policy fixes that we talked about that can chip away at this problem, us another day, and mitigate the concerns such that those medium and long-term solutions around affordability are not only going to be more feasible, but also more impactful once we do implement some of those measures.

Doug Lewin (01:03:53.73)

Yeah, and before I ask you what I didn't ask you that I should have, I also just want to reiterate, I don't know how anybody else approaches this area, but I know from you, from having talked to you in the past and from your reports and speaking for myself, this is not in any way meant to be kind of an anti-utility kind of thing. Utilities are very important. I think they're going to have a very important role for a long time to come.

Doug Lewin (01:04:18.74)

As I said earlier, I think the investment in the grid is very much needed. I also think we're at a moment where this was a different discussion, Charles. I was having these discussions five and 10 years ago, 15 years ago. This is a different discussion because they can see how much investment is going to be needed. I think we might be getting to a point where utilities are looking at some of their own numbers and they have to be having the thought.

Doug Lewin (01:04:49.432)

Can our customers actually pay all this? There are going to be opportunities for them to earn a lot of money, even in an environment where grid enhancing technologies and energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing some of the need to spend. They're still going to be spending a lot. So I think we're at a really important moment where not to be too Pollyannaish about it, but there is a potential win-win here. So feel free to comment on that and also

Doug Lewin (01:05:19.382)

What should I have asked you that I didn't that you'd just like to add? And let our audience know where to find Powerline stuff, where to hear more from you or read the reports, et cetera.

Charles Hua (01:05:29.15)

We've covered a lot of different turf here, so I don't think there's any other questions I would have asked other than why is there a Jordan Love poster on the back of your wall there, which I will give him a shout out. Go pack go.

Doug Lewin (01:05:42.242)

You just lost, we were talking to people in the DFW area, they were excited. They thought you were on their side with their utility and a rate case, and then you had to do that. Maybe we can edit that part out. It's very sensitive down here, Charles.

Charles Hua (01:05:59.886)

But on a more serious note, so I think that's right. mean, I also want to be clear, utilities are very concerned about affordability. know, we can look at the last 15 years in terms of why bills went up even without demand going up. know, second guess, are there things that we should have done differently? I mean, the reality is that ship has tailed. can't go back in time. I mean, that's just unfortunately the reality.

Charles Hua (01:06:26.286)

What again, I think this does call into question is that on a going forward basis, if we're actually motivated to solve this problem, to really take a solutions oriented approach here, the line, the delicate balance of striking all of these priorities around affordability, reliability, and meeting these economic development opportunities, the need for us to thread that needle, that needle is only going to get thinner and thinner in terms of what is the range of

Charles Hua (01:06:54.286)

prudent investments that's going to benefit all of these outcomes. And so what I do think that means is that going forward, especially in this affordability constrained environment, that utilities are, and they are doing this, is taking a closer look at what are the things that are going to benefit these outcomes. But they also need to hear from consumers too, in terms of how their decisions are impacting those very consumers that they're trying to serve. And so I think, you know, to give all stakeholders here some credit,

Charles Hua (01:07:23.83)

I do think on a going forward basis that there are opportunities for more constructive engagement in ways that benefit consumers at the end of the day. But again, we're not, you know, there's still daylight between where we're at now in that regulatory process and system and where we could go. And so what I do think that means though, is on a going forward basis, the role of consumers and making their voices heard in this whole process is going to become more important and also more impactful. so

Charles Hua (01:07:51.744)

If anything, I see all of this as a clarion call for folks to engage. If they haven't engaged before now is the time because there's a broader set of stakeholders that are concerned about these issues. So you won't be alone and you haven't been alone, but you certainly won't be alone going forward. And it's very clear that this is not a blue, red, purple, green issue. This is an issue that impacts everybody. And so all of that is to say that I think.

Charles Hua (01:08:18.029)

that consumers have a key role in modernizing our utility regulatory system, which is what we're all about at Powerlines. And you can find more information about our work, our focus on public utility commissions, our focus on ensuring that consumers are represented in the public utility commissions and the utility regulatory system. You can find all of that at powerlines.org. And please do reach out if you have any questions, you want to get engaged, whether in Texas or elsewhere, but you know, in Texas, you're in good hands with Doug here, but...

Charles Hua (01:08:46.818)

There is a huge need for folks.

Doug Lewin (01:08:48.864)

Yeah, we need more hands. We welcome all the different groups and organizations and people. So do reach out. Sure, reach out to me, but reach out to Charles, too. I think the timing for this organization, Charles, is perfect. You kind of sensed a moment. I think you're doing a great public service with this because there is not enough attention on public utility commissions and utility regulation. It's a really important issue. And you guys are doing a great job of this. So powerlines.org. We'll put some links.

Doug Lewin (01:09:16.298)

in the show notes so people can find you. But yeah, anything else you want to say? Thanks, Charles. I really appreciate it. This was great and looking forward to following your work and continuing to share it through the newsletter and the podcast. And yeah, thanks again.

But before Abdullah could join them, he first had to negotiate a hazard.

Lonyo Street.

Semitrucks roar down Lonyo at all hours, barreling between I-94 and a sprawling complex of truck yards that sandwich this neighborhood.

The trucks could take a slightly longer route to the freeway via Wyoming Street — a few extra minutes, fewer kids, no schools. But they don’t because they don’t have to.

City Council has delayed action on a proposed truck route ordinance for years, despite long-running complaints.

“It’s a shortcut,” said Shaddad Mansoob, Abdullah’s 38-year-old father, who grew up in this neighborhood. Wyoming “is out of the way for (truck drivers). It’s like a few extra minutes, so they don’t want to do that.”

In exchange for those “few extra minutes,” hundreds of children like Abdullah face daily dangers. To play after school, he must cross Lonyo twice: once to drop off his backpack at home and again to get back to the park.

“When trucks drive, the dust goes in my eyes and face,” Abdullah said. “I have to keep looking away, turning around.”

The dust is irritating, but the bigger danger is diesel exhaust — a toxic stew of chemicals linked to respiratory illnesses, heart disease, cancer and thousands of projected deaths nationwide this year.

“Everybody has a respiratory problem over here,” Shaddad said. “I myself have asthma. My kids do.”

“These trucks just add on to the pollution that we already have, which is not right,” he added, pointing to the freeway and nearby industrial zone.

“We pay our taxes, I feel like we should have a decent life here just like all the other neighborhoods.”

Optimism for an ordinance

None of this will come as a surprise to Detroiters. Truck traffic is a fact of life virtually everywhere in the city, from the shipping depots near Lonyo Street to warehouses on the westside and factories on the eastside.

Detroit ranks among the nation’s busiest freight hubs: nearly 128,000 loaded containers entered the city in July alone. A city study tallied an average of 1,600 trucks going in and out of a depot near Lonyo Street every day.

The same study found that 435 trucks per day pass through the intersection — Lonyo and Arnold — that Abdullah crosses to get to school.

The semitruck parade is linked to border trade and local efforts to lure industry to the city. But residents have opposed the traffic pretty much from the start. Trucks are noisy, chew up roads and endanger pedestrians. A semi struck and killed a man weeks ago, not far from where the Mansoobs live.

City officials have promised to do something about the situation for years, but haven’t delivered.

Now the city is trying again, and its leaders insist this time will be different.

Mayor Mike Duggan’s administration is planning to ban trucks from more streets and is drafting an ordinance that could strengthen enforcement of those rules.

Sam Krassenstein, deputy director of the Department of Public Works, said Lonyo is one of several streets that will have new truck restriction signage by the end of the year. He said the city is also considering physically changing streets — by narrowing them, for instance — to discourage truck traffic.

Residents have frequently complained that truck restrictions and signage elsewhere in the city are inadequately enforced and largely ignored.

Key supporters of a truck route ordinance, including City Councilmember Gabriela Santiago-Romero, who represents Southwest Detroit, hope it will pass by the end of this year. Both mayoral candidates have said they’d support an ordinance.

Enforcement poses a thorny challenge. Ticketing trucks might seem like an obvious solution, but shipping companies could have little incentive to change their routes if the tickets go to drivers, many of whom are independent contractors. And the sheer number of trucks could overwhelm enforcement.

“Whatever ordinance we decide to go with, we want to ensure that it has a strong enforcement mechanism … that changes behavior and improves pollution or safety concerns within their neighborhood,” Sheffield said.

Trucking companies with operations near the Mansoobs’ home did not return requests for comment.

‘I wouldn’t live anywhere else’

Shaddad Mansoob says he won’t stop speaking out about truck traffic — and he certainly won’t let it push him out of the neighborhood where he grew up.

His father emigrated to the area from Yemen as a teenager, and Shaddad bought a house here as an adult. His parents live on one side of him, and his sister on the other.

Gesturing down the street, he points out the homes of his cousins, aunts, uncles and siblings. He notes proudly that many residents on his street have been there for 30 years or more. He feels lucky to raise his children in such a tight-knit, kid-friendly community. About a third of residents in his neighborhood are under the age of 18.

It’s why he refuses to leave, despite the truck traffic and pollution.

“I wouldn’t live anywhere else,” he said. “That’s why I want to make this area better for the future children growing up here, for my children.”",https://i0.wp.com/outliermedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LonyoTrucks_20250828CydniElledgeTruckTraffic019.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-09 07:00:06.675640

“It’s not only about renewables,” Ambrose said in an interview with New Private Markets on Monday. “It’s much more about thinking about where the capacity is coming from, from the enormous demand that we’re seeing, and taking a practical approach to what is going to work best.”

The council noted at the meeting a shift to “energy addition” from “energy transition”, fuelled in part by the rise of data centres and artificial intelligence, and the need to create new capacity, rather than just replace existing sources.

“The council is focused on building energy capacity because the demands are overwhelming,” Ambrose said.

In addition, increased manufacturing and industrialisation make many emerging markets attractive investment destinations even before considering the implications of AI, according to Ambrose.

“The demand in Africa is absolutely massive,” she said by way of an example, adding that the continent had “the most growth potential”, with relatively low energy supplies and rapid population growth.

The discussion at the meeting dealt with energy transition and with implementing renewable energy projects, but it also touched upon making natural gas projects more sustainable to meet energy demands, according to Ambrose.

In addition, renewable energy developments involve more than just building a solar power plant or a wind farm. They include transmission, distribution and manufacturing components.

In turn, India, Laos, Indonesia and the Philippines are seeing growing solar manufacturing capacity.
Smirnow emphasised presenting US solar manufacturing as a “national security imperative,” much like has been done with battery energy storage system (BESS) technology.","The presentations focused on solar manufacturing, tariffs and changes to tax credits under the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ (OBBB) Act, compared to the policy framework under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), introduced in 2022.

Ettinger started by emphasising the growth of the US solar manufacturing industry, noting that so far this year, the US has added 8.7GW of solar module capacity, bringing the total to over 58GW of production.

In 2024 and 2025, the US increased its solar cell manufacturing capacity by 2GW. If all scheduled factories become operational in 2025, the total capacity could grow to 12.5GW.

Since the federal manufacturing tax credits were passed, mounting infrastructure production sites have grown by 50%.

Solar to grow ‘out of necessity’

However, the passage of the OBBB Act has undermined this growth. The act has shortened the eligibility timelines for several clean energy projects to receive Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) support. Combined with stricter “start of construction” rules, this is expected to result in the loss of tens of gigawatts of planned solar capacity.

According to the new budget rules, solar projects need to start construction by 4 July 2026, or be operational by the end of 2027, to qualify for the 45E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) or 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) under safe harbour provisions. These incentives have played a significant role in boosting solar deployment and demand in the US.

Smirnow’s presentation began with a sobering message: “Lobbying 101—solar energy’s hot streak comes to an end, natural gas won this round.”

While Ettinger was one of several speakers to make the point that “the industry will continue to grow out of necessity,” Smirnow noted that there would likely be increased competition from natural gas in the coming years.

An imbalanced supply chain

Pierce, meanwhile, noted that upstream component manufacturing has not kept pace with module manufacturing. Module manufacturers mostly rely on imported components, which makes them susceptible to tariffs.

New antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) are forcing manufacturers in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to close or relocate. In turn, India, Laos, Indonesia and the Philippines are seeing growing solar manufacturing capacity.

However, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) recently voted to continue its investigation into imported solar cells from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

According to Pierce’s presentation, the alleged dumping margins for India are 123%, for Indonesia 94%, and for Laos between 123% and 190%.

Pierce concluded her presentation by highlighting that the solar manufacturing industry will continue to be vulnerable to tariff hikes and policy shifts until the US develops a self-sufficient module supply chain, which will take years.

Currently, the US has increasing capacity that is unlikely to become operational, with several projects in wafer, cell, and module manufacturing either cancelled or paused over the next two years. Meanwhile, the forecasted capacity growth is not keeping up with demand.

‘A national security imperative’

However, Pierce’s presentation highlighted that the IRA has led to more than a sixfold increase in US module manufacturing capacity, now surpassing annual installation figures. While this suggests growth may decelerate in 2026, the rate of manufacturing growth in the last three years has been a positive development.

Looking ahead, Smirnow presented potential pathways to success in the US solar industry beyond the OBBB and the IRA. Smirnow emphasised presenting US solar manufacturing as a “national security imperative,” much like has been done with battery energy storage system (BESS) technology.

Furthermore, Smirnow stated that every part of the supply chain must be “healthy,” and that market protection will grow more important as IRA incentives decrease.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pvt.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 06:59:23.283450

Writing the story on India’s renewable energy journey pushed me to use the same materials that I gathered to look at what’s happening in the rest of the world.

The global renewable energy sector has witnessed a dramatic shift in competitive dynamics over the past decade, with India emerging as the fastest-growing major economy in clean energy deployment. While China maintains an insurmountable lead in absolute capacity, India’s exceptional growth trajectory is reshaping the international renewable energy hierarchy and challenging established rankings among the world’s clean energy superpowers.

Note that in this report, with information up to July–August 2025, the US maintains an unsteady second lead, fed by the gains left behind by the Biden administration, when the US renewable energy sector experienced a period of remarkable growth through the end of 2024.

A quick summary of the global renewable race in this one sentence using new renewable electricity generation capacity as the metric: China leads at 64%, the US comes in second with 11%, and the rest of the world combined accounts for the remaining 25%.

China’s commanding lead sets the pace

China continues to dominate the global renewable energy market, with an overwhelming 1,889 GW of installed renewable capacity as of the end of 2024, representing 64% of additional global renewable electricity generation capacity. Note this metric: global renewable electricity generation capacity, or in the parlance of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), new renewable energy capacity additions. This refers to all the new renewable power plants and installations built worldwide in 2024 and is a measure of both growth and new deployment.

This massive infrastructure deployment — nearly four times larger than its closest competitor — has established China not only as the world’s manufacturing hub for renewable technologies, but also as the primary driver of global cost reductions across the solar, wind, and battery storage sectors.

It is good to note that the majority of this growth is concentrated in specific highly industrial regions, but there seems to be no accounting for the small-scale home applications for solar and wind power. If seen from the perspective of global renewable energy additions (that is, projects that are completed and fully or partially operational), China may have more renewable, off-grid wind, solar, and even hydrological energy installations, especially in the upper regions of the country.

If data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) Photovoltaic Power Systems Program (PVPS) is to be used, at the end of 2022, China’s cumulative installed off-grid solar capacity was approximately 360 MW, representing a tiny fraction of China’s massive total solar capacity, which was nearly 393 GW at the time. However, based on the same data source, if the off-grid systems increased 22% annually as predicted, the number would be 640.5 MW by now. This is speculative because there isn’t data to back it up. And the figure seems small. However, there are clear policy directions increasingly focused on distributed solar, which includes both off-grid and small-scale grid-connected systems, particularly in rural areas.

The “Whole County PV” pilot program is a prime example of this strategy, aiming to install solar on rooftops of public buildings and homes. This has led to a significant increase in sales of smaller solar panels and components.

Then there is hydropower, geothermal, concentrated solar, and so on. All are aimed at cutting China’s dependence on fossil fuels, which ironically still powers the world’s largest EV market.

The scale of China’s renewable infrastructure creates a tier of leadership that remains unchallenged. However, the competition for secondary positions has intensified dramatically, with emerging economies demonstrating that rapid renewable deployment is achievable at scale.

United States unsteady in second

The United States holds a loose grip on second place with 388 GW of renewable capacity, accounting for 11% of global renewable electricity production. American renewable expansion has been bolstered significantly by the Inflation Reduction Act stimulus, which is projected to more than triple clean energy production by 2030.

The US solar sector demonstrated robust growth in 2024, with installed capacity expanding by 27.5% through the addition of 38,265 MW. This consistent expansion, combined with strong wind power development, positions the United States as a stable force in the global renewable energy market, though its growth rate remains modest compared to emerging economy competitors.

A combination of new and oftentimes unsteady federal policies under the Trump administration has led to market uncertainty, which has in turn led to a decline in investment and a slowdown in capacity additions. According to data from BloombergNEF, US investment in renewable energy declined by $20.5 billion in the first half of 2025 compared to the second half of 2024. This represents a 36% drop whereas the rest of the world is growing at an average of 15.1%.

The future growth of renewables in the US appears to be increasingly dependent on the balance between federal policy decisions and the continued momentum of state-level initiatives and market-driven factors like the cost-competitiveness of renewables.

India’s explosive growth

I added this section on India not that it came in third, but also because it is perhaps the most compelling story in the global clean energy sector. With 203 GW of current renewable capacity representing 46.3% of the country’s total installed power generation, India has achieved what many analysts consider the most rapid large-scale energy transition in modern history.

The numbers illustrate India’s exceptional momentum: annual renewable capacity additions are increasing faster than in any other major economy, with recent growth rates reaching 35% year-over-year. In the first half of 2024, India captured more than half of all global competitive auction volumes alongside Germany, demonstrating the maturity and scale of its renewable energy market.

India’s solar sector exemplifies this rapid expansion, growing from 9.01 GW in 2016 to 97.86 GW by January 2025 — a ten-fold increase that outpaces all major economies. This growth trajectory positions India to potentially overtake Brazil in total renewable capacity and challenge the United States’ second-place ranking within the current decade.

European leadership in market innovation

Once, Europe established itself as a global frontrunner in renewable energy, a position it has secured through ambitious policy frameworks like the European Green Deal and the REPowerEU plan. Note that based on various research, China overtook Europe in the global renewable energy race via rapid developments, massive population requirements, and provincial incentives that allow for almost independent energy development.

However, EU+EFTA+UK initiatives have been instrumental in driving consistent growth, with renewables generating nearly half of the EU’s net electricity in 2024. While the continent is committed to a diverse mix of clean energy sources, its long-term strategy heavily relies on offshore wind, a sector in which it has demonstrated decades of technological leadership. The North Sea, in particular, is seen as a strategic hub for this technology, with the EU setting a goal of 40 GW of ocean energy by 2050.

However, Europe’s offshore wind sector is currently navigating significant challenges that have led to a slowdown in development and the cancellation of some key projects. A major contributing factor is the prevailing macroeconomic environment, with high inflation, rising interest rates, and soaring raw material costs pushing project expenses up by as much as 60%.

This economic pressure has made many projects financially unviable, causing developers to withdraw from auctions. Furthermore, the industry is grappling with pervasive regulatory and permitting delays, as complex bureaucratic processes can take years to resolve and introduce substantial financial risk. The sector also faces intensified global competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers, and a reliance on vulnerable supply chains for critical components. These issues, combined with flawed auction designs that have incentivized unsustainably low bids, have created a difficult environment for offshore wind, highlighting the complexities of building a large-scale, capital-intensive renewable energy grid.

Japan’s place in renewable energy

Japan is making progress in renewable energy, but it remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Following the Fukushima disaster, Japan shifted away from nuclear power, which led to a massive increase in its reliance on imported fossil fuels to meet its energy needs. The country’s current energy strategy seeks to rebalance this mix by significantly increasing both renewables and nuclear energy.

In 2024, renewables supplied 26.7 percent of the country’s electricity, up from 25.7 percent in 2023. Solar accounted for 11.4 percent, hydropower 7.9 percent, and biomass 5.9 percent, while wind and geothermal contributed marginally. Including nuclear power, low-carbon sources made up roughly one-third of generation.

Clean electricity output reached about 322 terawatt-hours in 2024, and the first half of 2025 delivered 188 terawatt-hours, up 47 percent from 2019. Despite these gains, fossil fuels still provide nearly 70 percent of supply.

Government strategy calls for renewables to reach 36–38 percent by 2030 and 40–50 percent by 2040, with offshore wind identified as a critical growth area. Market opportunities remain strongest in solar, biomass, and offshore wind, as Japan positions itself to meet long-term emissions reduction targets while balancing energy security and cost.

This deserves a totally different story on it own soon.

ASEAN’s share

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is making notable strides in its renewable energy transition, driven by ambitious regional targets and a surge in clean energy investments. The region aims to have renewables account for 23% of its primary energy supply by 2025 under the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC).

This growth is most pronounced in countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, where strategic national policies and abundant resources have fueled a rapid expansion of solar, wind, and geothermal capacity. Despite this progress, ASEAN’s energy landscape remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with a significant portion of its electricity still generated from coal and natural gas.

However, the region faces considerable challenges that could hinder a more rapid and widespread transition. The uncoordinated deployment of new renewable energy projects has strained outdated grid infrastructure, leading to power curtailment and supply issues. Additionally, policy and regulatory frameworks across many member states are often inconsistent and can still favor fossil fuels, creating uncertainty for investors and deterring private capital. To overcome these hurdles, there is a growing consensus on the need for enhanced regional cooperation, particularly through the ASEAN Power Grid initiative, and increased investment in modern technologies like energy storage to ensure a more resilient and sustainable clean energy future.

Did we forget Australia & Africa?

Not at all. Due to the interest of deadline and incoming sources of information, Africa’s complete information is difficult to gather because it is a continent of 57 countries and of different levels of development.

Australia, on the other hand, is a single country continent whose electricity generation presents a mixed but rapidly evolving picture. Coal still accounts for 43–45% of electricity generation, while natural gas contributes 17% and oil just 2%. However, the renewable energy sector has achieved remarkable growth, with solar power now generating 20% of Australia’s electricity. Wind and other renewable sources contribute approximately 15%, bringing the total renewable share to around 35% of electricity generation.

Australia’s solar achievement is particularly striking. In October 2024, the country generated a record-breaking 25% of its electricity from solar power during peak generation periods. This represents an extraordinary shift from the turn of the millennium, when Australia derived more than 80% of its electricity from coal. Today, that figure has dropped to less than 50%, demonstrating the rapid pace of the energy transition. The country also operates without any nuclear power generation, making it unique among developed nations.

Global energy geopolitics

The competitive dynamics emerging from these renewable capacity rankings carry significant implications for global energy geopolitics. The developing nations are still challenged with traditional assumptions about energy leadership being primarily the domain of developed economies or resource-rich nations.

The data suggests a fundamental shift in how countries achieve energy security and international influence. Rather than relying on fossil fuel exports or imports, nations are increasingly competing on their ability to deploy clean energy infrastructure rapidly and cost-effectively.

Current trends indicate the global renewable energy hierarchy will continue evolving rapidly. While China’s leadership appears secure for the foreseeable future, the competition for secondary positions remains dynamic. India’s growth trajectory suggests potential to reach 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, which would significantly narrow the gap with current leaders.

This competitive transformation demonstrates that the global renewable energy sector rewards rapid deployment, technological adoption, and policy innovation more than traditional energy market advantages. As India continues its exceptional expansion, the renewable energy leadership rankings are likely to experience continued disruption, with emerging economies increasingly challenging established energy powers on the foundation of clean technology deployment speed and scale.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CleanEnergyAIM.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 09:01:43.564471

Volkswagen unveiled four small EV models from its namesake VW brand, as well as its Cupra and Skoda marques.

With starting prices of around 25,000 euros ($29,000), lower than many current EVs made by European manufacturers, their commercial launch is set for next year.

But at a press event at the IAA Mobility show, which runs the whole of this week, CEO Oliver Blume conceded that VW faced a tough fight.

""The automotive industry, and especially the Volkswagen group, has never faced so many headwinds at the same time,"" he said.

And he conceded that the situation in China, where VW has lost market share to local rivals, was highly competitive.

BYD ""without a doubt is doing a great job there,"" he said.

- Resistance to EU ban -

BYD meanwhile announced that its Dolphin Surf electric compact car, already on sale in Europe since May for around 20,000 euros, will be produced from the end of 2025 in its new Hungarian factory.

""We are almost ready to build our cars in Europe, for Europe,"" said the manufacturer's executive vice president Stella Li.

Building its cars in Hungary, an European Union country, should help the Chinese manufacturer avoid hefty EU tariffs the bloc has slapped on Chinese-made EVs over what Brussels says are unfair state subsidies.

Germany's top automakers have all suffered in recent times due to weak demand and fierce competition in key market China, where BYD and others have eroded their sales.

They have struggled with the shift to EVs as demand has proven weaker in Europe than many had anticipated and prices remain too high for many motorists.

Calls have meanwhile been growing for the EU to review a plan to end sales of new combustion engine vehicles by 2035 as part of efforts to tackle climate change.

Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep and Fiat, as well as BMW and Mercedes have all expressed scepticism or outright opposition to the plan.

Volkswagen's Blume added his voice to the criticism on Monday, saying that it was ""unrealistic"" to aim for ""100% electric mobility"" in a decade.

""We need reality checks every year,"" he said.

The average cost per kilowatt-hour in Alabama increased from $11.70 in 2015 to $14.63 in 2023.

Alabama Power has implemented three rate increases since 2020, including a recent increase approved for mid-2027.

Power costs have been on the rise in Alabama faster than most of the country, new data shows.

Texas Electricity Ratings, a site that primarily provides resources about Texas electricity companies, ran a study that surveyed utility costs between 2015 and 2023 nationwide.

Using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy, a ranking was created with all 50 states based on the average cost per kilowatt-hour to see which states had the largest increases.

Alabama ranked No. 17 on the list, with the Yellowhammer state seeing a 25% increase in power costs from 2015 to 2023. The average kWh cost in Alabama in 2023 was $14.63, compared to $11.70 in 2015.

“For the majority of states, the biggest increases that consumers have faced came during the more recent years of 2021, 2022 and 2023,"" said Texas Electricty Ratings CEO Karl Trollinger. ""Before that, energy costs didn’t increase significantly and even decreased slightly at times.”

Alabama Power follows that trend with three increases since 2020, the Alabama Reflector reported. When the company acquired other power plants in 2020 and 2022, the rate increased by $5 per month to offset those purchases.

The third expected increase was only recently made public. As of Aug. 5, Alabama Power said Alabamians who use their services can expect a $3.32 increase in mid-2027 per month to offset the impact of purchasing a power plant in Autauga County, the Alabama Reflector reported.

The study noted that low-income households are especially vulnerable to rising costs, as about 6% of their income is spent on electricity, which is more than three times what higher-income groups pay.

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
“However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said.","Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said.

Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.

The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.

Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.

While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.

“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”

According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.

In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.

Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.

Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.

The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.

In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.

But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.

Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.

“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”

In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.

While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.

“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.

Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.

In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.

One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.

“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”

In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.

Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.

However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.

“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.

Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)

“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”

Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.

Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.

Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.

Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.

A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.

Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.

“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.

At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.

State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.

Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.

“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”

Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.

While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.

“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”

Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.

“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 06:01:40.661013

Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization — which is the country’s largest miner of critical minerals — signed a memorandum of understanding with Missouri-based U.S. Strategic Metals for collaboration plans that include setting up a poly-metallic refinery in Pakistan.

The deal comes after Washington and Islamabad last month reached a trade agreement that Pakistan hoped would attract American investment in its minerals and oil reserves.

U.S. Strategic Metals is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the U.S. Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.

A second agreement was signed between the National Logistics Corp of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a Portuguese engineering and construction company.

A statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he held talks with the delegation from U.S. Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths, and other mineral resources.

The sides expressed readiness to develop value-added facilities, enhance mineral processing capacity, and undertake large-scale projects tied to mining, the statement said.

“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan said in a statement: “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”

Earlier this year, Sharif claimed that Pakistan possesses mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and foreign investment in the mineral sector could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and free itself from the burden of massive foreign loans.

Most of Pakistan’s mineral wealth is located in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

In August, the U.S. State Department had designated the Balochistan National Army separatist group and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organization.

Oil and minerals reserves have also been found in the southern Sindh, eastern Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan.

Why: Addressing America’s critical clean energy workforce crisis

The United States faces an unprecedented challenge: a 3.3 million worker shortage by 2030 in the clean energy sector, just as the nation embarks on its largest energy infrastructure transformation in modern history. The $2 trillion investment driven by the Inflation Reduction Act and private sector commitments is creating massive opportunities in offshore wind, solar energy, grid modernization, and energy storage—but these opportunities risk being constrained by the lack of skilled workers.

The crisis by the numbers:

500,000 offshore wind technicians needed as the industry scales from pilot projects to commercial deployment

1.2 million solar installation specialists required for distributed and utility-scale development

800,000 grid modernization technicians for smart infrastructure deployment

2.5x higher fatality rates in energy sector work compared to national average

40% of utility workers eligible for retirement within the next decade, threatening critical knowledge loss

Traditional training methods—classroom instruction and lengthy apprenticeships—cannot scale to meet these demands within the required timeline while ensuring absolute safety in high-risk environments where mistakes can be fatal.

The electric and natural gas utilities listed in the tracker, and the associated increases in rates, were identified through online filings by utilities and records of decisions in state public utilities commission (PUC) dockets. The list includes rate increases that went into effect January 2025 onwards. The list is not comprehensive and will be periodically updated with additional rate increases from across the country.

Each state’s public utility commission has different requirements for reporting data related to rate increases, bill impacts, distributional impacts, monthly increases, and justification for increases. The number of customers—including residential, commercial, industrial, etc.— affected by rate increases, column D, was collected as reported directly on utilities’ websites, in investor presentations, or in press releases. In some instances, rate increases affected only a portion of the customer base in a utility’s service territory and was reported by the utility through press releases or in the docket filings.

The time periods for increases, column E, were collected using utilities’ press releases, webpages, and docket filings from public utilities commissions. The time periods for increases fell into three categories: 1) increase in annual revenues, in which utilities did not specify a time period for the rate increase and instead requested or were approved to increase their annual revenue requirements until the next time the utility files and is approved for additional revenues; 2) specific time periods, in which single-year, part-year, and multiyear periods were explicitly mentioned in filing documents, press releases, or utility webpages; or 3) calendar years, such as 2025 or 2026. Some utilities did not specify whether the rate increase was annual or for a specific time period. The authors used the best available information from the utility to assign a time period.

The effective date and status for rate increases, columns I and J, respectively, were also collected using utility press releases, utility and PUC webpages, and docket filings. In most cases, authors were able to identify a specific date, month, or year from which a rate increase would be effective. In some instances, the request for a rate increase was ongoing and did not specify an effective date. The authors made a conservative estimate based on available information including expected decision dates or expected effective dates, such as “early 2026” or “second half of 2026,” to adopt an effective date.

The total revenue increase in column F was calculated based on revenue increases reported by utility websites or press releases, in news articles only when provided with a direct quote from a utility spokesperson, or from docket filings. The total revenue numbers include additional revenues to be recovered from all customer classes including residential, commercial, and industrial. Not all utilities reported an increase in revenue as a result of increased utility prices, and not all utilities reported monthly average bill impacts even when there was an increase in revenue and/or rate of return.

Since the time periods for revenue increases were not aligned across utilities, the authors calculated an estimated total additional revenue generated starting in January 2025 through the end of 2028, assuming that rates remained steady after the covered period. This methodology likely results in an underestimate of revenues for the time period because utilities often file for additional rate recovery to begin in the next cycle after the covered period, thus increasing utilities’ revenues beyond what authors estimated. Revenue estimates were calculated using the additional revenues reported by the utilities, the time period for increase (column E), and effective date for increase (column I). The time period for implementation of most revenue increases is before December 31, 2028, and the authors assumed that revenue increases during the effective time period for an increase continued until the end of 2028. Revenue increases prior to 2025 were not included in the totals. In cases where the implementation period stopped before December 31, 2028, revenues were prorated for the remainder of the four-year time period in order to standardize the data. For example, Ameren Missouri was approved for additional annual revenues of $355 million effective starting September 2025. To estimate the total revenue through the end of 2028, authors assumed an annual increase of $355 million for each year starting September 2025 through September 2028, and then calculated partial revenues for the remaining four months in 2028 at the rate of $355 million per year.

The monthly percentage increase (column G) and the dollar amount increase (column H) to the average residential bill were collected through utility webpages, press releases, news articles only when they included a direct quote from a utility spokesperson, or from docket filings. In the case of multiyear increases, when utilities reported multiple increases to residential bills through the time period, authors reported the total increase in monthly bills, when available. When percentage increases were not reported, but the appropriate data were available, authors calculated a percentage increase across the relevant time periods.

The authors prioritized using primary sources for the revenue increase, monthly increases, time periods, and effective dates. In some instances, these values were not publicly reported by the utility or the PUC and are labeled as “N/A.” The authors note that this does not necessarily mean that there is no associated increase in revenues, customer bills, etc., but represents a lack of public data from the utility or PUC.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/cap_utility_rates_tracker_share.png,N,,2025-09-09 06:01:44.847678

From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program.
“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director.
But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.
In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch.","Talia Boyd was spending over $300 a month to keep her home just outside Asheville, North Carolina, cool this summer. It was an enormous sum for the single-wide trailer she shares with her baby daughter and teenage son.

“We constantly kept ceiling fans going, and I had to get AC units,” she said — multiple ones that ran 24/7 to replace the cold air seeping out from gaps around the windows.

But now, the air leaks have been sealed, a door has been replaced, and a new heat pump has been installed — all at no cost to Boyd. Her monthly utility bill from Duke Energy has been cut in half, she said.

The improvements are thanks to Energy Savers Network, a small nonprofit that serves Buncombe County, where Boyd lives, along with neighboring counties Henderson, Haywood, and Madison.

“They really came out and they helped,” said Boyd, who works in home health care. “They talked. They took measurements. They walked through the whole trailer. I really appreciate the help, and I would love to spread the word.”

Boyd’s home is among the roughly 1,400 that Energy Savers Network has assisted with weatherization since its inception in late 2016. Across the state in the same time frame, thousands of other households have received similar services, mostly from community action agencies deploying federal dollars.

But Boyd’s story is somewhat unique. She’s in a smaller subset of people who’ve benefited from a Duke initiative meant not just to aid the energy burdened in times of crisis, but to permanently reduce their electricity use through home efficiency improvements.

And with politicians at the state and national levels turning against the clean energy transition in low-income communities and elsewhere, Boyd’s experience is rare good news that advocates hope can continue to be replicated.

From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency

Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program. Part of a side deal the utility struck in 2023 to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the program offers a monthly credit of up to $42 on bills for households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four.

In 2024, Duke began automatically providing the credit to any customers who’d benefited in the prior year from one of two buckets of federal aid: the Crisis Intervention Program, designed to prevent or reverse life-threatening emergencies like utility shutoffs, or the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which offers one-time payments to help households with heating bills.

North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services manages the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then enrolls customers in its program — a process that has minimized administrative expenses such as vetting participants for eligibility.

And though in its first year the bill assistance benefited less than half the number of households forecast, experts say that’s because funding for the two buckets of federal aid dropped, not because the need isn’t great. Advocates remain bullish about the prospect for Duke to serve 100,000 customers or more annually.

Totaling over $500 for a year, the bill credit alone is vital for families struggling to make ends meet, aid groups say.

But Boyd’s case demonstrates the full potential of the Customer Assistance Program: Virtually every household receiving help gets referred to a local entity that can assess homes and perform free efficiency upgrades, reducing energy burdens beyond the 12 months of financial aid.

""I’m very impressed with Duke""

The brainchild and passion project of former financial and utility consultant Brad Rouse, Energy Savers has undergone a few iterations over its nine years of existence. Its throughline is providing energy-efficiency retrofits, usually in a day’s time, via a team of volunteers guided by a professional.

When everything is running smoothly, that means the group can perform upgrades — such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks — for at least three homes a week, according to Rouse. But in its early years, Energy Savers sometimes struggled to meet that mark.

“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director. If they were last-minute, the group didn’t always have a backup client ready to take advantage of assembled volunteers and staff. In that case, Rouse said, “we lose the day.”

But now, the organization has almost eliminated that problem. “The Duke Customer Assistance referral is one big reason why,” he said.

That’s because the utility sends so many referrals that it’s easier to find clients who will be ready by the time the Energy Savers team arrives, reducing the likelihood of cancellations. And when a client does fall through, there’s a waiting list ready to be tapped.

The group identifies households in need through multiple channels, including farmers markets, community events, and word of mouth. But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.

“We send out a bulk mailing to [potential clients] first and then we try to follow up with phone calls to get them scheduled,” Rausch said.

Boyd, for instance, first got help paying her utility bills through Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry, which accessed one of the federal crisis assistance funds for her. She was soon enrolled in Duke’s $42 bill-credit program and then referred to Energy Savers. “They popped up at my doorstep,” Boyd said.

In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch. So far, 36 of those referred families have made it through the weatherization process.

“I'm very impressed with Duke at this point,” Rausch said. The utility, which funds the majority of the services provided by Energy Savers, always makes sure the group gets reimbursed, she said. “We've never been stuck with the bill.”

To be sure, Duke and advocates for low-income customers are still working out kinks in the bill-credit scheme. One challenge is waning funding for the two federal crisis assistance initiatives that are used to automatically enroll individuals in the Customer Assistance Program. Another hurdle is connecting the dots for recipients, who often don’t realize they’re getting the bill credit or that they’re getting referred to groups like Energy Savers.

Most of all, advocates are mindful that the Customer Assistance Program is in the middle of a three-year pilot phase, and they want to extend it one way or another — as a feature of Duke’s next three-year rate increase, as a condition of the merger of the company’s two North Carolina utilities, or as part of some other case before state regulators.

Boyd knows as well as advocates that the need for long-lasting energy savings is substantial. She’s now trying to get help for her 93-year-old Aunt Viola, whose electricity bill tops $400 a month.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aqyz9Nov9u0JTlLqWAjkLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/6eb56d174159d273972bf0e7e50c1505,N,,2025-09-09 06:02:12.803781

About Lloyd’s Register Foundation","Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and Lloyd's Register Maritime Decarbonisation Hub (Decarb Hub), a partnership between Lloyd’s Register Group and Lloyd’s Register Foundation, have today published Navigating the Net-Zero Transition - exploring innovative concepts to close the trillion-plus investment gap threatening the sector's climate goals. The report, which builds on two years of research, presents insights across the maritime value chain leveraging over 40 interviews with shipowners, financiers, fuel developers, insurers, academics and NGOs, in response to warnings that shipping emissions could reach 130% of 2008 levels by 2050 without adequate funding.

""Without strong action, emissions from maritime shipping are projected to rise, putting the sector far off track to transition away from fossil fuels by 2050,” said Guillaume Morauw, Sustainable Finance Senior Policy Analyst at Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the report.

Maritime shipping plays a unique role in the global economy, carrying nearly 80% of global trade and being the 6th largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions globally, which makes the sector’s decarbonisation challenge especially acute. The sheer capital expenditure intensity of ships and fuel infrastructure creates major financing needs to achieve the sector’s transition away from fossil fuels. Recent progress to tackle harmful emissions, including the International Maritime Organization’s approval of a framework that would make maritime shipping the first sector to pay a price on emissions, risks stalling without sufficient support from public and private financiers.

“Additional, innovative mechanisms to de-risk projects and channel capital at scale are essential. By backing energy-saving retrofits, the lending platform helps shipowners cut emissions and mitigate transition risks, while giving financiers a practical way to make an impact and decarbonise their portfolios,” added Morauw.

Investors' climate ambitions can often clash with shipping's realities of high baseline emissions and limited zero-emission options. This disconnect is already evident: a survey from 2023 states that senior finance professionals contemplate divesting from maritime due to ESG risks, ultimately making affordable capital harder to secure especially for smaller shipowners.

Financiers remain cautious about one of the toughest industries to decarbonise, while scaling zero- and near-zero emission fuel projects demands huge capital expenditure, in some cases up to $2 billion for infrastructure, storage and terminal facilities.

“These challenges are evident in the lack of communication between shipping and infrastructure finance, despite their interdependence. To overcome this, fuel procurement strategies must evolve, and bold collaboration across the maritime value chain is critical,” said Dana Rodriguez, Programme Manager at The Decarb Hub and report co-author.

The report explores three concepts to help unlock investments by de-risking projects, broadening access to affordable capital and showing the wider benefits of decarbonisation:

Maritime Multiplier: a carbon accounting tool that quantifies the supply-chain benefits of investing in cleaner ships. It shows how shipping decarbonisation can deliver “cascading” emissions reductions across multiple sectors and investor portfolios.

Lending Platform for Energy Efficiency: a blended-finance platform pooling retrofit projects to lower risk, build market maturity and expand access to affordable capital in particular for smaller shipowners. It focuses on energy-saving technologies to cut emissions in the near term and reduce transition risks.

Time Stacked Offtake (TSO): reshapes clean fuel contracts by breaking long-term offtake agreements into shorter, stackable tranches. This gives buyers more flexibility while providing fuel developers with revenue certainty. TSO could be managed by fuel producers, development banks or coalitions such as the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA).

""Silos are holding back shipping's transition. Finance and shipping must meet in the middle to deliver a sustainable and affordable transition,” added Rodriguez.

Next Phase: Collaboration and Pilot Projects

EDF and the Decarb Hub are now inviting feedback from stakeholders to help refine the concepts and move them toward commercial viability. They also invite partners - including banks, shipowners, fuel developers and public finance institutions - to take part in pilot projects that put these ideas into practice. The report’s findings will be shared at a closed meeting during London International Shipping Week on 15 September.

The slowdown in installations is shown in the graph above, with annual capacity additions, across all sectors, in yellow.
Indeed, capacity additions in utility-scale and residential solar were down both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.
Solar and storage account for 82% of all capacity additions Despite this slowdown in capacity additions, solar continues to be a key part of new US power generation additions, particularly alongside batteries.
Wind was responsible for a further 17%, leaving all other technology types, including all fossil fuels, to account for just 5% of new capacity additions in the first half of the year.","The rate of new capacity additions has also slowed notably, with 7.5GW of new capacity added in the second quarter of this year, down 28% from the previous quarter, and down 24% from the same period of the previous year.

The trade association places much of the blame for this slowdown in deployment on the Trump administration, particularly the passage of the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’, which has shortened the timeframe for which renewable energy projects can benefit from tax credits guaranteed by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

A report from sustainable finance company Crux, published in June, said that uncertainty regarding timelines and eligibility for these tax credits could create “higher costs of capital” in US solar, and make investors less willing to support new projects.

As a result, SEIA is starting to revise down some of its forecasts for US solar deployment to the end of 2030. The trade association now expects 2025 capacity additions to fall below the record 50GW installations reported in 2025, which would mark the first time US capacity installations have fallen year-on-year since 2021-2022.

SEIA’s most cautious forecast for deployment figures by 2030, compared to predictions made before the passage of the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’, estimate the US installing 55GW less new solar capacity by the end of the decade, a 21% decline. Indeed, SEIA expects the US to install more than 40GW of new capacity only twice between 2026 and the end of the decade – in 2026 and 2027 – and for year-on-year capacity additions to fall each year from 2027 to 2030.

The slowdown in installations is shown in the graph above, with annual capacity additions, across all sectors, in yellow. Indeed, capacity additions in utility-scale and residential solar were down both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.

The US added 5.7GW of utility-scale solar in the second quarter of this year, a 33% quarter-on-quarter decline, while the residential sector added just over 1GW of new capacity, a 3% decline from the first quarter of the year. However, SEIA notes that the commercial sector performed better, adding 585MW of new capacity in the second quarter of the year, a 27% increase over the same period of 2024 and a record for second quarter additions in this sector.

The SEIA-Wood Mackenzie report also notes that the cost of solar installations continues to fall; the cost of installing an “average-sized” residential system has fallen from around US$40,000 in 2010 to around US$26,880 today. SEIA president and CEO, Abigail Ross Hopper, said solar has “the lowest cost to families and businesses” among power generation technologies, and the competitive prices of solar installations have long been an attractive component of the industry.

However, the graph also shows that, in the last decade, the rate of price declines has fallen, with all three sectors profiled showing price increases in recent years.

Indeed, between 2025 and the first half of 2025, the average price of a PV system has increased in all three sectors – utility-scale, commercial and residential – reflecting the growing cost of solar amid continuing market and policy uncertainty.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardising the reliability of our electric grid,” added Hopper.

Solar and storage account for 82% of all capacity additions

Despite this slowdown in capacity additions, solar continues to be a key part of new US power generation additions, particularly alongside batteries. The SEIA-Wood Mackenzie report notes that, in the first half of 2025, solar accounted for a record 69% of all new generating capacity additions, the largest proportion accounted for by any single technology in any year since 2010.

Storage systems accounted for 13% of new capacity additions in the first half of the year, pushing solar and storage’s combined contributions to new US energy additions to 82%, a shade under the record 84% set by these technologies last year. Wind was responsible for a further 17%, leaving all other technology types, including all fossil fuels, to account for just 5% of new capacity additions in the first half of the year.

SEIA notes that, between 2023 and 2024, the percentage of residential solar projects co-located with battery energy storage systems (BESS) more than doubled from 12% to 28%. Much of this has been driven by the passage of the net energy metering (NEM 3.0) scheme in California.

While the bill has drawn criticism for dissuading investments in standalone residential solar, the effects on the storage sector are evident; between October 2023 and April 2024, the rate of residential systems installed with batteries increased from just over 20% to just over 50%.

Considering the role that batteries can play in providing grid-forming services, and reducing some of the variance in renewable power generation that has historically been unattractive for potential investors, the continued growth of the storage sector in the US could be critical to add certainty back to the US energy transition.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/desri.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 05:00:51.776522

Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.
Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Getting a gas supply there would also require building a new pipeline or using trains, both of which are extremely expensive.

In recent years, however, left-leaning politicians on both sides have worked to reduce fossil fuel dependence and accelerate the transition to clean energy.

The political winds changed with the return of Donald Trump, who views attempts to shift to renewables as premature and bad policy. Instead, he is renewing U.S. investment in oil and gas.

Meanwhile, Canada’s energy program has entered a new phase. Prime Minister Mark Carney has broken from Justin Trudeau’s cautious stance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to embrace a more diversified approach that includes critical minerals, clean energy, nuclear, hydro resources, and LNG export ambitions on both the East and West Coasts.

“Our government is in the process of releasing half a trillion dollars of investment in energy infrastructure, port infrastructure,” Carney said in Europe recently. “Some of the examples … will include reinforcing and building on the Port of Montreal, Contrecoeur; a new port, effectively, in Churchill, Manitoba, which would open up enormous LNG plus other opportunities.”

These East Coast plans complement projects already underway on the West Coast, reflecting what Carney told Trump at the G7 in June: He aims to make Canada “an energy superpower.”

Canada’s new East Coast LNG ambitions are ramping up just as Europe looks to diversify its energy supply and find alternatives to Russian imports. The big question is whether Canada can establish this export capability in time to capitalize on the wave of European demand, and if so, whether it could challenge Trump’s plans for U.S. energy dominance.

Energy flows

The U.S. already has eight LNG terminals — mostly on the Gulf Coast — exporting to Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Trump has aspirations for several more, including one for Alaska. This last one remains in the planning and development phase, but if successful, it would be the first major LNG export hub on the U.S. West Coast.

Canada currently has just one operational large-scale LNG terminal, in Kitimat, B.C., which came online earlier this year. A couple more West Coast terminals are under construction, and there’s a proposal to build a floating liquefaction and export facility. Targeting Asian markets, West Coast Canadian LNG exports could rival U.S. Gulf Coast exports — which traverse the Panama Canal — with shorter, more direct routes.

Since much of Canada’s natural gas supply is concentrated in B.C. and Alberta, and because pipelines are not in place coast to coast, eastern projects have been slower to develop. But now, planning is underway for a $15 billion facility off Newfoundland’s coast by Fermeuse Energy, including a nearly 400-kilometre pipeline. The New Brunswick government and energy partners, meanwhile, are discussing a possible LNG export terminal at Saint John, which might include a pipeline to Quebec. Finally, Carney has suggested that the Port of Churchill, the country’s sole Arctic deepwater port connected by rail, could be upgraded for LNG.

European leaders are thrilled by the prospect of Canadian LNG exports. Faced with an aggressive Russia, they are phasing out Russian oil, gas, and nuclear energy imports by the end of 2027. Export competition from the East Coast could mean better global competition and lower prices.

“Europe would like some redundancy,” says Heather Exner-Pirot, a senior fellow and director of Energy, Natural Resources and Environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

“Right now, they have to depend on the United States. If you’re a European country, you would like to have diversity of supply.”

Courting Europeans

For Europe, getting LNG from Canada, rather than the U.S. Gulf Coast, would mean getting shipments faster and, potentially, with a lower emissions profile.

Dulles Wang, director for Wood Mackenzie’s Americas gas and LNG research team, points to the shorter sailing distances and notes that Canada’s “upstream regulation is more stringent around flaring.” This could make Canadian LNG exports more politically palatable than those from the U.S.

Still, Canadian LNG faces plenty of challenges. While LNG shipping from places like the Arctic is “politically popular” at the moment, said Exner-Pirot, it doesn’t necessarily make sense. As it is a seasonal port, not year-round, lucrative LNG shipping would require too many ice-breaking capabilities to make the effort worthwhile, she explained. Getting a gas supply there would also require building a new pipeline or using trains, both of which are extremely expensive.

“Politicians and the public sector are pushing this port. It’s not the private sector lining up for this,” she said. “No one’s going to pay the price that it takes to develop our minerals and our energy in the Arctic.”

Other potential eastern projects also face obstacles, from gas supply and local or environmental opposition to permitting hurdles and prohibitively expensive builds.

Sourcing gas has long been the central problem for Canada’s eastern energy projects. Experts note that while earlier proposals included piping natural gas all the way from the West, which was prohibitively costly and faced political and environmental resistance in Quebec, newer ideas for offshore reserves require expensive pipelines buried under the sea.

“To bring a pipeline from those offshore fields to onshore through Iceberg Alley is still something I haven’t seen that’s fully been de-risked,” said Mark Oberstoetter, Wood Mackenzie’s head of Americas upstream research.

Ports like Saint John, meanwhile, could handle LNG exports but don’t have a reliable supply, and while shale gas resources exist in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, they are blocked by provincial fracking bans.

Also, while LNG projects have First Nations’ support in Manitoba, they’re met with more opposition from Indigenous groups in other parts of eastern Canada.

And even if all the political, permitting, and funding hurdles were overcome, Mother Nature would still get a say with her long winters. The colder months place estimated build times for LNG projects at between seven and 10 years – more than twice as long as projects in the U.S. South.

That lag time could hurt Canada’s ability to woo Europe, where policymakers still cling to the ambition of a quick clean-energy transition – while some still hope for cheaper Russian supply returning someday with a normalization of relations.

These concerns mean Europe has refused to sign long-term LNG contracts with North American LNG suppliers.

“If you ask Europeans, they’re firmly convinced that they will complete their transition to low-carbon fuel sources,” said Brigham A. McCown, a senior fellow and director of the Initiative on American Energy Security at Hudson Institute.

“I don’t think that’s going to happen,” McCown added. “I think it’s naive at best to assume that’s going to occur, simply because it’s too expensive.”

But there is also a question of supply and demand. While Wood Mackenzie expects the world’s demand for natural gas to grow by up to 80 per cent by 2050 — other groups pin it closer to 20 to 35 per cent — the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis has warned that increasing LNG export capacity could lead to a supply glut before 2030.

This means long-term investment in LNG exportation could be risky.

Making waves in Washington?

Trump is unlikely to care much about Carney’s attempts to export LNG from the Arctic, says Exner-Pirot, because “it’s not a threat.”

“The amount you’d be able to move out of there would be so minimal.”

But wooing investment to other LNG projects on the East Coast is another story. “We’re competing with the United States for investment,” she explained, “so it absolutely does not help the United States or Trump for LNG investment to find its way to Canada.”

There is already concern over LNG Canada beginning to directly compete with established exporters like the U.S. Gulf Coast and Russian projects for Asian LNG sales, so U.S. companies eyeing European LNG market dominance are likely to be wary of any potential Canadian competition on the East Coast.

No one’s going to pay the price that it takes to develop our minerals and our energy in the Arctic

It’s not hard to imagine Trump targeting Canadian LNG ambitions in the ongoing trade negotiations between Washington and Ottawa.

“Trump is very transactional and zero-sum,” Exner-Pirot noted. “So any gain for Canada is a loss for the United States.”

Still, she and the other analysts doubt Trump will really feel threatened by Carney’s LNG moves — some even said he should welcome Canada’s new energy approach, noting that expanded Canadian LNG export capability could be good news for global security and the North American energy market.

“If you were in charge of NATO and the Western Alliance … it’s very good that North America is supplying energy security, both for our allies in Europe and for our allies in Asia,” said Exner-Pirot.

Some fear that the exportation of LNG in large volumes could shrink domestic supply and raise prices. But this tension could be good for the industry, McCown explained.

“Weirdly, you will end up with a more stable industry if prices aren’t rock bottom, because you have less consolidation in the industry and you have more people who want to produce natural gas.”

Under the terms of the agreement, EQT will get 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquefaction capacity for 20 years at the Commonwealth LNG facility. In order to optimize its cargoes internationally, the company will purchase the volumes on a free-on-board basis at a price indexed to Henry Hub and market.

This follows the U.S. player’s last week’s deal with compatriot NextDecade. Under it, 1.5 mtpa of LNG will be purchased for 20 years from Train 5 of the Rio Grande LNG (RGLNG) project under development at the Port of Brownsville, Texas.

“The signing of this agreement with Commonwealth LNG adds to the momentum we are building in the LNG market and further strengthens EQT’s position as a leader connecting U.S. natural gas supply to growing global demand,” said Toby Z. Rice, President and CEO of EQT.

According to Rice, the latest agreement helps EQT establish a diversified LNG export portfolio that will give it the flexibility needed to market and optimize its own cargoes as global demand for reliable, lower-carbon energy continues to rise.

Ben Dell, Managing Partner of Kimmeridge and Chairman of Caturus, the parent company of Commonwealth LNG, stated: “The agreement with EQT is a strong endorsement of our integrated natural gas platform, featuring a unique wellhead-to-water strategy that meets burgeoning demand for LNG across global markets, while advancing U.S. energy leadership and economic growth.”

As disclosed, the SPA will become fully effective once customary conditions are satisfied, including taking a final investment decision (FID) on the 9.5-mtpa Commonwealth LNG project. The developer hopes to take the FID in Q3 2025, followed by the anticipated start of LNG production in 2029.

The range and sophistication of these challenges have appeared to increase over the course of the last several years.

Environmental groups have targeted liquified natural gas (""LNG"") facilities, petrochemical plants, and plastics manufacturing complexes by filing petitions seeking judicial review of both state agency-issued environmental permits and local government land use and zoning approvals. Some of the common themes of these lawsuits include allegations of:

Use of Improper Emission Factors and Modeling – contending that modeling used for pollution limits is outdated or underestimates potential emissions

Failure to Use Best Available Control Technology (""BACT"") – arguing that pollution controls that do not reflect the best available technology for the industry such that lower limits are achievable based on, e.g., other facilities' standards

Insufficient Monitoring and Compliance – alleging that the agency failed to provide monitoring provisions that are sufficient to ensure compliance with permitted emissions limits

Inadequate Environmental Justice (""EJ"") Review – claiming that the agency failed to assess or mitigate adverse impacts on disproportionately affected communities

Failure to Adhere to Procedural Requirements – arguing that the local government did not strictly comply with public notice and hearing mandates or follow its own ordinances before granting special land use, zoning, development, or building permits

Environmental groups have raised these issues in challenges to permits for a variety of industrial projects, and each challenge deals with unique circumstances that vary on a case-by-case basis. These cases highlight the need for industry stakeholders to ensure that any permitting or decision-making record is sufficient to withstand a host of different challenges. The below cases provide a sampling of recent challenges in the Gulf Coast region.

In Rise St. James v. Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, 2023-CA-0578 (La. App. 1 Cir. Jan. 19, 2024), environmental groups challenged the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's (""LDEQ"") approval of air permits for a new petrochemical manufacturing complex in St. James Parish, Louisiana, arguing, among other things, that LDEQ had not completed an adequate EJ analysis as required by the State's Public Trust Doctrine. The Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal dismissed the groups' petition for review and upheld the permits, holding that, although the Public Trust Doctrine is broad enough to include EJ analyses, the LDEQ's EJ analysis at issue was sufficient. Despite the current federal administration's EJ rollback, states may have their own EJ and/or economic and social consideration requirements that remain applicable and must be considered during permitting. Currently these analyses may have a different look than they did when the Louisiana First Circuit decided the Rise St. James case due to a shift in federal guidance and the removal of federal online tools that aided in EJ analyses. However, state laws and jurisprudence continue to provide potential grounds for legal challenge on this issue.

Recent cases in Texas and Louisiana challenging the air permitting of LNG facilities demonstrate that such permits are being carefully and critically examined by environmental groups. In Port Arthur Community Action Network v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, No. 22-60556 (5th Cir. Aug. 12, 2025), an environmental group challenged the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (""TCEQ"") approval of an air permit for a new LNG facility in Port Arthur, Texas, arguing that stricter emissions limits for a nearby LNG facility still in development should be incorporated into the permit at issue as BACT. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the group's challenge, holding that under Texas law, BACT requires emissions control methods that are ""already proven ... to be operational"" and that ""theoretical"" operability of the unbuilt LNG facility was insufficient to establish BACT for other facilities. Most recently, on August 21, 2025, environmental groups petitioned the U.S. Fifth Circuit for review of two LDEQ air permits for a new LNG facility near Cameron Parish, Louisiana, in Louisiana Bucket Brigade v. Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, No. 25-60455. There, the groups claim a variety of deficiencies with the permits, including that they were based on improper modeling and failed to incorporate appropriate monitoring requirements to ensure compliance with permitting emissions limits. The Fifth Circuit's decision in this pending case will shed further light on the planning needed to ensure defensible air permits under the increasing scrutiny of permit challengers.

This is particularly important in an environment where project opponents perceive that agency decision making or enforcement is unfairly biased against them, as the challenges have become more frequent and sophisticated.

From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program.
“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director.
But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.
In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch.","Talia Boyd was spending over $300 a month to keep her home just outside Asheville, North Carolina, cool this summer. It was an enormous sum for the single-wide trailer she shares with her baby daughter and teenage son.

“We constantly kept ceiling fans going, and I had to get AC units,” she said — multiple ones that ran 24/7 to replace the cold air seeping out from gaps around the windows.

But now, the air leaks have been sealed, a door has been replaced, and a new heat pump has been installed — all at no cost to Boyd. Her monthly utility bill from Duke Energy has been cut in half, she said.

The improvements are thanks to Energy Savers Network, a small nonprofit that serves Buncombe County, where Boyd lives, along with neighboring counties Henderson, Haywood, and Madison.

“They really came out and they helped,” said Boyd, who works in home health care. ​“They talked. They took measurements. They walked through the whole trailer. I really appreciate the help, and I would love to spread the word.”

Boyd’s home is among the roughly 1,400 that Energy Savers Network has assisted with weatherization since its inception in late 2016. Across the state in the same time frame, thousands of other households have received similar services, mostly from community action agencies deploying federal dollars.

But Boyd’s story is somewhat unique. She’s in a smaller subset of people who’ve benefited from a Duke initiative meant not just to aid the energy burdened in times of crisis, but to permanently reduce their electricity use through home efficiency improvements.

And with politicians at the state and national levels turning against the clean energy transition in low-income communities and elsewhere, Boyd’s experience is rare good news that advocates hope can continue to be replicated.

From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency

Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program. Part of a side deal the utility struck in 2023 to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the program offers a monthly credit of up to $42 on bills for households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four.

In 2024, Duke began automatically providing the credit to any customers who’d benefited in the prior year from one of two buckets of federal aid: the Crisis Intervention Program, designed to prevent or reverse life-threatening emergencies like utility shutoffs, or the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which offers one-time payments to help households with heating bills.

North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services manages the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then enrolls customers in its program — a process that has minimized administrative expenses such as vetting participants for eligibility.

And though in its first year the bill assistance benefited less than half the number of households forecast, experts say that’s because funding for the two buckets of federal aid dropped, not because the need isn’t great. Advocates remain bullish about the prospect for Duke to serve 100,000 customers or more annually.

Totaling over $500 for a year, the bill credit alone is vital for families struggling to make ends meet, aid groups say.

But Boyd’s case demonstrates the full potential of the Customer Assistance Program: Virtually every household receiving help gets referred to a local entity that can assess homes and perform free efficiency upgrades, reducing energy burdens beyond the 12 months of financial aid.

“I’m very impressed with Duke”

The brainchild and passion project of former financial and utility consultant Brad Rouse, Energy Savers has undergone a few iterations over its nine years of existence. Its throughline is providing energy-efficiency retrofits, usually in a day’s time, via a team of volunteers guided by a professional.

When everything is running smoothly, that means the group can perform upgrades — such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks — for at least three homes a week, according to Rouse. But in its early years, Energy Savers sometimes struggled to meet that mark.

“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director. If they were last-minute, the group didn’t always have a backup client ready to take advantage of assembled volunteers and staff. In that case, Rouse said, ​“we lose the day.”

But now, the organization has almost eliminated that problem. ​“The Duke Customer Assistance referral is one big reason why,” he said.

That’s because the utility sends so many referrals that it’s easier to find clients who will be ready by the time the Energy Savers team arrives, reducing the likelihood of cancellations. And when a client does fall through, there’s a waiting list ready to be tapped.

The group identifies households in need through multiple channels, including farmers markets, community events, and word of mouth. But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.

“We send out a bulk mailing to [potential clients] first and then we try to follow up with phone calls to get them scheduled,” Rausch said.

Boyd, for instance, first got help paying her utility bills through Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry, which accessed one of the federal crisis assistance funds for her. She was soon enrolled in Duke’s $42 bill-credit program and then referred to Energy Savers. ​“They popped up at my doorstep,” Boyd said.

In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch. So far, 36 of those referred families have made it through the weatherization process.

“I’m very impressed with Duke at this point,” Rausch said. The utility, which funds the majority of the services provided by Energy Savers, always makes sure the group gets reimbursed, she said. ​“We’ve never been stuck with the bill.”

To be sure, Duke and advocates for low-income customers are still working out kinks in the bill-credit scheme. One challenge is waning funding for the two federal crisis assistance initiatives that are used to automatically enroll individuals in the Customer Assistance Program. Another hurdle is connecting the dots for recipients, who often don’t realize they’re getting the bill credit or that they’re getting referred to groups like Energy Savers.

Thuy confirmed that the company will announce a US$200 million loan from Indian state-owned banks soon, she said. Bloomberg News reported in May that the automaker was seeking a loan from state-owned institutions.

VinFast is “constantly looking for other ways to fund the business”, she said. “So it’s still looking to bring in the equity investor at the price that is acceptable to us.”

As the company expands, it will “continue growing our credit profile”, Thuy said.

VinFast was poised to raise US$1.5 billion by selling certain research and development assets to founder Pham Nhat Vuong. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year, VinFast said.

The billionaire has already pumped more than US$2 billion of his own money into the EV maker and has said that he’s willing to support it until his money runs out.

VinFast posted a net loss of about 20.3 trillion dong (S$995 million) in the second quarter, 15 per cent wider than the first quarter and 8.4 per cent from a year ago, according to an exchange filing.

Vuong said in April that the automaker will prioritise Asia, including India, Indonesia and the Philippines, over North America and Europe, where high logistics costs weigh on margins.

ABOUT CRUX: Crux is the capital markets technology company changing the way clean energy, minerals, and manufacturing projects are financed in the United States.
Crux’s world-class team brings together expertise from energy, tax, finance, government, and technology to power an abundant, resilient, and secure energy future.","The market continues to grow year-over-year, with growth in 1H2025 fueled by diversification of investments beyond solar and wind

Transferability helped knit together what were once fragmented financing submarkets into a larger, more dynamic, more integrated market.”

— Alfred Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Crux

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, September 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Today, Crux, the capital markets technology company for the clean economy, released its 2025 mid-year market intelligence report on the state of clean energy finance. The report covers transferable tax credits, tax equity, and debt capital markets, and shows continued growth and diversification in US clean energy financing despite a backdrop of policy uncertainty in the first half of 2025.

This report is most accurately understood when 1H2025 data is compared against 1H2024, as seasonal demand, corporate tax liability planning, and project completion timelines all create natural cycles in the market. The transferable tax credit market grew from $8.5B in 1H2024 to more than $20B in 1H2025. The growth reflects many consecutive years of increasing investment in clean energy and manufacturing with particular accelerated expansion over the past three years. The assets associated with that robust investment continue to be delivered.

The market growth is further explained by increasing market diversification. Energy storage projects gained significant market share, alongside newly eligible credits from advanced manufacturing, critical minerals, clean fuels, geothermal, and other technologies. Even as the market grew, the proportion of the market associated with standalone wind and solar dropped materially from 76% in 1H2024 to 43% in 1H2025. Unsold 2025 supply is even further tilted toward newly eligible technologies.

External Market Forces in 1H2025:

The first half of 2025 was defined by a convergence of external factors that shaped activity across clean energy finance. Changing trade policy and negotiations around the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) introduced uncertainty early in the year and further impacted an already-evolving tax credit market composition. That uncertainty led to tightened financial conditions in equity and debt markets in 1H2025. The bill made significant changes to wind and solar credits, preserved credits for most other energy and manufacturing categories, and completely retained transferability. Rising US power demand and higher utility rates created supportive tailwinds irrespective of policy. Those forces are anticipated to continue to drive investments into energy storage, advanced manufacturing, clean fuels, and other emerging sectors. Together, these forces pushed the market to adapt quickly, with both developers and investors showing an increasing interest in hybrid financing opportunities.

An Adaptable and Strong Market:

“Massive investments in energy infrastructure are being realized at the very moment the US needs more electricity and manufacturing capacity,” said Alfred Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Crux. “But the new policy environment is challenging, especially for developers of wind and solar. Transferability helped knit together what were once fragmented financing submarkets into a larger, more dynamic, more integrated market; this integration has opened new opportunities and different strategies across the capital stack. Crux sits at the center of this interconnected financing market, and we’re proud to provide the market intelligence and industry expertise our clients have come to rely on to successfully navigate this critical but rapidly evolving landscape.”

Key takeaways from The State of Clean Energy Finance: 2025 Mid-Year Market Intelligence Report include:

1) The market for transferable tax credits grew rapidly in the first half of 2025, despite policy uncertainty headwinds. The transferable tax credit market has grown year-over-year since its inception in 2023. Crux estimates that the total transferable tax credit market exceeded $20 billion in the first half of 2025, an increase of nearly 2x over the first half of 2024.

2) A critical driver of market growth was the broadening range of technologies and active sponsors, as market composition continues to shift. In 1H2025, energy storage and other newly eligible technologies like advanced manufacturing, nuclear, hydro, storage, and geothermal made up 36% of tax credit transactions — up about 50% compared to 1H2024, reflecting a sustained appetite for credits from diverse technologies and sources.

3) Hybrid tax equity strategies make up the majority of tax equity investments, and tax credit transfers out of tax equity are the fastest-growing part of the market. Tax equity investment is on track to increase 10–20% relative to 2024, and Crux data suggests investments will reach $32–35 billion for the full year of 2025. Hybrid tax equity structures, which are structured to transfer a portion of the tax credits, made up more than 60% of tax equity commitments in 2025.

4) Investment-grade sellers saw higher prices on transfer deals, while most of the market saw prices decline in 1H2025. The premium for credits from investment-grade (IG) sellers grew, while newer technologies and less experienced developers faced higher costs of capital and less access to financing. These dynamics, long observed by Crux in the market, became more pronounced during the first half of the year.

5) Investment in solar+storage and standalone energy storage is growing quickly in 2025, while wind energy tax credits saw declining market share. Hybrid solar+storage and standalone energy storage ITCs accounted for about 26% of tax credits sold in 1H2025, a sizable increase from 1H2024 when these credits made up 9% of the market. Onshore and offshore wind energy transactions declined from 33% in 1H2024 to 9.5% in 1H2025.

6) In 2H2025, reductions in tax liability are weighing heavily on buyer demand and lowering average pricing. Crux’s analysis of the impact from the OBBB suggests that corporate tax liabilities will be 20–30% lower in 2025. Early observations from Q3 indicate a large proportion of buyers are still digesting the effects of the tax law change and the impacts to their own tax liabilities; ripple effects have yet to make their way through the market but are expected to be material. Demand is likely to begin recovering in Q4, but the composition of the buyside may differ materially from 2024, with bigger mainstay buyers on the sidelines for 2025.

7) The tax credit insurance market tightened, leading to changing trends in insurance coverage. Carrier-quoted premiums increased from last year: from $150,000–250,000 per policy in 2024 to ranges of $400,000 or more in 1H2025. Underwriting premiums have also risen, driving up the cost of insurance as a percentage of a deal, with fees that ranged from $50,000–250,000 in 2024 trending closer to $400,000 and up in 1H2025. These rising costs caused the prevalence of insurance coverage to decline slightly, with 62% of ITC deals including insurance coverage (vs 70% in 1H2024) and 21% of PTC deals (vs 22% in 1H2024).

Looking ahead, Crux projects total tax credit monetization in 2025, including tax equity, will reach $55–60 billion, up from $52 billion in 2024. Crux’s data estimates that transfers from tax equity will total $11-13 billion in 2025, up from $7 billion in 2024: an increase of 57%-85%. This reflects the growing importance of transferability as a core feature of clean energy finance, where tax equity, transfers, and debt capital increasingly move together as part of an interconnected capital stack. Today’s market data release follows Crux’s recent announcement of its new tax and preferred equity offering, underscoring the company’s commitment to serving clients across the full spectrum of clean energy financing.

This report offers the most comprehensive findings on debt, tax equity, and transferable tax credit transactions based on a $40B transaction database covering deals facilitated by Crux, publicly reported deals, and survey responses by more than 100 market participants. This report also includes the market’s inaugural database of tax equity commitments, compiled directly from major investors’ stated strategies.

Conclusion VinFast's 2028 North Carolina plant is a bold but precarious bet on the U.S. EV market.","VinFast's delayed North Carolina electric vehicle (EV) plant, now slated for 2028, has become a focal point for investors assessing the company's long-term viability in the U.S. market. The project, initially heralded as a $2 billion bet on American manufacturing and clean energy, now faces scrutiny amid VinFast's financial struggles, shifting priorities, and a volatile global EV landscape. For investors, the question is whether this three-year delay—and the company's broader strategic recalibration—can still align with its ambitious U.S. EV goals.

Strategic Shifts and Capital Constraints

VinFast's decision to postpone the North Carolina plant reflects a pragmatic response to macroeconomic headwinds and capital constraints. The company has burned through over $7 billion in losses since pivoting to EVs in 2021, with Q2 2025 losses alone hitting $770 million. To stabilize its balance sheet, VinFast is raising $1.5 billion by selling research and development assets to its founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, who has already invested $2 billion of his own money. This move, while providing short-term liquidity, raises questions about the sustainability of relying on Vuong's personal wealth for long-term growth.

The company's pivot to Asia—where it has launched plants in India and Indonesia—further underscores its prioritization of markets with lower logistics costs and cultural alignment. North America, by contrast, remains a high-cost, high-risk proposition. VinFast's leadership has openly acknowledged that the U.S. market will not be a priority until its Asian operations generate sufficient cash flow. This shift is not without precedent: Tesla's early struggles in the U.S. were mitigated by its eventual expansion into China and Europe. However, VinFast's delayed timeline and thin margins leave little room for error.

The North Carolina Plant: A High-Stakes Bet

The North Carolina plant, when operational, is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles annually, primarily the VF 7, VF 8, and VF 9 models. Its 1,800-acre site in Chatham County includes advanced manufacturing zones for EVs, batteries, and supplier ecosystems. Yet, the delay to 2028 means VinFast will miss critical momentum in the U.S. EV market, where competitors like Tesla, Ford, and Rivian are already scaling production. By 2028, the U.S. market could be saturated with cheaper, more efficient models, leaving VinFast's premium-priced vehicles at a disadvantage.

Moreover, the state of North Carolina retains leverage through a purchase option agreement, allowing it to reclaim the site if VinFast fails to meet job creation targets. With the company having delivered only 22,350 vehicles in the first half of 2024 (far below its 80,000-unit target), the risk of regulatory or financial penalties looms. Investors must weigh whether the plant's eventual launch will justify the capital outlay, especially given VinFast's current focus on Asia.

Market Volatility and Investor Sentiment

The global EV market remains highly volatile, with demand fluctuating due to economic downturns, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory shifts. VinFast's stock has fallen 20.1% in 2025, reflecting investor skepticism despite bullish sentiment on platforms like Stocktwits. This disconnect highlights the tension between retail optimism and institutional caution.

A reveals a stark contrast: Tesla's shares have surged despite similar macroeconomic challenges, buoyed by its first-mover advantage and consistent profitability. VinFast, by contrast, lacks a proven path to profitability and faces an uphill battle to capture market share in the U.S.

Strategic Equity Raising: A Double-Edged Sword

VinFast's $1.5 billion equity raise and $200 million loan from Indian banks provide temporary relief but do not address underlying structural issues. Selling R&D assets to Vuong may stifle innovation, while reliance on state-owned banks in India could limit financial flexibility. Investors should monitor whether these funds are allocated to high-impact projects—such as battery technology or charging infrastructure—or merely to cover operational shortfalls.

Investment Implications

For long-term investors, VinFast's U.S. ambitions remain a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The North Carolina plant could position the company as a regional player if executed successfully, but the delays and financial strains suggest a fragile foundation. Key risks include:

1. Capital exhaustion: Vuong's personal investments are finite, and further dilution could erode shareholder value.

2. Market saturation: By 2028, the U.S. EV market may be dominated by established players, leaving little room for VinFast's premium models.

3. Regulatory risks: North Carolina's purchase option and job creation mandates could force costly renegotiations.

Conversely, VinFast's pivot to Asia offers a potential lifeline. Its Indian and Indonesian plants, with lower production costs and growing middle-class demand, could generate the cash flow needed to fund U.S. operations. If VinFast can achieve profitability in Asia by 2028, the North Carolina plant might yet become a strategic asset.

Conclusion

VinFast's 2028 North Carolina plant is a bold but precarious bet on the U.S. EV market. While the company's strategic equity raising and Asian expansion provide short-term stability, the long-term viability of its U.S. ambitions hinges on its ability to navigate financial constraints, market volatility, and regulatory hurdles. Investors should approach with caution, prioritizing diversification and hedging against the company's high-risk profile. For now, VinFast remains a speculative play—a gamble on whether it can transform its Asian success into a North American breakthrough.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 05:01:31.282189

During the summer, EV sales were expected to surge as drivers pursued the sunsetting credits.
But the Wall Street Journal's coverage of the current electric car sales spike seemed to indicate buyers weren't solely there for the deals.
Colt Emich is a general manager at Emich Kia, a ""fourth-generation"" car salesman who likely grew up around auto sales shop talk.","Something ""unprecedented"" is occurring with car sales right now, and auto dealerships around the country are reporting a major trend.

As the Wall Street Journal observed, electric vehicles are flying off the lots in record numbers.

Federal tax incentives for drivers of cleaner vehicles in the United States began in earnest under President Barack Obama in 2009 and 2010, with a goal of putting a million plug-in hybrids or EVs on the road by 2015.

Utilities were among early advocates of federal incentives, appealing to Congress to extend the credits in 2018.

Earlier this year, several federal tax credits and incentives designed to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles were slashed, slated to expire at the end of the fiscal year on September 30.

During the summer, EV sales were expected to surge as drivers pursued the sunsetting credits. But the Wall Street Journal's coverage of the current electric car sales spike seemed to indicate buyers weren't solely there for the deals.

At 80, John McCabe is a retired doctor, current EV owner, and powers his home with solar panels. He said he'd intended to purchase a vehicle and decided to take advantage of the remaining credits.

""We were going to buy one anyway,"" McCabe told the Journal. ""As long as we're going to do it, you might as well get it done before the incentives disappear.""

Colt Emich is a general manager at Emich Kia, a ""fourth-generation"" car salesman who likely grew up around auto sales shop talk. Emich told the paper that his family had a gauge for lease deals: a monthly payment equivalent to 1% of the car's sticker price was ""as good as it gets.""

However, Emich was pleasantly surprised to see his family's general rule disproved, as well as by the sales numbers at his dealership.

Referring to monthly lease payments under that 1% threshold, he said: ""These EVs have just absolutely crushed that. It's a small portion of a percentage. It's just unprecedented.""

Greg Scolnick, 55, purchased an all-electric compact Volvo SUV crossover last year, but a $39 monthly lease payment on a Volkswagen ID.4 SUV lured him back to the dealership.

As the Journal pointed out, shockingly low lease deals have enabled young drivers who would have otherwise been unable to afford one to make their next car an EV.

But like McCabe, current EV owners and drivers have been ""enticed"" to upgrade or get a second car. Car salespeople, such as Markus Kamm of Tynan's Nissan, were skeptical that lease payments could dip below $40 a month in the future.

""We may never see this level of deal again,"" Kamm said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5e8glqlspC0psC7Y2RsCYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d8e4dac7ed22326e5cbe9525b619a671,N,,2025-09-09 03:58:55.364403

Hawaiian Electric has begun seeing an increase in applications for customer-sited solar and battery systems now that the federal government has moved up the deadline for claiming the 30% tax credit to Dec. 31, 2025. Previously homeowners had until the end of 2032 to claim the full tax credit for qualifying clean energy technologies.

Hawaiian Electric received 1,151 applications to install residential rooftop solar and battery storage systems in July, up sharply from 683 in June. Applications in July were the highest for any month since March 2024. Hawaiian Electric expects applications to continue at robust levels for the remainder of 2025 and can shift additional staff to process applications if needed.

“We are committed to processing applications as quickly as possible to help customers who want to install and energize their systems by the end of the year,” said Kaiulani Shinsato, Hawaiian Electric Customer Energy Resources co-director. “Customer-sited solar and battery storage is a priority for Hawaiian Electric because these systems are key to reaching Hawai‘i’s decarbonization and clean energy goals.”

Hawaiian Electric recently achieved a major clean energy milestone as the amount of rooftop solar and battery storage surpassed 1 gigawatt of installed capacity across the five islands the company serves. As a result of the high solar penetration, an estimated 44% of single family homes served by Hawaiian Electric have rooftop solar.

“Hawai‘i’s leadership in rooftop solar and storage shows how local action can deliver affordable clean energy and resilience,” said Rocky Mould, executive director of the Hawai‘i Solar Energy Association. “We appreciate Hawaiian Electric’s quick response in listening to the solar industry and accommodating this surge in demand. As federal support fades, reducing interconnection and permitting costs can ensure these resources keep paying off for customers, the grid, and our islands as a whole.”",https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2024/04/rooftop-solar-meco-heco-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 06:59:28.791768

The state’s infrastructure push, improving law and order, and talent availability are further shaping it into a competitive hub for clean energy expansion. In this context, Avaada Group has been actively building its presence across the region. From solar projects in Bundelkhand to manufacturing facilities in Dadri, Hathras, and Greater Noida, the company is pursuing an integrated approach to the energy transition.

In this conversation with ETGovernment’s Arpit Gupta, Vineet Mittal, Chairman of Avaada Group, discusses the company’s investment outlook in Uttar Pradesh, the support received from the state government, and Avaada’s broader plans across India’s clean energy landscape.

Edited excerpts:

Avaada is making significant investments across various districts in Uttar Pradesh. Could you elaborate on the support you have received from the state government and your investment outlook in the region?

Avaada is a fully integrated energy transition company, investing across the entire value chain—from solar and wind power to pumped storage batteries and green hydrogen production. In Uttar Pradesh, we are actively engaged in multiple districts, primarily in the Bundelkhand region. We have completed projects in Banda, are progressing in Lalitpur and Chitrakoot, and are exploring opportunities in Mirzapur.

We operate a fully automated solar panel manufacturing plant in Dadri, serving Uttar Pradesh and the wider country. Additionally, we are developing glass manufacturing in Hathras and ingot, wafer, cell, and module production facilities in the Greater Noida belt. Our planned Center of Excellence in Greater Noida will focus on research and innovation.

The government has been cooperative. One of our proposals has received cabinet approval, and we are awaiting further permissions to advance our projects. Over the past three years, Uttar Pradesh’s improved law and order situation has positively impacted talent availability and business confidence. The state’s infrastructure upgrades, cost competitiveness, and safety enhancements have made it an attractive destination for investment and workforce relocation.

Advt

We do seek expedited government support to streamline approvals, permits, and incentives, which will help accelerate the realization of these investments.

Can you provide some figures regarding your current and planned investments in Uttar Pradesh?

To date, we have invested approximately ₹2,000–3,000 crore in Uttar Pradesh. Looking ahead, our proposed investments could range between ₹20,000 and ₹30,000 crore. This includes ventures in data centers, pumped storage projects, ingot, wafer, cell and module manufacturing, glass production, and multiple solar projects. We are also considering retail initiatives in the state, such as advanced solar storage solutions for households, offering uninterrupted power supply.

Uttar Pradesh has three key policies around renewable energy: solar, bioenergy, and green hydrogen. What aspects of these policies are particularly attractive to Avaada?

Our primary motivation is the leadership and vision demonstrated by the Uttar Pradesh government. With a population of 24 crore, it is imperative for us to have a significant presence in the state. The initial concerns around workforce availability and incentives have been effectively addressed. The state’s manufacturing policies are now on par with those of other leading industrialized states in India.

For example, the incentives available for data centers are competitive with those in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. There is a clear willingness on the part of the government to facilitate investment. However, more proactive and coordinated support at the district level is needed to match the engagement seen at the state level. This would further accelerate investment realization.

Beyond Uttar Pradesh, you have signed MOUs in Maharashtra and other states. Could you share your preferred states and sectors for investment?

As an integrated energy company, we focus on solar, wind, and pumped storage. Wind projects are concentrated in states with suitable conditions, such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Gujarat. Large-scale solar projects exceeding 5,000 MW are primarily located in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, given land availability challenges in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

In Maharashtra, we are executing distributed KUSUM solar projects, having commissioned about 300 MW so far. Our manufacturing ecosystem for solar panels is well established in Nagpur. Overall, our key states for large investments include Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. Additionally, we have significant investments planned in five other states, totaling ₹1,000–5,000 crore.

What are your future plans for growth in the renewable energy sector?

Our ambitions are substantial. By 2030, we aim to build a portfolio of 30,000 MW across solar, wind, pumped storage, and battery-based projects. We aspire to provide affordable, reliable, round-the-clock clean energy for industries, data centers, and households across India. Our integrated model, spanning manufacturing to green hydrogen, positions us well to support India’s energy transition.

Instead of only delaying the 2026 targets, Carney should end the whole charade and cancel an unrealistic EV mandate which was set up to fail from the beginning.","Those with an attentive ear may have picked up on the distinct sound of sobbing emanating from the Department of Canadian Identity and Culture. They are the sobs of its minister, erstwhile minister of environment and climate change, Steven Guilbeault, watching the slow but certain immolation of Canada’s electric vehicle sales mandate, as it goes up in smoke. Friday, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that automakers would no longer need to have 20 per cent of their sales be zero emission vehicles, either fully electric or hybrid election, in 2026.

The target has been delayed by a year, and the entirety of the program, which also mandates that 60 per cent of sales by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035 be zero emitting will be reviewed over the next two months. If Carney is truly serious about turning Canada’s economy around, he will put Guilbeault’s criminally delusional policy out of its misery and return to a market driven solution rather than a government mandated one.

The electric vehicle mandate has always been something of an environmentalist absurdity from the beginning. To start with, Canada doesn’t have enough electricity. In British Columbia, for example, it has been estimated that to meet the 100 per cent zero emitting vehicle sales goal by 2035, B.C. needs to produce an additional 9,700 gigawatt hours of electricity with some estimates saying the province may need to double its entire electrical power output.

The lower end estimates would require the construction of further Site C dam equivalents. Site C is BC Hydro’s most recent crown jewel of electrical generation. Created by damming the Peace River it came online in August after well over a decade of planning and construction. That is to say, if we indeed wanted a 100 per cent EV mandate to be even remotely realistic, we need shovels in the ground today on massive hydro dams and nuclear power plants across the country. That’s just not going to happen on the government’s 2035 timeframe.

The other problem the EV mandate was always going to face is consumer demand and business profitability. Even now, EVs are unprofitable for many, if not most, car manufacturers. In February, Ford announced that it was projected to lose US$5.5 billion in 2025 on it EV and software division. Volkswagen is now less profitable because it sells more EVs and even GM, the best of the lot, is only breaking even at best. These are not sustainable numbers and the uncertainty created by the Trump tariffs have merely exacerbated the obvious issues with EVs mandates, not created them. This is all something automakers themselves have been saying for some time now, though until Friday their pleas landed on deaf ears.

The root cause of all this lies with consumers. They simply don’t want an EV for the very simple reason that, as it stands, EVs are less functional and versatile than vehicles powered by gas alone. This by no means to say they will remain so forever — indeed they likely will not — but at the moment consumers are looking at EVs, which cost more, are less functional, give them less value for money and are concluding that a traditional vehicle remains the more economically sensible decision. A government mandate would only hit consumers, already dealing with affordability issues, even harder.

The green lobby will seethe but the stark reality is that the EV mandate was always a pipe dream and that has now been laid clearly bare. Mandates of the EV type don’t work when they hurt both consumers and businesses. Instead of only delaying the 2026 targets, Carney should end the whole charade and cancel an unrealistic EV mandate which was set up to fail from the beginning.

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is stalling over charging fears. Finding a working, available public charger on US interstates is difficult; along six of the busiest interstates, real-time status is available for only one in three charging stations, with gaps of up to 1,308 miles with no charger status data.

States can turbocharge EV adoption without rebates or taxes—just data transparency. This report offers turnkey legislation that states can adopt to encourage EV adoption at near-zero cost.

Making real-time data universal for highway fast chargers would allow EV drivers to reliably navigate to working and available chargers and raise the EV share of new vehicle sales by 6.4 percentage points in 2030, putting 9.2 percent more EVs on the road by that year compared with baseline projections.

Executive Summary

Electric vehicle (EV) drivers want a seamless charging experience, but finding a working, available public charger on US interstates is difficult. Across six of the busiest interstates, traversing 40 states, only 34 per­cent of EV charging stations make real-time data available to PlugShare (a major charger-finding app), creating gaps of up to 1,308 miles with no charger status data.

The solution is simple and cheap—and readily advanced by states. If all fast chargers on highways reported their status in real time so that any software developer could put it in a mapping app, EV drivers could reliably navigate to working, available chargers on a road trip—effectively eliminating their range anxiety. We estimate that making real-time data universal for highway fast chargers would raise the EV share of new vehicle sales by 6.4 percentage points in 2030, expanding the 2030 EV fleet 9.2 percent above baseline projections.

Introduction

Electric vehicle (EV) drivers want a seamless charging experience, but finding a working, available public charger on US interstates is difficult because map­ping apps have limited real-time data for many of these chargers. Along six major US interstates—I-5, I-10, I-75, I-80, I-90, and I-95—only 34 percent of charging stations have real-time data on PlugShare, a major free website and app for EV drivers that has more real-time data on chargers than Google Maps or Apple Maps.1

We have documented real-time “data deserts”2 as long as 1,300 miles along major US interstates— something truly chilling for many EV drivers, as an EV with a 300-mile range would need to success­fully charge at least four times to cross that distance.3 On a road trip, verifying that a charging station will have an available, in-service charger often requires cross-referencing multiple apps—something no driver can safely do while driving.

The solution is simple and cheap—and readily advanced by states. If all direct current fast chargers (DCFCs)4 on highways reported their status in real time so that any software developer could put it in a mapping app, EV drivers could reliably navigate to working, available chargers on a road trip—effectively eliminating their range anxiety.5

It’s technologically feasible. Charge point operators (CPOs) could post their chargers’ real-time data to an application programming interface (API), where soft­ware developers could access it. A model is the 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which requires this reporting for all the highway fast char­gers it funds.6 Some CPOs already report these data, but they may limit the data’s access and use.

As the Trump administration moves to sweep away federal support for EV adoption, state action to support it is becoming more important.7 In particular, less federal investment in charging makes it critical to make the most of existing chargers. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) eliminates tax credits for business and residential investment in charging. The Department of Transportation froze IIJA charging funds until a court ordered it to free them; it then issued new interim guidance and reopened the program.8 Previous research has shown that investing in public charging is more cost-effective than offering tax credits to induce EV sales.9

Other policy changes will further chill EV adoption and slow charger rollout, increasing the urgency of making the most of existing chargers to advance EV adoption. OBBBA also eliminated tax credits for EV purchases and leases, effectively widening the price gap between buying an EV and an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle for consumers and busi­nesses.10 The tariffs on autos and parts—as well as on steel, aluminum, and copper—will increase the cost of new vehicles, impair automaker profitabil­ity, and likely slow automaker investment in new EV programs. The metals and “reciprocal” tariffs, if sustained, will make DCFCs and supporting transform­ers, many of which are imported, more expensive, likely slowing charger rollout.

The federal government is also effectively elimi­nating its environmental regulation of vehicles that has incentivized automakers to sell EVs, and it is undermining states’ ability to set their own, tougher standards. OBBBA eliminates penalties on automak­ers for failing to meet fuel economy standards, dramatically reducing incentives to comply. On July 29, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding the endangerment finding that greenhouse gases are harmful, which would nullify the tailpipe emissions standards that rested on that finding.11 In addition, on June 12, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a law revoking California’s longtime emissions waiver, which enabled it to set tougher vehicle emission limits than the federal gov­ernment’s. If it survives court challenges, the new law would prevent California, and other states that used its waiver, from phasing out ICE vehicle sales by 2035. California has sued, arguing that the waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act, which Congress used to eliminate it.12

Many states should be interested in supporting EV adoption: both “Battery Belt” states, which want to see more jobs in their state from EV production and battery supply-chain investments, and the 17 states (plus the District of Columbia) that followed California’s Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) or Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, committing to EV adoption to reduce emissions.13 Selling US-made EVs at home supports the US auto industry’s ability to compete in the global transition away from ICE vehicles and toward EVs. Every new EV sold means fewer carbon emissions than if the same driver were behind the wheel of a vehicle running on gasoline, and the emis­sions from each of those EVs will fall over time as the grid decarbonizes.14 Between the Battery Belt, ZEV, and Clean Car states, at least 28 may be interested in advancing EV adoption.

Likewise, all states should agree that US EV sales help the US auto industry compete in the global transition away from ICE vehicles. In 2024, China sold 11 million EVs and Europe sold three million,15 while the US sold just 1.3 million.16 If the United States con­tinues to fall behind China in EV manufacturing, US automakers may never be able to compete. That could mean not only fewer jobs in EV assembly, battery pro­duction, and the EV supply chain but fewer US auto jobs overall.

Our recent research finds that real-time data transparency is a powerful way to spur EV adoption. We estimate that making real-time data universal for highway DCFCs would raise the 2030 EV share of new vehicle sales by 6.4 percentage points—raising the estimated EV share to 46 percent of new vehi­cle sales from a 40 percent baseline projection.17 (Our projection incorporates EV policy changes in OBBBA while retaining charger investments in the IIJA and the surviving EV provisions of the IRA and California waiver.)18

As a result of open charger data, there would be 3.5 million more EVs on the road by 2030, a 9 percent increase compared with baseline projections. Put­ting these additional EVs on the road would reduce carbon emissions by up to 15.2 million metric tons in 2030 alone—with corresponding reductions in emis­sions every year those EVs are used. These estimates assume that putting real-time data for all DCFCs in centralized apps will lead CPOs to repair them more rapidly and improve their reporting accuracy, raising the share of successful charging attempts and enabling EV drivers to trust what their phones tell them—thereby erasing range anxiety.19

To be clear, apps to find EV chargers already exist, but they have large coverage gaps because some large charging providers do not share real-time data with them. Moreover, transmitting real-time data is technically feasible—thanks to the IIJA requirement, the capability is standard in the current generation of chargers. The problem is how to induce more real-time data disclosure.

One way to conceptualize the problem is see­ing it as a choice between two future states of the charging market: either all CPOs provide real-time data in centralized apps or none do. Both outcomes would be stable, but the information-sharing out­come is better from a societal perspective. The ques­tion is how to get there. The market has not yielded the information-sharing outcome, creating a role for policy to do so.

States should follow the IIJA’s example and require open real-time data for chargers in their state. California, Maryland, and Massachusetts have already taken steps in that direction. The model legislation presented in this report can help states adopt common real-time data disclosure standards that are consistent with the IIJA’s. Common require­ments will be easier for CPOs to follow and will therefore reduce resistance to data sharing.

In fact, only a few states need to require data disclosure to tip the market outcome toward the information-sharing equilibrium. Even without such tipping, the regional nature of the Battery Belt, ZEV, and Clean Car states also means that long, multi­state stretches of major highways could be made EV travel friendly by state action alone, alleviat­ing range anxiety for many road trips. If all 17 ZEV and Clean Car states20 plus another 11 Battery Belt states21—which together account for 67 percent of the nation’s registered vehicles22—set real-time data disclosure requirements, it would cover high­ways in 28 states, including Washington, DC.23 This report discusses the importance of real-time data to accelerate EV adoption; it then proposes a menu of policy solutions, emphasizing state action. In assessing real-time data’s value, current availabil­ity, and impact on EV adoption, this report relies extensively on our 2025 working paper, “Charging Uncertainty: Real-Time Charging Data and Electric Vehicle Adoption.”24

The Current State of Real-Time Data and Why It’s Critical to EV Adoption

Why Charging Is Critical to EV Adoption

Economic research consistently finds that charging infrastructure plays a big role in drivers’ choice between EV and traditional ICE vehicles.25 But whether charging infrastructure will spur EV adop­tion in practice depends on whether consumers believe public chargers will be reliable. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey found that “56% of Americans are not too or not at all confident that the U.S. will build the necessary infrastructure to support large numbers of EVs.”26 Insufficient charging infrastructure means that drivers may be unable to charge promptly simply because chargers are occupied and other EVs may already be wait­ing.27 Open data about whether public chargers are working and available can influence drivers’ deci­sion to buy an EV and help steer them to working chargers.

The popular narrative about EV public charging is negative. Over the past several years, newspa­per columnists28 and industry studies29 have docu­mented EV drivers’ frustration with public charging infrastructure, specifically the number of chargers and their reliability. J.D. Power surveyed new vehi­cle buyers in 2025’s first quarter and found that four of the top five reasons why drivers rejected EVs were related to charging.30

Academic research yields similar conclusions. A study of reviews on a major EV charger locator app from 2011 to 2015 reported that nearly half of reviews represented negative charging experiences.31 A more recent study documented the many reasons drivers

may fail to successfully charge at California’s DCFCs: nonfunctioning screens, payment failures, charging cables that are too short for some EV models, and so on.32

The two most important use cases for public charging are highways and cities. In cities, driv­ers are more likely to live in multifamily housing,33 rent their homes,34 or park on the street, all of which lower the odds of being able to install EV chargers in their homes. The US Department of Energy predicts that urban EV owners will rely on public charging for 62 percent of their needs, compared with only 32 percent for suburban residents and 16 percent for rural residents.35 Because driving speeds are lower in cities, drivers could lose substantial time driving to chargers that are out of service or occupied. At the Level 2 chargers common in cities, charging sessions are longer, turnover is less frequent, and stations are often small, so waiting for another vehicle to finish charging is not practical.

Traveling via highways poses a different set of concerning problems for EV drivers. Consumers considering buying an EV often anticipate range anxiety in public charging’s most extreme use case: long road trips far from home, where drivers are likely unfamiliar with local charging infrastruc­ture and where running out of charge can involve an expensive and time-consuming tow. Few house­holds actually take major road trips annually, but the possibility of taking one has outsized importance for potential vehicle buyers.36 The data analysis in this report focuses on the availability of real-time data on highways.

How Real-Time Data Help EV Drivers

This report proposes providing real-time data as a transparency solution for drivers’ anxiety about public EV charging. By “real-time data,” we mean that centralized, free apps report the locations and types of EV chargers and whether they are work­ing and available. The necessary condition for this is that all CPOs make the status of their chargers available, for free, to software developers so they can create those centralized apps. That is not the case today.

The absence of a one-stop shop for centralized and searchable data on EV chargers may be a real bar­rier to EV adoption for drivers accustomed to easily finding gas along highways thanks to prominent signs. Range anxiety is exacerbated by the difficulty of find­ing EV chargers, the longer time needed to recharge an EV, and the possibility of unreliable EV chargers. Open data can make it easier to find a successful char­ger and play a key role in mitigating range anxiety, making EVs more accessible to the American public.

While most CPOs provide data on their own char­gers through a proprietary mobile app, this falls short of the benefits of centralized real-time data. First, cross-referencing apps puts a substantial search bur­den on EV drivers. Second, it’s simply not safe for driv­ers to cross-reference apps while driving. Many drivers do not have the advantage of a passenger who can research chargers across apps—for example, those driving solo and drivers whose only passengers are young children.

The compatibility of plugs—the equivalent of gas­oline nozzles—complicates real-world charge find­ing for EV drivers, as not all EVs are compatible with all charging plugs, although that is changing. Tesla’s opening of part of its charging network is alleviating this matching problem. EVs with Combined Charging System and CHAdeMO plugs can use Magic Dock adapters provided at certain open Tesla chargers. The matching problem will further improve with time as Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug becomes the national standard in new vehicles.37

Some CPOs provide their real-time data to auto­makers for in-vehicle and brand-owner apps, but that also falls short of open data. Automaker apps may require subscriptions, especially when a vehicle is no longer new. Real-time data in subscription-only apps will become a worse substitute for open data as the market grows and EVs age. As the used-EV market matures, more prospective EV buyers will be from low- and middle-income households and therefore more sensitive to subscription costs.

CPOs may not voluntarily provide centralized real-time data out of concern that competitors will use it to their advantage or because proprietary data are a valuable part of their business.38 The IIJA’s $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, however, requires the highway DCFCs it funds to report real-time data. Moreover, the Trump administration retained this requirement when it issued its new NEVI guidance.39 Specifically, the program has required “third-party data sharing” (i.e., data accessible to aggregators via an API) on “real-time status by port” and “real-time price to charge” at the plug level for all NEVI-funded chargers.40 The NEVI requirement has also ensured that DCFC manufacturers make transmitting real-time data a standard feature of current DCFCs.

But the IIJA imposes no requirements on non-NEVI chargers, and there is no other national require­ment. As a result, providing centralized real-time data is voluntary for the majority of DCFCs that do not receive NEVI funds. As we document below, only a minority supply it voluntarily today. If DCFC plugs cost $100,000 on average, NEVI’s $5 billion (and states’ mandatory 20 percent contribution) could fund only up to 62,500 DCFC ports.41 That’s about one-third of the 182,000 DCFC ports that the National Renewable Energy Lab forecasted would be needed in 2030, implying two in three DCFC ports would not need to supply real-time data.42

Consumers Trust Chargers with Real-Time Data More Than Those Without

Charging infrastructure build-out can only spur EV adoption if consumers who are considering buying EVs trust that chargers work and that they can find an available one when they need it. We conducted two consumer surveys to understand how import­ant charging reliability is to potential EV buyers and the possible impact that providing better charging information could have on EV adoption. The surveys asked consumers about the probability of successfully charging at DCFCs with and without real-time data along US highways. Our survey results documented beliefs about charging reliability among current EV drivers and potential buyers, and this fed into our modeling of the impact that improved real-time data provision has on EV adoption.43

We asked the same questions to two groups of survey respondents: US-based EV drivers (for which we received 1,006 responses) and US-based non-EV drivers who expect to buy a new car soon (814 responses).44 For different DCFC stations (shown as images from PlugShare), we asked respon­dents about their perceived likelihood of successfully charging their vehicle with at least one plug in the time they were willing to wait (if all working chargers were occupied).

The survey revealed that respondents consis­tently were more confident that they could charge at a charger that was reported as available with real-time data than one that had no real-time data, as shown in Figure 1. But survey respondents also had low confidence even in chargers that reported being working and available.

Showing a striking level of doubt about charger reliability, EV drivers and prospective buyers believed they would have less than a two-thirds chance of a successful charge even at chargers that provide real-time data and are reported to be working and available. Prospective car buyers estimated that they could successfully charge at such a station 64.6 per­cent of the time, and current EV drivers estimated that they could successfully charge at such a station only 58.6 percent of the time.

Strikingly, EV owners are statistically significantly more pessimistic than prospective buyers were in all three scenarios.45 Real-time data and higher reli­ability would clearly reduce existing EV drivers’ uncertainty, raise their consumer surplus, and help retain them as EV drivers.

Still, EV drivers and prospective buyers had sub­stantially less confidence—around 40–50 percent—in chargers without real-time data and the odds of an occupied charger freeing up in the time they would be willing to wait. Respondents estimated a slightly higher chance of successfully charging at a station that had no real-time data (52.4 percent for prospec­tive buyers and 41.1 percent for EV drivers) com­pared with the odds of being able to charge at one where all chargers were occupied (47.9 percent for prospective buyers and 39.0 percent for EV drivers). This may indicate that they think occupied char­gers will not open up in a time frame that they are willing to wait.

We see two main reasons why drivers may believe that a charger reported to be working and avail­able may provide a successful charge only less than two-thirds of the time: congestion and overreport­ing of uptime. While the survey states that a charger is available when the driver checks PlugShare, driv­ers are likely aware that other drivers may arrive at and plug in to any free chargers before they reach the station. In their 2024 Annual Reliability Report, ChargerHelp stated that true uptime often falls short of reported uptime—and reported uptime is what real-time data captures. In particular, ChargerHelp found that 15 percent of stations they tested failed despite the app and the charger itself reporting that the station was online and available. These failures can happen because chargers are physically blocked, network connections or payments fail, or cords are too short.46

One in Three Highway DCFC Stations Posts Centralized Real-Time Data

In assessing the availability of centralized real-time data, we focus specifically on real-time data in charger locator apps for DCFCs on major US highways. Real-time data on chargers are available in main­stream general-purpose mapping apps, such as Apple Maps and Google Maps, and in specialized third-party charging locator apps, such as PlugShare. These apps report EV charger locations across the coun­try and generally also cover plug type and maximum charging speed.

We find that PlugShare has the best real-time data coverage of these three main apps.47 This section presents results from repeatedly scraping PlugShare, in which we focused on six major US highways: I-5, I-10, I-75, I-80, I-90, and I-95. We report the fraction of DCFCs providing real-time data, the CPOs that do and do not provide real-time data to PlugShare, and locations where real-time data are particularly sparse.

Across our six interstates on August 18, 2024, 34.4 percent of DCFC stations and 18.6 percent of plugs on average reported real-time data on PlugShare.48 Figure 2 shows whether chargers offer real-time data along these six interstates. Table 1 shows the number and share of highway-adjacent charging stations, with real-time data for each interstate.

The CPOs with the most stations and plugs in our sample, Tesla and EA, do not provide real-time data to PlugShare, Google Maps, or Apple Maps. The sec­ond set of rows in Table 1 provides these statistics for all non-Tesla stations. Excluding Tesla chargers brings the overall share of DCFC stations provid­ing real-time data to 53.4 percent, with a range from 39.6 percent on I-90 to 64.1 percent on I-5.

The last two rows in Table 1 exclude Tesla and Electrify America (EA) stations. EA chargers are available to non-Tesla drivers, but they do not pro­vide centralized real-time data. Excluding Tesla and EA chargers brings the total share of stations pro­viding real-time data to 70.9 percent, with a range of 54.3 percent on I-90 to 80.7 percent on I-5. Excluding them substantially improves the perceived fraction of stations providing real-time data, but it reduces the number of stations overall by over 53 percent (1,426 total stations vs. 669 when Tesla’s and EA’s are excluded). Tesla’s and EA’s share of plugs providing real-time data is lower, at 19.9 percent (vs. 33.2 per­cent for stations overall), because they tend to have large stations and subsequently more plugs.

The availability of centralized real-time data was stable from March to August 2024, as shown in Figure 3. Table B1 shows that there was also limited change in the availability of real-time data on November 19, 2024; for all six interstates, over­all real-time data availability improved by only 0.6 percent.

Data Deserts Exacerbate Limited Real-Time Data

Data deserts magnify the low share of highway-adjacent charging stations offering centralized real-time data. Some of these data deserts span distances longer than even the longest stated range of existing EV models,49 and therefore, road trips in these areas require careful research and planning in advance. EV drivers have no way of knowing whether a function­ing charger exists over distances of several hundred miles unless they cross-reference apps or can access more data through an in-vehicle automaker app (which may require a subscription). The cost of an error could be high: a tow to the next working DCFC (that is compatible with the driver’s vehicle) or hours spent at a Level 2 charger to gain enough charge to drive to the next working DCFC.

Figure 4 shows data deserts of 150 miles or longer on the six major interstates we studied on August 18, 2024. As Table 2 details, we found 13 data deserts: four on I-10, six on I-80, two on I-90, and one on I-95. I-5 and I-75 had none. Four of the data deserts were over 300 miles long, longer than the stated range of most current EV models: Deming, New Mexico, to Kerrville, Texas, (586 miles) and Baytown, Texas, to Robertsdale, Alabama, (466 miles) on I-10; Coalville, Utah, to Kearney, Nebraska, (709 miles) on I-80; and Post Falls, Idaho, to Blue Earth, Minnesota, (1,308 miles) on I-90. In identifying data deserts, we exclude chargers at auto dealerships, as many restrict chargers to their own customers only or allow charging only during certain hours.50

Several of these data deserts are adjacent, as Table 2 shows. On the 795 miles of I-10 between chargers in Tucson, Arizona, and Kerrville, Texas, the only intermediate chargers with real-time data are in Deming, New Mexico. On I-80, the 148-mile data desert from Truckee, California, to Lovelock, Nevada, is immediately adjacent to another 153-mile data desert to Carlin, Nevada. Between Perrysburg, Ohio, and Columbia, New Jersey, the only chargers with real-time data are in Emlenton, Pennsylvania. Real-time data availability is the worst on I-90, where across the 1,600-mile stretch from Post Falls, Idaho, to Madison, Wisconsin, there is a single station with real-time data in Blue Earth, Minnesota.

To be clear, these data deserts are not charging deserts; even on the 1,308 miles of I-90 between Post Falls and Blue Earth, publicly accessible DCFCs are available within two miles of the highway every 34 miles on average. The major problem we document is not an insufficient number of chargers along these highway stretches (although this may also be the case) but rather that there is insufficient information about those chargers to ensure these trips will be fea­sible and ease range anxiety.

In recent months, data deserts have improved marginally on our six interstates. What is now a 226-mile data desert between Tallahassee, Florida, and Robertsdale, Alabama, was a 385-mile desert between Jacksonville, Florida, and Daphne, Alabama, as of April 2024. The addition of a ChargePoint charger in Pensacola, Florida, and an EVConnect charger in Tallahassee, both reporting real-time data, have improved EV drivers’ ability to find charging on the Florida Panhandle.

These data deserts may continue to shrink and even disappear as NEVI chargers requiring real-time data reporting are built throughout the coun­try, but progress on this front has been slow. As of November 26, 2024, 31 NEVI charging stations with 126 total ports were operating across nine states—as compared with the program’s original objective of four NEVI DCFCs posting real-time data every 50 miles.51 A total of 41 states had ini­tiated their NEVI procurement process, while 11 had not.52

The Impact of Real-Time Data on EV Adoption

Using a model of driver choice between buying an EV and buying an ICE vehicle, we estimate that centralized real-time data would substantially increase EV sales, raise the number of registered EVs in the US, and reduce carbon emissions.53 Specifically, we estimate that the EV share of new vehicle sales would be 6.4 percentage points higher in 2030, raising the number of registered EVs in the US by 9.2 percent, both versus baseline forecasts.

These estimates assume not only that universal, centralized real-time data will be available but also that the data will shine light on nonworking char­gers, leading CPOs to achieve higher reliability, which will in turn enable drivers to trust real-time data and have more confidence in their ability to reli­ably charge. In effect, real-time data can eliminate range anxiety. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the increase in EV adoption and the EV fleet size as a result of universal real-time data. Our modeling methodology is detailed in our working paper, updated with sev­eral changes from Elaine Buckberg and Cassandra Cole’s 2025 report.54

The positive effect of real-time data on EV adop­tion is robust to these modeling changes and the change in the 2024 policy baseline (used in our working paper) and the OBBBA baseline, includ­ing the termination of the IRA’s EV and charger tax credits. Estimates from our working paper indicate that full real-time data plus reliability and consumer trust would increase the 2030 EV share of new vehicle sales by 8.0 percentage points, from 48 to 56 percent, against a December 31, 2024, policy baseline. The updated estimates predict an impact of 6.4 percentage points on top of the OBBBA base­line, from 39.5 to 45.9 percent. We have estimated the impact of real-time data on the EV share of new vehi­cle sales in 2030 at different tax-credit levels and find essentially zero variation.55 We have also confirmed with more recent modeling that real-time data can yield a similar increase in EV adoption against alter­native baseline scenarios. Buckberg and Cole have modeled how potential changes in federal EV policy under the Trump administration would change the trajectory of EV adoption.56

Improving real-time data, uptime, and consumer confidence in the data could lead to more EVs on the road and reduce carbon emissions by up to an addi­tional 15.2 million metric tons—or an added 18.7 percent—relative to the carbon emissions reductions projected under the IRA and IIJA without these improvements.57 Figure 7 shows the difference in carbon emissions by year. Moreover, compared with the $451 billion in government expenditures for the IRA and IIJA’s EV provisions estimated in Cole et al., requiring real-time data would be comparatively costless to the government.58

Policy and Market Solutions to Yield Real-Time Data Sharing

As mentioned previously, the EV charging market today has the potential to evolve in two ways: Either all CPOs will provide real-time data, yielding higher EV adoption and lower carbon emissions, or no CPOs will provide real-time data outside a limited set of chargers that require it, including the NEVI chargers. The information-sharing equilibrium is better from a societal perspective.

Options for Achieving Real-Time Data Sharing

An obstacle to achieving universal real-time data sharing is incentivizing CPOs to provide open real-time DCFC data. A variety of private-sector apps exist for finding EV routes and chargers, including Google Maps, Apple Maps, PlugShare, Chargeway, and auto­makers’ proprietary apps. Proprietary apps often negotiate access to more CPOs than the free apps offer—but automaker apps are free for a limited time, after which the vehicle owner must pay for access, as noted earlier.59

As the EV market matures and low to middle-income households increasingly purchase used EVs, these price-sensitive buyers are less likely to pay a monthly subscription to find chargers—a potential obstacle to used-EV sales. Thinking ahead and plan­ning for a healthy used-EV market is essential to creating a healthy new EV market today.

We consider three approaches to achieving universal real-time data sharing.

Pure Market Approach

A pure market approach has clearly been unsuc­cessful, given that the two largest CPOs do not have open real-time data. While it could improve in time—especially if big-budget new entrants shared data and created competitive pressure for large incumbents to do so—waiting to see whether that happens risks stalling EV adoption. Automaker consortium IONNA and BP Pulse already share real-time data. However, the large market shares of Tesla and EA, combined with their importance on remote highway corridors, reduces the odds that they will be quickly pressed to share real-time data or that drivers will have adequate real-time data anytime soon.

A Federal Requirement and Centralized API

While the federal government could require univer­sal real-time data by law, that is unlikely to happen under the Trump administration given its aim to with­draw federal support for EV adoption, its cutbacks to federal data provision,60 and its broader efforts to reduce regulation.

While improbable, a federal requirement would be advantageous because it would use a single entity to monitor and enforce compliance, versus individ­ual states needing to separately enforce it, including developing their own capabilities to do so. Enforce­ment could be easier if CPOs had to provide their data to a centralized federal API, which would then provide open data to EV drivers.

State Requirements

Currently, state requirements may be the most likely way to achieve universal real-time data sharing. How­ever, multiple state legislatures must act to achieve a tipping point that may induce CPOs to share real-time data nationally. States have less power and are less efficient in achieving compliance.

The biggest costs of any real-time data require­ment would be monitoring and enforcement. States could reduce costs by cooperating to monitor and enforce compliance, possibly by enlisting a multistate organization like the National Association of State Energy Officials or the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which could in turn contract a third party.

Achieving Higher EV Adoption Through State Real-Time Data Requirements

State action offers the best path to drive the EV mar­ket to the information-sharing equilibrium of universal, centralized real-time charger data and faster EV adoption. How would this work?

States should follow the IIJA’s example and require real-time data—ideally for all publicly available chargers in their state, but at minimum for new DCFCs the state and ratepayers fund. As we noted earlier, three states are already moving to address this. Massachusetts recently legislated a real-time data requirement for all new chargers receiving federal, state, or ratepayer funding.61 The proposed California regulations would compel all new state- and ratepayer-funded chargers to post real-time data.62 Maryland considered requiring real-time data for all chargers in the state and has legislated the creation of a com­mittee to further evaluate the proposal.63 While the Massachusetts and California laws affect only publicly funded chargers, they could induce CPOs to disclose real-time data for all their chargers to give custom­ers in those states a consistent experience across that CPO’s chargers.

Model legislation, presented in Appendix A, can push states to adopt common real-time data dis­closure standards that are consistent with the IIJA standards. Common standards would be easier for charging providers (CPOs) and therefore reduce resistance to data sharing. To curb any resistance, states could include technical minimums, such as enforcing the standards on all DCFC plus Level 2 chargers installed after a certain date only, to ensure that the affected chargers are capable of sharing real-time data.

Real-time data sharing could further a state’s envi­ronmental and economic goals, as the model legisla­tion reflects. Benefits include protecting consumers, promoting EV deployment, easing travel for EV driv­ers, and improving public safety by making it easier for EV drivers to locate a working and free charger while driving. Price transparency would create a more com­petitive market. Another economic benefit is attracting EV-driving tourists, who might choose not to visit the state if it’s hard to reliably find a charger there.

While some CPOs may nonetheless object to data sharing—particularly those sharing only via propri­etary apps today—if they publish their real-time data in certain apps or websites, it would undermine a potential legal claim that the state is unconstitution­ally “taking” a trade secret or other company prop­erty. Applying the disclosure requirement to only new chargers could further insulate the policy from a tak­ings lawsuit because companies considering invest­ment decisions would be on notice that they would have to share real-time data. Limiting the require­ment to new chargers also avoids any burden of retro­fitting existing chargers.

To further mitigate the potential for lawsuits, states should allow CPOs to attach reasonable data-use conditions, as CPOs do in their own apps, even when the data are obtained through third-party software devel­opers, such as Google. The model legislation includes such language. States could also offer regulatory ben­efits in exchange for disclosure, such as exemptions from public utility commission regulation. Moreover, the model legislation does not call for sharing other potentially valuable data such as the length of individ­ual charging sessions, initial and final charge states, and patterns by charger location, EV model, or spe­cific vehicles.

Finally, because the model legislation is narrowly tailored to accelerate EV adoption and would help a state achieve its environmental and economic pol­icy goals, the data-sharing provision would not be an unconstitutional compulsion of commercial speech. When states demonstrate a reasonable relation­ship between their legitimate policy goals and the required disclosure of accurate and factual commer­cial information, courts tend to reject First Amend­ment challenges. Only a few states may need to require disclosure to tip the market outcome to the information-sharing equilibrium. The broader the requirement in any state, and the more states that adopt real-time data requirements, the more rap­idly the equilibrium may tip to universal real-time data sharing.

If CPOs provide centralized real-time data for chargers only in states where it is explicitly required, they would risk offering customers an inconsis­tent and confusing experience—especially in metro areas that span two or more states. CPOs may quickly decide that it is easier and more customer friendly to meet the real-time data sharing require­ments across the board, rather than do it only in the states that require it and on any NEVI chargers they operate. Large, new CPO-market entrants may pro­vide real-time data on all their chargers in the face of these requirements, putting pressure on large incumbents to do so as well.

In exchange for voluntarily posting their real-time data to an API where any software developer can access it, the CPOs would enjoy the benefits of a faster growing market. A 13 percent larger US fleet of EVs in 2030, as our modeling indicates, would enable charging providers to amortize their investments more rapidly.

Even before real-time data sharing becomes stan­dard practice, the regional nature of the Battery Belt, ZEV, and Clean Car states also means that long, mul­tistate stretches of major highways could be trans­formed by state action, alleviating range anxiety for many road trips. If all 17 ZEV and Clean Car states plus Washington, DC, set universal real-time data disclosure requirements, then large regions of the country would become EV travel friendly: all high­ways in the mid-Atlantic and New England (excluding New Hampshire), the West Coast (plus Nevada), and Colorado and Minnesota. (See Figure 8.) The ZEV and Clean Car states represent 40.2 percent of US registered vehicles.64

If the 11 additional Battery Belt states (which have at least $10 billion in EV or battery plant investment and 9,500 jobs announced)65 also set real-time data disclosure requirements, it would cover the highways in 28 states, plus Washington, DC. (See Table B3.) EV drivers could go from Alabama to Maine or Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, from New York to Chicago’s Indiana suburbs, from Seattle to Tucson, and throughout Texas. Those 28 states have 67 percent of the nation’s registered vehicles.66 Yet other states might decide to follow so as not to be at a disadvantage in attracting tourism—such as Western states, where tourism may center on people driving to national parks.

Once multiple states adopt real-time data require­ments, those states could reduce their implementa­tion costs by cooperating with each other to monitor and notify CPOs and enforce the requirements. Standardizing states’ requirements would facilitate joint monitoring and enforcement.

Conclusion

States’ most powerful lever for accelerating EV adop­tion is essentially free from a state budget perspective: Follow the example of the IIJA and require real-time data for chargers in their state. We estimate that making real-time data universal for highway DCFCs would raise the 2030 EV share of new vehicle sales by 6.4 percentage points. As a result, there would be 3.5 million more EVs on the road by 2030, a 9.2 per­cent increase versus the baseline forecast. The fiscal cost is near zero.

Massachusetts has moved forward already, requir­ing any new charger receiving state, federal, or rate­payer funding to post real-time data. The California Energy Commission has issued draft regulations that would require posting real-time data for all new char­gers funded by the state and electricity ratepayers. Maryland has created a commission to study requir­ing real-time data for chargers in the state.

Model legislation, which can be found in Appendix A, can facilitate states adopting common real-time data disclosure standards that are consistent with the IIJA’s. Common requirements would be easier for CPOs and therefore reduce their resistance to data sharing.

Only a few states may need to require disclosure to motivate the EV market to comply as a whole. Even if the majority of states don’t require CPOs to share their EV chargers’ real-time data, the regional nature of the Battery Belt, ZEV, and Clean Car states could mean that long, multistate stretches of major high­ways could be quickly transformed by state action, alleviating range anxiety for many road trips just through state action.

Section 1. Legislative Findings

a. The legislature finds that it is in the best inter­ests of the state to encourage private-sector investment in infrastructure, including public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

b. The legislature finds that transparency into the real-time pricing and availability of public charging stations is essential for protecting con­sumers, promoting EV deployment, and foster­ing the rapid installation and widespread use of public charging stations.

c. The legislature finds that a robust network of privately owned public charging stations that provide consumers with transparent informa­tion about real-time pricing and availability will ease travel along the state’s roadways, improve public safety by simplifying how drivers locate available chargers, and reduce the time driv­ers spend searching for a charger or waiting to charge.

If the Administration follows through and gets this right, it will have big implications for our work in the South.

“Climate change and environmental injustice are urgent priorities for SELC, and we are grateful to have a federal Administration that shares our commitment,” says SELC Program Director DJ Gerken. “The South is the front line for tackling these twin crises and we look forward to applying SELC’s on-the-ground expertise to help the Administration find practical solutions.”

On the campaign trail, climate and equity action was one of Biden’s biggest promises. Here’s a look at how his team is managing our county’s top environmental concerns, and how they will affect our region.

Environmental justice

With the creation of the White House Council on Environmental Justice and a directive to all federal agencies to develop strategies for addressing disproportionate environmental impacts, the new administration is already working toward securing a healthy environment for all Americans.

A new initiative called Justice40 would require 40 percent of the benefits from federal investments in clean energy and clean water to go to communities bearing disproportionate pollution.

Environmental justice is paramount in the South, given its long history of racial injustice and inequity. For years, SELC has been working with partners across the region to enforce laws that fight environmental injustice because we’ve seen the gaps that cause some communities to be overlooked.

“SELC is determined to close those gaps in the law,” says Senior Attorney Chandra Taylor, who specializes in environmental justice. “And after four years of major setbacks, we’re grateful for an administration that’s finally on the same page about the unjust climate impacts these communities have been forced to bare.”

Climate action

On his first day in office, President Biden signed an Executive Order to rejoin the Paris Accord—the worldwide agreement on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and finance that the previous administration opted to withdraw from.

In stark contrast to a White House bent on denying climate change, Biden is pushing for a carbon pollution-free electricity sector no later than 2035, and to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. The new administration has also paused new oil and gas leasing on all public lands and waters, including the Outer Continental Shelf, adding further obstacles to fossil fuel companies seeking to drill in the Atlantic Ocean.

In the South, we’re already leading the way on deploying the clean energy needed to meet that ambitious goal, and we’re working to accelerate that change even faster.

Coastal resilience

We’ve known our seas are rising—in fact, we produced an entire podcast season on the many ways Southern cities like Norfolk and Charleston are navigating the changing tides.

Biden’s team has directed every federal agency to develop proposals to bolster adaptation and resilience to this climate crisis we’re all too familiar with in the South.

“SELC has deep expertise working with local and state partners to build climate resilient communities across our region,” says Gerken. “We will apply that experience to help the Administration tale concrete steps with real world benefit.”

Directive to review Navigable Waters Rule

SELC has led the fight to stop the greatest loss of clean water protections in American history, initiated by Trump’s gutting of the Clean Water Act, which significantly reduced the scope of which streams and wetlands are protected.

A critical review of the Navigable Waters Rule would help so much of our work in the South, including protecting the iconic Okefenokee Swamp and National Wildlife Refuge from a titanium mine enabled by the Trump rollbacks.

Conserve 30% of our lands and waters

“Southerners love our public lands, but the Trump administration fought tooth and nail to silence our voices about how they should be managed,” says Gerken.

Too often, national discussion about public lands and conservation focus on western landscapes. It is critical that the east, and especially the southeast, where resources are accessible and enjoyed by millions of Americans and strained by our rapidly developing region be front and center.

As the new administration mulls over how to use and protect our public lands, we’re committed to making sure there’s a seat at the table for the Southeast.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/iStock_000025252790_Large-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 06:02:09.613638

On Tuesday, LG Chem announced that Toyota Tsusho Co., the trading arm of Toyota Group, acquired a 25 percent stake in LG’s cathode material plant in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, making it the second-largest shareholder after LG Chem, which retains 51 percent.

The investment is estimated at around 170 billion won ($122.6 million).

With its initial acquisition of a stake in LG Chem’s facility, Toyota Tsusho plans to supply products from the Gumi plant to battery-makers in North America.

The acquisition also reduced the stake of LG Chem’s Chinese partner, Huayou Cobalt, from 49 to 24 percent. The change eliminated any risk of the plant’s customers losing eligibility for Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, a US tax incentive for domestic battery production under the IRA.

“Toyota Tsusho’s stake marks a significant turning point for LG Chem in responding to US IRA regulations and enhancing our competitiveness in global cathode material supply,” said Shin Hak-cheol, LG Chem vice chair and CEO.

Under the IRA, companies with more than 25 percent of voting shares, stock, or board seats held by countries it calls ""covered nations"" — China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran — are classified as ""foreign entities of concern,"" or FEOCs. Starting in 2026, only batteries containing at least 60 percent of materials from non-FEOCs will qualify for the tax credit, with the threshold gradually rising to 85 percent by 2030.

In response, LG Chem sought to reduce the stake its Chinese partner had in the facility, a major manufacturing base with an annual capacity of 66,000 tons.

The new partnership builds on years of collaboration between LG Chem and Toyota in cathode materials.

In 2023, LG secured a contract from Toyota Engineering & Manufacturing North America, the Japanese automaker’s North American manufacturing arm, for 2.9 trillion won worth of cathode materials through 2030. This was followed by another deal last year to supply materials for Prime Planet Energy & Solutions, the joint venture between Panasonic and Toyota Motor Co., Toyota Group’s automaker.

For Jindalee Lithium Limited (ASX:JLL), the decision to pursue a U.S. listing represents a calculated strategic move to capitalize on North America’s surging lithium demand while aligning with federal policies designed to secure domestic supply chains. With the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) creating a regulatory tailwind, Jindalee’s McDermitt Lithium Project is positioned to benefit from both market dynamics and policy-driven incentives.

Strategic Positioning in a High-Growth Market

Jindalee’s McDermitt Lithium Project, located on the Oregon-Nevada border, is one of the largest lithium deposits in the United States [1]. The project’s proximity to major transportation corridors and its clay-based lithium resource—known for lower environmental impact compared to hard-rock extraction—position it as a competitive player in the U.S. market. In September 2024, the company announced approval for a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) and secured non-dilutive grant funding from the Department of Defense (DoD) to accelerate development [2]. This funding, coupled with a $3.02 billion capital estimate prepared by Fluor Corporation, underscores the project’s scalability and long-term viability [3].

The U.S. listing strategy, formalized through a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with HiTech Minerals, reflects Jindalee’s intent to access U.S. capital markets and align with domestic stakeholders. This move is particularly timely, as the U.S. seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign lithium imports. According to a report by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the IRA’s 2024–2025 sourcing requirements mandate that 50% and 60% of critical minerals used in clean vehicles must originate from the U.S. or allied nations [4]. By establishing a domestic production footprint, Jindalee is well-positioned to meet these criteria and qualify for IRA tax credits, which could significantly enhance project economics.

Regulatory Tailwinds: IRA and DOE Support

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has emerged as a cornerstone of U.S. critical minerals policy, allocating $369 billion for clean energy initiatives and offering a $3,750 tax credit for EVs produced with domestically sourced materials [5]. For Jindalee, the McDermitt Project’s alignment with IRA requirements is a strategic advantage. The project’s integration of mining and refining operations qualifies it for the Section 45X tax credit, which incentivizes domestic production of critical minerals [6]. This credit, finalized in late 2024, provides a direct financial benefit for companies like Jindalee that aim to localize supply chains [7].

Beyond the IRA, the DOE has demonstrated a commitment to supporting lithium projects through loan programs. For example, Lithium Americas recently secured a $2.26 billion loan for its Thacker Pass project, highlighting the federal government’s willingness to fund large-scale domestic production [8]. While Jindalee’s application for a DOE grant to develop a lithium processing facility was unsuccessful, the company remains eligible for future funding as the U.S. continues to prioritize critical mineral security [9]. This ongoing support signals a favorable regulatory environment for Jindalee’s long-term growth.

Market Dynamics and Competitive Edge

The U.S. lithium market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 15% through 2030, driven by EV adoption and grid-scale energy storage demand [10]. Jindalee’s McDermitt Project, with its potential to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate, is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. A recent PFS indicated that the project could supply enough lithium to power 370,000 EVs annually, rivaling other U.S. projects like Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge [11].

Moreover, Jindalee’s U.S. listing strategy aligns with broader industry trends. For instance, SAGA Metals’ successful IPO in 2024 demonstrated the viability of accessing U.S. capital markets for mineral exploration [12]. By following a similar path, Jindalee can leverage North American investor appetite for critical minerals while mitigating currency and regulatory risks associated with cross-border operations.

Risks and Mitigation

While Jindalee’s strategy is compelling, challenges remain. The unsuccessful DOE grant application for processing facility development highlights the competitive nature of federal funding [13]. Additionally, the IRA’s sourcing requirements necessitate rigorous due diligence to ensure compliance with FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) guidelines. However, Jindalee’s proactive engagement with the DoD and its focus on domestic partnerships mitigate these risks. The company’s recent collaboration with Fluor Corporation for engineering services further strengthens its technical and operational capabilities [14].

Conclusion

Jindalee Lithium’s U.S. listing strategy is a masterstroke in a market defined by regulatory support and surging demand. By leveraging the IRA’s tax incentives, securing DoD funding, and aligning with U.S. critical minerals policies, the company is poised to become a cornerstone of North America’s lithium supply chain. As the U.S. races to decarbonize its economy, Jindalee’s McDermitt Project represents not just a strategic asset but a critical enabler of energy independence.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 08:01:08.731453

Now, President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act has set a very different course.

For too long, emerging economies have faced what seemed like a stark trade-off between growth and sustainability. As this report highlights, China’s green ascent challenges that assumption.

Through scale, innovation and long-term planning, China is demonstrating that decarbonisation can go hand in hand with industrial upgrading, job creation and improved quality of life. These lessons carry significance not only for China, but for the broader region – especially Southeast Asia, where energy demand is rising and development needs remain pressing.

Of course, China’s experience is not a one-size-fits-all blueprint. Each country must chart its own course, shaped by its unique resources, needs and priorities. Still, China provides a valuable reference point – showing what is possible when long-term vision is matched with pragmatic, coordinated action.

For Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, the task ahead is to translate that possibility into tailored strategies. The choices we make today will shape the direction of our economies and the well-being of generations to come. To build a better future, one of the most promising paths lies in seizing the opportunities of the energy transition – and doing so together.

His Excellency Dr Suwit Khunkitti

Chair, Advisory Committee of the International Society for Energy Transition Studies (ISETS)

Former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand

China’s clean energy transition is fundamentally reshaping the economics of energy across the world. Accelerating deployment of renewables, grids and storage in China, combined with electrification of transport, buildings and industry, are rapidly bringing China itself towards a peak in energy-related fossil fuel use, while also reducing costs and accelerating uptake of clean electro-technologies in other countries. These twin trends are creating the conditions for energy-related fossil fuel use globally to peak and decline.

China’s adoption of renewable energy continues to accelerate. In 2024, wind and solar electricity generation rose by 25% compared with the previous year. In the first half of 2025 it was 27% higher than in H1 2024 – enough, alongside other trends, to cut fossil fuel generation by 2% compared with H1 2024. In the 12 months to June 2025, wind and solar (2,073 TWh) generated more electricity than all other clean sources (nuclear, hydro and bioenergy) combined (1,936 TWh). Just four years ago, wind and solar generated half as much electricity as other clean sources combined.

The renewables transformation is underpinned by world-leading investment in clean energy, energy storage and transmission grids. China is the biggest investor in clean energy worldwide, spending $625 billion USD in 2024 – 31% of the global total of $2,033bn. The volume of installed battery storage tripled in the three years to 2024. Grid investment rose to an all-time high in 2024 of 608 billion RMB ($85bn USD), up by 25% from 486 billion RMB ($68bn) in 2019.

Beyond electricity, the transition is reshaping end-use sectors. Electricity is comfortably the biggest energy source in buildings, and in 2023 overtook coal to become the biggest energy source for industry. Oil-derived fuels still dominate in transport, but China’s rapidly-expanding electric vehicle fleet is progressively gaining ground. The share of electricity in final energy demand across the wider economy continues to grow, reaching 32% in 2023, out-pacing many mature economies.

China has embarked on this transition for a variety of reasons. Interviews with experts conducted for this report reveal that within China there is a realisation that the old development paradigm centred on fossil fuels has run its course, and is not fit for 21st century realities. The government’s aim to establish an ‘ecological civilisation,’ which simultaneously delivers on economic, social and environmental goals, is the response, embedded in the Constitution since 2018.

The clean energy transition is constraining China’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, reducing energy costs, stimulating growth and jobs and creating export markets. In 2024, investment and production in clean energy contributed 13.6 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion) to the national economy – a sum equivalent to about one-tenth of China’s GDP, or the total GDP of Australia – and the sector is growing three times faster than the Chinese economy overall. The depth of buy-in within business is reflected in research, development and innovation: Chinese companies now account for about 75% of global patent applications in clean energy technology, up from just 5% in 2000.

These investments in the clean energy future are driving dramatic cost reductions across the world in key technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, storage batteries and electric vehicles. The benefits are increasingly being felt in emerging markets, many of which are overtaking OECD countries in wind and solar generation share and in electrification.

China is rapidly electrifying heating, industry and transport

Having grown by an average 4.7% per year in the decade to 2015, final energy-related fossil fuel consumption outside the power sector (in buildings, industry and transport) has since fallen by an average of 0.2% per year. In 2023 the share of electricity in final energy consumption in China reached 32%, and is increasing by about 1 percentage point per year. Electricity is by far the largest source of energy in buildings, supplying 39% of final energy demand, and in 2023 overtook coal to become the largest source of energy in industry (31% of final energy demand). By contrast the EU and US electrification rate has remained stagnant at 24% since 2010.

China’s investment in the electro-technology revolution is creating choices for every other country, unlocking a clean, more affordable and secure energy future and opening the door to a new diplomacy, moving beyond the geopolitics of oil and gas. Most profoundly, China is showing that a highly electrified energy system centred on wind and solar generation is entirely compatible with a modern, growing, highly industrialised economy.

The scale, pace and depth of China’s transition raises questions about the future of fossil fuel production globally. China has been the main ‘swing state’ for global fossil fuel demand for a decade. Its energy-related fossil fuel consumption is likely to begin falling soon due to the twin trends of clean generation and end-use electrification, and made-in-China electro-technologies are displacing fossil energy across the world. The implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CETR_2025_v0.png,N,,2025-09-09 05:00:34.085764

In 1H 2025, biofuel imports averaged just 2,000 b/d, down from 35,000 b/d a year earlier, while renewable diesel imports fell to 5,000 b/d from 33,000 b/d, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) report last week.

One key reason for the sharp drop was a change in US tax policy.

Until the end of 2024, both imported and domestically produced biofuels qualified for a $1 per gallon blender's tax credit (BTC), which was paid to companies blending the fuels into the US supply.

Starting January 1, 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act replaced this system with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. Unlike the BTC, the new credit only applies to biofuels produced in the US, putting imports at a clear economic disadvantage.

At the same time, weaker blending economics cut overall US demand for biomass-based diesel.

Renewable diesel consumption fell about 30% year-on-year in 1H 2025, while biofuel demand declined 40%.

As a result, domestic producers supplied the reduced volumes being blended, leaving little room for imports.

""For example, Neste, the producer of all of the renewable diesel imported to the United States, reported a lower share of exports going to the United States in 1H25 than in 1H24,"" the EIA said.

The agency sees US biofuels consumption to rise later this year to meet Renewable Fuel Standard mandates, and imports are likely to remain subdued under the current tax regime.

The EIA projects biofuel net imports in 2025 and 2026 to be the lowest since 2012.

Though the use of biofuel bunkered by international ships in the US has seen limited uptake, it has been more common in domestic shipping. Limited imports could add further pressure on availability for the marine sector.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_5d991c2f32b0523938eaeebcfba47251.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 01:59:24.477779

The Trump administration has eliminated almost all federal support for renewable energies and has pressured countries to purchase American fossil fuels as part of trade deals.
The falling cost of renewable energy, though, means that many countries, particularly poorer ones, have a strong incentive to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
When the world’s fossil fuel use will peak also comes down to the pace of that change in China itself.
But last year, China met 84 percent of its electricity demand growth with solar and wind power, according to the report.","Since the beginning of the industrial age, the global economy has required more and more fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — to power growth.

It is increasingly clear, however, that China’s aggressive efforts to sell batteries, solar panels and wind turbines to the world is on course to bring that era to an end, a new report says. The Chinese dominance of clean-energy industries is “creating the conditions for a decline in fossil fuel use,” according to a report by Ember, a research group focused on the prospects for clean-energy technologies.

The report includes a sprawling set of data to support its claim.

The scale of Chinese production since 2010 has driven the price of these technologies down by 60 to 90 percent, the researchers found. And last year, more than 90 percent of wind and solar projects commissioned worldwide produced power more cheaply than the cheapest available fossil-fuel alternative, they said. That cost advantage might have seemed laughable before China began pumping billions of dollars of subsidies into the sector.

“China is the engine,” said Richard Black, the report’s editor. “And it is changing the energy landscape not just domestically but in countries across the world.”

If Beijing is trying to wrest the future of energy from anyone, it would be the United States, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer and exporter. The Trump administration has eliminated almost all federal support for renewable energies and has pressured countries to purchase American fossil fuels as part of trade deals.

The falling cost of renewable energy, though, means that many countries, particularly poorer ones, have a strong incentive to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.

According to Ember’s report, the falling costs of energy produced by Chinese-made wind and solar installations have allowed countries like Mexico, Bangladesh and Malaysia to race past the United States in recent years in terms of using renewably produced electricity (rather than fossil fuels) in everyday activities like heating and cooling buildings or powering vehicles.

Across Africa, solar panel imports from China rose 60 percent in the last 12 months, and 20 African countries imported a record amount over that period, Ember said in a separate study recently.

China has pushed for dominance in renewable energy partly for economic reasons and also to protect its national security by limiting its reliance on oil imports. But the implications for the planet’s health could scarcely be greater. Scientific consensus has long been that a sharp decline in fossil fuel use is the surest way to lessen the pace of climate change.

“For too long, emerging economies have faced what seemed like a stark trade-off between growth and sustainability,” said Suwit Khunkitti, Thailand’s former deputy prime minister. The Ember report “challenges that assumption,” he said.

To be sure, some countries would not be keen to rely so heavily on Chinese technology for geopolitical reasons. And few developing countries have the spending capacity to install the kinds of energy transmission and storage capacity that has allowed China to transform its own domestic energy grid so quickly.

When the world’s fossil fuel use will peak also comes down to the pace of that change in China itself.

China still burns more coal than the rest of the world combined and emits more climate pollution than the United States and Europe together. The country has not yet seen a decline in coal usage overall, though its total greenhouse gas emissions have reached what looks like a plateau.

But last year, China met 84 percent of its electricity demand growth with solar and wind power, according to the report. That meant it was able to cut fossil fuel use by 2 percent, despite a growing demand for power.

China is still building dozens of new coal-burning power plants, he said, but instead of running constantly like many existing ones, they might be at full capacity only during peaks in energy demand. Meanwhile, the contribution of wind and solar to the grid was quickly growing, he said.

“Coal is increasingly acting like training wheels,” said Yuan Jiahai, a professor at North China Electric Power University. “It provides balance and backup while the clean electricity system gains strength and confidence.”

China’s economy as a whole is increasingly reliant on the clean energy sector.

Investment and production in clean energy last year contributed nearly $2 trillion to China’s economy, a figure which the report said was around one-tenth of the country’s economy as a whole, or comparable to Australia’s entire economy. The clean energy sector grew at a rate three times that of China’s economy overall, according to the report.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/08/multimedia/08cli-china-report-kgcq/08cli-china-report-kgcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 00:59:56.051514

“Residential retail electricity prices are set with basically a lag,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel recently told The Hill.

“In the last couple of years, different items that have gone up in price have become media concerns. They become very visible, people get very angry — and I think electric rates are heading in that direction,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.

Wolfe said that if rates continue to rise, “it’ll become a political issue.”

The Trump administration is already seeing it as one — and trying to put the blame on Democrats and renewable energy.

“That is a key challenge for us,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria” when asked about utility bills last week.

“Things move slowly in the electricity grid. All sorts of crazy projects were under construction and being built on your electricity grids over the last four years,” he said.

Wright, in a recent interview with Politico, similarly blamed “the momentum of the Obama-Biden policies.”

However, he lamented, “We’re going to get blamed, because we’re in office.”

President Trump has taken a similar tack, decrying “ridiculous, corrupt politician approved ‘’windmills.’”

Meanwhile, Democrats are beginning to weaponize the issue against Republicans, especially after they repealed subsidies for wind and solar energy.

Experts say a buildout of renewables would help bring down prices, but the impacts of Trump’s moves are not being felt yet.

“Residential retail electricity prices are set with basically a lag,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel recently told The Hill. “Trump’s effects on the rate changes won’t take place until after the midterms.”

With Washington in retreat, governors and mayors need to double down on clean energy investments that make sense economically, fiscally and environmentally.
Use emergency authorities to expedite the contracting and regulatory processes necessary for clean energy projects.
Doing so could expedite government procurement and regulatory review for many clean energy projects.
State and local governments are dealing with enormous economic uncertainty, so new, recurring funding for clean energy investments may be difficult to find.","The shift to clean energy is well underway in the U.S. This momentum will continue, but the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) creates serious and significant obstacles to this transition.

With Washington in retreat, governors and mayors need to double down on clean energy investments that make sense economically, fiscally and environmentally.

Federal tax incentives — along with grants under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 — were speeding the development and deployment of clean energy projects. Without these incentives, progress will slow. According to the Princeton REPEAT project, the percentage of electricity generated by carbon-free sources will rise to just 57 percent by 2035, compared to 74 percent if all the clean energy incentives under IRA remained in place.

Under OBBA, solar and wind projects must commence construction by July 2026 or the project must be in service by 2027 in order to qualify for tax credits. For the purchase of eligible electric vehicles and charging equipment, the timeline is even shorter: Vehicles must be acquired by the end of this month and charging stations must be in service by the end of June 2026.

In response, state and local governments need to speed up existing planning, design and procurement efforts related to clean energy projects where federal incentives are about to be eliminated.

Here are a few ways to do this:

Reset capital plans to take advantage of the remaining window for key tax credits. For public projects where direct pay is available as a funding source, revise multiyear capital plans to move what might have been outyear projects to the front of the line to take advantage of direct pay.

Use emergency authorities to expedite the contracting and regulatory processes necessary for clean energy projects. State and local governments should seriously consider declaring a state of emergency based on the threat to the environment from climate change. Doing so could expedite government procurement and regulatory review for many clean energy projects.

Focus on projects that utilize the IRA’s remaining clean energy credits. State and local governments should also focus on planning and executing projects where tax benefits remain available under direct pay beyond 2027. Under the reconciliation bill, the tax credits for storage, geothermal, hydropower and nuclear remain largely intact. Some of the most ambitious public-sector projects that have already benefited from tax credits under direct pay were for investments in geothermal power that would seem to continue to be available under the reconciliation bill.

Expand the use of and availability of technical assistance to local governments and nonprofit organizations. In addition to the early phaseout of solar and wind credits, OBBA also imposes a new set of restrictions on projects involving prohibited foreign entities (PFEs). Rules related to the beginning of construction and PFE guidance documents are likely to make accessing tax credits for wind and solar projects before the phaseout more complicated. Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island were all at the forefront of developing technical assistance programs before OBBA.

States’ Own Money

State and local governments should also consider creating new dedicated funding sources for clean energy investments that will pay for themselves over time in operational savings.

Illinois passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in 2021, one year before the IRA. One Illinois solar developer predicted that a solar project with IRA tax credits that would have paid for itself in three years will now take five years to pay for itself; without state incentives, it would take 10 years.

Denver; Orange County, N.C.; and Portland, Ore., were all well positioned to take advantage of direct pay because they had already created dedicated funding sources for clean energy investments prior to IRA’s passage.

State and local governments are dealing with enormous economic uncertainty, so new, recurring funding for clean energy investments may be difficult to find. One answer may be reserve funds. Still, in many ways, this is a difficult time for state and local governments to dip into their reserve funds because of economic uncertainty and the need to address funding gaps in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program created by OBBA.

But state and local governments with healthy fund balances should assess whether they can use reserve funding for nonrecurring investments in government clean energy projects that will save money over the long term.

From PDX, Delta offers Oregonians nonstop service to nearly all of Delta’s hub airports, providing customers with more than 300 one-stop destinations.","Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and Portland International Airport (PDX), has taken delivery of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into the PDX fuel system, marking the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX. This achievement not only expands Delta’s SAF footprint but positions PDX – owned and operated by the Port of Portland – to capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the U.S.

The batch of more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF was made in the U.S. from waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal in Portland where it was blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck and pipeline. Earlier this month, the blended SAF entered the airport’s privately owned fuel supply system.

“Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.”

“We're excited about this step toward bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities,” said Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger. “We're looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.”

SAF is an alternative jet fuel made from renewable sources that can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80%, when compared to conventional jet fuel. Existing jet fuel infrastructure can be leveraged to deliver SAF to airports today, and it is safe to use in current aircraft engines. However, the technology to produce it remains nascent, so it is expensive and not widely available. In fact, there is not enough SAF in production today to fuel the world's airlines for a single week. This is why the work to scale SAF and bring it to new markets, like Portland, is so important.

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland. Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale. In 2022, Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. 40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the U.S. Congress this year through 2029.

This delivery represents the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX, building on Delta’s broader SAF strategy, which includes previous deliveries to hubs like Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW). This milestone also reflects the airline’s ongoing efforts to expand SAF availability and prove its repeatability and scalability across diverse airport systems.

Delta maintains a strong and growing presence in Oregon, underscored by the airline’s strategic operations at Portland International Airport (PDX). From PDX, Delta offers Oregonians nonstop service to nearly all of Delta’s hub airports, providing customers with more than 300 one-stop destinations.

The panel, held ahead of the Resilient Critical Infrastructure Summit that will take place on Sept. 18, focused on the need for greater resilience in internet exchange points, energy systems and security planning.

The discussion, featuring experts in each of those spaces, focused on the lack-of-resilience-related risks associated with internet infrastructure – and what can be done with current infrastructure funding programs

States without IXPs remain at risk

Brent Legg, executive vice president of government affairs at Connected Nation, highlighted that 14 states lack internet exchange points — facilities where networks connect and local traffic is routed efficiently. Without them, states must rely on distant hubs.

“Kansas, for example, depends entirely on two buildings — one in Kansas City, Missouri, and another in Denver,” Legg said. “If one of those two buildings or both of those buildings were to go down, most connectivity in the state of Kansas is going to go down, regardless of what local internet service provider you’re with.”

Experts warned that this reliance on faraway facilities creates choke points that could be exploited during emergencies or attacks. They called for state and federal officials to prioritize distributed IXP development using remaining BEAD funds.

Puerto Rico was cited as a model. The territory invested $334 million of its BEAD allocation in an underground, islandwide conduit system to increase resilience.

Panelists said the energy sector also represents a critical weakness for digital infrastructure. Broadband facilities remain tied to single utility grids that may not withstand natural disasters, cyberattacks or cascading outages.

“Resiliency is really a state of thinking,” said Mahesh Krishnaswamy, CEO of Taara, a spinoff from Google’s Project Moonshot that now offers wireless broadband.

“It’s about predicting. It’s about anticipating and being prepared even before something goes wrong, not when something happens and you have to fall back.”

Experts urged closer coordination between broadband deployment and energy planning. Possible measures include backup generation, renewable diversification and microgrids to avoid single points of failure.

Security threats go beyond cyberwarfare

Security vulnerabilities extend beyond software and networks, the panelists said. Centralized facilities create what Al-David Saab, policy adviser to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., described as a “target-rich environment for adversaries.” He compared the threat to Cold War-era Soviet maps that identified strategic choke points in Washington, D.C.

Evan Feinman, former director of the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, added a caution that threats may be low-tech but devastating. “What about three guys with chainsaws who want to take that data center out of commission?” he said. “Has anybody tried to figure out what that looks like?”

Speakers called for more frequent wargaming and scenario planning that includes both cyber and physical attack scenarios. Building redundancy, they said, is not enough without practical response strategies.

Federal funding is critical to address needs

Panelists noted that billions of dollars remain unspent from the BEAD program. Legg said those funds could support the very measures the panel outlined, including new IXPs and distributed networks.

“The more that we’ve built out and created a connected nation, we’ve also created so many more exposure points that now we have to cover,” Saab said.

As the September summit approaches, experts said the focus must shift from expansion to durability. The challenge for policymakers is not only to connect every American but to keep them connected in the face of mounting risks.

Topics

What Sources of Energy Are Needed for Resilient Infrastructure?

Energy supply is emerging as a vital need in ensuring Resilient Critical Infrastructure. Data centers currently consume 4% of U.S. energy output, and that share could triple in the next decade. Are current energy sources sufficient to meet the growing energy needs of data centers? What role will natural gas and small modular reactors play in this process? Is there a distinction between the energy needs of IXPs, multi-tenant data centers, and hyperscalers? How are behind-the-meter solutions adding (or aiding) America’s resilience on its electric grid?

Critical Resilience in an Age of Heightened Geopolitical Tensions

Building critical resilience in today's geopolitically volatile environment requires organizations and nations to develop comprehensive preparedness strategies that address both traditional threats like natural disasters and emerging challenges including cyberwarfare, electromagnetic pulse and other infrastructure vulnerabilities. Effective resilience must integrate robust backup systems for essential services, diversified supply chains, and layered security. How can our nation maintain a network of resilient critical infrastructure?

How IXPs and Smart Infrastructure Can Strengthen Critical Infrastructure

Internet Exchange Points serve as critical nodes that strengthen national infrastructure resilience by reducing latency through localized traffic exchange, eliminating the need for data to traverse long-distance networks, and creating more robust, distributed communication pathways that are less vulnerable to single points of failure. Some states don’t harbor a single IXP within their territory, contributing to the possibility that a single outage could take an entire state network offline. More IXPs in more locations across the United States can allow states to remain connected, even in the case of disaster or attack.

But those emissions pale in comparison to pollution caused by gas-powered vehicles on the road, according to the data.","(TNS) — Electric vehicles in the United States produce fewer greenhouse gases than gas automobiles, even when factoring in battery-making emissions, limited range during bad weather and coal-fired power grids, according to a new analysis.

The University of Michigan study, published in an American Chemical Society journal, compared projected lifetime emissions of battery, hybrid and gas-powered vehicles from the 2025 model year. On average, gas-powered vehicles will produce 70% more greenhouse gases than EVs with 300-mile charging ranges.

The data include emissions from battery and auto production, a roughly 200,000-mile vehicle lifespan and final recycling or other disposal of the vehicle. Data show EVs create less pollution than plug-in hybrids and other hybrids; plug-in hybrids are more environmentally friendly than other hybrids; hybrids create less pollution than gas-powered vehicles; and smaller vehicles of any powertrain are less emission-intensive than SUVs and pickups.

Pickups, SUVs, sedans and other vehicles used for personal transportation make up roughly 16% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the study, and individuals' vehicle choices ""will play a significant role"" in reducing pollutants.

""Yes, there are differences in terms of how much benefit but again, we want to make it clear that our study shows advantages everywhere in the country,"" said Greg Keoleian, a study author and co-director of the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems, ""which demonstrates that consumers everywhere in the country play a key role in addressing climate pollution and in lowering climate pollution.""

THE ADOPTION CHALLENGE

Widespread EV adoption lags in the United States, where battery-powered models make up roughly 8% of the market share and account for at most about 5% of vehicles in use. Analysts expect a surge in sales through the end of September, when legislation signed by President Donald Trump will end $7,500 tax credits for buyers and lessees. After that, automakers are bracing for a steep drop-off in sales, at least temporarily.

While many auto industry analysts and insiders still have faith battery-powered automobiles will dominate sometime in the future, the short-term fate of electrification has been shaken by ""openly antagonistic"" policies enacted under Trump, said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at auto communications firm Telemetry.

Most recently, Trump's administration announced plans to scrap federal rules on vehicle tailpipe emissions, which have been a driving force in pressuring automakers to electrify their fleets.

""Clean energy incentives, tax credits, and regulations enacted during the previous administration were designed to build a new landscape for American manufacturing by fostering technological advances and encouraging domestic manufacturing,"" U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, said in a statement.

""They worked, and led to a surge in EV investments, driving sales, lowering costs for consumers, and creating thousands of good-paying union jobs. The rollback of these incentives and regulations reverses all that progress and puts us on a dangerous path.""

Buyer concerns about high sticker prices, limited access to quick charging, and anxiety about how far an EV will go before its battery needs a boost have also limited sales growth.

U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Tipton, said in a statement that forcing automakers to electrify faster than market demand is not a viable policy: “While I am not against EVs or reducing transportation emissions, we must not implement misguided regulations that limit consumer choice or exacerbate the pollution they are trying to address.

""Even after the Biden-Harris administration’s Green New Deal giveaways and costly regulations, electric vehicles continued to sit unpurchased on auto dealership lots due to a lack of consumer demand,"" Walberg added. ""Government mandates that force the mass production of EVs, only for them to sit idly on lots, don’t help with emissions reductions — they make it worse."" Even without government pressure or incentives, Abuelsamid said, the industry will move toward electrification.

""People are not going to stop buying EVs just because Trump says they're bad,"" he said. ""Manufacturers, despite slowing some product rollout, are still producing EVs and are going to continue producing EVs.""

Still, recent developments demonstrate the industry's slow and uneven march toward electrification. Last month, Ford Motor Co. said it would invest $2 billion at its Louisville Assembly Plant to build a $30,000 electric midsize pickup while delaying the start of production at a Tennessee battery plant until 2027. And this week, General Motors Co. said it would temporarily reduce planned production of EVs at plants in Kansas and Tennessee because of soft demand.

'OVERWHELMING' BENEFIT

A University of Michigan-made calculator based on the study's data allows users to compare greenhouse gas emissions between two vehicles on a county-by-county basis. The local power supply matters. Fossil fuels such as natural gas and oil, among the top power sources in Michigan, create more pollution. Wind, hydroelectric, solar and nuclear power are considered cleaner.

But overall, driving an EV is still greener, even in coal-heavy areas.

""Study after study has shown that driving an electric vehicle, no matter the electricity grid mix, is significantly cleaner than a gasoline vehicle,"" Kathy Harris, Natural Resources Defense Council director for clean vehicles, said in a statement. ""And, unlike other cars, electric vehicles actually get cleaner over time — as the dirtiest sources of electricity retire and new, clean energy gets hooked up to the grid. A cleaner grid means a cleaner EV.""

Driving an EV sedan in some counties in hydroelectric-powered Oregon could mean a roughly 90% cut in emissions compared to a gas-powered SUV, according to an example from the study. In coal-powered Appalachian counties, EV sedans are still expected to produce 60% less in greenhouse gases than traditional gas-powered SUVs.

While EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions when driven, making the batteries is emissions-intensive. But those emissions pale in comparison to pollution caused by gas-powered vehicles on the road, according to the data.

""We acknowledge there are tradeoffs,"" Keoleian said. ""But the overall benefit is overwhelming.""

Previous research based on 2020 model-year vehicles estimated that driving certain gas vehicles was better for the environment in about 1-2% of U.S. counties, considering the local power grid.

The University of Michigan research is based on the assumption that, over time, the U.S. power grid will increasingly rely on renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels. Keoleian said utilities already are planning on increased demand from EV charging and are adjusting to provide more power.

""When you actually look at total life cycle emissions for vehicle manufacturing and production and then energy used through vehicle lifetime and end-of-use processing of vehicles through recycling and disposal, EVs always come out ahead,"" Abuelsamid said. ""Every single time.""

The firm said one of its central aims is to create projects that meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Virtual power plants do not yet fully exist in Michigan, he said, making residents unable to dispatch their stored energy back to the grid.
Grocoff said that residents have had low to no energy bills this summer, despite a record-high temperature recorded at the Ann Arbor airport.
Building a community The goal of the neighborhood is not only net-zero energy, but building a strong community, Grocoff said.","An Ann Arbor housing development under construction plans to generate its own electricity, resulting in little to no energy bills for its residents.

The company behind Veridian at County Farm said the development will be an all-electric, fossil fuel-free community, that gets its power from solar panels, geothermal and electric heat pumps, and battery energy storage systems.

The project is headed by Thrive Collaborative, an Ann Arbor-based real estate developer. The firm said one of its central aims is to create projects that meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Thrive CEO Matt Grocoff said he and his team started the foundation of the project in the wake of the signing of the Paris Climate Accords in 2016.

“It was really the beginning of the conversation of what is necessary,"" Grocoff said. “If you want a de-carbonized grid, you have to stop burning fossil fuels in order to meet that goal.""

Grocoff said the neighborhood is set up to act as its own virtual power plant, where energy sources including solar panels and battery storage systems connect to form a decentralized clean energy network.

But the system is held back by current infrastructure, Grocoff said. Virtual power plants do not yet fully exist in Michigan, he said, making residents unable to dispatch their stored energy back to the grid.

“Once a protocol is established, we’re going to be able to have tens of thousands of these power plants across the state,” said Grocoff.

But the project is yielding results. Grocoff said that residents have had low to no energy bills this summer, despite a record-high temperature recorded at the Ann Arbor airport.

Building a community

The goal of the neighborhood is not only net-zero energy, but building a strong community, Grocoff said. Veridian is located next to County Far Park, which has about 130 acres of woods and trails. Plans also feature a greenhouse and a grocery store stocked with produce from local farmers. Bikes and cargo bikes are available to lessen dependency on cars.

Grocoff said the goal of Veridian is to create a socially just, ecologically restorative, and culturally rich community.

The site is now looking to fulfill the Living Building Challenge, the world’s most rigorous green building standard. A living building is considered to be regenerative and self-sufficient, connecting occupants to natural systems as well as food and community.

“We want this to be an example for everyone,” Grocoff said. “Just like a roof is essential for a home, we believe that energy systems and the storage systems for that energy are essential as well.”

The development includes housing dedicated to a variety of living situations and incomes, Grocoff said. Less expensive studios are priced around $250,000 to $260,000, and townhomes go for more than $1 million.

Grocoff said Monday that there's one unit available for move-in and six more under construction.

The piece highlights BlackRock’s $6.2 billion bid to acquire Minnesota Power’s parent company, Allete. Opponents warn the deal could drive up household energy bills while undermining Minnesota’s clean energy transition.

“This proposal looks to be a classic private equity play: buy, own for a few years, and then sell at a profit,” Brett Christophers, author of Our Lives in Their Portfolios, told the Guardian. “Money will only be invested in decarbonizing Minnesota Power if [Global Infrastructure Partners] thinks the market will reward it when it comes time to exit”

PESP’s Communications Director Matt Parr told the Guardian:

“Utilities make money by investing in new energy infrastructure. With huge power demand comes huge ability to profit, especially if there’s an environment where utility commissions are approving rate increases.”

He warned that if Minnesota regulators approve the deal, it could “open the floodgates” for private equity firms eyeing utilities nationwide.

Despite BlackRock’s sustainability claims, the firm’s record tells a different story. Parr noted that Global Infrastructure Partners, the private equity arm driving the deal, remains a major investor in a south Texas gas terminal and other fossil fuel projects. Those investments show the firm is still deeply tied to fossil fuels, raising serious doubts that BlackRock would help Minnesota reach its legally mandated goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040.

Local voices are also sounding the alarm. “If the deal goes through, it will force ratepayers to be beholden to the private equity agenda: prioritizing profits for executives while rising prices for everyday people,” said Jenna Yeakle, campaign manager with the Sierra Club. Cody Pals of the Duluth Tenants Union added: “These capitalist vultures do not have our best interests at heart.”

Minnesota’s Administrative Law Judge has already recommended rejecting the proposal. She found that Global Infrastructure Partners “has not met their burden of proof to show the transaction is consistent with the public interest.” The judge pointed to evidence that the firm plans “significant rate increases” beyond inflation.

The new platform is being launched with a AUD$250 million (USD$165 million) investment, including $200 million from La Caisse and $50 million from CEFC, as well as long-term agreement with Rio Tinto as a foundation offtaker.

According to La Caisse, the new platform aims to generate high-quality Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) by integrating large-scale sustainable agricultural production with long-term Environmental Plantings, a methodology for ACCUs in which native vegetation is planted and maintained for a minimum of 25 years – and as long as a century for some projects – providing long term carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits. The investment will be underpinned by a long term offtake from Rio Tinto for part of the ACCUs to be issued.

Emmanuel Jaclot, Executive Vice-President and Head of Infrastructure and Sustainability at La Caisse said:

“This investment is a timely step toward advancing resilient, climate-smart agriculture in Australia, while delivering measurable environmental and economic value… It reflects La Caisse’s commitment to sustainable land use and our broader net zero ambition, as we position ourselves early in a growing market for high-quality carbon credits.”

Meldora will be managed by Australian agriculture and natural capital asset manager, Gunn Agri Partners (GAP). The platform has already purchased its first asset, a broadacre and irrigation farm of more than 15,000 hectares in Central Queensland.

GAP Managing Director, Bradley Wheaton, said:

“The scale of this investment and the scope of the Meldora platform means that it is uniquely ambitious in integrating the restoration of native vegetation in the landscape of an institutional-quality agricultural investment. Through diversification across irrigation, dryland cropping and carbon credit generation, the investment model redefines the future of farming.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/La-Caisse-CDPQ.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 05:00:40.647436

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), supported by a coalition of business and civic leaders, filed a petition for review, arguing that the rule unfairly penalized Wisconsin businesses for pollution largely generated in Illinois and Indiana.
The 7th Circuit’s decision to stay the rule acknowledges the disproportionate burden placed on Wisconsin employers and the need for further judicial review before enforcement proceeds.
“This ruling provides much-needed relief to businesses already working hard to grow and create jobs in our region,” Kooyenga added.","The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce (MMAC) welcomed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to grant a stay on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) reclassification of southeastern Wisconsin as a “Serious” nonattainment area under the 2015 ozone standard.

The court’s ruling pauses the implementation of stricter air quality regulations that would have imposed significant new costs and permitting burdens on businesses across Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington, Waukesha, Racine, Sheboygan and Kenosha counties.

“This is a critical and welcome step toward protecting the economic vitality of southeastern Wisconsin,” said Dale Kooyenga, President of MMAC. “The EPA’s reclassification was based on flawed assumptions and ignored the overwhelming evidence that most of the ozone pollution in our region originates from out-of-state sources. The court’s stay allows us to pursue a more rational, science-based approach.”

In December, the EPA reclassified several Wisconsin counties from a “moderate” to “serious” nonattainment status, triggering costly compliance requirements for local employers. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), supported by a coalition of business and civic leaders, filed a petition for review, arguing that the rule unfairly penalized Wisconsin businesses for pollution largely generated in Illinois and Indiana.

The 7th Circuit’s decision to stay the rule acknowledges the disproportionate burden placed on Wisconsin employers and the need for further judicial review before enforcement proceeds.

“This ruling provides much-needed relief to businesses already working hard to grow and create jobs in our region,” Kooyenga added. “We remain committed to clean air and environmental stewardship, but we must also ensure that federal regulations are fair, targeted and grounded in reality. Today’s decision is a step in the right direction.”

MMAC continues to work alongside a broad coalition of stakeholders to advocate for regulatory reforms that support both environmental and economic goals.

By 2026, its new capacity additions will align with a projected 15% annual growth in global LNG demand, driven by Asia’s industrialization and Europe’s energy security needs.","The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by energy security concerns, decarbonization pressures, and the U.S. emerging as a dominant supplier. At the heart of this transformation is EQT Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based energy giant that has positioned itself to capitalize on long-term offtake agreements as a catalyst for valuation growth and operational scalability. By securing multi-decade contracts with major buyers, EQT is not only hedging against market volatility but also anchoring its future cash flows in a sector poised for sustained demand.

Long-Term Offtake Agreements: A Hedge Against Uncertainty

EQT’s LNG strategy hinges on securing long-term offtake agreements, which provide revenue visibility and reduce exposure to short-term price swings. In late 2025, the company signed a 20-year Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Commonwealth LNG to purchase 1 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG from the latter’s 9.5 Mtpa export facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. This agreement complements Commonwealth’s existing offtake deals with Glencore, JERA, and PETRONAS, which collectively cover 5 Mtpa of capacity [1].

Similarly, EQT has inked a 20-year, 1.5 Mtpa LNG supply agreement with NextDecade Corporation’s Rio Grande LNG facility, indexed to Henry Hub prices [3], and a 2 Mtpa, 20-year deal with Sempra Infrastructure for the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project [4]. These contracts, structured on a free-on-board basis, ensure EQT’s access to U.S. shale gas while linking its pricing to domestic indices—a critical advantage in an era of geopolitical uncertainty.

According to a report by EY, the oil, gas, and chemicals industry is increasingly prioritizing consolidation and operational efficiency to drive value creation [1]. For EQT, long-term offtake agreements align with this trend by reducing capital intensity and enabling scale. The company’s 10 million metric tons per year (mmty) of new annual supply coming online from 2023 to 2025—part of a broader industry shift toward new capacity—positions it to benefit from a more stable supply-demand balance starting in 2026 [1].

Navigating Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks

While EQT’s strategy appears robust, it operates in a sector marked by volatility. Geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and potential U.S. policy shifts under a Trump administration, could disrupt global LNG flows and pricing. However, EQT’s contracts, which span diverse markets including Asia and Europe, mitigate regional risks. For instance, its agreement with JERA, a Japanese utility, and PETRONAS, a Malaysian state oil company, diversifies demand beyond any single geopolitical hotspot.

Moreover, the company’s indexing to Henry Hub prices—a U.S. benchmark—provides insulation from the European gas price spikes that have plagued other exporters. As noted in a recent analysis by Natural Gas Intelligence, this pricing structure allows U.S. producers to maintain margins even as global prices fluctuate [1].

The Energy Transition and EQT’s Adaptability

The energy transition poses another challenge. While LNG is cleaner than coal, it still faces scrutiny from climate advocates. However, EQT’s ability to pivot toward green technologies could enhance its valuation. A study in Energy Strategy Reviews highlights that fossil fuel exporters with hydrogen strategies are better positioned to navigate decarbonization [2]. Though EQT has not yet announced large-scale hydrogen projects, its existing infrastructure and global offtake network could serve as a foundation for future clean energy ventures.

A Data-Driven Investment Thesis

EQT’s LNG portfolio is set to grow significantly in the coming years. By 2026, its new capacity additions will align with a projected 15% annual growth in global LNG demand, driven by Asia’s industrialization and Europe’s energy security needs. A visual representation of EQT’s capacity expansion from 2023 to 2026 would underscore this trajectory:

Conclusion

EQT’s LNG expansion is more than a bet on U.S. energy leadership—it is a calculated strategy to leverage long-term offtake agreements as a buffer against market volatility and a springboard for scalability. By securing contracts with major buyers and aligning with industry trends toward efficiency and diversification, the company is well-positioned to thrive in a transitional energy landscape. For investors, EQT’s disciplined approach offers a compelling case: a balance of near-term stability and long-term growth potential in a sector that remains central to global energy security.

This year, City Council adopted new climate goals that target those emissions, aiming to eliminate the majority of community-wide emissions by 2035.

“If we can shift at least 50% of trips that are currently taken by driving alone to more environmentally-friendly forms of transportation, we can have a huge impact on the air quality, but also on our contribution to climate change,” Fencil said. She said walking, biking, taking public transportation and carpooling are all options that pollute less.

In the general election, Charlotteans will vote on a ballot measure to raise the sales tax one cent to fund road, rail and bus improvements. Mecklenburg County’s sales tax rate would increase to 8.25%.

Many of the city’s climate targets will hinge on whether the referendum passes, although some current city council members have expressed skepticism over the long-sought sales tax increase. Councilmembers Lawana Mayfield and Victoria Watlington said recently on Charlotte Talks that they still had not made up their minds about voting for the transit plan.

This ambivalence has crept into the electorate — voters like Bella McInnes, a recent graduate from North Carolina State University, who attended the open house to network. She said that she would still like more information before she goes to the polls.

“For the most part, I think I would just say yes,” McInnes said. “That would be my instinct.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46e2649/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1145x601+28+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F5f%2F0a75d23148a0aef1b6b893bc1ec8%2Fclimate-mapplan-de-travail-1.png,N,,2025-09-09 01:00:54.200204

This is the first time Tesla has dropped below 40% since October 2017, when it was ramping up production of the Model 3. The decline underscores the increasing pressure from legacy automakers offering more competitive EV options and aggressive incentives.

In July, Tesla held 42% of the market, down from 48.7% in June—the sharpest month-over-month decline since March 2021, coinciding with Ford’s launch of the Mustang Mach-E. While Tesla’s US sales rose 7% in July to 53,816 units, the overall EV market grew 24% month-over-month, driven by a rush to claim the US$7,500 federal tax credit set to expire at the end of September. In August, Tesla’s growth slowed to 3.1%, while the broader market expanded 14%.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights, Cox Automotive, said: “I know they are positioning themselves as a robotics and AI company. But when you are a car company, without new products, your market share will start to decline.”

Tesla’s last new vehicle, the Cybertruck, launched in 2023 but has not matched the success of the Model 3 or Model Y. A recent refresh of the Model Y failed to meet market expectations. Meanwhile, Tesla has postponed or canceled plans for more affordable models, focusing instead on robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Traditional automakers—including Hyundai, Honda, Kia, Toyota, and Volkswagen—have gained ground by offering higher incentives. Volkswagen’s EV sales surged over 450% in July, aided by low lease rates and free fast-charging. “These legacy manufacturers are benefiting from this sense of urgency,” Streaty said. “And it is working.”

Tesla is also under pressure on margins due to recent price cuts, aimed at maintaining sales volumes but raising investor concerns. The company’s board has proposed a US$1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, tied to boosting Tesla’s valuation to US$8.5 trillion over the next decade.

Musk’s public alignment with President Donald Trump earlier this year—and his departure from Trump’s administration in May after a disagreement—has further affected Tesla’s brand image. Analysts expect elevated EV sales through September, with a possible decline afterward if tax credits expire.

Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Why It Matters

Energy-intensive data centers are multiplying across the country to keep pace with AI-driven technology. While this could accelerate tech sector growth, it may strain utilities and housing costs for millions of Americans.

Residential electricity prices have surged in states with heavy tech investment. In Utah and Illinois, costs have jumped by 15 percent and 14 percent respectively as of June, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Meanwhile, the average price of residential electricity increased 6.5 percent from 16.41 cents per kilowatt-hour to 17.47 cents between May 2024 and May 2025, the EIA reports.

What To Know

Last Thursday, Trump invited the leaders of the tech industry to a White House dinner, featuring Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and AI and crypto czar David Sacks.

At the dinner, the president promised them that the resources needed for tech expansion would be made available, saying, ""I know everybody at the table indirectly through reading about you and studying, knowing a lot about your business, actually making it very easy for you in terms of electric capacity and getting it for you, getting your permits.""

Data centers already consume about 4.4 percent of total U.S. electricity, a figure projected to double or even triple by 2028, according to the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

An average midsize data center typically uses 300,000 gallons of water daily, which is roughly comparable to the same water consumption from 1,000 households in the same timeframe.

In 2025, data centers in Texas alone are projected to use 49 billion gallons of water, enough to supply millions of households, primarily for cooling massive banks of servers that power generative AI and cloud computing.

Texas also ranked as one of the most expensive states to pay electric bills, with an average monthly bill of $174.59, the fourth highest in the country.

California, another extremely tech-friendly state that invites large investment in AI development, also reported high electricity bills in 2025, with the average bill from June clocking in at $164.50 a month.

Homebuyers are also seeing higher mortgage rates since data center buildouts take trillions in capital, Realtor.com reported, adding that those trying to sell their homes are ""trapped by the mortgage lock-in effect.""

What People Are Saying

David Conn, vice president and head of business and development at utility software company Exceleron, told Realtor.com: ""Utility prices are rising across the board, partly due to higher energy demand from data centers and partly from extreme weather, growing electrification, and the need to upgrade aging infrastructure.""

Aaron Wright, CEO of Solomon Group and Solomon e3, a climate tech company focused on equitable energy solutions for underserved communities, told Realtor.com: ""As utilities race to meet AI-driven energy demand, infrastructure costs are rising and those costs are passed [on] to everyday ratepayers.""

Zoe Gamble, CEO of CleanChoice Energy, told Realtor.com: ""Clean energy is in an arms race with AI, and the U.S. is entering a period where power generation can't keep pace with demand. When we have more demand than generation, the grid starts failing. As more data centers are built to accommodate AI and other data-intensive processes, our grids are being pushed to their breaking point.""

What Happens Next?

The EIA projects retail electricity prices for residential customers will rise another 6 percent next year. Meanwhile, utilities are preparing for grid upgrades, and some cities are debating whether to slow or limit new data center permits.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2717914/donald-trump.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 08:01:26.937955

President Trump's push to cut federal sales incentives and roll back emissions standards is expected to benefit Detroit automakers, including General Motors (GM), Ford, and Stellantis, as they shift investments to petrol-fueled cars. The deregulatory push is clearing the way for the companies to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for electric vehicles (EVs) and other pollution-related costs.

GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing regulatory credits to help meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements. Ford has similarly cut its own credit-purchase commitments by nearly $1.5 billion this year alone, money it now plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids. The shift in policy has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years, according to Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley [1].

Trump's $3.4 trillion fiscal package sunsets the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers on September 30. It also zeroed out fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates, negating the need to buy credits under those rules. Stellantis paid $190 million in penalties in each of the last two years, which will now be saved [1].

Separately, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding stringent rules limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from cars and the president signed legislation effectively terminating similar regulations set by California. This change in policy has significantly impacted the industry, with Ford's Ford Blue division, which builds internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids, expected to be the biggest beneficiary [1].

GM believes it can capture a bigger slice of the EV market as rivals pull out, but the automaker is happy to do so at a slower rate. The company last week said it would operate on just one shift of workers, rather than two, to build the electric Chevrolet Bolt at a factory in Kansas that will start building the revived compact EV in December. The company will also cut a shift at a Tennessee plant making electric Cadillacs to start 2026, thanks to slower demand [1].

Trump's multi-front effort to slash emissions rules brings his policy approach for the auto industry into focus. Much like in his first term, he's easing regulations in the hope of creating domestic jobs, a goal he's also pressing with an aggressive tariff policy that penalizes imported vehicles and parts, imposing steep costs on carmakers. Near-term savings generated by weaker environmental rules will help offset some — but not all — of those incremental expenses [1].

On the other side, EV makers Rivian Automotive Inc. and Tesla Inc. stand to lose significant revenue. Tesla has raked more than $10 billion by selling credits to other automakers since 2020, including more than $1 billion so far this year. Analysts at JPMorgan have estimated roughly 40% of Tesla’s profits could be at risk if Trump implements his policy changes that are detrimental to EVs [1].

Rivian CFO Claire McDonough in August said the company expects zero revenue from credit sales for the rest of the year as a result of the policy changes. The EV maker collected about $160 million in the first half, and had expected about $300 million in total this year [1].

Title: Detroit Automakers Benefit from Trump's Deregulatory Efforts

President Trump's deregulatory measures have significantly boosted Detroit automakers by rolling back electric vehicle (EV) incentives and emissions rules. This shift has freed up substantial financial resources, allowing companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford to reinvest in gasoline-powered vehicles and other traditional segments [1].

Under Trump's administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) saw a relaxation of its emissions standards, which had previously pressured Detroit automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The reduction in these regulations has led to cost savings for the automakers, enabling them to focus on other areas of their business [1].

Moreover, Trump's victory over Democratic rival Kamala Harris added uncertainty to the Detroit Three's push toward an all-electric future. While some industry watchers predicted that Trump's policies could hinder EV adoption, others argued that the easing of environmental regulations would provide a boost to the traditional auto industry. The president-elect's promise to impose bigger tariffs on imported goods also played a role in shaping the industry's outlook. Higher tariffs would keep cheaper Chinese vehicles off U.S. shores, potentially reducing competition but also increasing the cost of parts and vehicles built elsewhere, such as in Mexico [1].

The impact of these policies on the auto industry has been mixed. While some experts predict that U.S. auto sales will hold up and finish the year up 2% with 15.7 million new vehicle sales, the long-term effects remain uncertain. The Trump administration's stance on EVs, including the potential revocation of the $7,500 EV tax credit, has raised concerns among automakers and industry analysts. However, the possibility of less regulation and lower taxes could provide a financial boost for consumers, potentially driving demand for new vehicles [1].

The Detroit Three have expressed mixed reactions to Trump's policies. While some industry experts see the president's victory as a boon for the auto industry, others caution that the uncertainty surrounding EV initiatives and tariffs could complicate the supply chain and affect prices. The auto industry's response to Trump's policies will be crucial in shaping the future of the U.S. auto market [1].

The sun isn’t just setting on incentives for buying EVs.","ROCHESTER, N.Y. (WROC) — EV sales are up right now, that was also the case in August, and according the Brad Mcareavy, the President of the Rochester Automobile Dealers Association, that’s because people are rushing to get theirs, before there are no more federal tax incentives to do so.

“It probably is going to have the effect of softening the EV market for a while,” said Mcareavy, “until we can figure out how to market those vehicles in an unsubsidized market, where it just has to compete on its own.”

Come September 30, consumer tax breaks on electric cars are expected to end under the “Big, Beautiful, Bill.” That includes credits of up to $7,500 towards the purchase of new vehicles and $4,000 for those that are used.

However, for those currently in the market, there may be a way for you to still take advantage of the benefit. Mcareavy says if the car you want isn’t out there today, you can still order it and qualify for the incentive.

“It’s important to keep in mind,” he said, “if you’re out there, and you’re shopping, and you can’t find the vehicle you want, the EV — place an order with a dealer, put a deposit down, sign that purchase agreement and you can take delivery a month or two down the road, when the vehicle comes.

All in all, even though he expects a slowdown of purchases once the incentive goes away, Mcareavy says EVs are here to stay.

“Manufacturers have invested millions of dollars in the development of manufacturing, and the acquisition of rare earth minerals for batteries, etc, etc. So, they’re very heavily invested in electric vehicles — I don’t see that going away.”

Mcareavy adds that he hopes NYS continues to invest in infrastructure for EVs, so there would be proper support for consumer interest.

AAA says fueling an electric vehicle is less expensive than gassing up.

Electric vehicles are having a strange moment.

EVs continue to grow as a share of the market, new models are here or on the way and deals can be had, but the recent uproar targeting Tesla over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, the expected elimination of federal EV tax credits and recent sales declines in certain segments highlight some of the contradictions.

Nonetheless, reasons that have attracted customers to EVs for years remain relevant, including peppy performance and the ability to avoid trips to the gas station.

If you’re in the market for an EV, however, you’ll want to take a few things into consideration before you buy.

Do I need to be concerned about battery range?

With the average daily commute less than 30 miles, looking for an EV with the longest range might be overkill. Range anxiety, which is the worry that an EV won’t have enough juice to get a driver to either a destination or a charging location, is often cited as one of the reasons some consumers decide to steer clear of EVs.

But many EVs promise battery range of 300 miles or more, and even vehicles with shorter ranges can comfortably handle a standard commute. If you mostly need a vehicle for basic commuting and short trips around town, you’d be more than covered in most cases. Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, notes one reason to perhaps not obsess about getting an EV that’s got the maximum range if you don’t need it: “With more range comes more price.” Of course, someone who regularly takes long trips will prioritize an EV with a longer range. Driving conditions – cold weather is harder on EV batteries, for instance – can also affect range.

What do I need to know about EV charging?

Fueling up an EV is a different experience from those familiar trips to the gas station. For the uninitiated it might seem like an intimidating prospect, but there’s no need to fret. Most people charge their EVs at home (EV owners who live in multiunit buildings may find that challenging). The U.S. Energy Department notes that “many EV owners are able to meet their daily driving range requirements by charging overnight with Level 1 equipment, requiring no additional cost or installation, provided that a power outlet on a dedicated branch circuit is available near their parking location.” Level 1 equipment is a cord that can plug into a standard wall outlet. Consumers can also install a Level 2 (240 volt) charger at home to speed the process. Level 2 charging equals 25 miles of range per hour of charging, according to the Energy Department. Some utility companies offer special rebates to install Level 2 chargers as well as programs that can save money on charging. Some automakers have their own offers.

But what about when I’m not close to home?

Finding public charging can be more complex, and your location will determine how convenient it is. Plenty of apps, either from automakers or charging companies can help pinpoint charging locations. The Energy Department lists almost 73,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations, those with one or more charging ports, on its website. DC Fast Charging (100-200 plus miles of range per 30 minutes of charging, per the Energy Department) can make longer trips more convenient. Tesla’s Supercharger network promises more than 60,000 global superchargers for drivers of its vehicles a recharge rate of up to 200 miles in 15 minutes. Many are located along prime corridors, such as the Ohio Turnpike. Although charging infrastructure is not yet as robust as many believe it needs to be, the options continue to expand. Waffle House, notably, just signed a deal with an arm of BP to bring fast charging to its restaurants.

Who’s the ideal EV driver and who's not?

This question points to the reason you’ll want to assess your own driving needs. Valdez-Streaty suggests that someone who’s got a shorter commute, lives in a place where gas is more expensive and has good charging access near home or work would be a prime candidate. A person who regularly drives long distances or has a consistently long commute, lives in a rural area with limited charging infrastructure or needs a large truck for hauling might not have the ideal lifestyle to be an EV driver, she says.

What are some other considerations?

Valdez-Streaty says to do your homework. Websites, including Kelley Blue Book, AAA and the Energy Department are some of the places to check as part of your research. Consider the total cost of ownership, not just the sticker price. In April, the average transaction price for a new EV was $59,255 and the average listing price for a used EV was $35,874, according to Cox Automotive.

But AAA notes that it costs less to charge an EV than a gas-powered vehicle. In addition, some maintenance needs are different (no more oil changes, for instance). The expected end of federal tax credits for EV purchases would kill one type of incentive, but Valdez-Streaty says that state and local jurisdictions could fill that gap, so check on what’s available where you live. She also notes that a large number of used EVs are expected to come off lease, meaning lower-priced options there. Despite some current headwinds for EV adoption, Valdez-Streaty is bullish on EVs in the long run: “I still feel like the future’s still electric.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USNK/86049540007-20220721-t-193939-z-2113313417-rc-2-dgv-96-ks-44-rtrmadp-3-amazonrivian-1.JPG?crop=8255,4644,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-08 22:02:56.033189

The electric truck and sport-utility vehicle manufacturer is preparing for a challenging year in which it plans to launch a more affordable model even as it gets more expensive to buy an EV.

A spokesperson at the company said that the layoffs are equivalent to about 1.5% of its total staff of nearly 15,000. The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs.

Rivian is among the many car companies bracing for the changes in federal tax credits.

Under President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 tax credit, which some buyers receive for purchasing EVs, is set to expire at the end of this month. The credit of up to $4,000 for used EVs also will end.

It’s an abrupt reversal of Biden-era efforts to address climate change emissions from gasoline cars.

Transportation is the most significant source of climate-warming emissions in California and the U.S., and experts warn that the sector must become far cleaner to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

In California, approximately one-quarter of new cars sold are either fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, according to the California Energy Commission.

That progress could stall. The planned phaseout of state credits is expected to dampen EV sales, which already have slowed due to waning consumer interest and high tariffs on imported cars.

Anticipating a slowdown in demand as the incentives end, General Motors has laid off 360 workers in Detroit due to the slowed production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Volkswagen plans to temporarily furlough 160 employees and slow production of its electric SUV.

Rivian’s newest model, the R2 SUV, is slated to come out next year.

“We have made some recent changes to the Commercial team as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,” a Rivian spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Times.

It will be one of the company’s more affordable options, starting at $45,000. Its current R1S SUV starts at $76,900. At this price level, Rivian will be able to compete with other EV companies such as Tesla, which also has a model starting at about $45,000.

Rivian first made a name for itself with its Earth-toned electric trucks, which debuted in 2018. The company was founded in Florida and moved to Irvine in 2020, where it is based today.

The introduction of its heavy-duty EVs initially appealed to more-affluent consumers, with some of the models sporting sticker prices above $120,000.

After taking the company public in 2021, the retailer has faced a number of challenges. It has had to grapple with supply chain issues, steep price points and order delays.

Like all EV companies, it is now struggling with policy changes out of Washington.

Because Rivian makes only EVs, the company’s sales have been derailed with changes in compliance credits. Previously, the company would sell these credits to other car companies that needed to meet fuel economy and emission standards.

In its second quarter, the company reported a loss of $1.1 billion.

Rivian shares have climbed about 5% this year.

The bill was one of three passed by the House last Wednesday rescinding resource management plans on nearly 30 million acres of public land in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska.
Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote.
“It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production.","The U.S. House last week passed a resolution overturning Biden-era restrictions on resource extraction across millions of acres in eastern Montana, bringing Montana’s all-Republican delegation closer to stated goals of bolstering the state’s mining and energy sectors.

But conservation groups said the change — which needs approval in the U.S. Senate — reverses environmental gains and ignores local stakeholders

House Joint Resolution 104, carried by the state’s eastern Congressman, Rep. Troy Downing, passed on near-partisan lines, with all but one Republican in favor and all Democrats opposed.

“The Biden Administration’s outright ban on coal leasing in the Powder River Basin is an intolerable threat to domestic energy production, U.S. national security, and the prosperity of the communities I represent,” Downing said in a statement. “I’m proud to be leading the charge in the House to reverse the Miles City Field Office RMPA to improve access to the affordable, reliable energy that brings the American dream that much closer to hand for countless families in Montana and across the country. I appreciate the support and advocacy of my colleagues from the Treasure State in this fight, and I look forward to seeing this resolution pass the Senate and signed into law by President Trump.”

All four of Montana’s congressional delegates, all Republicans, support the resolution, with Sen. Steve Daines sponsoring companion legislation in the upper chamber. Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy are cosponsors on their chambers’ respective bills.

The bill was one of three passed by the House last Wednesday rescinding resource management plans on nearly 30 million acres of public land in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska.

Downing’s legislation overturns a rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management that halted future coal leasing on roughly 1.7 million acres of federal land in Montana’s Powder River Basin, which contains roughly a third of the nation’s coal reserves.

The record of decision for the Miles City Resource Management Plan amendment, released last November, provided for existing leases at two mines — Spring Creek and Rosebud — to continue for at least a decade, but the bureau said the rule came following analysis that coal markets would continue to decline and coal-fired plants were likely to close or be converted to utilize renewable energy.

“The approved RMP Amendment makes unavailable 1,745,040 acres of BLM administered coal from further consideration for leasing in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a proxy for climate change. The BLM would not accept new coal lease applications,” the decision said.

Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.

Meanwhile, the federal government earlier this year authorized an expansion for the Westmoreland Rosebud Mine, which fuels the Colstrip power plant, allowing it to extract roughly 70 million tons of coal and operate through 2039.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. coal production to drop from 610 million tons in 2022 to 450 million tons in 2040, and Western U.S. production to drop from 335 million tons to 224 million tons over the same period.

Coal taxes in Montana benefit public education in the state, with money going into a trust that funds public school construction and upgrades, infrastructure projects, housing and economic development, among other things.

In a letter sent to the Trump administration, Gov. Greg Gianforte urged the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana to benefit national security, provide reliable energy and boost Montana’s educational systems.

“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.

While industry groups and Montana politicians praised the passage of the bill conservation groups decried the move as a step backwards for environmental protections and criticized Congress’ vote as a workaround of the federal rule-making process.

“Congress just jumped head first down a slippery slope that creates a dangerous precedent that will surely backfire. Using the Congressional Review Act not only repeals the current management plan, which was carefully crafted by local leaders and stakeholders, but it puts at risk future efforts to responsibly manage public lands. It’s not just wildlife habitat and hunting and fishing access at risk here; it’s all decisions made at the local level,” said Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation, in a statement. “At a time when Montana’s public lands are facing numerous threats, land managers need flexibility and tools to respond, not more interference from Washington.”

Justin Meuse, government relations director at The Wilderness Society, said Congress was overturning decisions over land management in an “unprecedented way” and could expose “thousands of permits, leases and rights of way to legal challenge.”

But Daines emphasized that Montana’s economy was at the forefront of his decision to back the move.

“Joe Biden’s Miles City RMPA halts all future coal leasing in the region and will cause hardworking Montanans to lose their jobs,” Daines said in a statement. “It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production. It’s critical that we remove this outdated and harmful plan.”

Downing’s office said overturning the resource management plan will keep roughly $46 million in coal tax revenue secure and generate $15 million in new federal energy revenue.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dbleizeffer-coal-haul-truck-bt-1-1-e17341118279051757368713.jpg?h=f68bd007&itok=_MwjTxUZ,N,,2025-09-08 23:59:58.987180

Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization — which is the country’s largest miner of critical minerals — signed a memorandum of understanding with Missouri-based U.S. Strategic Metals for collaboration plans that include setting up a poly-metallic refinery in Pakistan.

The deal comes after Washington and Islamabad last month reached a trade agreement that Pakistan hoped would attract American investment in its minerals and oil reserves.

U.S. Strategic Metals is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the U.S. Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.

A second agreement was signed between the National Logistics Corp of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a Portuguese engineering and construction company.

A statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he held talks with the delegation from U.S. Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths and other mineral resources.

The sides expressed readiness to develop value-added facilities, enhance mineral processing capacity, and undertake large-scale projects tied to mining, the statement said.

“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan said in a statement: “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”

Earlier this year, Sharif claimed that Pakistan possesses mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and foreign investment in the mineral sector could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and free itself from the burden of massive foreign loans.

Most of Pakistan’s mineral wealth is in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

In August, the U.S. State Department had designated the Balochistan National Army separatist group and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organization.

Oil and minerals reserves have also been found in the southern Sindh, eastern Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan.

France is leading the way with 10 different designs under development, placing it second worldwide after the US, with 27 designs registered, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA).
There may be little doubt that a nuclear energy renaissance is under way in Europe and around the world.","As more EU countries turn to nuclear power as a zero-emissions source of energy, they risk forgetting that a revival still hinges on industrial policy and investment decisions - both at home and abroad.

Belgium's new government has definitively U-turned on a planned phase out. Italy is preparing the ground for a nuclear energy comeback – 35 years since its last plant was shut down.

Both countries recently joined a French alliance to push pro-nuclear policies in the EU. That group has never been stronger, with 14 countries having signed up as of today.

Perhaps the most visible absence from the alliance is that of Spain, one of a dozen EU countries that have operational nuclear plants, but increasingly positioning itself as a powerhouse of wind and solar power.

But the anti-nuclear front is weakening, with signs that even Germany is prepared to ease its long-standing opposition in Brussels to any EU-level pro-nuclear policy – let alone subsidies.

Fission-friendly

With Russian belligerence focusing minds on the need to reduce dependence on unreliable suppliers of fossil fuels, recent policy developments suggest the European Commission and EU lawmakers more broadly are making friends with fission.

Policy support for nuclear technology manufacturing in the Net-Zero Industry Act and the launch of an EU industrial alliance for the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are just two cases in point.

But even with such positive signals and the goodwill they imply, the success of any European nuclear renaissance still depends on the EU’s capacity to coordinate licensing rules, avoid creating new dependencies on foreign powers, and find a balanced role for its nuclear energy champion, France.

Issues with the EU's nuclear juggernaut

With 57 reactors and a major build-up programme, Paris sees itself as being in the driving seat of Europe’s nuclear ambitions. But, in recent years France's state-backed energy giant EDF has lost at least a couple of major contracts for reactor projects within the EU.

Poland’s first nuclear power plant development was secured by the US company Westinghouse, and Washington has since extracted a promise from Brussels that could mean buying more American energy technology.

In Czechia, EDF's strenuous efforts to invalidate a tender won by a South Korean competitor led to a diplomatic incident.

Commission Vice-President Stéphane Séjourné, who is French, sided with EDF in an unsuccessful push to have Czech authorities suspend the signing of the contract on the grounds of alleged illegal use of foreign subsidies. EDF’s legal battle only succeeded in angering Prague before it signed with the Koreans anyway.

All this suggests that, absent direct EU industrial stimulus or some form of protectionism, non-European companies are quite capable of making successful bids for European nuclear power projects.

That risks leaving Europe more dependent on third countries for its energy supply – the opposite of the stated aim of the European Commission.

Losing the competitive edge?

While it remains to be seen if the EU nuclear industry can compete on the global stage, it has certainly fallen behind in terms of the number projects.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) flagged in January that of the 52 reactors that began construction since 2017, all but four are of either Chinese or Russian design. Of those four, two are Korean, built with local technology, and two British, albeit of European design.

It's worth recalling that EDF marked some successes abroad, contributing to the construction of two reactors in China in the 2010s, and has just secured the contract for a new nuclear power plant in the UK – whose budget is already double the initial estimate.

EDF's construction of another British power plant, Hinkley Point C, has been plagued by cost overruns and major delays, and is just one example of the infamous difficulty of building new reactors on time and budget.

Especially, it seems, in Europe. Other examples include France’s Flamanville 3, operational in 2024 instead of 2012, and Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, which started feeding the grid in 2022 instead of 2009, as planned.

Huge costs, long construction time, and project delays are strong arguments for anti-nuclear campaigners who maintain that renewables cost less, are built faster, and don’t have the problem of radioactive waste – although the issues linked to their intermittent power output have yet to be properly fixed.

Small is beautiful

The IEA predicts that the West could re-enter the game in the fledgling market for small modular reactors (SMRs).

SMRs have about a third of the power generating capacity of a traditional nuclear power plant, but being smaller and made with standardised, factory-produced parts, they promise to be quicker and cheaper to build.

Advanced economies are expected to cover over 60% of installations from 2025 to 2040, according to the IEA. However, China is forecast to install 35 gigawatts of SMRs by 2050 – more than the US and over twice the 15 GW the Paris-based agency expects to see in the EU.

Dan Jørgensen, the EU's energy commissioner, said on 1 September that the EU figure could be higher, between 17 and 53 GW. Yet all this remains, for now, theoretical.

As the IEA cautions, it’s still unclear what kind of a price tag SMRs – a nascent technology yet to be proven at scale – may come with. It could turn out to be significantly higher than expected, with first movers likely facing substantial costs before economies of scale bring prices down.

Small national markets

Despite these uncertainties, many EU countries are participating in race to develop SMR technology.

France is leading the way with 10 different designs under development, placing it second worldwide after the US, with 27 designs registered, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA).

The NEA figures show Czechia has two of its own, and Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden each have one, with all of these countries home to competing companies angling for a slice of the SMR market.

The European Commission has already warned that the domestic markets of EU member states are too small to realise the economies of scale required for SMRs to be a success, and has called for cooperation on regulatory requirements.

An industrial alliance set up by the EU executive in a bid to get development moving in a more coordinated fashion finalised this week a roadmap for action over the next few years. Among its requests is EU funding.

The Trump trade-off

Whether it's batteries, electric cars or solar panels, the EU is trying to boost local production. When it comes to nuclear, however, the bloc appears to have already conceded a slice of the market to the US.

To avoid a steep rise in American tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump, the EU has promised to buy $750 billion of US energy in the next three years.

This includes nuclear fuel supplies, but also “US energy technology investments, services and exports into the EU, notably in the nuclear sector for conventional and Small Modular Reactors”, the Commission said in July.

The undertaking referred to already existent “clear indications” that US companies are involved in projects, the Commission said.

There may be little doubt that a nuclear energy renaissance is under way in Europe and around the world. But it remains to be seen how much of it can or will be made in Europe.

Dive Brief:

Indiana’s governor last week pressed for lower utility rates from investor-owned companies with utilities in the state: AES, American Electric Power, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy and NiSource.

“We can’t take it anymore,” Gov. Mike Braun, R, said in a Sept. 3 press release. Braun directed Abby Gray, the state’s new ratepayer advocate, to evaluate utility profits and look for cost-saving measures that would ease utility rates. “I would also like to see the utilities' investors bear more of the cost of doing business,” Braun said.

Analysts with Jefferies and Capstone say they doubt Braun’s comments will derail a proposal to create NIPSCO Generation, a company affiliated with NiSource’s Northern Indiana Public Service Co. that would build and own power plants to serve data centers and other “megaload” customers.

Dive Insight:

The action in Indiana highlights the nationwide affordability pressures that are colliding with the potential need to build power plants and power lines to serve planned data centers, manufacturing plants and other loads.

In Indiana, average residential electric bills surged about 17.5% over the 12-month period ending July 1 — the most in 20 years, according to analysis from Citizens Action Coalition, a ratepayer-focused advocacy group based in Indianapolis. Average residential bills increased 9.3% during that period in 2023-2024, the group said.

NIPSCO’s average residential bills saw the highest increase in the state, jumping 26.7% this year and 17.8% in 2024, followed by CenterPoint at 24.9% and 7.1% in the same periods, Duke at 19.8% and 1%, AES at 12% and 11.9%, and AEP’s Indiana Michigan Power at 3.9% and 8.8%, CAC said.

AES Indiana is seeking a two-part rate increase that could total about 13.5%, or $21 a month, for a typical residential customer by 2027, on top of a 6% increase set to take effect next year.

In other Indiana utility news, two members of the five-member Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Sept. 3 said without explanation that they are leaving the agency next month, before their terms expire. IURC commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett plan to step down on Oct. 10 and Oct. 17, respectively.

Freeman has been an IURC commissioner since September 2016; Bennett has served at the agency since May 2023. Freeman’s term expires on Jan. 1, 2026, and Bennett’s term ends April 1, 2026.

“Both commissioners were heavily involved in industry stakeholder engagement, including at [the] National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, and known favorably by investors,” Jefferies equity analysts said Thursday. The action is a “clear negative development” for NiSource, but also for the other IOUs in the state, the analysts said.

Braun’s comments on utility rates were likely driven by voter pressure, according to research firm Capstone. “However, we do not believe his messaging will result in meaningful rate impacts for utilities or an unfavorable IURC composition, given his alignment with Trump interests and a desire to maintain a favorable business environment in Indiana,” analysts said in a client note on Friday.

Capstone analysts said they expect the IURC will likely approve NIPSCO Generation’s data center power proposal before Bennett and Freeman leave the agency. If they leave before the decision is made, the IURC will still have a quorum to make a decision, they noted.

“We also believe Braun to be supportive of NIPSCO and other utilities’ efforts to increase generation capacity for meeting growing data center demand, largely in line with the Trump administration’s priorities,” the analysts said.

NIPSCO, NIPSCO Generation and the NIPSCO Industrial Group reached a settlement agreement on the plan in mid-July.

Creating a separate generation company would allow NIPSCO to serve megaload customers by meeting their unique demands so that Northwest Indiana does not lose out on economic development opportunities due to “regulatory obstacles,” NIPSCO Generation said in an Aug. 15 filing at the IURC.

The plan protects existing customers by isolating risks to the generation company while maintaining NIPSCO’s financial integrity, the company said.

“Success now depends on Fortescue finding the right solution and then deploying it in the next five-and-a-half years,” author Peter Milne wrote.
“As with any ambitious decarbonisation effort, it is normal to encounter areas where new technologies are still being developed or tested.
“As outlined in our Climate Transition Plan, we have not yet settled on a single rail decarbonisation solution – and that is by design.
To date, we have progressed several pathways in parallel, including extensive work to assess and trial both battery and green ammonia options.","The real zero mission of iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest has hit some bumpy ground, with news emerging that Fortescue has gone back to the drawing board on plans to build a zero emissions electric Infinity Train and abandoned a major green manufacturing project in the US.

News has emerged in the US that the Australian iron ore giant has dumped its plan to manufacture EV batteries, fast chargers and electrolysers – already in the early stages of development – in America’s former automotive heartland of Detroit, Michigan.

The reports, first reported in Crain’s Detroit Business, said Fortescue has pulled the plug on the $US210 million Michigan Advanced Manufacturing Centre – which has also disappeared from company’s website – in light of US President Donald Trump’s attack on clean energy tax credits.

This was confirmed to Renew Economy on Tuesday morning.

“Following a comprehensive review of the economics, logistics and deadlines to meet our ambitious decarbonisation targets, we have made the decision to reassess the future of our U.S. manufacturing strategy and no longer proceed with our planned Michigan Manufacturing Center,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

“Current policy settings and market conditions in the United States, including recent changes to critical tax credits, have created significant uncertainty around the viability of long-term investment in advanced manufacturing.”

The Michigan plans had included $US20 million to buy two former Fisher car body plants, $US84 million for building renovations – believed to be in the very early stages – and $US106 million in new machinery and equipment.

As Renew Economy has reported, the plans had the backing of the Michigan state government, which last year awarded Fortescue a $US12.7 million ($A19.3 million) grant towards its rehabilitation of the car parts factories.

Fortescue had promised to create up to 600 jobs by 2030 – but would have needed to create 430 jobs by February 2031 in order to keep the grant.

“Detroit is an extremely attractive place to manufacture, given the skilled workforce, existing EV and green energy supply chains, and strong support from state and local governments,” said Fortescue WAE CEO Judith Judson in January, before leaving the company a few months later.

In the emailed statement on Tuesday, the Fortescue spokesperson said the company was “grateful for the strong support received from the Governor, Mayor and Detroit community,” its priority was to “do everything we can to remain focused on opportunities to meet our near-term global decarbonisation goals.”

Fortescue also said it would continue to explore opportunities to advance zero emission technologies in the United States – and its plan for a Colorado Technology Hub remains on the company website.

Closer to home, reports have emerged this week that Fortescue’s plans to develop an electric “Infinity Train” have gone back to the drawing board, after hitting an economic wall on the current design and development pathway.

The concept for the Infinity Train involves sending fully laden trains downhill from the mines to the port, charging the batteries with regenerative power along the way, and then sending the empty trains back up hill with battery power.

According to Boiling Cold, more than 100 staff and contractors supporting Fortescue’s battery electric locomotive (BEL) program were let go or moved to other parts of the company in June, after engineers concluded that the costs of the technology – as it stood – were too high.

Boiling Cold said the main problem was the ability of the battery electric locomotives to generate and store enough energy to take the empty trains back up to the mine site.

“Success now depends on Fortescue finding the right solution and then deploying it in the next five-and-a-half years,” author Peter Milne wrote. “Otherwise, it will continue to burn 80 million litres of diesel a year on its railways.”

In an emailed statement to Renew Economy on Tuesday, a company spokesperson said Fortescue remained fully committed to its Real Zero target at its Pilbara mines, having already identified solutions to “profitably eliminate” the majority of terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian operations.

“As with any ambitious decarbonisation effort, it is normal to encounter areas where new technologies are still being developed or tested. Any suggestion that we are off-track is simply incorrect,” the statement says.

“Decarbonising heavy haul rail is complex, particularly in a remote environment like the Pilbara. We are breaking new ground, and every challenge we face is an opportunity to learn and improve.

“As outlined in our Climate Transition Plan, we have not yet settled on a single rail decarbonisation solution – and that is by design. To date, we have progressed several pathways in parallel, including extensive work to assess and trial both battery and green ammonia options.

“Our prototype Battery Electric Locomotive was recently delivered to the Pilbara where it is being commissioned to be dispatched as part of our operating fleet, gathering valuable information to inform our ultimate rail decarbonisation solution,” the statement says.

“Importantly, our trials and studies to date have confirmed that zero-emissions rail is technically feasible – it is now a matter of delivering it in a way that maintains productivity and cost-efficiency.”",https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/whatsapp-image-2024-05-03-at-14.51.42_11025f47-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 23:00:23.206497

The fast-emerging EV market spans a diverse range, including battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, hybrids, fuel cell electric vehicles, and much more.

While Tesla dominates the public attention, a wide array of models, such as those from Ford and Hyundai, are being employed in the public sector.

EVs are steadily gaining traction across the U.S., not just with individual buyers, but also through public services sectors such as police, fire and emergency medical services. The adoption of electric vehicles began with smaller testing programs in the early 2010s in cities like Los Angeles and New York City.

However, in recent times, the integration of EVs in the public sector has picked up incredible momentum as a result of increasing environmental concerns and improvements in technology. In 2024, the South Pasadena Police Department completely replaced its gasoline-powered vehicles with EVs.

“This initiative not only ensures the safest vehicles for officers and staff, but also leads to substantial reductions in both fuel and maintenance costs,” said South Pasadena Police Chief Brian Solinsky.

As more departments consider electrifying their fleets, the advantages of EVs in the emergency sector have become increasingly evident. Key benefits include reduced carbon emissions and lowered fuel and maintenance expenses. For police cruisers, impressive acceleration and speed, along with noise-free driving, become major benefits to achieve enhanced performance while avoiding any disruptions. In the case of ambulances, rapid response time and a quieter operating environment can be beneficial, especially during high-stress medical situations. Lastly, for fire trucks, EVs allow for emission-free firefighting in addition to a quick response time.

The adoption of EVs seems to be a shift toward a more disaster-resilient, environmentally sustainable, and economically efficient future.

“Our sustainable transportation researchers are driving progress on clean energy solutions for entire sectors,” said Chris Gearhart, the director at the U.S Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences, referring to a big push towards electrifying major industries.

However, this change comes with its setbacks, such as limited range due to frequent charging halts. This challenge further exacerbates during high-stakes situations such as criminal pursuits or medical emergencies. Next, since EVs are solely reliant on the power grid, they become highly vulnerable during power outages or face battery strains during extreme weather conditions. Lastly, the initial cost of establishing an effective and available charging infrastructure, along with transforming entire fleets, places a significant financial burden on emergency departments.

While the transition towards EVs in the emergency sector is a promising step toward a cleaner future, it is crucial to address the challenges that come with it. Securing loose ends regarding the infrastructure and grid dependency should be combated with a gradual hybrid transition, allowing emergency departments to adapt slowly while proactively mitigating all potential risks.

He has used OCO data to show how satellites could measure pollution from individual power plants.","As Congress returns to session this month, the fate of two satellites that have become integral to climate science hangs in the balance.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 and -3, or OCO-2 and -3, have been circling the globe for years, gathering some of the best data available on carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.

They helped scientists determine that natural systems struggled in the extreme heat of 2023 and failed to pull in as much CO2 as normal. They’ve helped researchers track early indicators of agricultural drought in India, and measure climate-warming emissions coming out of coal power plants in Montana, Poland and Canada.

They are the “gold standard” for measuring the most abundant climate-warming gas in the atmosphere from space, according to NASA. Yet the space administration has proposed ending the satellites’ missions next year, part of the Trump administration’s proposed 24 percent reduction in the agency’s budget.

Across NASA, the cuts would amount to $6 billion. Nixing the two satellites would provide $16 million of that, about a quarter of a percent of the total.

“It would be a blow to science to have these missions canceled,” said Ray Nassar, a research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, that country’s environmental regulatory agency, who stressed that he was not commenting on the merits of a U.S. policy proposal but only its potential impact to science. He has used OCO data to show how satellites could measure pollution from individual power plants.

Nassar noted that it cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build and launch the satellites, “and the continual operation of them is a fraction of that cost. So to shut them off is … not really getting the full return on the initial investment to get them there.”

Congress has until the end of September to approve a budget for the next fiscal year, and bills introduced so far have proposed maintaining NASA’s science budget or enacting more modest cuts than the Trump administration is pursuing.

The proposed end for the satellites’ missions is part of a broader attempt by the Trump administration to slash federal investments into earth and climate sciences, including at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.

OCO-2 was launched in 2014 to measure CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and to better understand how pollution from power plants, vehicles and other sources are offset by natural systems that absorb the climate pollutant. Its launch came after a previous attempt to launch a similar satellite failed in 2009.

OCO-3, which is attached to the International Space Station, was launched in 2019. According to NASA, it provided “for the first time, daily variations in the release and uptake of carbon dioxide by plants and trees in the major tropical rain forests of South America, Africa, and South-East Asia, the largest stores of above ground carbon on our planet.”

A 2023 senior review for operating missions determined that OCO-2 was in “excellent condition” and had enough fuel to operate until 2040.

A NASA spokesperson pointed to the administration’s technical budget document, which says, “To align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities, OCO-2 and OCO-3, two climate missions beyond their prime mission, will close out and end in FY 2026.” The spokesperson added that “as the budget has not yet been enacted, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time. As always, NASA will follow the law.”

Jack Kaye, who retired from NASA in April and served as associate director of research in the earth science division, said data from the OCO satellites has become a central piece of the global science community’s work on the carbon cycle. Kaye said it would be highly unusual to shut down a well-operating satellite.

“It’s been a long time since we’ve taken something that was working well and said, ‘Let’s not do it anymore,’” Kaye said. “And these are working well.”

While some nations and private companies maintain other satellites that measure CO2, Kaye said NASA’s satellites have a stronger emphasis on calibrating and validating the data for accuracy. He noted that scientists and officials use the data from OCO-2 and -3 across the world to make environmental policy, and that turning off the satellites would take the United States “out of the information-generating game.”

Nassar said the OCO satellites provide the most precise measurements of CO2, helping scientists better understand the cycling of carbon through the atmosphere and ecosystems.

While that work could still continue without the OCO satellites, “it’s sort of like telling someone, if you didn’t have eyes you could still hear and taste, so why do you really need your eyes?” Nassar said. “It’s taking away a tool that we’re reliant on today. It doesn’t mean we don’t know anything without it, but we would have a limited view of what’s going on.”

If Congress chooses to cut funding for the satellites, there’s a chance that some other entity, like a private company or philanthropy, could take them over. In July, NASA included the OCO-3 in a list of proposals it was soliciting, saying its funding could end and that it was “seeking a partner.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iss059e114054orig.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 22:03:15.745655

Chevron and other oil companies say parish lawsuits over World War II-era oil work belong in federal not state court because the companies were assisting the war effort, and Congress lets such cases be heard in federal court.

Chevron and several co-petitioners filed a fresh opening brief at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, saying a wave of coastal-erosion lawsuits brought by Louisiana parishes should be tried in federal court under the federal-officer removal statute.

The brief – led by former U.S. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement – was filed Sept. 4 in Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish.

The case is one of dozens brought under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act, which created a coastal-use permitting program starting in 1980. The legislation includes a “grandfather clause” stating that uses lawfully started before Sept. 20, 1980, do not require a coastal permit, a point the companies say the parishes are trying to sidestep by targeting activities from decades earlier.

Chevron’s filing centers on a statute which lets cases be removed to federal court when defendants were “acting under” federal officers. The brief says Congress broadened that statute in 2011 to cover suits “relating to” acts taken under federal direction, so companies don’t need an explicit contract clause ordering the precise conduct being challenged – as long as the conduct is connected to fulfilling federal contracts.

To show that connection, the companies point to World War II. They say their predecessors increased oil production in Louisiana and refined that crude into aviation gasoline for the military under wartime directives and contracts. As Judge Andrew Oldham noted in dissent, “it is unclear how [petitioners] could have met their contractual obligations with the federal government” without ramping up production from those fields.

Chevron also highlights a recent state-court verdict as a cautionary example. Earlier this year, a Louisiana jury returned a $744.6 million award in a Coastal Resources Management Act case; the brief says the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already rejected the theories used to reach that result.

The filing opens with the principle that private parties assisting federal officials should have their federal defenses decided “free from local interests or prejudice.”

This year, the ‘theme of ‘Racing for Air’ emphasises the need to accelerate solutions and collective action to deliver clean air for all.

With global air pollution costs at USD 8 trillion per year — or 6% of global GDP — the world is falling behind on that race. New data from the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) shows that particulate pollution remained the greatest external threat to human life expectancy in 2023, the impacts comparable to smoking and exceeding other major health risks.

But this race is hardly an even one, with some nations moving fast while others, often the most vulnerable, are left far behind.

People in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in regions like South Asia, bear the brunt of the burden. The impact on life expectancy in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan — the most polluted countries in the region — is over 1.5 times that of major health risks like childhood and maternal malnutrition, and more than eight times that of unsafe water, and sanitation.

Advanced economies in Europe and North America have implemented strict laws and invested heavily in clean technologies, leading to significant improvements in air quality. Europe’s strict air quality laws are on track to cut premature air pollution-related deaths by 55% and generate up to gross annual benefits of EUR 121 billion in health, economic, and environmental benefits.

Air pollution sources: The common and the country-specific

Today, the top global sources of air pollution are fossil fuel combustion from energy production, transportation, and industrial activities, all of which release major health-harming air pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).

In many countries, coal-fired power plants and vehicles powered by fossil combustion engines are key contributors. The industrial sector, including manufacturing, smelting, and waste incineration, also releases a toxic mix of pollutants, including fine particles and chemicals.

In northern India, stubble burning by farmers during harvest season significantly worsens air quality in major cities like Delhi, which highlights the challenge in policy enforcement against deeply entrenched agricultural traditions. In Bangladesh, unregulated brick kilns are a dominant source of air pollution. While the government is working to phase them out, the social and economic needs of an estimated one million workers are often overlooked.

In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, household air pollution from the use of solid fuels for cooking has been a critical health crisis. Efforts to transition one billion people in Africa to cleaner fuels has the potential to address 10% of Africa’s total mortality, particularly those of women and children.

Transboundary air pollution is also a critical problem. Air pollutants travel beyond country borders, creating transboundary hotspots far from the source of the pollutants. The Indo-Gangetic Plain and the border region of China and Mongolia are major examples in the Asia Pacific region. Similarly, in Mainland Southeast Asia, crop burning and forest fires are a major source of transboundary haze, affecting the entire subregion.

Another highly significant issue that doesn’t receive enough attention is the need for better integration of clean energy and clean air policies. Since the sources of air pollution and climate change are often one and the same, tackling these problems individually is a self-defeating prospect that misses the opportunity for powerful, co-beneficial solutions. CREA’s work in fossil fuel dominant economies — namely China, India, Indonesia, among others — aims to provide actionable insights into energy and emissions trends, informing national dialogues to address the health and economic impacts of energy sector decisions.

Exposing the ground level impacts of emissions and poor air quality

In the six years since its establishment, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has implemented unique methodologies that reveal the connection between fossil fuel power generation and air pollution, as well as the impacts of air pollution on specific geographies, including public health, annual deaths, and economic loss. This work has demonstrated the profound power of data in loosening the grip of entrenched policies and triggering genuine action on air pollution.

The core of CREA’s air pollution work is in its health impact assessments (HIA). Through data extrapolated from satellites, atmospheric modeling, global health and population databases, CREA extracts findings on asthma, deaths, and hospital visits, all of which are linked to air pollution in specific geographies. These HIAs then assess the health impacts of specific emissions and their sources, the economic costs of air pollution, and the health costs or benefits of policies and investment projects.

For example, a recent report from CREA found that in 2023, South Africa’s coal-based economy contributed to an estimated 42,000 air pollution-related deaths, including over 1,200 deaths among children under five. Bringing these findings to the attention of the public has since empowered communities, sparking widespread civil engagement and highlighting the transformative power of data.

Data is moving the needle on air pollution across the globe

A data-driven ruling on diesel emissions in Europe

In 2015, the ‘Dieselgate’ scandal revealed that Volkswagen was using prohibited defeat devices which caused vehicles’ emission control systems to be switched on during laboratory testing conditions but then switched off under real-world driving conditions, leading to higher real-world nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions.

In response, environmental law charity ClientEarth and NGO partners including Mums for Lungs sent legal complaints to the UK and French governments in 2023 for failing to address the issue. They presented CREA HIA data tying excess emissions to 124,000 premature deaths; 90,000 new cases of asthma in children; 25,000 years of lives with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); and an economic burden of EUR 760 billion.

The report also estimated that inaction would result in an additional 81,000 premature deaths, 55,000 new cases of asthma in children, and an economic cost of EUR 430 billion.

Data into impact: On 27 July of this year, ClientEarth successfully persuaded the courts to rule that auto manufacturers must release unredacted Dieselgate documents.

Action on air pollution-related deaths in Bangladesh

In 2023, Bangladesh was ranked the most polluted country globally. To address the country’s mounting air pollution crisis, the Global Strategic Communications Council (GSCC) partnered with CREA and the Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS) to host a press conference in Dhaka in January 2025 that presented stark new findings.

CREA’s HIA work found that reducing PM2.5 pollution exposure in Bangladesh could prevent approximately 102,456 deaths annually, including deaths due to ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, and lung cancer.

It was also shown that meeting Bangladesh’s national air quality standard could reduce deaths by 19%, while meeting the WHO 2021 guideline would reduce deaths by 79%, or 81,282 lives each year. Doing so would also eliminate almost all asthma-related emergency hospital visits and preterm births, as well as avoid 262 million annual sick leave days.

Data to impact: Less than a month after the January 2025 event, it was announced that the Bangladesh government would install eight Continuous Air Monitoring Stations (CAMS) at strategic roadside locations in urban hotspots for the first time. The initiative is set to primarily focus on monitoring pollutants from vehicle emissions, a huge contributor to air pollution in cities like Dhaka and Chattogram.

Previously, CREA also provided groups like Bangladesh Working Group on Ecology and Development (BWGED) and CLEAN Bangladesh with a health impact assessment to support their campaign to stop the development of new coal-fired power plants. After many years of resistance and multiple approaches, BWGED and CLEAN Bangladesh successfully blocked Orion’s planned 635 MW coal power plant in Matarbari in 2025, leading to the cancellation of its land lease — a major win for communities, the environment, and justice.

Data is pushing air pollution progress in India

CREA’s monthly India ambient air quality report for February 2024 found Byrnihat, an industrial town notorious for its poor air quality, to be the most polluted city in India.

Data to impact: The following September, the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board (MSPCB) ordered the closure of six industrial units in Byrnihat to tackle the city’s extreme pollution levels.

In 2025, CREA examined the state of flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) systems deployment in India’s coal-fired thermal power plants, revealing delayed enforcement and persistent non-compliance, as well the government’s misuse of scientific studies to justify FGD rollbacks.

Data to impact: The CREA briefings and a viral X post successfully elevated public discourse on the subject, prompting the government to engage and finally issue a statement.

Air pollution deaths related to Ventanas coal plant in Chile

The Ventanas coal-fired complex in Chile is a 544-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant that currently operates two active units. CREA performed a world first assessment of how emissions from the Ventanas coal-fired complex have affected air quality, public health, and the economy during the plant’s operations from 2013 to 2020.

Over the eight-year period cited above, pollution from the Ventanas complex was associated with an average 563 deaths, 1,117 asthma emergency room visits, 129 low birthweight births, 238 preterm births, 575 years lived with disability, and over 300,000 days of work absences. The cumulative economic burden amounted to an estimated USD 1.4 billion.

Data to impact: The data was featured in an in-depth local documentary exploring the issue. Around the same time, the Chilean government, in a display of institutional responsiveness, publicly acknowledged the report and committed to a review.

What advocates can do to hasten clean air for all

Evidence to empower action

Together with community organisations, advocates should engage with the government using science-backed data to inform a productive dialogue centered on solutions. A collective understanding of data from impacts modeling, ambient air monitoring, and public health research must serve as the foundation to guide policy and protect the community.

Advocates play a vital role in educating stakeholders and raising awareness on the effects of air pollution, emphasising the health effects using science-backed data, as well as the economic costs that will be incurred should countries continue to operate as business as usual.

Consolidating of efforts

Advocates should find and connect with other organizations using science-backed data to strengthen each other’s work and build coalitions with other community members, organisations, and unions..

Since CREA’s founding in 2019, progress has been possible by joining forces with likeminded organisations with similar or corresponding goals. By collaborating with regional partners , CREA has been able to contribute to air pollution dialogue in countries around the world, including China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and South Africa, among others.

Much has been made of the fact that energy storage tax credits remain in place, although the new FEOC rules add restrictions and layers of complexity.
It never mentioned storage, which means, by default, the existing rules for storage are still in place,” Flakoll said.
Nonetheless, while it kept its tax credits, the addition of FEOC rules presents a big challenge for the industry, Kikuma said.
So, definitely, that restriction for projects starting after 2025, when it comes to the construction year, will have a big impact on energy storage.”","Fluence said in its most recent quarterly financial results release that customers’ projects, which had been put on hold as the tariff issue emerged in April and H.R. 1 ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’, was making its way through the legislature, are back in full development swing. Other companies have said similar things.

“I think the market is now getting used to some of the uncertainty,” Kikuma said, while some of the uncertainties that existed a few months ago are looking a little more settled.

The reciprocal tariffs placed on countries that trade with the US (and some that do not) and the subsequent back-and-forth escalation of tariffs between the US and China “definitely shook the market quite a lot,” he said.

The 90-day pause on extremely high US-China tariffs was renewed for a further three months from mid-August, which at least gives developers a window of some relative certainty to work around.

Policy expert Derrick Flakoll said the extended tariff pause coincides with the apparent finalisation of trade deals with major battery-producing regions that are not China, namely South Korea and countries in Southeast Asia.

“On top of that, the underlying fiscal policy certainty of what the tax credits are going to look like is mostly set. The deadlines are mostly known,” Flakoll said.

“The foreign entities of concern (FEOC) rule is obviously still an issue, but if you can begin construction on your project before the end of this year, you don’t have to worry about that. So that’s another sort of spur to activity picking back up. There’s a bit of a race.”

The Trump administration still needs to clarify rules, and Flakoll said it is “inevitable” that the market will take a stop-start, staccato approach: “pausing while things are uncertain, resuming when they’re more certain.”

FEOC rules still to have ‘big impact’

The administration moved as quickly as it could to remove incentives for solar PV, wind and electric vehicles (EVs) and basically, hindering the uptake of those technologies in any way it could.

Much has been made of the fact that energy storage tax credits remain in place, although the new FEOC rules add restrictions and layers of complexity.

Flakoll notes that the government moved the goalposts after the H.R 1 legislation passed concerning the start of construction date definitions for wind and solar.

Start of construction dates matter because of the timelines for receiving tax credits for wind and solar, which are winding down rapidly. Traditionally, a project could be counted as ‘in construction’ if 5% of the capex has been invested, or if any physical work has begun, including offsite work to prepare equipment such as transformers.

“The [new] guidance eliminates the 5% threshold for wind and solar, beginning as of this month, and it only affects wind and solar. It never mentioned storage, which means, by default, the existing rules for storage are still in place,” Flakoll said.

This perhaps takes us back to the second of Isshu Kikuma’s two big presentation themes: growing electricity demand across the US, which the development of hyperscale data centres for AI computing has accelerated.

Kikuma said that one perspective often heard is that forecasted load growth over the next decade or so is so immense that it likely cannot be done without energy storage being heavily involved.

Nonetheless, while it kept its tax credits, the addition of FEOC rules presents a big challenge for the industry, Kikuma said.

“If you look at the import value of lithium-ion batteries in the US, basically, three-quarters are coming from China. So, definitely, that restriction for projects starting after 2025, when it comes to the construction year, will have a big impact on energy storage.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7031.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 20:59:45.091620

Critics have assailed Trump for attacking policies to curb pollution from automobiles, one of the largest contributors of planet-warming emissions.","DETROIT: President Donald Trump’s push to cut federal sales incentives and roll back emissions standards is shaping up to be a multibillion-dollar gift to Detroit’s automakers as they shift investments into petrol-fuelled cars.

General Motors Co (GM) last week said it would cut electric-vehicle (EV) production plans at two factories as it overhauls a third plant to make petrol-fuelled pickups, instead of battery-powered trucks.

Ford Motor Co is moving funds from a cancelled three-row electric sports utility vehicle to future internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids, while Jeep-owner Stellantis NV is resurrecting the thirsty Hemi V-8 engine.

Although not yet finalised, the deregulatory push is clearing the way for Detroit’s legacy automakers and their traditional rivals to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and other costs linked to pollution rules.

GM has spent US$3.5bil since 2022 purchasing so-called regulatory credits to help the company meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements – a less-needed currency if Trump’s policies stick.

Ford has similarly cut its own credit-purchase commitments by nearly US$1.5bil this year alone, money it now plans to reallocate to petrol-powered models and hybrids.

The shift in policy “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years,” Ford chief executive officer Jim Farley recently told analysts.

Trump’s US$3.4 trillion fiscal package sunsets the US$7,500 tax credit for EV buyers on Sept 30. It also zeroed out fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates, negating the need to buy credits under those rules.

Stellantis paid US$190mil in penalties in each of the last two years.

Eliminating the fines “will save us money in 2026 and beyond for sure,” GM chief financial officer Paul Jacobson told investors last month.

Separately, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed rescinding stringent rules limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from cars and the president signed legislation effectively terminating similar regulations set by California.

“The EPA’s decision and their posture has really changed a lot in the United States,” Farley said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call.

Farley said he expects the biggest beneficiary will be the company’s Ford Blue division that builds internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids.

The unit “has carried a lot of the compliance burden” under the previous emissions regulations.

The carmaker is in the process of retooling its plant in Oakville, Ontario, to make Super Duty F-Series pickups starting next year. The factory had been in line to produce EVs until Ford scrapped that plan last year in response to sluggish demand for battery-powered models.

Critics have assailed Trump for attacking policies to curb pollution from automobiles, one of the largest contributors of planet-warming emissions.

“The EPA is revoking the biggest single step any nation has taken to save oil, save consumers money at the pump and combat global warming,” Dan Becker, director of the Centre for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said in a July statement.

But automakers blasted the standards, arguing they were so stringent that companies were being pushed to sell more plug-in models than the market would bear.

“I would be surprised if there aren’t fewer EV retailers or EV sellers in the next four to five years,” Jacobson said at a JPMorgan conference.

GM believes it can capture a bigger slice of the EV market as rivals pull out, but the automaker is happy to do so at a slower rate. — Bloomberg",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/09/09/3510959.JPG,N,,2025-09-08 22:04:01.941797

China added 87,071 more new chargepoints in July than June—which was a disappointing month for the nation’s deployment—marking a 657% increase.

Per figures from Rho Motion’s EV Charging Database, in July China installed 51,112 AC chargers and 49,209 DC chargers, with both speeds increasing by the same amount (657.1%). This indicates a coordinated, balanced expansion approach in China's charging infrastructure strategy.

It was also a strong month for the EU, EFTA, and UK, which added a combined 27,577 new chargepoints, a 91% increase from June's deployment numbers. This was predominantly in the AC segment, where 20,643 chargers were added in July, a 91% increase.

French EV charging deployment recovers

The most dramatic monthly change for any European country was in France, which in June recorded negative numbers. At the time, Rho Motion explained that “a review of out-of-order or permanently offline charging points” by trade association Avere France led to a decrease in the slow charging (AC) segment.

Overall additions in Germany were also strong with deployment increasing 50% in July compared with June and the Netherlands added 120% more chargers than in June, notably upping its DC deployment by 190% (from 92 units added in June to 267 in July).

The UK saw an overall increase of 36%, but DC deployment dropped in July to see 206 fewer chargers added than in June. It was the only country to see DC deployment decline.

Recent figures from chargepoint mapping service Zapmap show that 11,464 chargepoints have been added to the UK public network so far this year, but the majority of these were slow (AC).

Having registered a decline in DC installations in June, the US and Canada installed 2,170 new fast chargers in July, a 48% increase on the month previous, however AC installations dropped.

US new EV charger figures comparatively strong

June was a particularly strong month for the US and Canada’s AC deployment, the strongest so far this year with nearly 6,700 installations. The 3,198 chargers added in July still made the month the third strongest so far this year, behind June’s record and the previous one set in March.

It was the only region to see a net decline in charger additions but this trend may not continue after the Trump administration revived federal funding support for EV fast charging, with Rho Motion noting that this releases “billions of frozen funding” under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grant programme.

Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

To close this gap, the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2) will need to tackle unsustainable national debt burdens and a global financial architecture that is skewed towards loan-based finance, which compounds the debt problem, experts told Climate Home News.
These are all aimed at improving cross-border electricity transmission networks, building resilient infrastructure and providing the clean energy African countries need to decarbonise their economies.
“While the world accelerates towards a green energy transition, Africa appears to move sluggishly, with the risk of being left further behind,” he said.
Fakir of the African Climate Foundation said these showed that green industrialisation had “gained momentum” since the first ACS in Nairobi.","As the second Africa Climate Summit began in Ethiopia on Monday, a progress report launched by Kenya’s president highlighted how shortfalls in clean energy and infrastructure, a decline in manufacturing capacity, high debt levels and limited participation in global value chains are holding back green growth on the continent.

In 2023, at the first such summit in Nairobi, African leaders adopted a bold vision for the continent to become a clean energy hub and to develop local industries enabling their people to reap more economic benefits through a green industrialisation agenda.

The Nairobi declaration said that with 60% of the world’s best solar resources and 30% of critical mineral reserves which are essential for clean technologies, Africa would aim to process more of its raw materials, make production sustainable, play a bigger part in global supply chains and increase renewables capacity from about 50 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 300 GW by 2030.

But two years on, in a foreword to the progress report, Kenya’s leader William Ruto wrote that Africa continues “to face headwinds – from crippling debt and a persistent shortfall in climate finance to the urgent need to advance adaptation and resilience, without which Africa cannot withstand today’s pressures nor thrive tomorrow”.

Speaking at the summit’s opening plenary, Ruto added that realising Africa’s vision for a climate-safe future requires action – including from the international community which “must dismantle the structural barriers that continue to hold the continent back”.

The report showed that some progress has been made but challenges remain. As the world shifts to cleaner energy and high-tech, low-carbon supply chains, Africa is in a “fragile position”, it noted.

The continent accounts for only 2% of global manufacturing value-added, while manufacturing makes up just 11% of its gross domestic product today – compared to almost 18% in the 1980s – creating fewer jobs than in other regions, the report said.

Analysts told Climate Home that issues such as weak cooperation across the region and a continued focus on exports of low-value goods continue to hamper Africa’s green industrialisation plan. To drive it forward at this week’s summit in Addis Ababa, they said leaders should seek ways to drum up the finance and investment opportunities required to unlock the “climate-positive growth” envisaged in Nairobi.

Saliem Fakir, executive director of the African Climate Foundation, said Africa must move beyond talk and show leadership on concrete initiatives that can offer “credible investment portfolios and attract the right kind of financing to scale and deliver green industrial development objectives”.

New finance paradigm needed

Financial constraints have meant that the gap between ambition and delivery remains wide, the progress report said, with 32 African countries in or at high risk of debt distress. External debt exceeded $680 billion in 2023, and around $90 billion is expected to be paid back in 2025, it added.

On top of this, despite rising climate ambition, financial flows remain insufficient, costly and poorly targeted, the report said, with Africa receiving only 23% of the $190 billion it needs annually by 2030.

To close this gap, the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2) will need to tackle unsustainable national debt burdens and a global financial architecture that is skewed towards loan-based finance, which compounds the debt problem, experts told Climate Home News.

Meron Tesfamichael, director of the Africa energy programme at the World Resources Institute (WRI), said the continent needs “quality, accessible and affordable finance that does not create more debt and hindrances to economic development and opportunities”, adding that ACS2 should look for ways to ease the bottlenecks.

The progress report called for global financing systems to be reformed to reflect current development realities, including by expanding concessional finance, delivering faster debt relief and exploring new international levies on shipping, aviation and fossil fuels.

Seyoum Mekonen, Ethiopia’s minister of planning and development, told journalists before the summit that ACS2 would present a “unified African voice and push for climate financing” ahead of the UN General Assembly this month, the COP30 climate talks in November and the G20 summit in Johannesburg.

This week’s ACS2 and upcoming multilateral gatherings also provide an opportunity for the continent to ramp up its push for local value addition. Mohamed Adow, founder of the Nairobi-based think-tank Power Shift Africa, said ACS2 should support policies and partnerships that prioritise domestic and intra-regional mineral processing, refining and manufacturing capacity in Africa.

“This commitment should be advanced through targeted financing, concessional technology transfer, and the development of skills to ensure inclusive and sustainable industrialisation,” he told Climate Home.

Initiatives yet to deliver

The Africa progress report said that since the first summit, various continent-wide efforts have been launched to deliver on its promises, including the Africa Green Industrialisation Initiative aimed at leveraging resources and advancing investments through African financing entities and structured partnerships with governments, philanthropies and multilateral institutions.

This February, meanwhile, the African Union officially endorsed Mission 300 to provide electricity access to 300 million people by 2030 – around half of those currently living without it.

Other programmes include the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA), the Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA) – supported by the European Union – and the Continental Power System Masterplan (CMP). These are all aimed at improving cross-border electricity transmission networks, building resilient infrastructure and providing the clean energy African countries need to decarbonise their economies.

Boom in solar panel imports boosts hopes for clean energy take-off in Africa

Despite such initiatives – which are at different stages of implementation – Adow of Power Shift Africa said that overall progress on the ground since the Nairobi summit has been “disappointing”.

“While the world accelerates towards a green energy transition, Africa appears to move sluggishly, with the risk of being left further behind,” he said.

Some experts highlighted encouraging signs such as bans on exports of unprocessed minerals in Nigeria, Namibia and Zimbabwe and regional power projects such as the Zambia-Tanzania interconnector. Fakir of the African Climate Foundation said these showed that green industrialisation had “gained momentum” since the first ACS in Nairobi.

Kuda Manjonjo, a just transition associate at Power Shift Africa, said that overcoming roadblocks to green growth would require more regional corporation and trade between African countries to support industrialisation at home rather than exporting critical minerals further afield.

“It is important for Africa… to see its own continent as its primary market,” Manjonjo said. “There is not enough inward-looking to understand what’s possible and the potential that can be set up.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/ACS2-Ruto-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 01:00:11.599080

Analysts expect an EV sales bump to continue through September in the US, then drop when federal tax credits expire at the end of the month, raising financial pressure on Tesla and other automakers.

The decline highlights the threat from automakers ramping up EV incentives at a difficult time for the industry. Analysts expect an EV sales bump to continue through September in the US, then drop when federal tax credits expire at the end of the month, raising financial pressure on Tesla and other automakers.

Tesla, which once held more than 80% of the US EV market, accounted for 38% of the total EV sales in the United States in August, the first time it has fallen below the 40% mark since October 2017, when it was ramping up production of the Model 3, its first mass market car, according to early data from Cox.

While other automakers are rolling out new EVs, Tesla has turned its focus to building robotaxis and humanoid robots, delaying and canceling plans for cheaper electric vehicle models.

Much of Tesla’s trillion-dollar valuation hangs on that bet. The company’s board on Friday proposed an unprecedented $1 trillion pay package for Musk that, apart from other operational milestones, is pegged to Tesla’s value rising to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.

For now, Tesla’s core auto business remains its money maker. Its last new model was the Cybertruck pickup that rolled out in 2023 with nothing of the success of its Model 3 midsize sedan or Model Y midsize SUV. Tesla has refreshed the Model Y, once the world’s best-selling car, but the changes failed to live up to expectations, and Tesla is on track toward a second year of sales decline.

“I know they’re positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you’re a car company, when you don’t have new products, your share will start to decline,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights, said in an interview with Reuters.

Cox has more complete data for July, when Tesla’s market share fell to 42% from 48.7% in June. The drop was the sharpest since March 2021, around the time when Ford launched its Mustang Mach-E EV, according to a Reuters analysis of the data.

Musk’s right-wing political work and association with President Trump also has hurt the brand. Musk helped guide Trump’s efforts this year to downsize and reshape the US government but left the administration in May and had a falling out with the Republican president.

Sales of new EVs jumped more than 24% month over month in July to 128,268, according to the Cox data, driven by the looming end of a $7,500 tax credit for EVs and attractive deals. Tesla saw sales rise 7% to 53,816, even as its market share fell.

In August, Tesla’s growth slowed to 3.1%, and the broader market grew by 14%, the preliminary data showed.

Competition against Tesla has turned fierce at EV dealer lots.

While scouring for a car for everyday use last month, Topojoy Biswas, a 41-year-old tech worker in the San Francisco Bay area, was greeted with a range of deals, including zero down payment and zero interest rates, from various EV dealers.

Instead of the Toyota Camry he initially was eyeing, Biswas bought a Volkswagen ID.4, VW’s competition to the Model Y, lured by an attractive lease price and an offer of free fast-charging. Volkswagen sales rose more than 450% in July from the previous month.

“It felt like the deal of the market,” Biswas said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/elon-musk-tesla-market-share.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1757335681&w=1024,N,,2025-09-08 20:01:19.170541

Meanwhile, state transportation funding has weakened due to a plateau in gasoline tax revenue.
But state and local lawmakers are reluctant to fill the gap, with some Republicans blaming poor fiscal management.
Such drastic cuts could trigger a “death spiral” if the cuts drive away more riders, the agency wrote on its website.
And in New York City, the transit system brought in a surge of new revenue by charging a toll on vehicles entering southern Manhattan.","Cities across the U.S. are sacrificing public transportation as budgets shrink and costs climb.

That could have far-reaching consequences not only for the buses and subways that millions of Americans rely on — but for reducing climate-warming emissions in the transportation sector, the source of roughly one-fifth of the planet’s greenhouse gases.

“This feels like potentially a major turning point in transit history in North America,” Matthew Palm, a transportation planning researcher at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, told my colleague Adam Aton.

The Philadelphia area’s transportation agency is grappling with a more than $200 million deficit — leading it to briefly implement a 20 percent reduction in service and then raid its capital improvement fund. The Chicago Transit Authority is warning of a 40 percent cut in services without fresh funds from lawmakers. Similar tales are playing out in Dallas; Portland, Ore.; Pittsburgh; and the Bay Area, Adam writes.

Transit agencies say ridership on public bus and rail lines has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic norms, even as costs like labor, fuel and maintenance have risen. Meanwhile, state transportation funding has weakened due to a plateau in gasoline tax revenue.

But state and local lawmakers are reluctant to fill the gap, with some Republicans blaming poor fiscal management. Lawmakers from rural areas are also balking at paying for services they argue primarily benefit urban dwellers.

“You have people that don’t feel that they’ll directly benefit from these services [who are] unwilling to pay into it,” Corrigan Salerno, the policy manager for Transportation for America, told Adam. “Even though, when these regions do well, they pay into state coffers, which in net will benefit their [rural] communities.”

Transit agencies have turned to cuts as deficits balloon. Slashing services, however, isn’t always enough to make up the difference.

In San Francisco, Bay Area Rapid Transit warned that the system would need to be cut by as much as 85 percent to recoup savings of just 40 percent. Such drastic cuts could trigger a “death spiral” if the cuts drive away more riders, the agency wrote on its website.

But Adam writes that some positive changes for public transportation could be on the horizon. In the 2024 election, voters in 51 districts around the country supported measures that boosted local transportation funds. President Donald Trump won 32 of those districts.

And in New York City, the transit system brought in a surge of new revenue by charging a toll on vehicles entering southern Manhattan. The Trump administration attempted to yank federal approval of that policy, but a federal judge has allowed it to continue — so far.

Grant recipients wonder where to go next

Recipients of grants from the Inflation Reduction Act are questioning whether it’s worthwhile to apply for more federal aid after the Trump administration canceled funding this year, Alex Guillén writes.

Leaders in Kipnuk, Alaska, for example, are scrambling to replace the $20 million that the federal government once promised to build a rock wall to protect the town from coastal erosion. They had purchased a bulldozer and started making plans. Now they have few options.

“I do just wonder, the back of my mind is always, like, is it really worth applying for this? Is this [grant] going to be another one that’s going to be jerked out from under one of the tribes?” said Sheryl Musgrove, director of the climate justice program at the Alaska Institute for Justice.

Fired FEMA chief dishes on time at agency

The former Navy SEAL who briefly headed Trump’s Federal Emergency Management Agency recently spoke about his “very hostile relationship” with Department of Homeland Security officials, Thomas Frank writes.

Cameron Hamilton discussed his tenure atop FEMA for the first time last week on the Disaster Tough Podcast. He said he warned officials that talk of abolishing FEMA was “really divisive language” and “extremely unwise.”

“That’s when the divide started to happen between myself and DHS leadership, [which was saying], ‘No, we don’t want it. We want it cut, shut down,’” he recalled. “My argument was, ‘This is extremely irresponsible.’”

Megalaw could bust New Mexico’s oil boom

The Republican megalaw slashed the royalties states receive for oil and gas production, and it’s causing an outsize effect in New Mexico, Ian M. Stevenson writes.

New Mexico is the No. 2 oil-producing state in the country and stands to lose billions of dollars in funding after the megalaw reduced the royalty rate from 16.67 percent to 12.5 percent. Nearly 35 percent of the state’s budget is tied to oil and gas after production boomed in the Permian Basin.

“It’s an outrage,” said Greg Bloom, assistant commissioner of mineral resources at the New Mexico State Land Office. “The Trump administration is picking the pocket of New Mexicans and other states and giving away a valuable resource to the oil and gas industry.”

If you work for a company that is still waffling about attending Climate Week NYC, let me be clear: there’s never been a more important time to engage. Despite headwinds in the United States, state and local progress is undeniable, and — as RMI has always championed — markets and economics remain powerful engines for the energy transition both domestically and abroad.

Here are the trends that corporates need to know going into Climate Week.

1. The energy transition is forging ahead in 80 percent of the world

Since 2020, total investment in the energy transition has grown year after year — and momentum is only building. In 2024, China led with $818 billion, with the EU and United States following at $380 billion and $338 billion respectively. Together, these figures point to the accelerating scale of global investment carrying into 2025 and beyond.

The Global South is poised to drive the next wave of growth over the next 25 years. With population and economic expansion, clean energy portfolios are quickly becoming the least-cost option available in many markets. In India, some 93 percent of investment for power generation is going to clean sources, and solar-plus-storage is already cheaper than coal on a life-cycle basis. Renewables are expected to supply most of India’s new generation, and non-fossil sources already account for more than 50 percent of existing capacity.

The Global South is forging ahead in electrified transportation as well. In 2024, annual sales of EVs more than doubled in Brazil and Africa. More than half of all car sales in China will be electric in 2025, and India is the world’s largest electric three-wheeler market with approximately 700,000 electric three-wheelers sold in 2024. Our analysis shows that due to falling battery costs, EVs will make up between 62 and 86 percent of global car sales by 2030.

But obstacles remain high. Geopolitical tensions, armed conflict, and growing nationalism create barriers for global supply chains and initiatives across OECD countries. Fortunately, the energy transition will continue to move forward in much of the Global South for a simple reason: it just makes economic sense. For corporates, the choice is whether to keep pace with this momentum or risk being left behind.

2. Modernizing the grid is the key to unlocking energy transition leadership

Across all my work, I keep hearing about the perfect storm of spiking electricity demand, driven by AI data centers, new manufacturing, vehicle and appliance electrification, and extreme heat. Regardless of where in the world you sit, there is a need for increased electrons. Our need for electricity is actually growing at twice the rate of our increasing energy demand.

Here in the United States, we need to connect terawatts of clean energy to the grid at a time with slow interconnection processes and gas turbine delivery delays. The convergence of these pressures, coupled with the digitalization of grid infrastructure, provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fundamentally reform how power systems operate.

The United States has invested trillions in the grid since the 1950s, creating one the most remarkable machines on the planet. But today, that grid runs at only 40 percent utilization. No capital-intensive asset should be deployed at that level when alternatives exist. Initial investments have already been made in batteries, rooftop solar, and demand response from factories, but more remains to do. Other innovative models like virtual power plants, grid-enhancing technologies, reconductoring, and digitalization, plus energy efficiency, can make the American grid the center point of economic competitiveness in this increasingly electrified world. A focus only on adding supply, however, risks perpetuating inefficiency and decreases international competitiveness. The United States should first target getting more from the assets that it has already paid for, not adding costly infrastructure onto an aging system.The US should first target getting more from the assets that it has already paid for – where timelines frequently are faster for upgrade – even as it considers additional options for new generation for replacement and addition.

If the United States approaches the opportunity in the right way, it can increase competitiveness and affordability. Tackling this will require new approaches to regulation and policy. But the country has achieved this outcome before: in the 1980’s and 90’s, rates went down for customers even as service improved and the grid expanded.

Stay tuned for more RMI thinking on this topic during Climate Week.

3. Insurance is reaching its tipping point, but joint action can open new pathways

Extreme weather events can destroy assets in a moment and disrupt supply chains overnight. Chronic weather shifts — drought, sea level rise, and wildfires — are threatening companies and eroding whole industries, like Florida’s citrus industry. Although climate-related weather disasters can hit anywhere at any time, the risks are concentrated in states with a high contributions to US GDP, like Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, and Illinois.

Insurance is the economy’s shock absorber, but it has limits. Globally, roughly 60 percent of disaster losses go uninsured. And once an asset becomes uninsurable, its value can collapse overnight — wiping out equity, eroding municipal tax bases, and destabilizing credit portfolios. At scale, this can be a major problem for a country with some of the most expensive assets in the world. Think 2008’s housing crash, but driven by wind, water, and fire instead of bad loans.

The frustrating part? Resilience is one of the best investments available. Allstate and the US Chamber of Commerce peg the return at $13 for every $1 spent. Yet the capital flows aren’t there due to collective action problems, low standardization, and short-term thinking. In corporate terms: it’s like knowing the factory roof leaks but refusing to fix it because it doesn’t always rain.

We’ve solved for these same challenges in the banking sector, through RMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance. If insurers and banks can work more closely on resilience, the market can do the rest.Center for Climate-Aligned Finance. If insurers and banks can work more closely on resilience, the market can do the rest. Expect more engagement on this issue at Climate Week and beyond.

4. Industrial transformation is still possible

Heavy industry is called “hard-to-abate” for a reason: outside of China, economics are not yet on the side of decarbonization. Sectors like steel, chemicals, and cement remain in early adoption economics with limited cost-competitiveness and shallow learning curves on requisite decarbonization technologies. Many global companies can invest only limited funds in these new solutions, and continue with business as usual for the majority of their assets, hoping that long-term solutions like carbon capture ultimately become available. Scaling up new technologies requires a clearer path from first-of-a-kind projects to widespread deployment, and policy interventions will be required to move competitive commodity industries across geographies.

The International Maritime Organization is showing what is possible: by assigning a global carbon price that will come into effect in 2027, it is beginning to shift behaviors across global shipping. Aviation is not far behind. But other industries will need clearer signals. Voluntary buyer groups can play a critical role in the near term, but long-term transformation will require government procurement leverage and policy incentives — including carbon pricing — to send unambiguous market signals.

RMI is working to grow demand for lower-emissions products to drive investment into innovative heavy industry and transport technologies while giving companies credible tools to meet their sustainability goals. By aggregating demand for steel, cement, chemicals, and aluminum, we are building market systems that support deep decarbonization. Keep an eye out for news about the latest concrete demand initiative, launching at Climate Week.

5. Carbon markets need credibility

The Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) has long held promise, but today it suffers from inconsistent standards, data opacity, and market fragmentation. Without trust, corporates are losing faith and stepping back. At the same time, regulatory approaches are gaining ground. The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is one example that is challenging global businesses to count emissions. Some companies are going a step further and pushing for carbon accounting systems based on standards akin to GAAP, which could differentiate performance without voluntary markets, and might ultimately drive global policy alignment. Virtually every major company is counting its carbon, so why not harmonize methods and create a much more thorough ledger of activity?

RMI’s Carbon Markets Initiative is working to provide that foundation through an open, standardized data framework. During Climate Week, we’ll feature our new Carbon Data Open Protocol which standardizes carbon market data to improve integrity, interoperability, and scale.

The direction is clear: the markets that succeed will be those built on transparency and integrity.

The details: When will my EV carpool sticker expire?
Violations of California’s carpool lanes, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, carry fines of $490.
For more than 20 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles.
“We think it’s time to return carpool lanes to the carpools.","Sorry EV drivers, you’re about to lose one of your most-coveted perks.

One of California’s longest-running incentives for people to buy electric cars — a program that provides access to carpool lanes regardless of how many people are in their vehicle — is coming to end. The Clean Air Vehicle decal program expires on Sept. 30.

After that, the colorful stickers that have given drivers of Teslas, Priuses, Leafs, Rivians, and other electric vehicles privileges to cruise along the carpool lane during commute times on congested roads like Highway 101 in Silicon Valley, 880 in the East Bay or the 405 freeway in Los Angeles for nearly 25 years will be shut down and the special perks will end. The details:

When will my EV carpool sticker expire?

Midnight on Sept. 30, statewide.

What happens if I am driving in a carpool lane during restricted hours with no passengers after that?

The CHP can pull you over and write you a ticket. Violations of California’s carpool lanes, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, carry fines of $490.

“Starting October 1, 2025, you must obey the posted vehicle occupancy requirement to travel in the carpool (HOV) lane or risk receiving a citation and fine,” the California Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement.

Why is this happening?

For more than 20 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles. The original idea was to provide incentives to sell the vehicles, which reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But under the most recent version of the federal law, signed by President Obama in 2015, and called the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” those permissions expire on Sept. 30. Republicans who have majorities in the House and Senate have not reauthorized the program, and President Trump has taken steps this year already to end federal tax credits for electric vehicles, and to block a California law requiring all new vehicles sold in the state starting in 2035 be electric.

Can California do anything about it?

No. Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027. It passed with large bipartisan majorities in Sacramento. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law last September. But it won’t take effect unless Congress reauthorizes the program.

There are still three weeks left. Is there any chance Congress will save the program?

Not likely. There is an outside chance that House leaders could jam language at the last minute into a large continuing resolution as part of a compromise to keep funding the federal government after Sept. 30, but experts watching the issue don’t expect it.

“I would put the chances of reauthorization as very slim,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group.

Will my EV sticker still get me discounted or free tolls for bridges and in high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes?

No. Starting Oct. 1, the FasTrak CAV toll tag will automatically switch to a regular FasTrak Flex tag, and the driver will be charged full tolls for bridges and express lanes unless vehicles meet carpool occupancy rules.

What’s the main argument in favor of letting the carpool tags expire?

When the program first began, after former Gov. Gray Davis signed AB 71, a law written by former Republican Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose in 1999, less than 2% of the cars on the road were electric. Last year in California, 25.3% of the new vehicles sold were electric, according to the California Energy Commission.

In some counties, the number is even higher. In Santa Clara County, a stunning 43.8% of new passenger vehicles purchased last year were “zero emission” — basically electric or plug-in hybrid. In Marin County, it was 40.1%; Alameda County 37.7%; Contra Costa County 32.7%; San Mateo County 25.3% and San Francisco 35.6%. It was 31% in Orange County, and 26.5% in Los Angeles County.

“We think it’s time to return carpool lanes to the carpools. It’s fine for the program to expire,” said Magavern, whose group does not support the program continuing.

Who supports continuing the carpool perk?

Some environmental groups do, along with the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group of automakers, and the California Air Resources Board.

The air board argues that despite huge improvements in recent decades, California still has some of the nation’s dirtiest air (mostly in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley), and for the state to reach its clean air and greenhouse gas goals, more electric vehicles need to keep entering the roads.

What are the ramifications of this change? How will it affect traffic?

Nobody knows for sure. It could add more vehicles to the regular lanes, increasing traffic. It could cause more people to ride to work with others so they can stay in the carpool lane. It might further depress EV sales. They have dipped this year, led by Tesla, the top-selling EV nationwide and in California, in part because many potential buyers in largely Democratic states where the most EVs are purchased are unhappy with Tesla CEO Elon Musk providing $250 million to President Trump’s campaign and helping him fire federal workers through his DOGE program.

Do I have to remove the decal from my vehicle on October 1, 2025?

No. If you want you can take it off. Or you can leave it as a souvenir of a bygone era.",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SJM-L-CARPOOL-0909.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-09-08 20:01:24.537599

The electric truck and sport-utility vehicle manufacturer is preparing for a challenging year in which it plans to launch a more affordable model even as it gets more expensive to buy an EV.

A spokesperson at the company said that the layoffs are equivalent to about 1.5% of its total staff of nearly 15,000. The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs.

Rivian is among the many car companies bracing for the changes in federal tax credits.

Under President Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 tax credit, which some buyers receive for purchasingEVs, is set to expire at the end of this month. The credit of up to $4,000 for used EVs also will end.

It's an abrupt reversal of Biden-era efforts to address climate change emissions from gasoline cars.

Transportation is the most significant source of climate-warming emissions in California and the U.S., and experts warn that the sector must become far cleaner to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

In California, approximately one-quarter of new cars sold are either fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, according to the California Energy Commission.

That progress could stall. The planned phaseout of state credits is expected to dampen EV sales, which already have slowed due to waning consumer interest and high tariffs on imported cars.

Anticipating a slowdown in demand as the incentives end, General Motors has laid off 360 workers in Detroit due to the slowed production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Volkswagen plans to temporarily furlough 160 employees and slow production of its electric SUV.

Rivian's newest model, the R2 SUV, is slated to come out next year.

""We have made some recent changes to the Commercial team as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,"" a Rivian spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Times.

It will be one of the company's more affordable options, starting at $45,000. Its current R1S SUV starts at $76,900. At this price level, Rivian will be able to compete with other EV companies such as Tesla, which also has a model starting at about $45,000.

Rivian first made a name for itself with its Earth-toned electric trucks, which debuted in 2018. The company was founded in Florida and moved to Irvine in 2020, where it is based today.

The introduction of its heavy-duty EVs initially appealed to more-affluent consumers, with some of the models sporting sticker prices above $120,000.

After taking the company public in 2021, the retailer has faced a number of challenges. It has had to grapple with supply chain issues, steep price points and order delays.

Like all EV companies, it is now struggling with policy changes out of Washington.

Because Rivian makes only EVs, the company's sales have been derailed with changes in compliance credits. Previously, the company would sell these credits to other car companies that needed to meet fuel economy and emission standards.

In its second quarter, the company reported a loss of $1.1 billion.

Rivian shares have climbed about 5% this year. That's less than half the gain of the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index for the same period.

In December, the EPA issued a final rule that reclassified areas of Milwaukee, Kenosha and Sheboygan counties in “serious nonattainment” of its 2015 ozone standards.
In 2018, environmental group Clean Wisconsin sued the EPA to force the agency to reclassify southeastern Wisconsin counties as “nonattainment” or failing to meet air quality standards for ozone pollution.
In its motion last month, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said reclassifying those areas as seriously failing to meet air quality standards would result in Wisconsin businesses facing strict new requirements.
“This requirement could create $4 million in added costs for Wisconsin, reducing funding for other air quality work,” Kaul wrote.","For now, Wisconsin will avoid costly requirements to meet air quality standards for ozone pollution in parts of southeastern Wisconsin under a recent federal appeals court order.

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted the state’s request to temporarily postpone a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in an order issued Friday. It comes after Wisconsin filed a motion last month saying the rule imposes “costly and burdensome requirements” on the state and businesses.

In December, the EPA issued a final rule that reclassified areas of Milwaukee, Kenosha and Sheboygan counties in “serious nonattainment” of its 2015 ozone standards. The state petitioned for review of the rule in February.

In a statement, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce applauded the court’s order to stay the EPA rule. Scott Manley, executive vice president of government relations for WMC, said the court order provides relief to employers who face “crushing and job-killing ozone regulations.”

“Data from both the (Department of Natural Resources) and EPA indicate that the vast majority of ozone pollution in eastern Wisconsin is caused by emissions originating from outside our state borders,” Manley wrote. “It’s unfair to punish Wisconsin businesses for pollution they didn’t create, and (the) order is the first step toward righting this wrong.”

Ozone pollution, also called smog, often occurs in the summer when air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from industry, power plant or vehicle emissions interact with heat and sunlight.

The DNR previously told WPR that ozone-causing pollutants are carried in the air over Lake Michigan from outside areas, causing shoreline counties in southeastern Wisconsin to have higher levels of ozone pollution. The agency has said Wisconsin sources contribute no more than 10 percent to elevated ozone levels while the rest comes from other states or outside sources.

In 2018, environmental group Clean Wisconsin sued the EPA to force the agency to reclassify southeastern Wisconsin counties as “nonattainment” or failing to meet air quality standards for ozone pollution.

“The fact that southeastern Wisconsin has been reclassified as in serious nonattainment for ozone means that residents of those counties are at higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and Wisconsin should be implementing all possible policies and strategies to reduce ozone pollution to protect public health,” Clean Wisconsin attorney Katie Nekola said in a statement.

Nekola added that the existence of pollution from outside sources doesn’t absolve Wisconsin industries from doing their part to cut back on pollution.

In its motion last month, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said reclassifying those areas as seriously failing to meet air quality standards would result in Wisconsin businesses facing strict new requirements.

“This change triggers costly permit requirements, complex regulations, and stringent emissions offset mandates,” Kaul wrote in a court filing.

According to the state’s filing, Wisconsin businesses would be considered major sources of pollution if their facilities produce between 50 and 100 tons per year of nitrogen oxides or volatile organic compounds.

The change would also require the state to revise its plan for complying with national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act by January, “requiring extensive staff time and resources.” The DNR would also have to process more permits, according to the filing.

“This requirement could create $4 million in added costs for Wisconsin, reducing funding for other air quality work,” Kaul wrote.

The DNR also estimated 382 southeastern Wisconsin sources or businesses would need to review their operations to see if they need new or revised permits to meet requirements. The agency estimated businesses could face between $1 million and $6.9 million in costs.

In 2015, the Obama administration created a standard for ozone pollution at 70 parts per billion — a stricter standard than the previous 75 parts per billion threshold. The EPA must designate an area as “nonattainment,” or not meeting the standard, if it has an air quality monitor that exceeds the ozone threshold or if sources contribute to a violation of federal air quality standards.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250723_MKELAKE09-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 22:03:19.800325

NORMAN, OK, UNITED STATES, September 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- PCI Energy Solutions today announced the launch of a collection of free energy market AI chatbots. These tools are designed to help market participants, analysts, and operators get faster, higher-quality answers to questions about North American ISO/RTO rules, procedures, and business practice manuals. The flagship ISO Bot is trained on key ISO/RTO documentation across all North American markets, with built-in links to download underlying source manuals so users can verify answers instantly.

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, ISO Bot is purpose-built for organized power markets and has been tested to outperform ChatGPT on queries that rely on up-to-date ISO/RTO documentation. It’s maintained by PCI market experts to keep pace with market changes.

“Market rules are nuanced and evolving. Our goal was to make authoritative documentation discoverable and usable in seconds—without sacrificing verifiability,” said David Christopher, Senior Director of Marketing at PCI Energy Solutions. “Chatbots like ISO Bot help new and veteran market participants reduce research time and make decisions faster. Of course, AI can make mistakes, and we encourage users to check answers before acting on them.”

Since the soft launch, PCI has seen strong, organic engagement from utilities and independent power producers who are using the chatbots to speed up onboarding, cross-check their own interpretations, and reduce research time on documentation-dependent questions. As adoption grows, PCI will continue expanding coverage and improving the AI to better answer questions.

“Documentation is the single source of truth in organized markets. We built these AI assistants to respect the manuals, not replace them—pairing speed with provenance,” said Shailesh Mishra, SVP, Commercial & Customer Success at PCI Energy Solutions. “It’s the research tool we wanted on our own desks.”

Because the documentation for emerging programs like SPP Markets+ and ERCOT RTCB is in constant flux, PCI maintains stand-alone AI bots for these initiatives. The M+ Bot helps participants keep pace with evolving SPP Markets+ program rules, while the RTCB Bot is dedicated to ERCOT’s Real-Time Co-Optimization with Batteries initiative. Both bots have been tested in real-world use and are seeing rapid adoption among utilities and IPPs who need authoritative, current guidance on these specific programs.

The Energy Department will make up to $60 million available for two additional critical mineral programs, the agency said in an Aug. 25 release.

One program aims to support organizations developing technologies to shorten the evaluation timeline for ore deposits. The other focuses on using AI and high-throughput experimentation to create new types of rare earth magnets, the release said.

“Developing faster, more accurate resource evaluation tools, and creating a new more powerful class of magnetic materials will enable America to unlock domestic reserves, strengthen supply chains, and enhance U.S. energy and economic security,” Daniel Cunningham, acting director of the department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, said in the release.

Dive Insight:

The programs comply with President Donald Trump’s March 20 Executive Order to develop U.S. critical mineral resources. The order seeks to reduce the country’s reliance on foreign nations for materials necessary for domestic and military manufacturing.

The Energy Department launched the latest round of Notice of Funding Opportunity two weeks after making nearly $1 billion available for projects that advance and expand mining, processing and manufacturing technologies for critical minerals.

The DOE allocated $40 million to the Reliable Ore Characterization with Keystone Sensing program. The funding targets the development of advanced drilling, sensing, and analytical technologies that cut the time needed to evaluate ore deposits from years to months.

The department dedicated the remaining $20 million in funding to the Magnetic Acceleration Generating New Innovations and Tactical Outcomes program. The financing will support the development of novel magnetic materials with new chemistries and microstructures, per the DOE.

The MAGNITO funding targets organizations employing AI, machine learning and high-throughput experimentation, the DOE said. The latter refers to research techniques that use automated systems and parallel processing to conduct large numbers of experiments simultaneously or in rapid succession.

The J.H. Campbell plant in Ottawa County was supposed to shut down in May, then August, and now the federal government will keep it running through November.

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) advocacy group says Consumers Energy planned to shut down the plant in May after a settlement agreement several years ago.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright ordered it to remain open instead, citing an emergency energy shortage.

The Trump administration’s order will extend the plant's energy generation for another 90 days.

Previous coverage:

The Department of Energy expressed concern homes and businesses would face outages if the J.H. Campbell plant is shut down, but the Natural Resources Defense Council says it sees no evidence for any emergency, and calls its operation outdated and inefficient.

""You can imagine the amount of money that has gone into having to get it up to a place where it could run,"" Michigan Policy Director of Climate and Energy for NRDC Derrell Slaughter said.

The council claims the plant is costing nearly $1 million per day, and taxpayers across the Midwest are paying for it.

Slaughter says the original settlement also revealed health issues caused by emissions.

""Some of the nastiest chemicals that get into folks' lungs, they cause all types of health effects like asthma and other breathing issues,"" he said.

Republican State Senator Roger Victory responded to the NRDC’s claims, acknowledging the cost of keeping the J.H. Campbell plant operational:

There is a cost associated with keeping the Campbell plant open, however, when operating the facility does generate revenue which can help to offset those costs. A recent report from Energy Ventures Analysis contends that the operation likely saved ratepayers money during the first two months of the order. I encourage those who have claimed a direct cost to taxpayers for operation of the plant to wait for the FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] filing later this year, which should present a clearer financial picture.

The department has cited the NERC [North American Electric Reliability Corporation] report that indicates “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls” in the MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] region, and other detail highlighting concerns which demonstrate the importance of the Campbell plant to the regional grid. As we look to address the immediate costs associated with continued operation, I would advocate that the costs to maintain this regional asset should be shared across the MISO region.

I hope to see Secretary Wright provide a longer-term order to maintain the Campbell plant. This would allow the plant to better plan for operational costs and maintenance and ensure secure and reliable energy as we continue to strengthen our energy grid.

The NRDC says any delay to close the plant also delays a plan to supply cleaner energy.

""Hence why it is even more frustrating that the administration came in like it did to essentially undermine a really well thought-out process,"" Slaughter said.

Court Hands Trump EPA Win in Bid to Claw Back Biden Climate Grants

A US appeals court last Tuesday cleared the way for the Trump administration to reclaim around US$16bn of climate grants awarded to non-profit groups, reversing a lower court ruling that had frozen the money.

The money, part of former President Biden’s US$20bn Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), was intended to bankroll a wide range of decarbonization and climate resilience initiatives, including infrastructure upgrades to harden communities against extreme weather and natural disasters.

The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 that the dispute falls under contract law and should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, which had issued a preliminary injunction against the claw back in April. “While some grantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the litigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the government and the public in the proper stewardship of billions of taxpayer dollars,” the majority opinion reads.

At the center of the legal fight are five non-profits — including the Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, and the Justice Climate Fund — that had been awarded large chunks of funding last year, but have been unable to access the money from their accounts at Citibank since February.

Their lawsuit argues that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under Trump’s pick Lee Zeldin, illegally froze and terminated already-disbursed funds without justification. Zeldin, in a February video, slammed the grants as “boatloads of cash” funneled to progressive groups under the guise of environmental justice. By March, he’d called for an internal review, effectively halting the program’s rollout.

Judge Nina Pillard, the lone dissenting voice on the appeals panel, argued the move was a politically driven assault on climate investment and directly undermined Congress’s spending authority. She noted the lack of credible legal reasoning from the EPA and warned that allowing such unilateral action threatens the integrity of congressionally mandated climate initiatives. Pillard was appointed to the bench by President Obama, while the two judges in the majority were appointed by President Trump.

Climate United CEO Beth Bafford maintains that the funding freeze is unlawful and vowed to continue fighting.

“This is another hurdle in our fight to lower energy costs for those who need it most while creating jobs for hardworking Americans, but we will continue to press on for communities across the country that stand to benefit from clean, abundant, and affordable energy. This is not the end of our road,” she said.

In Brief

US homes worth a collective US$12.7trn now face severe or extreme flood, wind, or wildfire risk, according to Realtor.com’s 2025 Housing and Climate Risk Report. Besides the direct threats they pose, these hazards are also rapidly changing housing markets and insurance availability. In places like Miami and New Orleans, insurance premiums can reach up to 3.7% of a home’s value, and that doesn’t include separate flood policies or steep hurricane deductibles. In addition, the report finds that US$1trn of housing outside of FEMA flood zones are at risk of inundation, revealing a major blind spot in federal mapping. (Realtor.com)

A top executive at Munich Re has warned that the growing role of hedge funds and private investors in the reinsurance sector could upend the market for catastrophe cover, especially after major climate-related disasters. In an interview with the Financial Times, Board member Stefan Golling said the US$115bn surge in alternative capital into catastrophe bonds and reinsurance ‘sidecars’ could inject volatility into the disaster insurance market, as these investors may lack underwriting expertise and could withdraw capital abruptly after losses, as seen after Hurricane Ian in 2022. (Financial Times)

Global insured losses from natural catastrophes are climbing fast, with Verisk projecting a $152 billion annual average — driven less by blockbuster hurricanes and more by fast-moving hazards like wildfires, floods, and severe storms. These so-called frequency perils now account for nearly two-thirds of expected losses, reflecting a new risk regime shaped by rapid urban growth, inflation-fueled exposure, and the creeping effects of climate change. (Verisk)

Climate-related shareholder proposals lost traction in 2025, with filings down nearly 50% and none passing, data compiled by The Conference Board shows. Submitted proposals numbered 101 in 2023, 102 in 2024, and just 56 this year. Investors grew more selective on what proposals to back amid political headwinds — but also in response to improved climate-related metrics, targets, and governance practices introduced by many companies. A rule change by the US Securities and Exchange Commission made it easier for companies to exclude ESG proposals, further dampening activity. (The Conference Board)

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has released Phase 2A of its Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, introducing a “Climate Change Adaptation” category to capture investments that help prevent, adjust to, or reduce the impacts of a warming world. While voluntary, the taxonomy is being positioned as a tool for capacity building and may eventually inform regulatory supervision. The updated taxonomy is open for public consultation until October 8. (HKMA)

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has inked a US$200mn lending deal with Turkey’s Development and Investment Bank (TKYB) to boost private investment in climate resilience and digital infrastructure. The ‘on-lending facility’ will see TKYB borrow from the AIIB in order to re-lend funds for investments in climate mitigation, adaptation, and climate-related industries. These include projects that bolster the resilience of productive processes, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, as well as nature-based solutions like drought management, water storage, and afforestation.

EU’s Climate Resilience Push Gets Business Backing

The European Union’s forthcoming climate resilience initiative is getting an early thumbs-up from businesses and trade groups. However, respondents to a recent consultation made plain that lawmakers had to bring the private sector to the table and create space for adaptation to become an investable market.

Feedback sent to the European Commission came from respondents including engineering firms, insurers, multinationals, and climate policy outfits, urging lawmakers to prioritize market-making and long-term finance as part of the initiative, which is due to be finalized in 2026. A total of 237 individuals and organizations responded to the call for evidence.

The initiative aims to roll out a mix of legislative and non-legislative tools to shore up Europe’s climate preparedness. Key goals include harmonized risk assessments, stress testing of critical assets, and embedding ""resilience by design"" into investment decisions.

Almost all the feedback supported the new initiative, with many respondents calling on the EU to embrace an ambitious resilience agenda. The European Federation of Engineering Consultancy Associations pressed lawmakers to ensure all infrastructure investments would be designed to withstand climate risks over their lifecycle and to implement climate stress testing of taxpayer-funded assets. Climate KIC, the bloc’s top climate innovation agency, added that the EU should have a binding climate resilience goal by 2050, complete with targets and indicators co-designed with key economic sectors and other stakeholders. It also called for long-term financing for resilience to be baked into the EU’s budgeting process.

Insurance stakeholders also responded in force. The Lloyd’s Market Association — representing fifty-one managing agents at the London-based insurance organization — said the EU should steer clear of measures that restrict insurance capital or warp pricing while promoting alternative risk transfer solutions, like parametric insurance. Trade body Insurance Europe said policymakers could consider an EU-level Climate Resilience Investment Fund to finance resilience upgrades in vulnerable communities and high-risk sectors.

As for corporates, carmaker BMW wrote that efforts should be focused on reducing red tape and overhauling the regulatory framework so it can better address forthcoming climate-related challenges. Similarly, biomedical giant Bayer called for “a harmonised and coherent outcome-based agricultural sustainability policy and regulatory framework” to incentivize sustainability performance, including on climate resilience.

Following a period of public consultation and rulemaking, the European Commission says it plans to adopt the new resilience initiative sometime in the last three months of 2026.

In Brief

More than 85 leading climate scientists have issued a scathing rebuttal to the US Department of Energy’s July 2025 report downplaying the risks of greenhouse gas emissions. In a 400+ page expert review, the authors accuse the DOE Climate Working Group (CWG) of cherry-picking data, misrepresenting scientific consensus, and relying on just five “hand-picked contrarians” to produce a report riddled with “basic errors”. The DOE report was issued ahead of a push by the Environmental Protection Agency to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding, which provides the legal basis for the bulk of US climate regulations.

Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is reintroducing the America’s Clean Future Fund Act, a sweeping climate bill that aims to invest in US climate resilience while slashing emissions and boosting clean energy jobs. The legislation would impose an economy-wide carbon tax starting at US$75 per metric ton, ramping up over time, and fund a new Climate Change Finance Corporation to back resilience and clean tech projects, especially in environmental justice and fossil fuel-dependent communities. Durbin first introduced the bill in 2020 with a carbon price of US$25 per ton. (Senator Dick Durbin)

Two wildland firefighting crews raided by immigration agents at Washington’s Bear Gulch fire in August were certified and actively assigned to suppression work, despite claims from federal officials that they were “not firefighters.” Internal planning documents show both crews met national qualifications and had been tasked with securing fire lines and protecting structures before being reassigned to cut firewood on the day they were detained. The Department of Homeland Security said the crews were not actively fighting the fire, a claim repeated by Republican figures and some media outlets. Fire veterans allege the reassignment to firewood duty may have been a pretext for the raid and warn the incident is undermining morale and breaking longstanding protocols that bar immigration enforcement at emergency sites.

The Irish government has released its draft Tourism Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for 2025-2030, a raft of measures designed to “maintain the attractiveness of Ireland for holidaymakers” amidst worsening extreme weather events. The plan aims to bolster the tourism sector’s adaptability to climate impacts through enhanced awareness of the links between climate variables and tourist trends and the implementation of resilience measures. Stakeholders are invited to submit feedback during the public consultation period ending September 17, 2025. (Government of Ireland)

Mazarine Climate Backs NZ Start-up Tackling Water-Damaged Roads

Adaptation tech venture capital fund Mazarine Climate had made its inaugural investment in New Zealand-based roadway moisture insights company TDRI.

TDRI uses a trailer-mounted moisture sensing system — leveraging Time Domain Reflectometry Imaging (TDRi) — to rapidly scan for subsurface moisture beneath road pavings. The tech allows for the creation of maps showing where water could erode, crack, and otherwise impair highways and byways. The data can be used by road owners and operators to detect early-stage water damage, diagnose drainage problems, and order preventative maintenance before things fall apart. The company says that excess moisture leads to a 2.5 times increase in pavement deterioration and 30% waste in maintenance spend.

Water risks to roadways are increasing as climate-induced flooding and extreme rainfall events ramp up.

Mazarine Climate did not disclose the size of the seed investment. The fund is focused on tech solutions that tackle water risks to ‘linear assets’ — like roads, pipelines, and railways — with a particular interest in innovations that produce or consume data. The fund’s website says investment prospects have to “demonstrate a plausible strategy for reaching profitability” and have booked more than US$300,000 in revenue in the last calendar year.

Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote.
“It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production.
It’s critical that we remove this outdated and harmful plan.” Downing’s office said overturning the resource management plan will keep roughly $46 million in coal tax revenue secure and generate $15 million in new federal energy revenue.","The U.S. House last week passed a resolution overturning Biden-era restrictions on resource extraction across millions of acres in eastern Montana, bringing Montana’s all-Republican delegation closer to stated goals of bolstering the state’s mining and energy sectors.

But conservation groups said the change — which needs approval in the U.S. Senate — reverses environmental gains and ignores local stakeholders

House Joint Resolution 104, carried by the state’s eastern Congressman, Rep. Troy Downing, passed on near-partisan lines, with all but one Republican in favor and all Democrats opposed.

“The Biden Administration’s outright ban on coal leasing in the Powder River Basin is an intolerable threat to domestic energy production, U.S. national security, and the prosperity of the communities I represent,” Downing said in a statement. “I’m proud to be leading the charge in the House to reverse the Miles City Field Office RMPA to improve access to the affordable, reliable energy that brings the American dream that much closer to hand for countless families in Montana and across the country. I appreciate the support and advocacy of my colleagues from the Treasure State in this fight, and I look forward to seeing this resolution pass the Senate and signed into law by President Trump.”

All four of Montana’s congressional delegates, all Republicans, support the resolution, with Sen. Steve Daines sponsoring companion legislation in the upper chamber. Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy are cosponsors on their chambers’ respective bills.

The bill was one of three passed by the House last Wednesday rescinding resource management plans on nearly 30 million acres of public land in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska.

Downing’s legislation overturns a rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management that halted future coal leasing on roughly 1.7 million acres of federal land in Montana’s Powder River Basin, which contains roughly a third of the nation’s coal reserves.

The record of decision for the Miles City Resource Management Plan amendment, released last November, provided for existing leases at two mines — Spring Creek and Rosebud — to continue for at least a decade, but the bureau said the rule came following analysis that coal markets would continue to decline and coal-fired plants were likely to close or be converted to utilize renewable energy.

“The approved RMP Amendment makes unavailable 1,745,040 acres of BLM administered coal from further consideration for leasing in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a proxy for climate change. The BLM would not accept new coal lease applications,” the decision said.

Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.

Meanwhile, the federal government earlier this year authorized an expansion for the Westmoreland Rosebud Mine, which fuels the Colstrip power plant, allowing it to extract roughly 70 million tons of coal and operate through 2039.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. coal production to drop from 610 million tons in 2022 to 450 million tons in 2040, and Western U.S. production to drop from 335 million tons to 224 million tons over the same period.

Coal taxes in Montana benefit public education in the state, with money going into a trust that funds public school construction and upgrades, infrastructure projects, housing and economic development, among other things.

In a letter sent to the Trump administration, Gov. Greg Gianforte urged the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana to benefit national security, provide reliable energy and boost Montana’s educational systems.

“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.

While industry groups and Montana politicians praised the passage of the bill conservation groups decried the move as a step backwards for environmental protections and criticized Congress’ vote as a workaround of the federal rule-making process.

“Congress just jumped head first down a slippery slope that creates a dangerous precedent that will surely backfire. Using the Congressional Review Act not only repeals the current management plan, which was carefully crafted by local leaders and stakeholders, but it puts at risk future efforts to responsibly manage public lands. It’s not just wildlife habitat and hunting and fishing access at risk here; it’s all decisions made at the local level,” said Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation, in a statement. “At a time when Montana’s public lands are facing numerous threats, land managers need flexibility and tools to respond, not more interference from Washington.”

Justin Meuse, government relations director at The Wilderness Society, said Congress was overturning decisions over land management in an “unprecedented way” and could expose “thousands of permits, leases and rights of way to legal challenge.”

But Daines emphasized that Montana’s economy was at the forefront of his decision to back the move.

“Joe Biden’s Miles City RMPA halts all future coal leasing in the region and will cause hardworking Montanans to lose their jobs,” Daines said in a statement. “It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production. It’s critical that we remove this outdated and harmful plan.”

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices.","President Donald Trump has been racing at breakneck speed to keep all his campaign promises. Yet he has only four months left to fulfill his vow to halve electricity prices by the end of his first year. Fighting against the fallout of the Biden administration’s harmful anti-fossil fuel agenda, the president faces stiff headwinds. The only way the president can meet his self-imposed deadline is to change course quickly, reject Biden’s mistakes and unlock the potential of every available electron.

So far, the trend lines aren’t looking good. In the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation, and the Energy Information Administration estimates that retail electricity prices will continue to outpace inflation through next year, with residential prices surging between 13% to 18% higher than in 2022.

Though, traditionally, consumers have been much more concerned about gas prices — a number they see projected on highway signs and experience firsthand multiple times a month at the pump — the experience of electricity price spikes instead of the promised price cuts will risk diminishing Trump’s popular support.

‘WEB OF DARK MONEY’ TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN

What’s worse, these price hikes will arrive before the midterms, when Trump will be battling to retain his slim congressional majorities.

The current price hikes aren’t Trump’s fault. Instead, he inherited a market with increasing and unprecedented energy demand coupled with the fallout from the Biden administration’s harmful policies to phase out fossil fuels.

Technological innovations like cloud and quantum computing, crypto mining, electric vehicle adoption, streaming services and, most of all, AI data centers, all have tremendous energy demands, which drive electricity prices higher. Rand estimates global AI data centers alone will need 327 GW of energy by 2030. To put that into perspective, the entire state of California used 86 GW of energy in 2022.

‘LEFTIST’ TAXPAYER-FUNDED ACADEMY SPARKS BACKLASH AFTER MOVING AGAINST TRUMP’S ROLLBACK OF KEY REGULATION

In the face of rising demand, the Biden administration embarked on an aggressive program to curtail legacy energy production. The Biden EPA imposed new emissions restrictions that effectively forced the retirement of coal and natural gas power plants and manipulated regulations across agencies to hem in traditional fuel sources.

If these Biden-era policies didn’t cause the current electricity price spikes, they at least allowed today’s demand-induced price increases to hit consumers unabated.

Trump now has to deal with a crisis not of his own making. With his firm commitments to win the AI race, advance crypto and reshore energy-intensive manufacturing such as semiconductor production, Trump can only keep electricity prices in check by massively increasing supply to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, his administration appears to be repeating the same mistakes as Biden’s, just colored with a different ideology.

TRUMP BREAKS ‘DAY ONE’ PROMISE TO LOWER COSTS AS PRICES SURGE ACROSS AMERICA IN FIRST SIX MONTHS

Where the Biden administration cut energy supplies by attacking fossil fuel production, the Trump administration is limiting alternative and renewable energy sources.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

The One Big Beautiful Bill rescinds tax incentives for renewables, while the administration has advanced multiple orders and rules that limit clean energy, from halting offshore wind leases to curbing solar tax credits.

“Drill, baby, drill” is a great energy policy, but it’s not enough by itself. While America produced nearly enough energy from fossil fuels (86.3 quads) to supply our nation’s entire energy consumption (93.59 quads) in 2023, the fact is, we need alternative energy sources just to meet current demands. When the future requires even more energy, the necessity for alternative energy will only increase.

The cheapest way to put more electrons into the power grid immediately is to erect significantly more solar and energy storage infrastructure, coupled with natural gas peaker plants that can be rapidly turned on during peak hours.

WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR

In the medium term, America needs to increase nuclear energy production, build more energy infrastructure like electric transmission lines and natural gas pipelines, and construct geothermal power plants while deploying grid-enhancing technology, improving demand response and increasing energy efficiency. With the growing adoption of solar and EVs, the United States can even create an aggregated network of residential, virtual power plants that only draw energy in low-use times while feeding energy back into the grid when it’s needed most.

The point is, every energy source and efficiency measure must be deployed if we have any hope of keeping prices in check.

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices. But he could be blamed down the road if his administration continues to limit supply by favoring one source of energy over others. At the end of each month, most consumers don’t care where their energy comes from; they only care that it’s cheap.

The deal comes after Washington and Islamabad last month reached a trade agreement that Pakistan hoped would attract American investment in its minerals and oil reserves.
“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.
Most of Pakistan’s mineral wealth is located in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization — which is the country’s largest miner of critical minerals — signed a memorandum of understanding with Missouri-based U.S. Strategic Metals for collaboration plans that include setting up a poly-metallic refinery in Pakistan.

The deal comes after Washington and Islamabad last month reached a trade agreement that Pakistan hoped would attract American investment in its minerals and oil reserves.

U.S. Strategic Metals is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the U.S. Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.

A second agreement was signed between the National Logistics Corp of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a Portuguese engineering and construction company.

A statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he held talks with the delegation from U.S. Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths, and other mineral resources.

The sides expressed readiness to develop value-added facilities, enhance mineral processing capacity, and undertake large-scale projects tied to mining, the statement said.

“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan said in a statement: “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”

Earlier this year, Sharif claimed that Pakistan possesses mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and foreign investment in the mineral sector could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and free itself from the burden of massive foreign loans.

Most of Pakistan’s mineral wealth is located in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

In August, the U.S. State Department had designated the Balochistan National Army separatist group and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organization.

Oil and minerals reserves have also been found in the southern Sindh, eastern Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan.

Permitting reform is essential to advancing energy projects and unlocking lower costs, more jobs, and stronger communities. In a recent blog, Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer at Americans for Prosperity, emphasized the urgent need for reform and the rare bipartisan opportunity to finally get it done.

More from the post here:

It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes Republicans and Democrats agree.

And when it comes to America’s permitting system, both sides of the aisle know it’s broken.

That consensus matters because the problem urgently needs to be fixed.

Approvals for critical projects that should take weeks or months routinely drag on for years, mired in red tape and lawsuits.

As President Biden’s senior advisor, John Podesta, said in 2023, “We got so good at stopping projects, we forgot how to build things in America.”

THE COST OF DELAY

This broken system has real-world consequences.

Rising energy costs are squeezing American families and businesses — showing up in higher utility bills, pricier commutes, and the cost of everyday goods across the economy.

Affordable energy powered America’s rise in the 20th century, fueling innovation and economic growth. But today, outdated rules put us at risk of falling behind.

Electricity doesn’t simply appear in our homes and businesses. It requires a vast and complex generation, transmission, and distribution supply chain that often needs upgrades to keep up with ever-growing demand.

And demand is soaring. Electric vehicles, data centers, and the AI revolution are pushing America’s power grid to its limits.

AI alone requires massive amounts of reliable power for data centers and high-performance computing. Our outdated permitting system simply won’t allow us to keep up with the demand, which threatens our ability to lead on this critical new technology.

At the same time, reliable coal and fossil fuel plants that provide steady baseload power are being retired faster than replacements can come online.

Without reform, the infrastructure needed to expand grid capacity and bring new generation to market will remain unbuilt, leaving the country less secure, less competitive, and without reliable power.

THE WAY FORWARD

Permitting reform is the key to clearing the way for energy projects and unlocking lower costs, more jobs, and stronger communities.

While lawmakers have long recognized that unnecessary self-imposed federal regulations are holding back America’s energy potential, they never anticipated how quickly technology and innovation would make solving this problem mission critical for our economy and global competitiveness.

That’s why momentum is finally building across party lines to get it done.

Permitting reform is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to work together to deliver a rare, bipartisan win for the American people. Outdated rules are blocking progress on building pipelines, renewable energy facilities, nuclear plants, transmission lines, and storage projects.

The question is no longer whether the system is broken. It’s whether Washington will finally rise to the occasion and fix it.

SECURING THE FUTURE

Majority Leader Steve Scalise is betting that it can.

He has made permitting reform a top priority this fall, putting real weight behind the effort to modernize America’s energy policies and clear the way for projects that can power the future.

Energy is the foundation of America’s prosperity and security.

As Leader Scalise put it, “American energy provides us national security and really leads us to global leadership that the whole world wants to see. … We know the ability America has to unleash American energy if we just get red tape out of the way.”

He’s right. If Washington clears the way, America can unleash its energy potential and lead the world.

Permitting reform is no longer optional. It’s essential.

Families need relief from high energy costs, businesses need reliable power, and America needs the capacity to compete and lead.

For once, there is bipartisan agreement on the problem and the need for a solution.

That rare consensus gives Congress the chance to rise above politics and deliver a win that matters: affordable, reliable American energy that fuels growth, strengthens communities, and secures our future.

But it won’t happen without your help. Lawmakers need to hear that families, businesses, and communities are demanding relief. The time to act is now.

However, for those currently in the market, there may be a way for you to still take advantage of the benefit.
Mcareavy says if the car you want isn’t out there today, you can still order it and qualify for the incentive.
All in all, even though he expects a slowdown of purchases once the incentive goes away, Mcareavy says EVs are here to stay.
“Manufacturers have invested millions of dollars in the development of manufacturing, and the acquisition of rare earth minerals for batteries, etc, etc.","ROCHESTER, N.Y. (WROC) — EV sales are up right now, that was also the case in August, and according to Brad Mcareavy, the President of the Rochester Automobile Dealers Association, that’s because people are rushing to get theirs, before there are no more federal tax incentives to do so.

“It probably is going to have the effect of softening the EV market for a while,” said Mcareavy. “Until we can figure out how to market those vehicles in an unsubsidized market, where it just has to compete on its own.”

Come September 30, consumer tax breaks on electric cars are expected to end under the “Big, Beautiful, Bill.” That includes credits of up to $7,500 towards the purchase of new vehicles and $4,000 for those that are used.

However, for those currently in the market, there may be a way for you to still take advantage of the benefit. Mcareavy says if the car you want isn’t out there today, you can still order it and qualify for the incentive.

“It’s important to keep in mind,” he said, “if you’re out there, and you’re shopping, and you can’t find the vehicle you want, the EV — place an order with a dealer, put a deposit down, sign that purchase agreement and you can take delivery a month or two down the road, when the vehicle comes.

All in all, even though he expects a slowdown of purchases once the incentive goes away, Mcareavy says EVs are here to stay.

“Manufacturers have invested millions of dollars in the development of manufacturing, and the acquisition of rare earth minerals for batteries, etc, etc. So, they’re very heavily invested in electric vehicles — I don’t see that going away.”

Mcareavy adds that he hopes NYS continues to invest in infrastructure for EVs, so there would be proper support for consumer interest.

The sun isn’t just setting on incentives for buying EVs. A series of tax credits aimed at lowering the cost of installing solar panels, heat pumps, and other clean energy technologies in your home is also ending throughout the rest of 2025.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.
Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully.","On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

At this price level, Rivian will be able to compete with other EV companies such as Tesla, which also has a model starting at about $45,000.
Like all EV companies, it is now struggling with policy changes out of Washington.
Because Rivian makes only EVs, the company’s sales have been derailed with changes in compliance credits.
Previously, the company would sell these credits to other car companies that needed to meet fuel economy and emission standards.","Rivian has laid off about 200 employees as the electric vehicle maker prepares for a U.S. economy with fewer incentives to go green.

The electric truck and sport-utility vehicle manufacturer is preparing for a challenging year in which it plans to launch a more affordable model even as it gets more expensive to buy an EV.

A spokesperson at the company said that the layoffs are equivalent to about 1.5% of its total staff of nearly 15,000. The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs.

Rivian is among the many car companies bracing for the changes in federal tax credits.

Under President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 tax credit, which some buyers receive for purchasingEVs, is set to expire at the end of this month. The credit of up to $4,000 for used EVs also will end.

It’s an abrupt reversal of Biden-era efforts to address climate change emissions from gasoline cars.

Transportation is the most significant source of climate-warming emissions in California and the U.S., and experts warn that the sector must become far cleaner to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

In California, approximately one-quarter of new cars sold are either fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, according to the California Energy Commission.

That progress could stall. The planned phaseout of state credits is expected to dampen EV sales, which already have slowed due to waning consumer interest and high tariffs on imported cars.

Anticipating a slowdown in demand as the incentives end, General Motors has laid off 360 workers in Detroit due to the slowed production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Volkswagen plans to temporarily furlough 160 employees and slow production of its electric SUV.

Rivian’s newest model, the R2 SUV, is slated to come out next year.

“We have made some recent changes to the Commercial team as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,” a Rivian spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Times.

It will be one of the company’s more affordable options, starting at $45,000. Its current R1S SUV starts at $76,900. At this price level, Rivian will be able to compete with other EV companies such as Tesla, which also has a model starting at about $45,000.

Rivian first made a name for itself with its Earth-toned electric trucks, which debuted in 2018. The company was founded in Florida and moved to Irvine in 2020, where it is based today.

The introduction of its heavy-duty EVs initially appealed to more-affluent consumers, with some of the models sporting sticker prices above $120,000.

After taking the company public in 2021, the retailer has faced a number of challenges. It has had to grapple with supply chain issues, steep price points and order delays.

Like all EV companies, it is now struggling with policy changes out of Washington.

Because Rivian makes only EVs, the company’s sales have been derailed with changes in compliance credits. Previously, the company would sell these credits to other car companies that needed to meet fuel economy and emission standards.

In its second quarter, the company reported a loss of $1.1 billion.

Rivian shares have climbed about 5% this year.

Significant federal tax incentives for buyers of electric vehicles are set to expire at the end of September, following passage of the Big Beautiful Bill.

Earlier this year, GM anounced Fairfax would begin production of a gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox in combination with production of the Bolt.

A spokesperson said Monday that the plant's ability to shift between internal combustion engines and electric vehicles gives the company manufacturing flexibility.

""As part of that, we made the decision to delay the return of a second shift at Fairfax,"" the company said.

While the auto company navigates uncertainties in the electric vehicle front, it remains bullish on gas.

""The recent decision to allocate the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox production to Fairfax beginning in 2027 emphasizes the strong future for the facility,"" the company said in its Monday statement to KSHB 41.

The decision, announced in June, was part of a $4 billion expansion plan at three GM plants in Orion Township, Michigan, and Spring Hill, Tennessee.

The plant recently produced the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT4.

Production of the Malibu stopped in 2024 and the Cadillac XT4 is no longer in the General Motors lineup of vehicles.

Both vehicles have been scrapped from the GM lineup of vehicles.

TL;DR Premier American Uranium is acquiring Nuclear Fuels to become one of Wyoming's most active uranium drilling operations, expanding to 12 projects across five states.
Q: Why does management believe development-stage uranium companies may outperform?","Premier American Uranium is completing a transformational acquisition of Nuclear Fuels that will establish the company as one of Wyoming's most active uranium drilling operations, expanding its portfolio to 12 projects across five historic uranium-producing states.

The company operates a dual development strategy, combining Wyoming exploration assets positioned near existing production facilities with an advanced New Mexico project containing 23.5 million pounds of defined uranium resources approaching economic assessment completion.

Premier's innovative processing approach at its Cebolleta project reduces traditional capital requirements by producing pregnant resin that can be processed at existing facilities across multiple jurisdictions, addressing a key challenge facing new uranium developments.

The uranium sector is experiencing unprecedented institutional investment from technology companies seeking reliable clean energy sources, creating fundamental demand growth in an undersupplied market where global production remains below consumption levels.

Management believes the company is positioned to benefit from the next phase of uranium equity performance, where development-stage companies may outperform following the recent rally in near-term producers, supported by multiple near-term catalysts including acquisition closure and economic study completion.

Premier American Uranium (TSXV:PUR) is finalizing the acquisition of Nuclear Fuels, a transaction that will fundamentally transform the company's scale and operational capacity. According to CEO Colin Healey, the deal will create one of the most active drillers in all of Wyoming and one of the most interesting and active exploration uranium exploration companies in the United States. The acquisition, which received 95% shareholder approval from Nuclear Fuels, is expected to close following the completion of technical report updates required by the exchange.

Strategic Portfolio Expansion Through Targeted M&A

The Nuclear Fuels acquisition centers on the Kaycee project, which is 400 miles of mapped roll fronts on the property and represents an incredibly perspective asset for the Premier American Uranium. The strategic value extends beyond the asset itself to its location within Wyoming's established uranium corridor. The Kaycee project sits approximately 20 miles from existing production facilities, including UEC's Christensen Ranch and Energy Fuels' Nichols Ranch, providing potential processing options that could significantly reduce capital requirements. This geographic positioning exemplifies Premier's broader acquisition strategy.

""We like Nuclear Fuels and the Kaycee project because of the drill work that they've done, but we also like its proximity to UEC's Christensen Ranch. So it's right in a jurisdiction where you know you have project that has a 11 to 30 million pound resource exploration target on it. But if you kind of hit the critical mass of resource through the drill bit, you've got potential offtakers or resin loaded resin buyers, potential processing facilities that could really lower your capex hurdle leading to production."" - CEO Colin Healey

Advanced Development at Cebolleta

While the Nuclear Fuels acquisition expands Premier's exploration footprint, the company's Cebolleta asset in New Mexico represents its most advanced development opportunity. The project contains a defined resource of 23.5 million pounds and is approaching a critical milestone with the completion of its preliminary economic assessment (PEA).

The Cebolleta project demonstrates Premier's ability to advance assets through the development pipeline efficiently. The company acquired the asset through its purchase of American Future Fuel last year, and within 16 months has established a 43-101 compliant resource and is now delivering economic studies. This rapid advancement reflects the asset's substantial historical drilling data and the management team's execution capabilities.

Importantly, Cebolleta offers a unique processing solution that distinguishes it from conventional uranium projects.

Healey notes, ""Our Cebolleta asset cannot be an ISR mine because of its position relative to the water table. But we can bring that ore to surface, leach it exactly the way you would that you would leach it in ground, get it into pregnant solution, put it on resin, and truck that resin to 4-5 processing facilities in Wyoming ....there's at least 3 [further facilities] in Texas.""

This innovative approach addresses one of the primary challenges facing new uranium projects: the capital intensity of building processing facilities. By designing the project to produce pregnant resin that can be processed at existing facilities, Premier potentially reduces both capital requirements and technical risk while expanding processing options across multiple jurisdictions.

Market Positioning and Valuation Strategy

Premier's development strategy directly addresses current market dynamics and valuation methodologies in the uranium sector. The company recognises that different asset stages command different valuation multiples, and its approach is designed to capture these premium valuations as projects advance.

For exploration-stage assets like those in Wyoming, the focus is on converting exploration targets into defined resources to capture higher per-pound in-situ valuations. As Healey explains,

""When you have resource exploration targets, it's a huge range and it's really not pounds. But does the market discount it compared to delineated resource? Massively. So when you talk about exploration, you talk about increasing your in-situ per pound valuation.""

For more advanced assets like Cebolleta, the strategy centers on demonstrating project economics through the PEA process.

""A PEA really provides a template for me justifying the money that we're spending. But at the end of the day, it also produces a NAV (net asset value) for project and NAV multiples will be applied to that project,"" Healey adds.

This dual approach reflects a sophisticated understanding of uranium equity valuations, where proximity to cash flow generation commands premium multiples. The strategy positions Premier to benefit from what management believes will be the next phase of the uranium bull market.

Operational Excellence and Technical Capabilities

Premier's recent operational results demonstrate the quality of its asset base and technical execution. The company recently reported its best drilling result in the history of the Cyclone project: 15.5 feet at 0.09% U3O8. This result, combined with the project's location within 15 miles of Ur-Energy's Lost Creek production facility, exemplifies the company's strategy of developing assets in proximity to existing infrastructure.

The success at Cyclone, combined with the comprehensive drilling database at the Kaycee project and the advanced resource definition at Cebolleta, demonstrates Premier's ability to create value across multiple development stages simultaneously.

Interview with CEO Colin Healey

Capitalizing on Market Cycle Dynamics

The Nuclear Fuels acquisition serves multiple strategic purposes beyond asset addition. As Healey notes,

""The transaction makes the company bigger. And that gives us a lot more flexibility to acquire some more advanced or more expensive things... as we scale, each transaction becomes less dilutive.""

This increased scale provides Premier with enhanced financial flexibility to pursue additional strategic opportunities while maintaining disciplined capital allocation. The company's board composition, which Healey describes as having a lot of depth and a lot of expertise and M&A transaction experience, providing governance oversight for future transactions.

Premier's timing appears well-positioned for the anticipated next phase of uranium equity performance. While uranium prices have remained relatively stable in 2025, rising 4% from $73 to $76, the equity performance has been bifurcated, with near-term producers and existing producers significantly outperforming exploration and development companies.

Healey believes this performance gap presents an opportunity:

""I think that there's a second leg to this cycle where some of the less advanced stage companies really get in the toe and we've seen that in many historic cycles where the most advanced companies, advanced stage development stage companies lead the equity rally and then the development companies are kind of second in line.""

This cyclical pattern suggests that companies like Premier, which are advancing assets toward production readiness, may be positioned to outperform as uranium prices continue their upward trajectory. The company's strategy of advancing multiple assets through different development stages provides multiple opportunities to capture this anticipated performance rotation.

Sector Tailwinds Aligned With Institutional Adoption

The broader uranium sector is experiencing unprecedented institutional interest, particularly from technology companies seeking clean energy solutions for power-intensive operations. Microsoft's recent investment in restarting Three Mile Island Unit 2 and its membership in the World Nuclear Association represent a significant inflection point for the sector. Healey observes:

""I think big tech is just so important and it's so good to see them starting to get involved at the industry level. I think these tech companies, they just absolutely want to deliver their products in the most green emission-free way and they see nuclear as a solution for safe green power at a large scale with incredible uptime.""

The involvement of technology companies brings substantial capital resources to uranium demand creation.

""What I love about big tech being involved here is those deep pockets. They're really driving SMR development, new nuclear plant construction, new demand specifically for nuclear energy and I think that definitely translates to increased demand for uranium,"" Healey explains.

This institutional adoption occurs against a backdrop of supply constraints, creating what Healey describes as ""an undersupplied market where the deepest pockets on earth are looking to increase the demand for your commodity.""

The Investment Thesis for Premier American Uranium

Experienced Management Team: Leadership demonstrates proven ability to advance assets through development stages efficiently, as evidenced by the rapid progression of the Cebolleta project from acquisition to economic studies.

Market Timing: The company appears positioned to benefit from the anticipated next phase of uranium equity outperformance, where development-stage companies may outperform following the recent rally in producers.

Sector Tailwinds: Institutional adoption of nuclear energy, particularly by technology companies, provides fundamental demand growth in an undersupplied market environment.

Scalable Platform: Increasing company size enhances financial flexibility for additional strategic acquisitions while maintaining disciplined capital allocation standards.

Premier American Uranium represents a compelling investment opportunity in the uranium sector through its strategic portfolio approach, innovative processing solutions, and positioning for the next phase of the uranium bull market. The company's dual focus on Wyoming exploration assets and advanced New Mexico development, combined with experienced management and favorable sector dynamics, provides multiple pathways for value creation. The imminent completion of key corporate milestones, including the Nuclear Fuels acquisition and Cebolleta PEA, offers clear catalysts for potential outperformance as institutional capital continues flowing into uranium investments.

The Nuclear Renaissance and Institutional Capital Flows

The uranium sector is experiencing a fundamental shift driven by the convergence of artificial intelligence energy demands, climate commitments, and energy security concerns. Technology giants, led by Microsoft's Three Mile Island investment and World Nuclear Association membership, are recognizing nuclear power as the only scalable solution for reliable, carbon-free baseload energy. This institutional adoption represents more than symbolic support—it brings unprecedented capital deployment capabilities to a historically undersupplied market.

Central banks and sovereign wealth funds are also recognizing uranium's strategic importance, viewing nuclear energy as essential for energy independence and climate goals. This multi-faceted institutional demand, combined with limited investable uranium companies, creates a unique supply-demand dynamic in equity markets.

As Premier American Uranium CEO Colin Healey observes, ""In an undersupplied market where the deepest pockets on earth are looking to increase the demand for your commodity, it's a very interesting and exciting time to be involved.""

The timing of this institutional embrace coincides with years of uranium underinvestment following the Fukushima incident. Global uranium production remains below consumption levels, while utility inventory drawdowns have masked the supply deficit. As artificial intelligence and data center expansion accelerate, power consumption requirements are growing exponentially, making nuclear energy's 24/7 reliability increasingly valuable compared to intermittent renewables.

TL;DR

Premier American Uranium is acquiring Nuclear Fuels to become one of Wyoming's most active uranium drilling operations, expanding to 12 projects across five states. The company's dual strategy combines Wyoming exploration assets near existing production facilities with an advanced New Mexico project (Cebolleta) containing 23.5 million pounds of uranium resources. Premier's innovative approach reduces capital costs by producing pregnant resin that can be processed at existing facilities rather than building new ones. The uranium sector is experiencing unprecedented institutional investment from tech companies like Microsoft, creating demand growth in an undersupplied market. Management believes the company is positioned to benefit from the next phase of uranium equity performance, where development-stage companies may outperform producers, supported by near-term catalysts including acquisition closure and economic study completion.

FAQ's (AI-Generated)

Q: What makes Premier American Uranium's processing approach at Cebolleta unique?

A: Unlike traditional uranium projects that require expensive in-situ recovery (ISR) mining or building new processing facilities, Premier's Cebolleta project will extract ore to the surface, leach it into pregnant solution, load it onto resin, and truck that resin to existing processing facilities in Wyoming and Texas. This innovative approach significantly reduces capital requirements and technical risks while providing multiple processing options across different jurisdictions.

Q: Why is the Nuclear Fuels acquisition strategically important for Premier?

A: The Nuclear Fuels acquisition brings the Kaycee project with 400 miles of mapped roll fronts and an 11-30 million pound resource exploration target. Crucially, it's located just 20 miles from existing production facilities like UEC's Christensen Ranch, providing potential processing options and reducing capital hurdles. The acquisition also increases Premier's scale, making future acquisitions less dilutive and providing more financial flexibility.

Q: How is the involvement of big tech companies affecting the uranium sector?

A: Technology companies like Microsoft are investing heavily in nuclear energy to power AI and data centers with reliable, carbon-free energy.

The investments include a previously announced $457 million power transformer factory in South Boston, Virginia, which will be the largest in the US, and expansions of Hitachi Energy’s existing facilities throughout the country. The company says the investments will create thousands of US jobs, including $825 million at the Virginia site alone.

The Trump administration released its AI Action Plan in June, calling for streamlining permitting and environmental reviews for data center projects, along with power grid improvements that focus on natural gas, coal, geothermal and nuclear sources. The focus on fossil fuels and exclusion of incentives for wind and solar energy sources drew significant criticism from environmental groups.

AI Driving Unprecedented Data Center Demand

Companies pouring billions into AI adoption are creating unprecedented data center demand. A McKinsey & Company report says businesses will invest $6.7 trillion on data centers globally by 2030, with almost $3 trillion going to real estate and power infrastructure.

Steven Dickens, CEO and principal analyst at HyperFrame Research told Data Center Knowledge that more data center energy deals should be expected, as local governments look to capitalize on demand.

“I expect to see locally elected representatives clamoring to ink these types of deals, as they provide a rapid way to demonstrate innovation and bring long-term tech jobs to their regions,” he said in an email interview.

“The longer-term power implications for local communities are less transparent, and many areas will need significant investment in power generation infrastructure to keep up with rampant demand. The US will need to invest in natural gas, and more pertinently, nuclear, to keep up.”

Powering Up for Growth

Hitachi said the investments, part of a $9 billion global investment plan, would also bolster domestic electrical equipment supply chains while boosting technologies to support security and resilience for the US power grid.

“The United States is a key market for Hitachi, and this investment reflects our commitment to powering America’s energy future to meet the accelerating demands for reliable and sustainable solutions to benefit the nation,” Toshiaki Tokunaga, president and CEO of Hitachi, said in a statement.

“We are supporting American manufacturing, the development of critical infrastructure, and the rapid expansion of data centers driven by AI adoption.”

Hitachi Energy, a subsidiary of Japan’s Hitachi, has headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Zurich, Switzerland.

“Bringing production of large power transformers to the US is critical to building a strong domestic supply chain for the US economy and recuing production bottlenecks, which is essential as demand for these transformers across the economy is surging,” Hitachi Energy CEO Andreas Schierenbeck said in a statement.

“Power transformers are a linchpin technology for a robust and reliable electric grid and winning the AI race.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/bltdebc235f47f54f8f/68bf44a06a5e75d07187235a/Hitachi-Energy-South-Boston.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 18:04:26.090333

Will the End of EV Incentives Kill Its Momentum? - Hagerty Media,Eric Weiner,,,,,https://www.hagerty.com/media/news/cadillac-is-on-a-roll-will-the-end-of-ev-incentives-kill-its-momentum/,"A refreshed Escalade, plus the Optiq, Lyriq, and Vistiq electric SUVs are driving sales among conquest customers, many of them in younger demographics than Cadillac has recently reached.
General Motors said that August was its best-ever sales month for electric vehicles, with more than 21,000 examples delivered across Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC.
“October will be an interesting month as people adjust to whatever this new level of EV sales turns out to be.
But as I look at our performance around Cadillac today, the industry runs about 14% electric in the luxury space.
Whether it’s EVs or the “quite strong” sales of the CT4 and CT5, Roth is optimistic about where Cadillac is headed.","Cadillac is having a good year. As of mid-August, annual sales are higher than they’ve been in the last 18 years. A big part of that, no doubt, is fresh metal in the showroom. A refreshed Escalade, plus the Optiq, Lyriq, and Vistiq electric SUVs are driving sales among conquest customers, many of them in younger demographics than Cadillac has recently reached. Global Vice-President of Cadillac, John Roth, took the top seat at the brand in 2023; when we spoke last month at Monterey Car Week, he stressed that the transformation is a decade in the making.

“You’ve got to walk back to 2015, when there was a whole lot of work put into a vision plan, which is the product portfolio that we have today,” Roth explained. “The idea at that time was not only that we’d make some great EVs, but also that there would be a big investment in the V series brand and making statements there, but really doing truly ground-up Cadillacs from a [full] portfolio standpoint. Then you bundle around making sure our dealer network was well-trained, having the right locations, redoing our image facilities, updating all the advertising creative that was wrapped around these vehicles. And so you start to build this bigger strategy and bundle around a massive launch of vehicles that are all coming right now.”

The recent rush of EV sales, no doubt, can be attributed to the planned rollback of the $7500 federal incentive, set to expire on September 30. General Motors said that August was its best-ever sales month for electric vehicles, with more than 21,000 examples delivered across Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC. Naturally, other automakers are experiencing the same urgency: Automotive News reported that Ford Mustang Mach-E sales increased 35 percent last month, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 was up 61 percent. J.D. Power and GlobalData figures indicate that EVs accounted for 12 percent of all retail sales in August 2025, compared with 9.5 percent in the prior August.

Roth, like everyone else, expects the frenzy to die off after September 30.

“October will be an interesting month as people adjust to whatever this new level of EV sales turns out to be. But as I look at our performance around Cadillac today, the industry runs about 14% electric in the luxury space. The general market is running around 7 or 8% electric. So luxury is running double the general market, versus Cadillac that is running on average for the calendar year about 24%. So we do have a draw for consumers who are looking for a really good Cadillac from a driving dynamic standpoint, and it shows up in the form of an EV. As we move into the fourth quarter, the industry itself may become smaller, but I think Cadillac is well positioned to maintain, if not grow market share because of the product offerings we have.”

Translation: Rougher times ahead. If the overall market is smaller, retaining the advantage you have in the space becomes even more important, and conquest sales are a reason for Roth to be confident. Optiq is boasting between 70 and 75 percent conquest sales, versus about 80 percent for the Lyriq. The customers the brand are poaching are trending younger, as well: Cadillac’s average customer age is down to about 53 years, versus 60 years back in 2015.

Formula 1 promises a new avenue to capture fresh eyeballs, Roth says. “F1 is very much a fashion statement these days. It’s much like with us being at The Quail, from a concours standpoint; it’s a chance to really be part of car culture and express what you’re going to tell the public about what you stand for from a capability standpoint. And we compete with many of the tier one luxury makes that are out there that I mentioned earlier. We compete with them in the retail world and we compete with them on the track.”

Things are definitely changing at Cadillac, but the brand did go back on its earlier ambitions to go all-electric by 2030. Gas engines are sticking around. The compact XT5 SUV will remain gas-powered when it launches as a 2027 model, and the Escalade will keep a dinosaur-burner for the foreseeable future. The CT4 and CT5 (which currently use turbo-four, turbo-six, and supercharged V-8s) are carrying on, Roth says, which gives customers “the luxury of choice” in propulsion and body style across the portfolio.

Whether it’s EVs or the “quite strong” sales of the CT4 and CT5, Roth is optimistic about where Cadillac is headed. “I think that energy is driving more energy. People are seeing cars on the road and they’re asking us or other customers who are driving ’em, ‘What is that?’ And so there’s a bit of word of mouth.”",https://media.hagerty.com/media/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cadillac-IQ-front-three-quarter-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:04:49.246171

U.S. Strategic Metals is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the U.S. Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.

A second agreement was signed between the National Logistics Corp of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a Portuguese engineering and construction company.

A statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office said he held talks with the delegation from U.S. Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths, and other mineral resources.

The sides expressed readiness to develop value-added facilities, enhance mineral processing capacity, and undertake large-scale projects tied to mining, the statement said.

“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan said in a statement: “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”

Earlier this year, Sharif claimed that Pakistan possesses mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and foreign investment in the mineral sector could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and free itself from the burden of massive foreign loans.

Most of Pakistan's mineral wealth is located in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

In August, the U.S. State Department had designated the Balochistan National Army separatist group and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organization.

Oil and minerals reserves have also been found in the southern Sindh, eastern Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan.

Several companies have already signed agreements with Pakistan in the mining sector. They included the Canadian firm Barrick Gold, which already owns a 50% stake in the Reko Diq gold mine in Balochistan.",https://images.wral.com/presentation/v3/images/content/social/open_graph/wral_newcom_1920x1080.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:04:30.796505

How Trump’s war on climate science is weakening the US.

In late July, President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal so bold it would have once seemed unthinkable: to reverse the endangerment finding, a legal determination under which the agency regulates planet-warming pollution. The 2009 finding rests on a vast body of scientific evidence showing greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change and threaten public health.

The agency held a public hearing on the move last month. Speaking against were activists, doctors, state officials — and business leaders such as Chris Nevers, senior director of public policy at the electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc., who called it “detrimental to the US automotive industry, consumers, and public health and welfare.”

The effort was striking, but not isolated. Around the same time, Trump proposed in his budget to shut atmospheric observatories including Mauna Loa in Hawaii, which keeps a benchmark record of carbon dioxide levels. The Energy Department published a report by contrarian scientists that downplayed the severity of climate change, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that past US government reports on climate science — which have been taken down from government websites — will undergo review and possible alteration. News surfaced plans by NASA to abandon two satellites that measure CO2.

These and dozens of other actions taken since Jan. 20 paint a clear picture: The Trump administration is going to war with established climate science. Mass firings, regulatory rollbacks, program closures, and funding cuts across agencies have compromised the nation’s ability to gather and assess data on climate change, reducing the amount of high-quality information that policymakers and business leaders can use to guide their decisions, potentially for years to come.

It’s the most aggressive targeting of climate science by any US administration, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former federal workers and officials, academic researchers and members of Congress. It parallels Trump officials’ efforts to sideline or question other types of widely accepted expertise, from vaccine research to labor statistics.

“They’re doing away with science. That, to me, is enormously troubling,” said Christine Todd Whitman, EPA administrator under President George W. Bush and the former Republican governor of New Jersey. “It’s science across the administration.”

The assault has left hundreds of federal scientists out of work, but its impacts reach much further. Datasets that industries and policymakers depend on have gone dark. Weather forecasting nationwide has been strained. The cancellation of billions of dollars in grants has halted work on, to cite only two examples, mapping of flood and storm risks for the US Coast Guard and improved stormwater infrastructure for towns in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, the administration wants to relax limits on climate pollution for fossil fuel and manufacturing as it reins in electric vehicles, solar power and especially wind farms. Marginalizing the science on global warming helps this push by seeming to weaken the case for clean energy and affirming the decision by governments and companies to keep pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers when asked about the government-wide shift. “The Trump administration is committed to eliminating bias and producing Gold Standard Science research driven by verifiable data that informs Americans’ decision-making while keeping them safe.”

Not every cut and rollback will survive the many lawsuits that have been filed to stop them. Some moves have already been reversed.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, described the administration’s strategy as “a cluster-bomb approach.”

“They’re fighting on multiple fronts, some legal, some not,” he said. “They just want to see what ultimately hits.”

The barrage is hard to track. Even changes with major long-term consequences can “slip under the radar, because there's so much else going on. And that’s part of the tactic,” said Whitman.

Over the first six months of Trump’s second term, the administration took roughly 400 anti-science actions, many more than in the entirety of his first term, according to tracking by the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change are piling up, from intense heat waves to massive wildfires to deadly floods. Last year was the hottest ever recorded.

Whether we will have enough reliable data to predict, recover from and adapt to these impacts is an open question, experts say. “Some damage will take decades to regain. Some cannot be repaired,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist of advisory firm Carbon Direct and a former Energy Department official who served in two administrations.

“The result,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, “is going to be that we are very, very unprepared for when the climate chickens come home to roost.”

The earliest impact felt by climate researchers came just one week after Trump’s return to the White House, when the Office of Management and Budget froze all outgoing federal funds. Judges intervened to halt the order, but many grants remained frozen, putting climate research, projects and jobs in limbo. The EPA moved to wrest back from bank accounts $20 billion of climate funding awarded by the Biden administration; a recent ruling by a federal appeals court cleared the way for the agency to go ahead, pending further litigation.

The EPA under Trump is “laser-focused on its core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” said agency spokesperson Carolyn Holran. She said Administrator Lee Zeldin cancelled the grants due to his concerns over conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients and missing agency oversight.

Then came the downsizings. Through a combination of probationary employee firings, early retirement offers, reductions in force and resignations, agencies shed thousands of employees. In the first five months of the year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency lost 2,446 workers, including dozens of senior officials, according to a Sept. 2 report by the US Government Accountability Office. The EPA said about 400 people left between this year through mid-August. But 2,300 employees are participating in early retirement and deferred resignation programs, and most are technically still on the roster for now. Not included in these figures are the dozens of employees that have recently been placed on administrative leave at both agencies for signing onto open letters criticizing their Trump-appointed leaders.

So many departed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service that it is now trying to hire many of them back. But the nation’s weather forecasting capabilities have already been affected. At least seven of 122 NWS offices no longer operate around the clock due to shortages. Now, if an office can’t cover all of its shifts, its closest neighbor will help put out disaster watches and warnings for the territory, said Tom Fahy, legislative director for the union National Weather Service Employees Organization.

Staffing cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also had a ripple effect on local climate work around the US. Officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, relied on the agency’s data and guidance to help them track heat-related illnesses and deaths. Doing without it “means Arizona is losing critical support,” said Maren Mahoney, director of the state’s Office of Resiliency.

In April, the administration also dismissed hundreds of outside scientists who had volunteered their time to write the sixth National Climate Assessment, a landmark report mandated by Congress. The last edition of the NCA took nearly four years to develop and had some 750 contributors. It’s widely consulted by businesses and policymakers as a roadmap to current and future risks: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Marriott International Inc. and The Travelers Companies Inc. have all cited NCAs in public disclosures.

Not only is the sixth report on ice, but the website hosting past reports was pulled down, making it harder for the public to access taxpayer-funded research.

“You tear down data, it impacts the scientists who use that data,” said Emily Grover-Kopec, a director in the climate and energy practice of the research firm Rhodium Group and a meteorologist by training. “But ultimately this affects businesses, policymakers, city planners, individuals — they’re just looking to make good decisions with some information.”

Then, in July, the Energy Department published climate research of its own. It released a report by five scientists, handpicked by Wright, who oppose the consensus view on climate change. The report argues that global warming projections are exaggerated, benefits from higher levels of carbon dioxide are overlooked and policies to reduce emissions may do more harm than good.

Numerous experts have criticized these conclusions, and a group of more than 80 researchers issued a detailed critique of the report on Sept. 2. Another group of former military leaders and national security experts said it failed to address the defense implications of a warming planet.

Wright told Bloomberg Television that the agency isn’t denying the reality of climate change, which he called “a real physical phenomenon,” but that it has “put climate in its rightful place.” The report, he said, gives Americans “a more realistic view of this phenomenon. It’s just not even close to the world’s greatest problem. But that’s the only reason we’ve justified putting expensive wind turbines out.”

Wright’s suggestion that US energy policy has been too tethered to climate concerns is emblematic of the administration’s stance. It “very clearly sees climate as a social, economic and scientific phenomenon taking us down the wrong direction with respect to the kinds of energy we use,” said Joseph Majkut, director of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The Energy Department released the contrarian report in tandem with EPA proposing to roll back the endangerment finding, and to unwind related regulations on emissions from vehicles, power plants and oil wells. The attempted repeal will be hard-fought in court. Should it go through, it would have long-lasting consequences by making it harder for federal agencies to create new climate regulations without explicit congressional approval.

“We have basically an EPA that’s totally been defanged of its mission,” said Gina McCarthy, the EPA chief under President Barack Obama and a climate advisor to President Joe Biden. “It’s simply beneficial to the fossil fuel industry.”

The agency said deregulation ensures it sticks to its mission. Since the endangerment finding, spokesperson Holran said, consumers and automakers “have suffered from significant uncertainties and massive costs” due to vehicle emissions standards. If the finding is rescinded, “companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.”

Trump has made it a top priority to extract more fossil energy — declaring an energy emergency, exempting some coal power plants from pollution rules and speeding up permitting for oil and gas projects. That’s a stark contrast to the hurdles put in front of the renewables sector. Republicans in Congress hastened the end of tax credits for solar and wind production and electric cars in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But getting rid of Biden-era incentives wasn’t the end of it.

The Energy Department killed financing for a transmission line planned to carry wind power across the Midwest. The EPA pulled the plug on Solar for All, $7 billion to help low-income households tap solar power.

The Interior Department has created a snarl of red tape for all renewables projects on federal lands. It has taken particular aim at offshore wind, which Trump loathes. It withdrew millions of acres of ocean from potential use for wind power, and in August halted construction at a wind farm that was nearly finished. The agency also revoked approval for a planned 231-turbine wind project in Idaho and is trying to block other projects in Massachusetts and Maryland. The Interior Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The hobbling of the sector coincides with rising electricity demand from AI and data centers. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, a Democrat, told Bloomberg News the administration should be “working with states, not against states, in an effort to bring more power on board.”

The overall outlook for US clean energy has dimmed. New capacity added through 2030 will be 23% lower than forecast before the tax bill passed, according to BloombergNEF.

Researchers at Princeton University projected in July that the tax bill and other Trump policies will lead to 470 million more tons of carbon emissions in 2035. That’s equivalent to the energy used by 63 million American homes per year.

Justin Mankin, a scientist at Dartmouth College, estimates there will be $35 billion in economic losses in the US by 2035 from the clean energy rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act alone. Meanwhile, China installed over half of the world’s new solar last year and makes more than 70% of the EVs sold globally.

“We're ceding economic leadership in the energy transition to China,” Mankin said.

The administration’s policies will also limit the nation’s capacity to defend itself from the climate impacts that are already piling up: more intense storms, fires, heat waves and floods.

Trump and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have called for eliminating FEMA, which DHS oversees, and putting the burden of disaster response on states, localities and individuals. Trump launched a review council “tasked with reforming and streamlining the agency,” a group that’s set to release recommendations later this fall.

But already, the administration has taken several steps to dial back the federal government’s role in responding to and preparing for disasters. FEMA has stopped sending staff doorknocking to help survivors in disaster-hit areas, and it has reduced the amount of aid it gives to states that experience a catastrophe.

In April, FEMA terminated its billion-dollar Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, with funds that states could use to protect themselves by, for instance, elevating structures in floodplains or retrofitting hospitals against fierce storms. (Twenty states challenged the ending of the program in July, and a judge then ruled the administration cannot spend the funds elsewhere while litigation continues.)

Trump’s FEMA “is leaner, faster, and laser-focused on real disaster response,” according to a written statement provided by the agency’s press office, which called the door canvassing effort “wasteful and ineffective.” The spokesperson said the Biden administration was “burning through FEMA’s budget on so called ‘climate change’ and DEI pet projects.”

If FEMA disappears or shrinks significantly, states will have to mount their own responses at their expense, and households may be stuck with higher taxes and insurance premiums. This would sap GDP growth in disaster-prone states, according to research by Bloomberg Intelligence.

The US is the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, and the rest of the world is feeling the effects of its U-turn. Trump has struck trade deals that commit other countries to buying more US oil and gas, potentially slowing their own carbon-cutting progress. The administration has been pushing for changes at the International Energy Agency, displeased by forecasts it views as too green.

The US retreat from the Paris Agreement and climate diplomacy is already providing cover for governments, banks and corporations that have watered down or dropped green pledges. The dynamic is also tempering ambitions for the United Nations’ upcoming COP30 climate summit in Brazil, since it could give more leverage to Saudi Arabia and other countries that have worked to block strong targets at past talks.

(Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News’ parent company Bloomberg LP, is the UN Secretary-General’s special envoy on climate ambition and solutions. His philanthropic organization Bloomberg Philanthropies has said it will help cover US financial obligations under the Paris Agreement following Trump’s withdrawal.)

American scientists have long played a major role in writing the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, considered the gold standard of climate science. Four dozen plan to contribute to the next edition. But after the closure of the federal program that once supported this work, scientific organizations are fundraising to cover expenses, and some researchers will have to find their own funding to take part. The IPCC also draws on regional research like the National Climate Assessment; its suspension means there will be less granular data about the US available in the future.

Fortunately, the global climate science effort is less dependent on the US than in prior decades, according to Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Other countries and private companies have launched satellites that can collect climate and weather data that only the US did a decade or two ago.

But the US has the best-resourced scientific establishment in the world, and many holes will inevitably go unplugged. The result will be less insight into the current state of climate and weather, as well as what lies around the corner. It will be harder to tell promising solutions from dead ends. Public trust in US government data will decline, making it easier for misinformation to take hold. The country will be groping with one hand tied behind its back as record-breaking heat and storms become the new normal.

(CF) has emerged as a pivotal player in navigating these challenges. Over the past two years, the company has undergone subtle yet significant leadership transitions that have reinforced its strategic continuity while enhancing operational resilience. This analysis examines how CF’s evolving leadership, coupled with its focus on decarbonization and clean energy, positions the company as a leader in the transition to sustainable agriculture.

Strategic Continuity Amid Leadership Shifts

CF Industries has maintained a consistent strategic direction despite leadership changes, particularly in its commitment to decarbonization and innovation. Lori Ryerkerk, who previously served as CEO, President, and Chair, transitioned leadership to Scott A. Richardson in 2023 [1]. Richardson’s tenure has emphasized long-term sustainability, aligning with broader industry trends toward reducing carbon footprints. For instance, CF’s partnership with CHS Inc. to produce low-greenhouse-gas nitrogen fertilizer—a $200 million investment—demonstrates Richardson’s focus on measurable environmental impact while maintaining crop yields [2]. This initiative not only addresses climate concerns but also taps into growing demand for “climate-smart” agricultural products.

The board’s composition further underscores strategic continuity. Over half of CF’s board members joined since 2017, bringing fresh insights into emerging trends like carbon capture and green energy [3]. Independent directors, including Scott Richardson and Chuck Kyrish, have prioritized financial prudence and risk management. Kyrish, for example, has been instrumental in guiding CF’s restructuring efforts, with 2025 cash cost projections reflecting disciplined cost management [4]. This blend of experienced leadership and new perspectives ensures adaptability in a volatile sector.

Operational Resilience Through Innovation

CF’s operational resilience is evident in its aggressive decarbonization projects. The company’s carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) initiative at its Louisiana facility, set to begin in 2025, is a cornerstone of its strategy. By capturing and storing carbon dioxide, CF aims to generate 45Q tax credits while reducing emissions—a dual benefit for profitability and environmental stewardship [5]. Additionally, the 25-year sequestration agreement with 1PointFive, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, solidifies CF’s position in the low-carbon ammonia market [6].

Financial performance further validates this resilience. In 2024, CF reported net earnings of $1.22 billion and EBITDA of $2.33 billion, with $1.9 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases [7]. These figures highlight the company’s ability to balance growth with shareholder returns, even amid global supply chain disruptions. The recent collaboration with NextEra Energy on a green ammonia project in Oklahoma—producing up to 100,000 tons annually using renewable energy—signals CF’s readiness to capitalize on the rising demand for clean energy applications [8].

Leadership Expertise and Governance

The board’s expertise in sustainability and financial strategy has been critical to CF’s success. Scott Richardson’s emphasis on “higher-order cognitive processing” in leadership—addressing complex challenges like climate change—aligns with academic frameworks for sustainability leadership [9]. Meanwhile, the board’s independent structure, with 11 out of 13 members operating without conflicts of interest, ensures robust oversight and accountability [10]. This governance model has enabled CF to pivot swiftly, such as integrating the Waggaman ammonia production facility acquired in 2023, while maintaining operational efficiency [11].

Conclusion: A Model for Sustainable Growth

CF Industries’ leadership transitions have not disrupted its strategic trajectory but rather reinforced its commitment to innovation and sustainability. By leveraging board expertise, investing in decarbonization, and maintaining financial discipline, the company has positioned itself to thrive in a sector increasingly defined by environmental and regulatory pressures. For investors, CF’s blend of operational resilience and forward-looking strategy offers a compelling case for long-term value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 20:03:48.877805

Critics of the so-called ‘devastation bill’ celebrate as the government U-turns on controversial provisions slated to have ‘grave’ consequences for human rights, environmental and climate protections.

In a major win for environmental safeguarding, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has scrapped 63 articles from a recently adopted environmental licensing law that were the subject of intense international scrutiny over their potential to roll back environmental, climate and human rights safeguards.

UN experts on Thursday (4 September) lauded the move as a “decisive step” in the protection of the environment and human rights, and the prevention of a weakened environmental licensing process, adding that the vetoes reflected well on the country’s “commitment to upholding international human rights and environmental obligations”.

THE DEVASTATION BILL

The experts, appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, were quick to express their “grave concerns” over Bill PL 2159/2021 – widely known as the ‘devastation Bill’ – following its approval by the Brazilian Federal Senate on 21 May 2025. In a 26 May letter addressed to the Brazilian government, they lamented the addition of “serious and aggressive amendments” to the Bill that either altered or abandoned key provisions that would have ensured environmental and human rights were upheld.

The now-vetoed provisions included, among other amendments, the exemption of mining activities from licensing obligations; weakened protections for the Atlantic Forest; and simplified licensing processes through automatic permit renewals and developer self-declarations.

“These modifications can have serious and irreversible damages to the environment, aggravating the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and toxic pollution,” the experts wrote.

Critics also condemned the Bill’s impact on indigenous peoples and Quilombola Afro-descendant communities living on unmarked lands whose rights to informed consent processes would be threatened by the amendments.

INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE

Though supported by the oil and gas and agribusiness sectors, the Bill’s new provisions sparked international outrage. In early July, 352 organisations and civil society groups condemned the Bill as “a major institutional setback for Brazil and the undoing of over 40 years of national environmental legislation”. (Google translation)

Despite the intense backlash, the Bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 17 July 2025, with 267 votes in favour and 115 against.

In a statement issued on 25 July 2025, UN experts urged the president to veto the provisions that “contradict Brazil’s constitutional and international obligations”. They pointed to the Bill’s potential to damage Brazil’s credibility as host of the upcoming 2025 Climate Change Conference, COP30, reminding the country of its obligations to ensure its legislation aligns with international commitments such as those signed under the Paris Agreement.

“While procedural efficiency in environmental licensing is important, it must not be achieved at the expense of effective regulations, controls and monitoring, and accountability, and human rights and environmental protections,” they wrote.

The experts added that the licensing amendments were likely to disproportionately impact indigenous peoples and Quilombola Afro-descendant communities. With these individuals already bearing the brunt of environmental and climate harms, they warned that the proposed measures would violate Brazil’s non-discrimination obligations.

Following Congress’ stamp of approval, human rights organisation Amnesty International echoed the sentiments of the UN experts and urged President Lula to veto the Bill while criticising its lack of “public debate and transparency”.

“This Bill drastically weakens environmental licensing, undermines critical environmental institutions, and shows little regard for human rights,” the organisation said. “We call on the president to veto this bill, as it threatens the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the rights to access to information, public participation and access to justice, as well as the rights of indigenous peoples and climate justice.”

NEXT STEPS

Welcoming the Brazilian government’s move to scrap the 63 provisions from the Bill, the UN experts called on the National Congress to uphold the presidential vetoes, issuing a stark warning that failure to do so would violate the country’s constitution as well as its international obligations under customary international law and several treaties.

With a simplified licensing process for ‘strategic projects’ retained in the law, the experts cautioned that all projects, both standard and strategic, poised to significantly impact the environment, climate or human rights must undergo “an adequate and comprehensive environmental impact assessment based on the best available science, including Indigenous science and other knowledge systems”.",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/brazil-blocks-problematic-provisions-from-environmental-licensing-bill_0_7Vq5Sg75twW5BTmhaL8gd62hEgQnTEh5MNbEgjz5.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:03:38.130209

Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon.

“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email.

The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”

Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power.

“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppard said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”

The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.

PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.

Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere.

Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.

The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.

AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.

“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Hydrogen sector dependent on uncertain government support

A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach.

Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years.

But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen.

“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.

“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.

Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.

“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”

If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.

Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.

“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.",https://corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Clean-Hydrogen-construction-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-08 18:03:33.413813

Water quality concerns The new pipeline is proposed to cross several dozen streams and wetlands across North Carolina, using mostly dry-open cut methods and trenchless technologies.
“This method of crossing water bodies degrades water quality, pollutes drinking water sources, and harms habitat for aquatic species,” said the organization.
Another group, Clean Water for North Carolina, recently released interactive maps showing the proposed route overlaid with the bodies of water it would cross.
The commissioners also pointed to Transco's poor safety record, according to data analysis by watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust.","Environmental advocates and concerned citizens are urging state officials to deny a water quality permit for Transco’s Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP), citing concerns over safety, environmental impacts, and consumer protection.

“Water is a sacred source of all life and should be treated as a beloved relative,” said Seth Harris, programs director at 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous-led advocacy organization. “It's past time we do everything in our power to protect our water, and invest in North Carolina’s resilience, not waste money on dead-end polluting infrastructure like Transo’s SSEP.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) held a hearing Thursday evening in Kernersville in Forsyth County to hear comments from members of the public. State officials are accepting public comment online until Oct. 6. (Project No. 20240801; Version 2)

According to the N.C. DEQ, the project is proposed to include approximately 4.4 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline in Rockingham County, known as the Eden loop. The project would also include construction of approximately 24.1 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline in Guilford, Forsyth, and Davidson counties, known as the Salem loop. Finally, the proposed project would modify existing compressor stations and other facilities in Davidson, Cleveland, Iredell, Lincoln, and Gaston counties.

This project is part of a larger push to expand natural gas infrastructure across the U.S. Two other pipelines could also be built in North Carolina: MVP Southgate and Enbridge T-15.

Why is this project needed?

In its permit application to state officials, Transco says this project is needed “to meet growing natural gas fired power generation, commercial, residential, and industrial demand in the southeast United States.” Transco says SSEP “helps support companies switching from coal to gas.”

Critics of the project say new pipeline infrastructure isn’t needed to begin with. Groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center contend resources should instead be put toward renewable energy.

“The Transco expansion project … represents a multi-generational investment in fossil fuels at a moment of deepening urgency in the climate crisis,” the law center said in a press release from October 2024. “If this Transco expansion project is approved, it will result in tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year, putting federal and state emissions reduction goals firmly out of reach.”

Natural gas contains several different components, the largest being methane, a potent greenhouse gas. According to NASA, methane is the second largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates about 6.5 million metric tons of methane leak from the oil and gas supply chain each year.

In its application, Transco states renewable energies, like solar and wind, can’t meet the nation’s energy demand.

“Wind and solar energy sources cannot provide the reliable dispatch of load following energy generation that natural gas can provide, nor can they be made available at the scale necessary to meet customer' s required demand,” the application said.

Water quality concerns

The new pipeline is proposed to cross several dozen streams and wetlands across North Carolina, using mostly dry-open cut methods and trenchless technologies. In its application, Transco said it will follow best management practices to minimize and avoid impacts on waterways during construction.

However the group NO SSEP, which advocates against the pipeline, disagrees with these practices.

“This method of crossing water bodies degrades water quality, pollutes drinking water sources, and harms habitat for aquatic species,” said the organization.

Another group, Clean Water for North Carolina, recently released interactive maps showing the proposed route overlaid with the bodies of water it would cross.

“The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (would damage) … drinking water sources, and that includes surface water as well as groundwater,” said Stephanie Gans, assistant director at Clean Water for North Carolina. “There are public water supplies … that are very close to the proposed path.”

Local governments pass resolutions urging regulators to take action

In late August, Forsyth County Commissioners passed a resolution urging state and federal regulators ""to meaningfully address safety and environmental concerns regarding the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project and to deny approval of the project.""

""This pipeline enhancement project raises a range of concerns for citizens, including, but not limited to, public safety risks, water resource impacts, environmental degradation, increased electric rates, and economic risks,"" stated the resolution.

The commissioners also pointed to Transco's poor safety record, according to data analysis by watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust.

“Water is a sacred source of all life and should be treated as a beloved relative,” said Seth Harris, programs director at 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous-led advocacy organization. “It's past time we do everything in our power to protect our water, and invest in North Carolina’s resilience, not waste money on dead-end polluting infrastructure like Transo’s SSEP.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) held a hearing Thursday evening in Kernersville in Forsyth County to hear comments from members of the public. State officials are accepting public comment online until Oct. 6. (Project No. 20240801; Version 2)

According to the N.C. DEQ, the project is proposed to include approximately 4.4 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline in Rockingham County, known as the Eden loop. The project would also include construction of approximately 24.1 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline in Guilford, Forsyth, and Davidson counties, known as the Salem loop. Finally, the proposed project would modify existing compressor stations and other facilities in Davidson, Cleveland, Iredell, Lincoln, and Gaston counties.

This project is part of a larger push to expand natural gas infrastructure across the U.S. Two other pipelines could also be built in North Carolina: MVP Southgate and Enbridge T-15.

Why is this project needed?

In its permit application to state officials, Transco says this project is needed “to meet growing natural gas fired power generation, commercial, residential, and industrial demand in the southeast United States.” Transco says SSEP “helps support companies switching from coal to gas.”

Critics of the project say new pipeline infrastructure isn’t needed to begin with. Groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center contend resources should instead be put toward renewable energy.

“The Transco expansion project … represents a multi-generational investment in fossil fuels at a moment of deepening urgency in the climate crisis,” the law center said in a press release from October 2024. “If this Transco expansion project is approved, it will result in tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year, putting federal and state emissions reduction goals firmly out of reach.”

Natural gas contains several different components, the largest being methane, a potent greenhouse gas. According to NASA, methane is the second largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates about 6.5 million metric tons of methane leak from the oil and gas supply chain each year. However, that number is very likely underreported, according to researchers at MIT and Johns Hopkins University.

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/689715/original/file-20250908-64-rbsloy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C54%2C6240%2C3120&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 17:03:42.652935

Florida Marks Fifth Straight Year of Clean Air

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) announced that Florida has met all federal air quality standards for the fifth consecutive year. Florida is the most populous state in the nation to achieve this distinction, underscoring the success of strong air quality monitoring, effective pollution controls and collaboration with partners at every level.

The Clean Air Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria air pollutants that can harm human health and the environment: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particle pollution and sulfur dioxide. Florida’s industrial emissions have declined 78 percent since 2000, and ozone levels – the most widespread air pollutant – have fallen by nearly half over the past twenty years. This success reflects years of collaboration between DEP and stakeholders to reduce emissions and improve air quality.

Florida maintains one of the nation’s most comprehensive air quality monitoring networks, with 180 monitors at 90 sites across the state. The network meets or exceeds federal requirements and ensures accurate, real-time data for residents and communities.

Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a public comment period on its intent to issue a permit for Marquis Carbon Injection LLC to inject and store carbon dioxide underground at an injection well in Putnam County, Illinois.

The process of storing carbon underground is known as “carbon sequestration.” Under the proposed plan, Marquis Carbon Injection would inject up to 1.5 million metric tons of carbon per year, over a period of six years. Marquis would be required to monitor the wells—during the six years of proposed injection and for twelve years afterwards—to ensure that the injection wells work properly, the carbon dioxide does not move from its injected location and drinking water sources are protected.

The formation where carbon will be stored is approximately 3,094 feet below ground. Studies of the site show that there is about 963 feet of rock, including a 404-foot-thick confining zone composed of impermeable shale and carbonates, between the deepest underground source of drinking water and the proposed injection location. EPA has concluded that the well materials, intended operation of the well, and underlying geology are appropriate for carbon sequestration and will prevent endangerment of underground drinking water sources.

EPA will host a public availability session on October 15 to engage in conversation and answer questions on the draft permit and a public hearing on October 29 to hear and record public comments. Comments may also be submitted in writing.

“Funding has been a huge kind of punch in the gut, especially with [Environmental Justice],” said Kennedy Williams, environmental justice program manager for CleanAIRE NC. The nonprofit is looking at new ways to make money, such as monetizing its AirKeeper Dashboard.

The AirKeeper Dashboard is a mapping tool that presents results from the nonprofit's air monitors. The reports also include information on pollution sources, demographic data and public health.

“Obviously, we want to make it free for community members so it's easily accessible,” Williams said. “But for institutions and corporations that are also interested in using the dashboard, we're trying to create a system where they can have either a subscription or pay for their colleagues to use it.”

Wave energy is an emerging industry that's largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects.
The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES — (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a ""game changer in terms of clean energy production"" for the port and the communities around it. America's shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

Wave energy is an emerging industry that's largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America's energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Pre-Construction Phase Factsheet

Location: North Dakota, USA

Lead Firm: Canada-based Nucleon Energy

Scope: Site selection, licensing, public engagement, workforce assessment & cost modeling

Timeline: 2025 – 2027. Potential construction before 2030

Proposed Technology: Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

Impact: Energy diversification, grid stability, carbon-free initiative

North Dakota’s Energy Mix

North Dakota is already among the leading states in U.S. oil production, is among the top ten wind energy producers by capacity in the states, is a major lignite coal basin, and has strong transmission corridors feeding Midwest markets.

Ideally, adding nuclear would enhance grid stability and help diversify beyond fossil dependence. This comes at a time when the strain on U.S. grids is clearly evident as flagged by the WSP Pulse Report 2025, which showed overwhelming public support for affordability, grid safety and modernization, and assessments on climate impact of using fossil fuels for energy generation.

Now serving as the fifty-fifth United States Secretary of the Interior, former North Dakota Governor, Doug Burgum, has also consistently stressed on “energy dominance” and an expansion of America’s fossil fuel production. Burgum makes clear of this through pushing for fossil-fuels and his support for coal plants. Crowning this has been marked by events like the halting of the now resumed $5 billion Empire offshore wind project by Equinor off the coast of New York City. Despite all this, he also promised to make North Dakota carbon neutral by 2030.

North Dakota has already forged great steps in lignite coal, oil, and wind capacity. Nuclear, particularly SMRs, is now being considered to ensure grid reliability and long-term energy independence.

Nuclear in the U.S. Energy Market

North Dakota picking Nucleon Energy to lay groundwork for its nuclear power plan positions the state to join others like Michigan, Washington, Idaho, and Tennessee, where the nuclear market is already growing.

This decision also aligns and fits with federal ambitions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The act allocates tax credits and loan guarantees for zero-carbon technologies, including nuclear.

Some investors, utilities, and even the Trump administration alike see SMRs and nuclear as a hedge against intermittency risks from wind and solar, while complementing gas and LNG projects such as the Alaska LNG mega-project now under review by Japanese buyers. Japan also plans to build a next-generation nuclear reactor at the 1,666 MW Mihama nuclear power plant in Fukui Prefecture, marking the country’s first concrete post-Fukushima move towards the construction of a new nuclear reactor.

“The president has a long-standing distaste for wind power and solar power, but the practical impact is that bills do go up,” Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., said in a brief interview.
“And so I think long term, how you address energy costs is you invest in American clean energy security.
“The real energy emergency isn’t a made-up crisis — it’s the skyrocketing energy costs American families are facing because of Republicans’ relentless attacks on clean energy,” Heinrich said in a statement.","As electricity prices outpace inflation, members of Congress and the administration have constituents’ bills on their mind, with Democrats hoping they will help them make the case against Trump administration policies.

Last week, the House passed the fiscal 2026 Energy-Water appropriations bill, in a 214-213 vote. The bill would provide $57.3 billion for federal energy and water programs, including the nuclear defense programs and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, much of the concern during floor debate was on how the measure would affect consumer energy bills.

Republicans said the provisions of the bill that increase investments in nuclear energy, fossil fuels and critical minerals would support the Trump administration’s goals for constantly running baseload power, while Democrats said spending cuts, such as a 47 percent reduction to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, would cede U.S. leadership on renewable energy sources as China continues to invest in the sector.

Increases in energy costs are “not sustainable for working families, and sadly, this Republican Energy and Water bill does not meet our nation’s energy and water imperative for the future, nor for the present,” said Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, adding that she had heard from a constituent whose energy bill doubled in July.

Energy demand is increasing across the country, at an average rate of 1.7 percent per year, according to the Energy Information Administration. This is largely driven by the commercial and industrial sector, which includes data centers for artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

With this, electricity prices have risen at double the rate of inflation in the past year.

Trump administration officials have acknowledged growing consumer concern about energy costs but say intermittent wind and solar energy are to blame for the increases.

“We had 100 years of flat to declining inflation-adjusted electricity prices until President Obama decided we’re going to save the planet with renewable power,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Sept. 4. Wind and solar energy “are the reason we have more expensive electricity,” he said.

The Trump administration has used this argument to support actions such as issuing a stop-work order for the nearly completed Revolution Wind facility off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island. The states and the developer, Danish wind giant Ørsted S.A., have sued the administration over this decision.

When announcing their intent to sue on Sept. 4, the states’ Democratic attorneys general cited an August statement from regional grid operator ISO New England that said project delays will jeopardize reliability in the summer and winter peak periods and “will adversely affect New England’s economy and industrial growth, including potential future data centers.”

As they aim to retake power in the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats have sought to tie the increase in electricity prices to President Donald Trump’s policies on wind and solar, which they say have been borne out of a desire to support fossil fuels.

“The president has a long-standing distaste for wind power and solar power, but the practical impact is that bills do go up,” Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., said in a brief interview. “And so I think long term, how you address energy costs is you invest in American clean energy security. You modernize the grid, and you do everything we can to harness the lowest-cost source.”

Last week, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., renewed their push for a joint resolution that would terminate the energy emergency that Trump declared on his first day in office. Trump’s executive order has been used to support actions to keep fossil fuel plants open and take actions that supporters of wind and solar energy say make them less competitive.

The 1976 law that gives the president the power to declare a national emergency also established procedures for a privileged resolution to end the emergency declaration, which can be reintroduced every six months if the emergency declaration is maintained. Any member can bring the resolution up for a vote in the coming weeks.

In February, the Senate rejected, 47-52, an earlier joint resolution along party lines, but Kaine and Heinrich are tying a potential vote on the newer joint resolution to rising energy costs and the cancellation of renewable energy projects to pressure Republicans who previously supported the emergency declaration.

Significance

Transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in the United States, and light duty vehicles make up the majority of transportation emissions. Electrification is the primary strategy for decarbonizing transportation, and the effect of electric vehicle (EV) charging on the power grid is the largest factor in determining the net emissions implications of electrification. We find that EV adoption can induce wind, solar, and natural gas infrastructure investments that shift power generation mix and emissions, producing lower consequential emissions estimates of EV adoption than prior studies that ignore long run effects. Our power system emissions estimates for policy-relevant EV adoption trajectories can help quantify emissions implications of policy decisions and inform public and scientific discussions around EVs.

Abstract

We model the effect of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) adoption on U.S. power system generator capacity investment, operations, and emissions through 2050 by estimating power systems outcomes under a range of EV adoption trajectory scenarios. Our EV adoption scenarios are informed by 1) an Energy Information Administration scenario with no policy intervention, 2) EV growth expected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 3) a Biden Administration 50% EV sales target by 2030, 4) the Environmental Protection Agency’s projections under vehicle emissions standards, and 5) the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to Net Zero by 2050. We find across these scenarios that increasing EV adoption induces investment in new wind, solar, storage, and natural gas capacity, affecting power generation mix and emissions. The net effect of increasing EV adoption beyond our IRA base case is to increase power sector emissions by about 5 mtCO2eq per EV-year in 2026 (comparable to displaced gasoline vehicle combustion emissions), but this effect rapidly drops to annual levels below 1 mtCO2eq per EV-year by 2032 and continues below this level through 2050. Consequential effects of EV adoption vary regionally, with most regions primarily increasing wind or solar capacity and some regions primarily increasing natural gas capacity, even in 2050. Our national emissions estimates per EV-year are relatively robust to the level of EV adoption beyond our baseline and to variation in assumptions about power systems, EV behavior, and policy.

Time is running out for anyone thinking about buying or leasing an electric vehicle who also wants a discount. The federal EV tax credit—worth up to $7,500—is ending on Sept. 30.

“For more than a decade, this program has helped make EVs more affordable, but once it’s gone, so are those savings, says Aaron Bragman, Detroit Bureau Chief, Cars.com. “While most shoppers have heard of the credit, a recent study from Cars.com shows only about a third really understand how it works. That’s important, because nearly 80% of car shoppers considering EVs say it factors into their decision to go electric, and almost half say they might speed up their plans before the deadline hits.”

For shoppers considering an EV, start shopping now so you can finalize your purchase and take delivery before the Sept. 30 deadline. Some automakers and dealers are also offering their own discounts and financing deals, which can stack on top of the credit to bring prices down even more.

“Looking ahead, the end of the credit doesn’t mean the end of affordable EVs,” he says. “Brands like Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hyundai are rolling out lower-priced options, and used EVs are getting more attractive too, with plenty available under $25,000. Battery costs are also coming down, which will help keep prices competitive in the long run.”

I recently test drove the Chevrolet Equinox, which is a really good value for a starting price of $34,995 for the LT trim. Another EV that qualifies for the tax credit is the Hyundai Ioniq 5 which starts at $44,200.

Eligibility for the tax credit is not only dependent on the vehicle but also on your own income and filing status.

More From Our Experts

The Trump administration is pulling back sharply on large-scale projects that demonstrate cutting-edge energy technologies. Unless Congress steps in forcefully to preserve the program which a bipartisan majority funded just four years ago, the cuts will slow the global response to climate change and hurt U.S. competitiveness in emerging energy technologies. China, meanwhile, is stepping up its investments and seeking to extend its technological lead.

Why governments should invest in demonstration projects

More on:

Energy and Climate Policy

Renewable Energy

United States

Many of the technologies that large-scale demonstration projects would advance, such as new kinds of nuclear reactors or steel mills, could ultimately pay off for society, but the risks and costs of their first iterations are usually too steep even for very risk-tolerant capitalists to take on. Government investment in demonstration projects plugs the gap left by private investors.

Scale and complexity are the roots of this problem. Large scale makes power plants and industrial facilities economical, enabling them to supply electricity and goods that are vital to society at low costs. The same features create barriers to innovation. The first full-scale nuclear reactor or steel plant of its type probably won’t run as smoothly or affordably as the older ones their builders hope to replace, even if the new ones have passed smaller-scale tests with flying colors. Moreover, potential competitors can sit back and learn from the first movers without risking a penny.

As a result, private investors frequently take a pass on staking hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars on demonstration projects. Yet the societal benefits of advancing these technologies can be large. A hefty fraction of the emissions that drive global climate change come from large-scale facilities. The innovations that could drastically reduce their emissions may have additional benefits, such as greater affordability or security. Government funding that bridges the so-called “demonstration valley of death” [PDF] can give domestic pioneers in these emerging sectors a leg up on their competitors abroad.

More From Our Experts

Gaps in the global portfolio

The United States, the European Union, and fifteen other nations responded to this challenge in September 2022 by pledging $94 billion in public funding to support large-scale demonstration projects during the current decade. This amount exceeded the $90 billion that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated [PDF] would be needed to stay on its roadmap to net-zero emissions. However, as we show in a recent analysis, “the combined effort of pledged countries is falling far short of the pledge’s goal.”

Technological progress in the global demonstration project portfolio has been uneven as well. The IEA’s net-zero scenario highlighted eleven technology areas, ranging from synthetic fuels to small modular nuclear reactors. More than 80 percent of projects and funding tracked by the IEA have flowed to only four of these eleven: biofuels; carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); offshore wind; and hydrogen production, storage, and transportation.

Energy and Climate Policy

Renewable Energy

United States

Some of the neglected areas are big contributors to climate change. For example, the steel industry, which causes 7 percent of global emissions, is the focus of only two projects. Similarly, international shipping, which causes another 3 percent, accounts for just two as well. Emissions from such sectors are not going to decline unless demonstration projects show that innovative clean technologies are technically viable and have a plausible pathway to affordability.

The United States’ Pullback

The United States committed $21.9 billion to the September 2022 pledge, comprising the entire budget of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) in the Department of Energy (DOE), which Congress had set up the year before. By the end of the Biden administration, Congress had given OCED more than $26.7 billion for large-scale projects. While some of these projects supported work in areas well-represented in the global portfolio, such as CCUS and hydrogen, others promised to fill gaps in areas like industrial decarbonization and long-duration energy storage.

The Trump administration is pulling back hard on these planned investments. In May 2025, DOE announced the cancellation of $3.7 billion awarded by OCED for industrial demonstration projects. The industries impacted included cement, fuels, chemicals, glass, and steel. The administration’s request for DOE’s fiscal year 2026 budget states that it would cancel an additional $15 billion [PDF], although the specific projects included in this proposal have not yet been identified.

The administration has also crippled DOE’s newly created capacity to manage large-scale projects. A reported 77 percent of OCED’s staff opted to leave the department voluntarily in the first few months of Trump’s term, and the office has essentially been dismantled.

OCED’s administrative record has been criticized in recent reports by DOE’s Inspector General as well as external observers. The task of overseeing billions of dollars for cutting-edge fields with very limited administrative funding, while developing project management capabilities that DOE had not previously possessed, was daunting. Some poorly designed projects were approved, and some decisions might have been rushed.

The critics have not shown that OCED made significant technical misjudgments, much less acted corruptly. Because the awards were phased, only about 3 percent of OCED’s budget has actually gone to developers, limiting the financial risk and allowing time to strengthen or drop weak projects. DOE did not provide substantial evidence, much less rigorous analysis, to back its cancellations. A review by Resources for the Future concluded that “that many of the projects that DOE canceled could have generated long-run public returns—and potential short-run financial returns...” The Energy Futures Initiative added that “canceling these awards has ripple effects. ...investors will lose faith in DOE-supported projects.”

China steps up

As the United States pulls back, China is stepping up. China already dominates key growth sectors, such as solar panels and battery manufacturing, and it is aggressively investing in emerging energy technologies. In March 2025, the central government announced 101 new demonstration projects, adding to the 47 funded last year. Iron and steel, long-duration energy storage, and the production of polysilicon (the primary material used in solar panels and semiconductors) are among the many technology areas targeted.

The United States remains engaged in some vital areas of emerging energy technologies, such as nuclear and geothermal power. The Trump administration has maintained the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, announced new initiatives to build plants at government sites, and eased licensing and permitting. China continues to invest in these areas as well. Competition between the two nations to refine and scale these technologies should accelerate innovation (although stronger international cooperation in precompetitive and non-proprietary R&D would also help).

U.S. relinquishes leadership as global gaps remain

But gaps in the global portfolio remain. Chemicals, fuels, shipping, and carbon dioxide removal are among the areas where American investment will be particularly missed. Even more important, the demise of OCED dramatically weakens the world’s capacity to identify and fill new gaps that will emerge as the economy and technology evolve in the coming decades. One of OCED’s final reports identified two dozen opportunities [PDF] that are promising now or likely to become so during this decade alone.

Over the past eighty years, federal innovation investment sparked the growth of major industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, the internet, and AI, to name a few. During the same time span, the United States frequently sought to mobilize international action to address collective problems. Congress carried forward these traditions when it created and funded OCED. Unless the administration can be persuaded to reverse course, the nation will relinquish both strands of global leadership this year.

""U.S. LNG contributes to supply security thanks in part to the greater reliability of the route from the United States to Italy and Europe, compared with the geopolitical risks present on other routes,"" Pichetto Fratin said in a statement.

A potential increase in Italian imports of American LNG was discussed in Washington in April during a meeting between Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and U.S. President Donald Trump.

If anything, Northvolt’s demise has reinforced China’s lock on the market, and rendered cleantech investors gun shy on the prospect of challenging it again.","MONTREAL — In Europe, the collapse of Swedish EV battery maker Northvolt in March meant shuttered production plants and thousands of job losses. In Quebec, its demise was less dramatic: a 171 barren hectares on Montreal’s South Shore.

This was to be home of the company’s first non-European battery factory, right up until the Quebec government pulled the plug on the project last week.

You might say the province got off easy. Yet by flopping in Sweden, Northvolt stands to have detrimental long-term effects on cleantech investment in Quebec and beyond.

First, the obvious. The Quebec government invested $270 million in the Northvolt project. That investment is now worthless. For context, that is more than enough money to revamp a good-sized hospital in Montreal, train 5,000 new construction workers or purchase just over a quarter of a new roof for the Olympic Stadium. Quebec also loaned Northvolt $240 million to purchase those 171 hectares, with the land itself as collateral, meaning the government must sell it for at least that amount, along with at least $20 million in interest, to make itself whole. Christine Fréchette, Quebec’s economic minister, recently said the government has managed to recoup $200 million, and said there is more coming.

Less obvious, but more profound, is Northvolt’s long shadow on the cleantech industry. Investments in world-saving technologies are in free fall, with the dollar value of Canadian investors’ deals in cleantech and climate-tech was down 45 per cent in 2024 compared to the year before. Granted, this is compared to the pandemic era, when green investment dollars flowed. Now, Trump’s tariffs, combined with its demonization of anything carbon reduction-related, has turned cleantech bulls into bears.

By virtue of its rapid rise and expensive downfall, Northvolt makes for an easy cautionary tale about the folly of cleantech investing. It’s already had an effect in Northvolt’s backyard. “In Sweden, private money is pulling back and becoming increasingly cautious, in large part because of what happened with Northvolt,” Christian Sandström, an associate professor of technology management at Linnaeus University in Sweden, told me.

Quebec’s public-money investments in Northvolt tell a similar cautionary tale. As someone who knows these things told me recently, Quebec public pension fund manager La Caisse de dépôt invested $200-million in Northvolt largely because others, including the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, had already done so. This sounds less like sound investment strategy than dumb money FOMO.

La Caisse has poured roughly the same kind of money into a buzzy sector before, with similarly disastrous results. In October 2021, it invested US$150 million in crypto lender Celsius, while hailing the company as “the leading global cryptocurrency earning and borrowing platform.”Celsius collapsed nine months later. The result? La Caisse wrote off its investment and swore off crypto for good. Will Northvolt’s demise trigger a similar reticence for cleantech investment? Well, Northvolt’s $200-million black eye certainly doesn’t help.

Northvolt’s would-be Quebec home, those 171 barren hectares, also sets a bad precedent. The company was not only able to secure the land with a Quebec government-backed loan; it also circumvented a strict environmental review normally conducted for such massive infrastructure projects.

The land was cleared of trees and protesting environmentalists as a result, all for a $7-billion battery production facility that will never be built. This sends a perverse message to the world: Quebec will roll out the red carpet and ignore its own environmental laws, as long as you’re selling something big, expensive and dripping with hype.

As Europe’s EV battery pioneer, Northvolt sold investors on a compelling narrative. It would challenge China’s dominance in the sector while respecting the environmental norms, democratic ideals and European standards. This narrative has since turned on itself. If anything, Northvolt’s demise has reinforced China’s lock on the market, and rendered cleantech investors gun shy on the prospect of challenging it again.

In this Markets in a Minute graphic, created in partnership with Terzo, we highlight the jobs that experts believe will have the fastest growth rate in the coming years.

A Closer Look at the Fastest Growing Jobs

Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the jobs below are projected to grow the fastest from 2024 to 2034.

Job% Change, 2024–2034PMedian Annual Wage in 2024 Wind Turbine Techs50%$62,580 Solar Panel Installers42%$51,860 Nurse Practitioners40%$129,210 Data Scientists34%$112,590 Cybersecurity Analysts29%$124,910 Healthcare Managers23%$117,960 Physical Therapist Assistants22%$65,510 Actuaries22%$125,770 Operations Analysts22%$91,290 Physician Assistants20%$133,260

The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects wind turbine service technicians will see the highest growth. This is because demand for electricity fuels the need for wind turbines to be installed and maintained. Also within the realm of renewable energy, solar panel installers could grow quickly given lower costs and leasing options that eliminate upfront installation expenses.

Both of these roles pay more than the overall median wage of $49,500 in 2024, but less than other jobs on the list.

Growth in Healthcare

Four of the fastest growing jobs are related to healthcare, with this change fueled by the rise of chronic diseases and an aging population. In fact, adults over age 65 make up close to a quarter of the population in some states.

While three of the four medical roles involve the direct care of patients, healthcare managers are responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating health services. Their tasks typically include things like helping develop healthcare goals, ensuring facilities follow regulations, and preparing and monitoring budgets.

Momentum in Math and Computers

The remaining fastest growing jobs are in math and computer-related fields. Of these roles, actuaries have the highest median salary.

As risks and the amount of data increases, actuaries play a key role in helping companies manage their own risk. They may also work at insurance companies to analyze data and project future risks and costs.

Meanwhile, experts predict both data scientists and operations analysts will see strong growth as the amount of data increases and the demand for actionable insights rises.

Data scientists typically collect data, create algorithms and computer models, visualize findings, and make business recommendations. They typically need to be able to write code and develop statistical models, and therefore command a higher salary than operations analysts.",https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fastest-Growing-Jobs_Terzo_Share.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:05:17.996702

At the heart of this transformation lies long-duration energy storage (LDES), a critical enabler of grid stability and renewable energy adoption. Corporate sustainability-driven R&D partnerships are emerging as the primary catalysts for sector growth, combining technological innovation, financial scale, and policy alignment to overcome historical barriers. For investors, this convergence of factors presents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on a market poised for exponential expansion.

Corporate R&D Partnerships: The Innovation Engine

Leading energy firms are redefining the LDES landscape through strategic collaborations that prioritize sustainability and scalability. EDF, for instance, has partnered with Skytree and Return Carbon to develop direct air capture (DAC) facilities in Texas, targeting the removal of 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually while advancing hydrogen and compressed air storage technologies [1]. Similarly, RWE’s alliance with HPE and Nvidia leverages AI-driven weather modeling to optimize renewable energy generation and grid efficiency, reflecting a shift toward data-centric operational intelligence [2]. These partnerships are not merely incremental—they are reengineering the economics of energy storage by reducing capital risks and accelerating industrialization.

IBU-tec’s collaboration with Volkswagen’s PowerCo and Wanhua Chemical exemplifies this trend. By co-developing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode materials, the partnership secured EUR 6 million in contracts and enabled the production of IBUvolt® LMFP Gen0, a high-energy-density variant that reduces reliance on commoditized materials [3]. Such innovations directly align with the European Union’s battery sovereignty goals and net-zero targets, underscoring the role of R&D partnerships in bridging technological gaps while capturing premium pricing.

Policy-Driven Scaling and Market Dynamics

Government policies are amplifying the impact of corporate R&D efforts. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a game-changer, with investment tax credits for standalone energy storage reducing project costs by 40% in 2024 and spurring deployments of non-lithium LDES technologies [4]. For example, Form Energy’s iron-air battery projects and Quinbrook’s 8-hour battery storage with CATL in Australia highlight how policy incentives are de-risking high-capex ventures. The IRA’s support has also driven global average turnkey energy storage system prices down, making LDES more accessible to utilities and developers [5].

Quantifiable metrics further validate the sector’s growth trajectory. The stationary energy storage market, valued at USD 66.47 billion in 2025, is projected to surge to USD 293.59 billion by 2032, with a 23.64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) [6]. This expansion is fueled by utilities like NextEra Energy, which deployed 6.3 GWh of ESS batteries with Samsung SDI in 2025, and Platte River Power Authority’s 100 MW/400 MWh lithium iron phosphate project in Colorado [7]. These deployments are not isolated successes but part of a broader industry shift toward energy storage as a core infrastructure asset.

ROI and Risk Mitigation in R&D Collaborations

Investors are increasingly prioritizing partnerships that demonstrate clear return on investment (ROI) and risk mitigation. VFlowTech’s USD 20.5 million funding round in 2025, backed by Granite Asia and EDBI, illustrates this dynamic. The capital is scaling vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) deployments across 10 countries, leveraging AI-driven energy management to enhance grid stability [8]. Similarly, LG Energy Solution’s $5.5 billion cylindrical battery plant in Arizona, supported by partnerships with Hyundai and Honda, has expanded its production capacity to 67 GWh by 2026 while targeting 100% renewable energy by 2030 [9]. These cases highlight how R&D partnerships reduce technical and financial uncertainties, enabling scalable commercialization.

Challenges remain, including high upfront costs and regulatory fragmentation. However, the sector’s resilience is evident in its ability to attract private capital. Energy Vault’s 37% increase in S&P Global ESG scores and $954 million project backlog demonstrate how sustainability-focused innovation can command premium valuations [10].

The Future of LDES: A Call to Action for Investors

The strategic case for investing in LDES innovation is unambiguous. Corporate R&D partnerships are not only advancing technologies like flow batteries, thermal storage, and AI-optimized grids but also aligning with global decarbonization mandates. As the International Energy Agency notes, LDES deployment must increase from 27 GW in 2021 to 358 GW by 2030 to meet net-zero targets [11]. This requires sustained investment in partnerships that combine technical expertise, policy agility, and market foresight.

For investors, the path forward is clear: prioritize firms and consortia that demonstrate measurable impact on cost reduction, deployment rates, and carbon removal. The energy transition is no longer a distant vision—it is a present-day imperative, and LDES is its linchpin.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 19:04:08.126291

It's the latest in a series of compact affordable electric concept cars from the German automaker that also includes the ID Polo GTI and ID Every1, and it's based on an improved version of VW's Modular Electric Matrix or MEB platform called MEB +. The front-wheel-drive ID Cross concept is meant to be a preview of a production version of the car that will go on sale in Europe next summer, though no U.S. sales plans have been announced as of now.

The concept is about the same width as the current Taos and its wheelbase is only about three-inches shorter, but it is 10-inches shorter overall and rides on 21-inch wheels, giving it a significant visual presence without being overly large. Volkswagen's head of design Andreas Mindt says the ID Cross debuts a new design language for the brand, called 'Pure Positive,' which will show on all new future VWs. Mercifully, Volkswagen appears to have learned from its button-eliminating sins, since the ID Cross concept has more physical controls than the brand's current models, and four dedicated window switches.

The ID Cross may be small outside, but it focuses on maximizing interior space, style, comfort, and flexibility.The front-wheel-drive concept prioritizes urban use and versatility, and features a five-seat interior with a big trunk space and a small frunk with a very wide and airy interior. VW says the interior is designed as a 'feel-good oasis,' with the concept car's interior featuring a soothing monochromatic beige treatment that VW calls ""Vanilla Chai"" covering every surface.

As a party trick that harkens back to the legacy of the versatile Volkswagen Bus, all of the seats in the ID Cross fold forward to create a massive 'reclining area' as VW refers to it. The rear-mounted ball coupling is rated to support about 165 pounds for duos who want to sleep in their ID Cross and haul two e-bikes, or it can tow over 2,600 pounds if you don't want to sleep on its flat floor.

That puts transmission at the center of making sure we can say “yes” to these opportunities while maintaining reliability across the grid.
What are the biggest pressures on Michigan’s grid today compared to five or ten years ago?
Reliability has always been our calling card, and our customers should continue to expect the same strong performance we’ve delivered since ITC took over Michigan’s electric transmission system in 2003.
About ITC ITC Michigan is composed of two operating companies: ITCTransmission and Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC).","As Michigan stands at one of the most transformative junctures in its energy history, its electric grid faces extraordinary pressure from escalating demands — spanning data centers, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and new industrial ventures — while striving toward an ambitious target of 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

To unpack what this means for businesses, residents and Michigan’s economy, Crain’s Content Studio sat down with Brian Slocum, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at ITC Holdings Corp., the largest independent electricity transmission company in the U.S. Headquartered in Novi, ITC is central to delivering reliable power to communities and industries.

Why do you describe this as a pivotal moment for Michigan’s electric grid?

We’re seeing changes unlike anything since the introduction of home air conditioning in the 1950s and ’60s. The pace and size of demand are accelerating — whether it’s AI, data centers, electric vehicles or onshoring of industry, we need reliable energy to succeed. Load growth is happening faster and on a larger scale than ever before. That puts transmission at the center of making sure we can say “yes” to these opportunities while maintaining reliability across the grid.

What are the biggest pressures on Michigan’s grid today compared to five or ten years ago?

The sheer volume of demand is the biggest pressure. This level of demand is straining supply chains, resulting in five years or more to procure some of the equipment needed to build reliable transmission. At ITC, we’re focused on how quickly we can grow capacity without sacrificing reliability. That includes using the equipment we have on hand today to support vital economic development and working with partners like the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to identify future sites for infrastructure growth. We’re also prioritizing locations where infrastructure is already in place to support new or expanding current loads, whether for a manufacturing plant or a data center. Reliability has always been our calling card, and our customers should continue to expect the same strong performance we’ve delivered since ITC took over Michigan’s electric transmission system in 2003.

Michigan has set a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. What role does transmission play in achieving that?

Transmission is the bridge between generation and reliable use of electricity. Our engineers run studies to determine what upgrades will be required to integrate solar, wind and battery projects. Through long-range planning efforts, we look 10+ years ahead to evaluate generation goals and projected load growth. The truth is, without transmission, renewable energy can’t reach the businesses and communities that need it.

Data centers, particularly those housing artificial intelligence, are being called game-changers. How significant is this trend?

Very significant. To give context, Michigan’s average peak daily electricity demand during the summer months is around 20 gigawatts. Right now, DTE Energy alone is in advanced discussions for more than 3 gigawatts of new data center load, with another 4 gigawatts in the pipeline. Consumers Energy has also seen another gigawatt in requests, and more in the pipeline. These projects represent a massive increase in demand. AI-driven centers are especially energy-intensive — up to 10 times the computing power of traditional data centers in the same footprint. Our job is to move quickly: answer customers, assess if the system can handle it and get projects built. That’s why Michigan is in a race for these new loads to locate here, and that’s why planning and investment are so critical at this moment. Customers are looking for the speed of connection, while meeting their reliability needs.

Beyond demand, what other challenges are you most focused on — cybersecurity, weather resilience?

Both are top of mind. Since 2008, ITC has operated under strict NERC standards for cybersecurity, with a cyber operations center working alongside our control room to monitor threats. On the weather side, we’ve rebuilt and modernized infrastructure that in some cases was over a century old. That investment has already paid off. For example, during the Petoskey-to-Alpena ice storm last spring, rebuilt lines held up and our transmission system was restored within days. We’re also looking forward, studying climate impacts so we can reinforce vulnerable areas before problems occur.

What should Michigan residents and business leaders know about the state of the grid right now?

First, they should be proud. Companies are choosing Michigan because of the reliability of our grid, and that’s a real competitive advantage. Second, they should recognize that electricity powers everything we do. To keep pace with growth, we’ll need support from businesses, residents, landowners and policymakers to make the infrastructure investments required. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for economic growth, and the grid is the foundation that makes it possible.

However, the pace of growth keeps me up at night. These projects take years to build, and we need to find ways to move faster. But what gives me optimism is that Michigan is already reaping the benefits of ITC’s investments over the past 22 years. We have a strong foundation. If we keep building on that foundation — together — I believe we can meet this moment and power the state’s future.

More From Our Experts

The Trump administration is pulling back sharply on large-scale projects that demonstrate cutting-edge energy technologies. Unless Congress steps in forcefully to preserve the program which a bipartisan majority funded just four years ago, the cuts will slow the global response to climate change and hurt U.S. competitiveness in emerging energy technologies. China, meanwhile, is stepping up its investments and seeking to extend its technological lead.

Why governments should invest in demonstration projects

More on:

Energy and Climate Policy

Renewable Energy

United States

Many of the technologies that large-scale demonstration projects would advance, such as new kinds of nuclear reactors or steel mills, could ultimately pay off for society, but the risks and costs of their first iterations are usually too steep even for very risk-tolerant capitalists to take on. Government investment in demonstration projects plugs the gap left by private investors.

Scale and complexity are the roots of this problem. Large scale makes power plants and industrial facilities economical, enabling them to supply electricity and goods that are vital to society at low costs. The same features create barriers to innovation. The first full-scale nuclear reactor or steel plant of its type probably won’t run as smoothly or affordably as the older ones their builders hope to replace, even if the new ones have passed smaller-scale tests with flying colors. Moreover, potential competitors can sit back and learn from the first movers without risking a penny.

As a result, private investors frequently take a pass on staking hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars on demonstration projects. Yet the societal benefits of advancing these technologies can be large. A hefty fraction of the emissions that drive global climate change come from large-scale facilities. The innovations that could drastically reduce their emissions may have additional benefits, such as greater affordability or security. Government funding that bridges the so-called “demonstration valley of death” [PDF] can give domestic pioneers in these emerging sectors a leg up on their competitors abroad.

Gaps in the global portfolio

The United States, the European Union, and fifteen other nations responded to this challenge in September 2022 by pledging $94 billion in public funding to support large-scale demonstration projects during the current decade. This amount exceeded the $90 billion that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated [PDF] would be needed to stay on its roadmap to net-zero emissions. However, as we show in a recent analysis, “the combined effort of pledged countries is falling far short of the pledge’s goal.”

Technological progress in the global demonstration project portfolio has been uneven as well. The IEA’s net-zero scenario highlighted eleven technology areas, ranging from synthetic fuels to small modular nuclear reactors. More than 80 percent of projects and funding tracked by the IEA have flowed to only four of these eleven: biofuels; carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); offshore wind; and hydrogen production, storage, and transportation.

Energy and Climate Policy

United States

Some of the neglected areas are big contributors to climate change. For example, the steel industry, which causes 7 percent of global emissions, is the focus of only two projects. Similarly, international shipping, which causes another 3 percent, accounts for just two as well. Emissions from such sectors are not going to decline unless demonstration projects show that innovative clean technologies are technically viable and have a plausible pathway to affordability.

The United States’ Pullback

The United States committed $21.9 billion to the September 2022 pledge, comprising the entire budget of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) in the Department of Energy (DOE), which Congress had set up the year before. By the end of the Biden administration, Congress had given OCED more than $26.7 billion for large-scale projects. While some of these projects supported work in areas well-represented in the global portfolio, such as CCUS and hydrogen, others promised to fill gaps in areas like industrial decarbonization and long-duration energy storage.

The Trump administration is pulling back hard on these planned investments. In May 2025, DOE announced the cancellation of $3.7 billion awarded by OCED for industrial demonstration projects. The industries impacted included cement, fuels, chemicals, glass, and steel. The administration’s request for DOE’s fiscal year 2026 budget states that it would cancel an additional $15 billion [PDF], although the specific projects included in this proposal have not yet been identified.

The administration has also crippled DOE’s newly created capacity to manage large-scale projects. A reported 77 percent of OCED’s staff opted to leave the department voluntarily in the first few months of Trump’s term, and the office has essentially been dismantled.

OCED’s administrative record has been criticized in recent reports by DOE’s Inspector General as well as external observers. The task of overseeing billions of dollars for cutting-edge fields with very limited administrative funding, while developing project management capabilities that DOE had not previously possessed, was daunting. Some poorly designed projects were approved, and some decisions might have been rushed.

The critics have not shown that OCED made significant technical misjudgments, much less acted corruptly. Because the awards were phased, only about 3 percent of OCED’s budget has actually gone to developers, limiting the financial risk and allowing time to strengthen or drop weak projects. DOE did not provide substantial evidence, much less rigorous analysis, to back its cancellations. A review by Resources for the Future concluded that “that many of the projects that DOE canceled could have generated long-run public returns—and potential short-run financial returns...” The Energy Futures Initiative added that “canceling these awards has ripple effects. ...investors will lose faith in DOE-supported projects.”

China steps up

As the United States pulls back, China is stepping up. China already dominates key growth sectors, such as solar panels and battery manufacturing, and it is aggressively investing in emerging energy technologies. In March 2025, the central government announced 101 new demonstration projects, adding to the 47 funded last year. Iron and steel, long-duration energy storage, and the production of polysilicon (the primary material used in solar panels and semiconductors) are among the many technology areas targeted.

The United States remains engaged in some vital areas of emerging energy technologies, such as nuclear and geothermal power. The Trump administration has maintained the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, announced new initiatives to build plants at government sites, and eased licensing and permitting. China continues to invest in these areas as well. Competition between the two nations to refine and scale these technologies should accelerate innovation (although stronger international cooperation in precompetitive and non-proprietary R&D would also help).

U.S. relinquishes leadership as global gaps remain

But gaps in the global portfolio remain. Chemicals, fuels, shipping, and carbon dioxide removal are among the areas where American investment will be particularly missed. Even more important, the demise of OCED dramatically weakens the world’s capacity to identify and fill new gaps that will emerge as the economy and technology evolve in the coming decades. One of OCED’s final reports identified two dozen opportunities [PDF] that are promising now or likely to become so during this decade alone.

Over the past eighty years, federal innovation investment sparked the growth of major industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, the internet, and AI, to name a few. During the same time span, the United States frequently sought to mobilize international action to address collective problems. Congress carried forward these traditions when it created and funded OCED. Unless the administration can be persuaded to reverse course, the nation will relinquish both strands of global leadership this year.

The Fuel Cell Vehicle Market has been witnessing significant advancements, driven by innovations in hydrogen technology, infrastructure development, and supportive policies across major economies.

Breakthroughs in Hydrogen Fuel Cell Efficiency

One of the most important technological developments in recent years is the improvement in fuel cell efficiency. Traditional fuel cell systems faced challenges such as limited durability and high operating costs.

Today, manufacturers are introducing next-generation proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells that operate at lower temperatures while delivering higher efficiency. These cells require less platinum catalyst, reducing costs and enhancing performance.

Improved water and thermal management systems are also enabling better fuel cell durability, allowing vehicles to operate seamlessly in diverse climates.

According to industry analysis, these efficiency gains are directly contributing to cost reduction, one of the most critical factors influencing the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market. Automakers are now producing FCVs that match or even exceed the mileage of conventional gasoline-powered cars, making them more appealing to both individual and commercial consumers.

Lightweight Materials and Advanced Design Engineering

Fuel cell vehicles require careful engineering to balance hydrogen storage, durability, and vehicle safety. Innovations in lightweight composite materials are making a significant impact on overall design. Advanced carbon fiber tanks are now being used to store hydrogen at pressures up to 700 bar, ensuring both safety and compactness.

Automotive engineers are also focusing on aerodynamics and vehicle weight reduction to improve fuel economy. By integrating lightweight aluminium and reinforced plastics into body design, manufacturers are extending driving ranges while maintaining robust safety standards. This trend is particularly critical for commercial fleets and public transport, where range and reliability play a vital role.

Expansion of Hydrogen Refueling Infrastructure

Another major innovation is the rapid expansion and digitization of hydrogen refueling networks. While limited refueling stations have historically hindered adoption, governments and private stakeholders are investing heavily in infrastructure. Digital integration allows stations to be monitored remotely, ensuring uptime, safety, and efficient fuel distribution.

Smart refueling systems, powered by AI and IoT technologies, are emerging to optimize hydrogen delivery and usage. These intelligent networks predict demand, reduce downtime, and ensure cost efficiency for station operators. Fairfield Market Research notes that these developments are instrumental in improving consumer confidence and accelerating adoption in urban and intercity transportation systems.

Advances in Solid Oxide and Hybrid Fuel Cell Systems

While PEM fuel cells dominate the market, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and hybrid configurations are gaining attention. SOFCs can operate on various fuels beyond hydrogen, including natural gas and biogas, making them versatile for multiple applications. Hybrid fuel cell systems, which combine batteries with fuel cells, are also becoming increasingly popular. This dual approach provides flexibility by offering both long driving ranges and the ability to manage peak power demands efficiently.

Integration of AI and IoT for Performance Optimization

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are playing a transformative role in enhancing fuel cell vehicle performance. AI-powered diagnostic systems are enabling real-time monitoring of critical components, predicting potential failures, and improving maintenance schedules. IoT sensors embedded across the vehicle and hydrogen supply chain are helping optimize fuel efficiency and safety.

Role of Renewable Hydrogen Production

Hydrogen’s source has long been a point of debate. Conventional hydrogen production from natural gas generates carbon emissions, undermining the sustainability of FCVs. The latest innovation involves producing hydrogen through renewable sources, such as electrolysis powered by wind, solar, or hydropower.

Green hydrogen production technologies are scaling rapidly, making the supply chain cleaner and more sustainable. In the coming years, large-scale electrolyzer projects are expected to integrate seamlessly with hydrogen refueling infrastructure, lowering costs and boosting adoption rates.

Collaborations and Strategic Investments

The pace of innovation in the FCV sector is being accelerated by collaborations between automakers, technology providers, and governments. Leading manufacturers are entering partnerships to share research, co-develop hydrogen technologies, and expand supply chains.

Joint ventures are focusing on scaling production, cutting costs, and making FCVs more accessible to consumers worldwide.

The Road Ahead for Fuel Cell Vehicles

As the world intensifies efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, fuel cell vehicles are emerging as a critical pillar of sustainable mobility. Continuous innovations—from hydrogen production and storage to AI-driven systems and lightweight materials—are creating a favorable environment for their growth. The expansion of hydrogen infrastructure and the diversification into commercial applications will further accelerate adoption.

While challenges such as high production costs and limited infrastructure remain, ongoing research and collaborative initiatives are steadily addressing these barriers.

Autoguide reported on a patent application from the automaker’s American arm, FCA, which covers a high-performance electric drive axle with three separate power units.

Three motors on one axle is a pretty rare setup, as most automakers opt for two. FCA’s goal with the technology is to allow a greater range of speed to each drive wheel, and the system functions similarly to a two-speed transmission. The outside motors take over for the center motor at a certain speed and continue accelerating.

Stellantis claims power outputs of up to around 470 horsepower for each motor, which would mean a combined output of 1,341 horsepower. This is just a patent application, so there’s no word on how or where the axle could be used, but it’s reasonable to guess that we’ll see a souped-up version of the Dodge Charger EV at some point.

The electric axle could also make its way to a future electrified Ram truck, and it’s likely possible to incorporate two of the units for a beastly all-wheel drive setup, though each motor’s power output would probably not reach the full 470 horsepower in that sort of configuration.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's (TSLA) U.S. market share dropped to a near eight-year low in August as buyers chose electric vehicles from a growing stable of rivals over the aging lineup offered by CEO Elon Musk's company, according to data from research firm Cox Automotive shared exclusively with Reuters.

The decline highlights the threat from automakers ramping up EV incentives at a difficult time for the industry. Analysts expect an EV sales bump to continue through September in the United States, then drop when federal tax credits expire at the end of the month, raising financial pressure on Tesla and other automakers.

Tesla, which once held more than 80% of the U.S. EV market, accounted for 38% of the total EV sales in the United States in August, the first time it has fallen below the 40% mark since October 2017, when it was ramping up production of the Model 3, its first mass market car, according to early data from Cox.

While other automakers are rolling out new EVs, Tesla has turned its focus to building robotaxis and humanoid robots, delaying and cancelling plans for cheaper electric vehicle models.

Much of Tesla's trillion-dollar valuation hangs on that bet. The company's board on Friday proposed an unprecedented $1 trillion pay package for Musk that, apart from other operational milestones, is pegged to Tesla's value rising to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.

For now, Tesla's core auto business remains its money maker. Its last new model was the Cybertruck pickup that rolled out in 2023 with nothing of the success of its Model 3 midsize sedan or Model Y midsize SUV. Tesla has refreshed the Model Y, once the world's best-selling car, but the changes failed to live up to expectations, and Tesla is on track toward a second year of sales decline.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, said in an interview with Reuters.

Cox has more complete data for July, when Tesla's market share fell to 42% from 48.7% in June.

Jon Ossoff, which impacted his ability to maintain a subcommittee chairmanship, per committee rules. Shortly after Rep. Carter’s announcement, the chairman of the full House Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee, Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-KY), announced that Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) would assume the Health Subcommittee Gavel. Rep. Griffith is the former chairman of E&C’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and was chairman of E&C’s Environment Subcommittee at the time of the announcement.

Rep. Carter, a pharmacist who represents Georgia’s first Congressional district, has been a member of the E&C Committee for five terms, and has used his 30-plus-year background as an independent pharmacy owner to advocate for various health care policies, most notably pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reform. While his tenure as chairman of the Health Subcommittee was limited, he held hearings on illicit drug threats, the need for PBM reform, the US Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of over-the-counter drugs, domestic manufacturing of health care products, and the US Department of Health and Human Services’ FY2026 budget.

Rep. Griffith, who has represented Virginia’s ninth Congressional district since 2011, is an attorney who practiced law in southwestern Virginia for nearly three decades. Like Rep. Carter, he served in his state’s legislature before being elected to Congress. As chairman of the E&C Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in the 118th Congress, he held multiple hearings on health-related topics, including origins of COVID-19 and public health reforms, antimicrobial resistance, drug supply chains, physician reimbursement, preserving Medicare and Medicaid, 340B, and others.

Rep. Griffith and Rep. Carter have many shared policy goals in the health care space, which is evident from similar bills they have introduced and cosponsored, topics of hearings they have held, and remarks they have given during hearings and markups. Both Members have stressed the importance of reining in health care middlemen such as PBMs; reforming how Medicare reimburses physicians to ensure seniors have access to quality, low-cost care; supporting policies to promote innovation and domestic manufacturing; transparency; and notably, complementing the Trump Administration’s Make America Healthy Again agenda. Both Members also represent rural districts with many low-income areas, which will likely lead to a continued focus on policies supporting those populations.

A few notable health bills that Rep. Griffith has introduced could indicate areas of focus for the subcommittee.

H.R.2191 - Physician Led and Rural Access to Quality Care Act

Allows physicians to own rural hospitals that are more than 35 miles from another hospital.

H.R.4282 - Contact Lens Prescription Verification Modernization Act

Bans the use of phone calls with artificial or prerecorded voices (robocalls) as a method of verifying patients’ prescriptions. This stems from both fraud and patient safety concerns.

With Chairman Guthrie also supporting those goals and stressing a team-oriented, collaborative mindset on the committee, members of the health care industry should expect the Health Subcommittee to maintain its direction under Chairman Griffith. This direction is also likely to be influenced by the Trump Administration’s health priorities. In order to maximize the number of bills moved through the Health Subcommittee, Chairman Griffith has also indicated that he may hold night hearings.

Key Takeaways

Expect the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee’s agenda and focus to largely remain the same. Much of what drives the committee’s agenda comes from “have to” policies, such as having to extend expiring workforce and telehealth programs.

The Energy and Commerce Committee is very member-driven, meaning that its chairman as well as subcommittee chairs will continue to rely on individual member input for direction.",https://www.afslaw.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2018-05/Arent-Fox-Government-Relations_1.jpg.webp?itok=uIDwJzTU,N,,2025-09-08 20:03:14.511867

The green hydrogen industry has the potential to monetize excess capacity from wind farms and solar arrays, gathering up clean kilowatts that would otherwise go to waste. That puts the industry somewhat at odds with the current state of affairs in US energy policy. Nevertheless, new ventures continue to squeeze into the market.

Green Hydrogen And The New Tax Bill

Hydrogen is the multi-tasker of the modern era, which means that the pace of global decarbonization depends on how quickly hydrogen can shake off its carbon-loaded supply chain. The primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, with coal playing a significant but lesser part.

Non-fossil options are becoming available as new technologies emerge to extract green hydrogen from water or various bio-based resources, as well as human-made waste streams. The challenge is to bring the cost down to parity with cheap, fossil-sourced hydrogen (see lots more green H2 background here).

Cost parity has been a tough nut to crack, and the new federal tax bill didn’t make things any easier.

The Republican-controlled Senate passed a final version of the bill that wasn’t quite as bad as the initial version proposed by the Republican-controlled House, but it was bad enough. In one representative analysis, the news organization Hydrogen Insight notes that the bill “remains far less supportive than the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) ever was and is therefore unlikely to drive a similar scale of investments in US clean hydrogen production — while its impact on upstream sources of renewable energy could make it more difficult for projects to get off the ground.”

Green Hydrogen Seeks Renewable Energy

In other words, green hydrogen stakeholders are hobbled by the availability (or lack thereof) of renewable energy resources. In addition to burdensome provisions in the new tax bill, the new “American Energy Dominance” policy has also provided the President with a platform to take administrative actions against wind and solar development in the US.

However, the American Energy Dominance policy does explicitly support other forms of renewable energy, including hydropower, geothermal, and biomass. Nuclear energy has also received a big thumbs-up from the Trump administration, and the Energy Department is also moving forward with programs that support marine energy.

Though the advanced geothermal and marine options involve emerging technologies with limited application for the here and now, hydropower is a mature, available resource, and the Indiana-based global firm Cummins is taking advantage of the window. On September 3, Cummins announced that its Accelera branch has supplied a 35-megawatt electrolyzer to the UK industrial gas firm Linde to run on hydropower at its facility in Niagra Falls, New York.

“Powered by renewable hydroelectric energy, the system will generate green hydrogen to help decarbonize industrial operations and accelerate the clean energy transition in the U.S.,” Cummins explains.

Linde has been looking forward to the delivery for three years. “The new plant will be the largest electrolyzer installed by Linde globally and will more than double Linde’s green liquid hydrogen production capacity in the United States,” Linde explained in 2022. The firm cited aerospace, electronics, and manufacturing among the markets for green hydrogen, reflecting the diminished role of hydrogen fuel cells in the ground transportation sector.

Green Investors Seek Green Hydrogen

At the startup end of the scale, the Oklahoma firm Tobe Energy has leveraged the substantial oil and gas experience of its principles to develop a new low-cost electrolyzer system.

Exactly how low-cost remains to be seen, but Tobe claims that its new system can reduce operating costs by more than 50% compared to conventional systems, partly by reducing waste heat from the process. Its business model is based on turnkey, transportable electrolyzer systems for onsite use, which shaves down costly hydrogen transportation and storage expenses.

As with Cummins and Linde, Tobe identifies non-transportation markets for its green hydrogen in the near term, including steelmaking and fertilizer production. E-fuels are also in the works at some point in the future, leading to the potential for cracking into the aviation market, among others.

The latest news from Tobe cropped up on September 5, when the firm announced a $1.8 million round of seed funding. The round was spearheaded by Cortado Ventures with participation from the Scissortail and Hurricane branches of 46 VC, along with Techstars, Wavefunction VC, and a roster of angel investors.

Tobe has already laid plans for manufacturing its first 100 commercial-scale units at its plant in Oklahoma. Keep an eye out for the company’s first project, to be located at the Zeeco Advanced Research Complex in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.

If They Can’t Make It Here, They’ll Pack Up And Take It There

The clampdown on the US green hydrogen industry is too bad for the US, but there may be a silver lining for decarbonization advocates elsewhere around the globe. Earlier today, the Massachusetts green hydrogen startup Electric Hydrogen announced the acquisition of the New York hydrogen project developer Ambient Fuel, with an eye on the EU market.

Electric Hydrogen has developed a transportable electrolysis system which the company claims reduces costs by up to 60%, as well as reducing the installation timeline. The company’s hydrogen-as-a-service business model further pares down the need for a substantial upfront investment.

“Rising demand for clean hydrogen in both the U.S. and E.U. is accelerating the already fast-growing market for U.S. technology,” Electric Hydrogen explains. “Adding Ambient Fuels’ deep development expertise and portfolio of U.S. project sites will expand Electric Hydrogen’s ability to partner with customers on co-development of hydrogen projects and provide dedicated capital resources where appropriate.”

The capital end of things is supported by the leading firm Generate Capital, which has staked up to $400 million on hydrogen projects around the world. “This complementary relationship combines Electric Hydrogen’s industry leading electrolyzer technology with project financing to create attractive offerings for customers seeking the lowest levelized cost of hydrogen,” Electric Hydrogen noted in a press statement.

“Working with Electric Hydrogen, we can help solve current finance and bankability challenges and reduce LCOH, enabling more hydrogen projects to reach Final Investment Decision,” adds Scott Gosselink, Managing Director at Generate Capital.

If those FIDs don’t materialize here in the US, no worries, Electric Hydrogen is prepared to leverage RED-III, the EU’s latest Renewable Energy Directive framework, for opportunities overseas.

About That EU Green Hydrogen Market …

Despite some fits and starts, the nations of Europe continue to advocate for the growth of a robust domestic green hydrogen industry to help cut down on imports of Russian gas. Imported green hydrogen is also in play, with Canada in the running in addition to an ambitious plan to pipe it in from Egypt.

US producers may not have an opportunity to rush to supply Europe with green hydrogen, but at least firms like Electric Hydrogen can chip into the effort by supplying electrolyzers. The new RED-III framework has motivated oil and gas refiners in Europe to switch to green hydrogen, as Wood Mackenzie assessed in August.

“European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,” the firm explained.

The affected projects are located in renewable-rich states such as Rajasthan, western Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in central India, according to a document from the federal agency overseeing inter-state transmission access.

The grid access terminations were carried out in the June quarter after prior notices were issued to the companies, said the source, who requested anonymity as the firms are seeking relief from the federal power regulator, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).

India's surging power demand - driven by rising incomes, mechanised farming, industrialisation, and urbanisation - has prompted New Delhi to streamline grid rules to better integrate clean energy projects and ensure uninterrupted electricity supply for its 1.4 billion people.

The country aims to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity by 2030. However, its transmission network, spanning about 495,000 circuit kilometres, is lagging the growth in generation capacity.

The Central Transmission Utility conducted manual inspections before revoking access and will continue efforts to free up transmission lines for projects that are on track for completion, the official said.

JSW Energy appealed the revocation, but the regulator declined to grant interim relief, according to an order dated June 24, and on July 10 asked CTUIL to share its response. The petition is listed for October 7, according to orders posted on the CERC website.

Gov. Chris Christie

Christie was inaugurated as the 55th Governor of New Jersey on Jan. 19, 2010. He was re-elected with 60% of the vote in November of 2013 and served two terms.

He was a Republican candidate for President in both 2016 and 2024. Governor Christie was elected Chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2014, leading the organization to the election of 31 Republican Governors.

Christie is recognized for his leadership in advancing New Jersey’s energy and environmental resilience. Under his administration, New Jersey became a national leader in solar power, ranking second in the country for installed capacity and creating a strong framework to expand renewable energy use. He also signed the landmark Offshore Wind Development Act.

In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Christie prioritized coastal restoration and resilience projects that safeguarded communities while restoring vital natural defenses. His administration also supported energy efficiency initiatives that helped businesses and residents reduce costs and conserve resources.

Prior to his service as Governor, he was nominated by President George W. Bush and he served as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey from January 2002 to December 2008.

In 2019, he authored The New York Times best seller, “Let Me Finish,” about his life and his candidacy for President. In 2021, he authored Republican Rescue, dealing with his prescription for the future of the national GOP. In February 2024 he released his third book, “What Would Reagan Do?""

He is the Managing Member of the Christie Law Firm and Christie 55 Solutions, LLC in Morristown.

Amy Cradic

Cradic joined New Jersey Resources (NJR) in February 2018.

As Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Non-Utility Businesses, Strategy and External Affairs, she leads NJR Clean Energy Ventures, NJR Energy Services and NJR Storage & Transportation. She also oversees the company’s Corporate Strategy, Government Affairs, Communications and Sustainability functions.

Cradic has been a driving force behind NJR’s enterprise-wide sustainability strategy. This has included the establishment of an Office of Sustainability, positioning NJR at the forefront of decarbonization innovation.

As head of NJR’s renewable energy subsidiary, Clean Energy Ventures, Cradic progressed the company’s leadership role as one of the largest owner-operators in New Jersey’s solar marketplace, with over $1.2 billion invested in solar projects. Amy also oversees NJR Storage & Transportation, which owns and operates FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline and salt cavern storage facilities in Pennsylvania and Mississippi, respectively.

Before joining NJR, Cradic served the New Jersey Office of the Governor in several capacities, including as Senior Policy Advisor, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Cabinet Liaison before becoming Chief of Staff to the Governor.

Prior to that, Ms. Cradic served as Assistant Commissioner for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

Toby Hanna

Hanna spent his 33-year consulting career helping companies navigate air quality and climate change regulations.

With a solid understanding of these organizations’ business and sustainability goals, as well as the goals of the state and federal agencies involved, Hanna was known for his ability to negotiate favorably in support of hundreds of companies in New Jersey, the U.S. and abroad.

Here in New Jersey, he worked hard to make regulation and policy manageable for the regulated community, having a hand in nearly all of the current air quality, environmental justice, and greenhouse gas regulations.

Hanna, a three-time cancer survivor, has served on New Jersey’s Clean Air Council for over 25 years, representing the New Jersey Society of Professional Engineers under gubernatorial appointment. He spent 25 years at ERM, a global Environmental, Health & Safety, and Sustainability consultancy, building and leading ERM’s 300+ consultant global practice for air quality and climate change services.

Gov. Tom Kean

Thomas Howard Kean served two terms as governor of New Jersey from January 1982 to January 1990.

The state’s 48th governor, he is a descendant of its very first constitutional governor, William Livingston, who was elected by the first state Legislature in August 1776.

As a former teacher, education policy was of special importance for the governor. Following the report “A Nation At Risk,” which warned of the growing threat the United States faced if the quality of education continued to decline, Kean began an even greater effort for education reform.

On the national level, Kean also was named chairman of the Education Commission of the States, a forum that allowed governors, legislators, educators and others to discuss and evaluate programs across the country. He was succeeded as chairman by then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, with whom Kean would develop a lasting friendship.

Kean’s environmental record was highlighted by his aggressive push for legislation to protect freshwater wetlands and create a buffer zone adjoining the wetlands new construction could not take place.

Employing a tactic of Governor Byrne’s in the battle to preserve the Pinelands, the Governor issued an executive order imposing a moratorium on the granting of permits in wetlands areas, thus exerting great pressure on the Legislature to take action on the pending bill.

Kean also faced repeated incidents of toxic waste spills, including a 50-mile-long slick of medical waste that washed up on the Jersey shore in the height of the summer beach season in August 1987 and the discovery of high levels of dioxin in the Ironbound section of Newark.

With the federal EV tax credit set to expire on September 30, 2025, consumers and investors face a critical decision: act now or risk missing a window of unprecedented financial incentives and market momentum. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) tax credits—offering up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models—are being accelerated out of existence by President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), signed in July 2025 [1]. This abrupt policy shift has created a surge in demand, with July 2025 EV sales hitting 130,082 units—a record for the year [2].

The Electrify Expo: A Catalyst for Urgency

The Electrify Expo 2025, held in Chicago from September 13–14, has become a linchpin in this high-stakes environment. By aligning its timing with the tax credit deadline, the event has amplified urgency for consumers to experience EVs firsthand. At the expo, Lucid, Tesla, and Rivian showcased their flagship models, each leveraging the platform to drive adoption:

- Lucid debuted public demos of its Gravity SUV, its first Midwest appearance, drawing over 3,000 visitors to a recent New York event and securing 75% of Gravity orders from new customers [3].

- Tesla highlighted its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and Model Y Robotaxi, reinforcing its dominance in innovation while capitalizing on price cuts that boosted July sales [4].

- Rivian displayed its R1T and R1S, paired with a $6,000 incentive for upgrades, directly countering the tax credit’s impending phase-out [5].

The expo’s ""Electrify Weekender"" program, which allows attendees to take home a Tesla for a weekend test drive, further reduces barriers to adoption. According to a report by Skillfusion, such initiatives contributed to a 11% year-over-year surge in U.S. EV sales in Q1 2025 [6].

The Tax Credit Cliff: A Race Against Time

The IRS’s recent clarification that a binding contract with a payment made by September 30 qualifies for the tax credit—even if delivery occurs afterward—has added nuance to the deadline [1]. However, state registration deadlines and automaker production timelines create ambiguity. For example, Lucid’s Gravity SUV, which saw 58% year-over-year delivery growth in Q1 2025 [3], may face delays for buyers in states with October registration cycles.

Investors must also consider automakers’ responses to the tax credit’s expiration. Lucid has announced a $7,500 rebate for the Gravity SUV to offset the loss of incentives [7], while Rivian’s promotional offers signal a strategic pivot to retain market share. Tesla, despite a 12.6% Q2 2025 U.S. sales dip, remains the category leader, outselling the next ten brands combined [8].

The Investment Case: Why Timing is Everything

The convergence of policy shifts, consumer behavior, and corporate strategy creates a compelling case for immediate action. Here’s why:

1. Short-Term Surge in Demand: With 300,000 new EVs sold in Q1 2025 alone [6], the market is primed for a pre-deadline rush. Automakers like Lucid and Rivian are scaling production to meet this demand, with Lucid reporting an 83% year-over-year increase in Q2 2025 production [3].

2. Price Competitiveness: Post-September 30, EVs will lose their $7,500 tax credit discount. Companies offering rebates (e.g., Lucid’s $7,500) or incentives (e.g., Rivian’s $6,000) are effectively bridging this gap, but such offers may not persist indefinitely.

3. Supply Chain Resilience: The tax credit’s expiration has already caused uncertainty in battery manufacturing. Investors should prioritize companies with robust domestic supply chains, such as Tesla’s Gigafactories or Rivian’s partnerships with battery suppliers.

Conclusion: Seize the Window

The Electrify Expo 2025 and the looming tax credit expiration have created a perfect storm of urgency and opportunity. For investors, the message is clear: act before September 30 to capitalize on discounted EV purchases and the market’s pre-deadline momentum. Lucid, Tesla, and Rivian are each navigating this transition with strategic rebates, innovations, and promotional offers—but the window for tax-advantaged purchases is rapidly closing.

Fast deployment of renewable energy is the United States’ best option to respond to this dilemma.
Despite regulatory headwinds, renewable energy remains the cheapest and quickest source of new power, on track to deliver 93 percent of power buildout this year.
Euclid serves as a single source of truth for renewable energy teams, transforming scattered project documentation into actionable intelligence.
Since its launch, Euclid has onboarded more than 12 gigawatts of solar and storage capacity and supported over $10 billion in renewable energy investments.","Euclid Power, an operating system for renewable energy project development, financing, and operations, announced a $20 million Series A round led by Venrock, with participation from HSBC Asset Management and existing investors including Spero Ventures, Toba Capital, Designer Fund, and Commonweal Ventures.

The funding comes as surging energy demand from AI strains an already stressed grid, while new federal compliance rules threaten to slow the deployment of renewables needed to meet this demand. Euclid’s platform and services suite give renewable energy teams the clarity, speed, and control they need to keep projects moving.

Founded in 2021 by energy industry insiders Jacob Sandry, Ryan Guay, and Brian DeMaio, Euclid is already embedded in more than 1,000 solar and storage projects across the United States, helping developers, investors, and asset owners cut diligence and transaction timelines from months to days. Clients including UBS, Catalyze, and Apollo Global Management rely on Euclid to identify risks early, maintain audit-ready documentation, and close deals faster — without sacrificing precision.

The United States is facing an unprecedented power crisis. Fueled by the rapid buildout of AI data centers, resurgent manufacturing, and transportation electrification, U.S. electricity demand is estimated to grow 25 percent by 2030 — and utilities are left scrambling to find enough power to supply that already strained grid.

Fast deployment of renewable energy is the United States’ best option to respond to this dilemma. Despite regulatory headwinds, renewable energy remains the cheapest and quickest source of new power, on track to deliver 93 percent of power buildout this year. Euclid fuels this growth. As the industry’s leading operating system, Euclid empowers renewable energy teams to move projects forward faster and fill the widening gap between capacity and demand.

This new capital will accelerate Euclid’s AI-enabled workflows, expand its product suite, and strengthen its services team to meet the market’s demand for speed at scale.

Euclid serves as a single source of truth for renewable energy teams, transforming scattered project documentation into actionable intelligence. Its AI engine automatically tags documents, extracts key data points — cost lines, deadlines, risk indicators, and more — and collates them into a single, up-to-date source of project information. Euclid’s disciplined workflows and strategic guidance refined more than 1,000 projects, helping identify critical opportunities and risks when they matter most.

Since its launch, Euclid has onboarded more than 12 gigawatts of solar and storage capacity and supported over $10 billion in renewable energy investments. Clients use Euclid to cut transaction timelines by as much as 60 percent, stay ahead of regulatory requirements, and manage portfolios with confidence. Euclid doubled its enterprise client list in just the first quarter of this year, and will continue to help renewable energy teams develop more projects faster in response to rising demand for power.

KEY QUOTES:

“Euclid has transformed our ability to execute deals. What once took weeks of manual document chasing now happens in days — accurately, transparently, and with the right people aligned from the start.”

Stephen Owen, Senior Vice President at Catalyze

“With this round, we’re scaling to meet the urgency of the clean energy transition. Our customers are navigating regulatory friction and market uncertainty every day to supply power that people desperately need. We help them move through that complexity faster, with the precision their projects demand.”

Jacob Sandry, CEO of Euclid

“What makes Euclid exciting is how their team has transformed renewable energy project management. In a market where developers face increasingly complex compliance requirements, customers actively prefer paying Euclid to handle critical workflows rather than just accessing tools. The Euclid team brings decades of experience in the industry, with a vision to unlock gigawatts of new energy resources by fundamentally changing how deals get done.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/09/Euclid-Power-Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 15:04:20.373505

Currently, India has about 44GW of renewable projects pending firm power supply agreements.
Oyster Renewable Energy noted that the lower tax rate would enable developers to renegotiate with utilities for more competitive tariffs, potentially freeing up projects.
This move is expected to bolster India's renewable energy sector, which has recently surpassed 100GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.
""India reduces GST on renewable energy components to 5%"" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.","The Indian government has reduced the goods and services tax (GST) on solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and wind turbine generators from 12% to 5%.

This move is expected to decrease the capital cost for solar and wind power projects by approximately 5% and accelerate the country's transition to renewable energy, reported Reuters, citing industry experts.

The tax cut is part of a broader initiative to reduce taxes on hundreds of consumer items and is aligned with India's goal to expand its non-fossil fuel capacity to 500GW by 2030.

Currently, India has about 44GW of renewable projects pending firm power supply agreements.

ICRA senior vice-president and group head Girishkumar Kadam emphasised that “the tax cut for solar PV modules and wind turbine generators is expected to reduce the capital cost for solar and wind power projects by about 5%.”

This reduction in costs is, however, likely to put pressure on existing project developers to offer more competitive tariffs.

Projects awarded before the tax cut may need to renegotiate existing power supply contracts to reflect the new rates.

However, the tax change also introduces “a few short-term challenges,” according to EY India tax and new energy partner Saurabh Agarwal.

Oyster Renewable Energy noted that the lower tax rate would enable developers to renegotiate with utilities for more competitive tariffs, potentially freeing up projects.

For developers who have not yet procured equipment, it is expected that they will pass on the tax benefits to consumers through reduced tariffs.

Those who have already paid the higher rate can maintain their current tariff agreements by providing relevant documentation to the federal regulator, explained Hexa Climate Solutions founder and executive chairman Sanjeev Aggarwal.

Waaree Energies, a solar equipment manufacturer, has confirmed that it will pass on the benefits of the tax reduction to its customers.

This move is expected to bolster India's renewable energy sector, which has recently surpassed 100GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

Where do you think all that energy in those precious fossil fuels comes from initially? The sun, that’s where. Old Sol injects the Earth’s flora and fauna with the building blocks of life. When these life forms die and become fossilized, they take the elements with them.

Why not get your energy directly from the source? Solar panels make so much sense. Getting your power from fossil fuels is like getting your protein from meat rather than directly from plants in the ground. That’s inefficient and expensive.

So are fossil fuels. Solar is much cheaper than methane gas. There are no solar plants and the fuel is free. Methane gas plants have to purchase their fuel. Coal, of course, is way more expensive than everything.

And that’s just through the grid. Imagine every all-electric building having its own solar power source. After some initial expense, you have no utility bills.

Go solar.

Hershey’s claims require clarity

Tony Hershey, perhaps it’s time to take a break from your weekly claims of persecution by local government. You’ve served on the Aspen and Glenwood Springs city councils. You currently sit on the Garfield County Library Board and work as an assistant district attorney. Yet you continually portray yourself as a victim of the very “deep state” you are deeply embedded in.

In your most recent letter, you accused the city of lying to smear your ethics and character and to intimidate you into silence. You described their sworn affidavits and legal filings to the Secretary of State as “slanderous.” As an attorney, you surely know that to prove slander, the statements must be false, communicated to a third party, stated as fact, and demonstrably damaging.

If you truly believe the city has defamed you by knowingly false court filings, that is not just unethical — it could be criminal. Your boss, District Attorney Ben Sollars, would be obligated to investigate potential perjury. At the very least, you should pursue civil action to defend your reputation. Failing to do so raises questions about the strength of your claims.

On the other hand, if the allegations made by Mr. Williams are accurate — that you disclosed privileged information about ongoing legal cases involving minors, including names, locations, and investigative methods — then you and Mr. Sollars owe the public a serious explanation.

This community deserves clarity. Either these allegations are false and legally actionable, or they’re true and require accountability. If no investigation is launched, no lawsuit filed, and no response offered, then the Colorado Bar Association should indeed review these matters and determine whether you should continue to serve the public in a position of legal trust.

Now is the time to clear the air — or take responsibility.

The recycle/compost dilemma

I think our society is getting the wrong idea when it comes to recycling. Is it a good thing? Absolutely, especially compared to dumping it in the landfill. But many of us have questioned whether the items we put in our recycling bins actually get recycled. After it leaves our curb and leaves the valley, what truly happens to it? There have been some investigative reports that say it never gets recycled. We don’t know for sure.

By no means am I saying that we shouldn’t continue recycling and composting, but we can do better. Especially our local restaurants that have converted to compostable and recyclable containers to serve their food in. Understandable for to-go orders, but if the customer is going to sit down in your establishment and dine in, they should get real plates and silverware that can be washed and reused. Yes, this will cost the restaurant owner more, but it is the right thing to do. And I would be willing to bet that most people in our valley would be willing to pay a little more to help take care of our planet.

This goes for us at home as well. Don’t use throwaway items just because it is easier. Keeping things in-house is the best way to help preserve our natural surroundings. If everyone does their part, we can make a difference.

Immigrants and workers deserve support

I am proud of my town, Carbondale, folks in the Roaring Fork Valley, and the state of Colorado, who showed up for Labor Day rallies to support our workers. I hope everyone will contact their elected officials whenever issues arise that affect workers.

These include immigrants, who are vital to our community, state, and national economies. Trump and his administration are attacking these workers, who help make America great by harvesting our crops, maintaining our landscaping, caring for our children, keeping our homes clean, and preparing our food in restaurants. The list goes on and on. We should be grateful for and respect them.

Like many others, I am the granddaughter of immigrants who came to America to seek a better life for their families, especially their children. Is it fair to deny these hardworking people the opportunities that many of us had?

In addition to supporting our immigrants, we should stand up against the massive firings of our federal workers — from the EPA, FEMA, CDC and other agencies — who keep our country safe. They have been replaced with workers, some at top levels of our federal government, who are not qualified to oversee the departments and agencies they lead. How does this make us greater or safer?

Not only are individuals traumatized by deportations and dismissals, so are their families and communities. If you think it can’t happen here, it already has.

Previously, these groups were excluded from claiming clean energy tax credits because they didn’t owe federal income tax.
While Elective Pay provides a one-time federal tax refund after installation, the long-term energy savings are where the true value lies.
To assist organizations in navigating the Elective Pay process, the Michigan Infrastructure Office’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) offers no-cost support.
Kris Brady, director of TAC, has been leading TAC’s effort to help Michigan nonprofits navigate Elective Pay since October 2023.","Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and a federal program called Elective Pay, the Humane Society of Huron Valley (HSHV) has taken a major step toward financial sustainability and environmental responsibility. The Superior Township-based nonprofit recently completed the installation of 474 rooftop solar panels — an initiative that is already reducing operational costs and enabling the organization to reinvest more deeply in animal welfare and community programs.

HSHV Chief Financial Officer Jonathon Trevathan first learned about Elective Pay in 2022. Elective Pay, established through IRA, was designed to make federal clean energy incentives accessible to nonprofits, tribal governments, municipalities, schools, and other tax-exempt organizations. Previously, these groups were excluded from claiming clean energy tax credits because they didn’t owe federal income tax. Now, under Elective Pay, they can receive up to 30% of their eligible clean energy project costs as a cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These incentives are activated by the installation of qualifying clean energy technologies, including solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicle charging stations, and geothermal systems.

Trevathan and his colleagues at HSHV seized the opportunity they saw in the program. HSHV’s solar panels, installed by Ann Arbor-based Homeland Solar, were up and running in under two weeks — a process Trevathan describes as “seamless.” More importantly, the financial impact was immediate. While Elective Pay provides a one-time federal tax refund after installation, the long-term energy savings are where the true value lies.

Over the next 25 years, HSHV is projected to save approximately $850,000 on energy costs. That money can now be directed toward critical services such as grief counseling, pet ownership education, emergency sheltering, foster care, and veterinary treatment. For HSHV, the transition to solar is more than a sustainability win — it’s a strategic investment in HSHV’s mission.

But for Trevathan, one initiative holds particular importance: keeping pets in loving homes during times of financial hardship.

“We’ve got a Bountiful Bowls program where you can come and collect food a couple times a month to help feed your animals,” he says. “If you love this animal, and this animal loves you, let’s keep it in your family. Having $850,000 more can really allow us to be generous in that way.”

Trevathan says the benefits of the Elective Pay program extend far beyond this one project. He says he would “absolutely” encourage other nonprofits to look into the program.

“Even without the [tax] credits, I think it largely makes sense,” he says.

To assist organizations in navigating the Elective Pay process, the Michigan Infrastructure Office’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) offers no-cost support. Through a combination of informational webinars, one-on-one consulting, and accounting guidance, the TAC helps applicants — many of whom are working through the refund process for the first time — to successfully access Elective Pay benefits.

Kris Brady, director of TAC, has been leading TAC’s effort to help Michigan nonprofits navigate Elective Pay since October 2023. Her mission goes beyond paperwork; it’s about making sure organizations know this resource exists and understand how to use it.

“We’ve been out and about, explaining that this program is available through the tax refund process with the IRS,” Brady says. “A lot of the time eligible folks for Elective Pay are nonprofits and they’ve never filed taxes and think a tax refund is not something they would be eligible for. There is a lot of public outreach to get folks to understand that if they’ve done one of these projects, they could get a refund of a portion of what they invested.”

Still, changes are on the horizon. According to Brady, the recently passed federal budget reconciliation bill has affected the Elective Pay program by tightening implementation timelines and removing some incentives altogether. However, she emphasizes that nonprofits still have another 10 months to take advantage of Elective Pay incentives.

“My best advice for folks that are planning projects is to reach out to the Technical Assistance Center,” she says. “We encourage these clean energy transition projects to continue. It’s important to realize that Michigan did not abandon its Healthy Climate goals and we are striving to meet those even though some of these tools might be changing.”

Among TAC’s newest initiatives is the Elective Pay Ambassador Program, a community-based effort that places trained ambassadors with organizations across Michigan to support clean energy project planning. TAC also offers the Unlocking Elective Pay Challenge, a competitive grant opportunity.

“We are all still dedicated to the mission and we will make it work one way or another,” Brady says.",https://d3ggs9wi9hwg8r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/08125623/Huron-Valley-Humane-Society-Jonathan-Trevathan-Mast-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:05:31.317575

A powerful shift is on the horizon, and drivers will soon see the difference as the next wave of cars hits the road.

The automaker is bringing its motorsports and performance operations under one roof with the launch of Ford Racing, a new division created on 4 September.

The move will unite race cars, road cars, customer experiences and global branding in a single business, designed to inject cutting-edge racing technology directly into everyday vehicles.

Ford Racing will be based in Dearborn, Michigan, where teams once split between production and motorsports will now collaborate more closely.

Executives said the shake-up will boost profits and create a powerful “halo effect” around the brand, connecting the thrill of the racetrack to what ends up in dealerships.

“We’re building this as a major business within Ford Motor Co.,” Will Ford, general manager of Ford Racing Global, told the Detroit Free Press.

“It’s a commitment to racing and finding the product opportunities that arise from those racing efforts in an all-encompassing way, to an extent we’ve never really done before.”

Return to F1

The timing comes as Ford ramps up for a return to Formula One and prepares to compete at world-famous races from Le Mans to the Baja 1,000.

Lessons learned on those grueling circuits will feed straight into models like the Mustang GTD and the Raptor pickup.

Ford also confirmed that the revamped division will expand into new areas, including merchandise and customer experiences, ensuring the Ford Racing name becomes a visible part of its global brand.

“The team will be focused on winning on the track and creating performance across the lineup,” Ford told the Detroit Free Press.

he added that racing technology will “trickle down to the entire family of Ford products.”

With rivals circling the off-road and performance markets, Ford’s rebrand signals an aggressive push to keep the Blue Oval at the front of the pack.

Ford's leaked plans

Drivers are all revved up over the potential return of a beloved old Ford model after a mysterious trademark filing.

The auto giant announced last month that the brand is going ""back to its roots"" by making cars more affordable as the company develops a new electric vehicle platform.

Then speculation began swirling in early August, when Ford filed a request to trademark the word Ranchero.

Ranchero was a car-based pickup sold from the 1950s through the 1970s, which was popular for its pickup-like bed on a station wagon platform.

In Ford's new filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office, the Ranchero name is trademarked when referring to pick-up trucks, electric cars, and electric vehicles.

Now, Ford fans are convinced the brand's highly anticipated new pickup will be called a Ranchero.

However, there will be one key difference in the model from 75 years ago with the one expected in 2027: it'll be much more modern.

Instead of the fan-favorite fuel system that drivers might be used to, the new Ford pickup will be an electric vehicle.

Ford is investing billions of dollars in a new EV platform in an attempt to compete with China's output.

CEO Jim Farley said last month that the plan to switch gears to electric is a ""risky bet,"" but that he believes it'll pay off.

Ford is set to debut a new EV mid-size pickup truck that will start at around $30,000, Farley said.

The four-door vehicle will be built entirely in the United States and will be available in 2027.

Farley said the plan is ""the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.""

Part of the reason why the Ranchero was so popular was that it had the comfort of a car but the usefulness of a truck.

It was discontinued in 1979 for reasons including declining sales and stricter government regulations.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have been shown to both increase soil organic carbon (SOC) inputs and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGnet).","A study using multiple agronomic models to examine two long-term agricultural research stations in North America shows that so-called climate-smart agricultural practices – like no-till treatments, cover-crop utilization and residue retention – can help promote carbon sequestration in soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The findings show that using a combination of models – rather than just one – can provide a more realistic range of outcomes and can highlight the shortcomings of individual models.

“We targeted open-source data from long-term agricultural experiments in Michigan and Texas that are very different – with different climates, soils and crops grown,” said Debjani Sihi, the senior author of a paper describing the research and a member of NC State’s Plant Sciences Initiative. “By utilizing these long-term studies, we wanted to see what the future might look like in terms of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.

“We examined three different models developed by different research groups and looked at them collectively,” said Sihi, an assistant professor with joint appointments in NC State’s Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. “The architecture is a little different in these models. What can we learn from each of the models, and what is the collective information?”

The study examined data from more than three decades at the two agricultural experimental sites and calibrated it into a “model ensemble” to make future predictions. The ensemble examined both individual climate-smart agricultural practices and practices that were “stacked,” or added to each other.

The researchers then examined whether these proposed practices would, in the next 25 years or so, generate carbon sequestration in soil and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in two different scenarios: a baseline scenario that replicated climate-change historical data of the past three decades, and a “worst-case” scenario that envisions dramatic growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

“We tried to capture a variety of biological processes related to soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) emission while also accounting for climate-change effects,” Sihi said. “These processes are driven by different climate variables like temperature and precipitation.”

The model ensemble showed some positive effects in both studied locations under the baseline scenario.

“At the Michigan site, we found that no-till farming and keeping crop residues on the field increased soil carbon sequestration, while using no-till farming, some cover crops, and reducing fertilizer decreased greenhouse gas emissions,” Sihi said. “At the Texas site, most of the farming practices we tried increased soil carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions stayed about the same. However, the models indicated that not plowing alone could reverse greenhouse gas emissions.”

The worst-case scenario, however, lived up to its name in the study.

“We also found that all the climate-smart farming practices performed worse under worst-case scenario climate change, which was expected,” Sihi said.

She added that the study could provide the impetus for other researchers to try out the model ensemble approach and improve it. Future studies could be improved by using real-world data from on-farm studies and selecting other models with different strengths to broaden the insights.

“We hope others will evaluate these climate-smart practices to learn which may be more important, and what kind of experiments that we can leverage,” Sihi said. “These are two long-term examples in Michigan and Texas that we have utilized, so that others could adopt and improve and build on it.

“In this context, utilizing no-till or cover crops as a base practice and then stacking residue retention reduced future net emissions. Future work would need more study in other parts of the country – or world – to better generalize effects.”

Abstract: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts are underway to mitigate climate change worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have been shown to both increase soil organic carbon (SOC) inputs and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGnet). We evaluated the GHGnet of several management practices with three biogeochemical models (APSIM, Daycent, and RothC) at two sites with contrasting soils, climates, and cropping systems. Additionally, two future climate scenarios (baseline and high-emissions) provided alternative outcomes of SOC, N2O, and CH4 by 2050. In Michigan, most biochar and residue retention with no-till treatments increased SOC stocks; leguminous cover crops, no-till, and reducing fertilizer input lowered N2O emissions. The lowest biochar treatment lowered GHGnet in the baseline climate scenario, but all other management treatments increased GHGnet under both baseline and high emissions, and all management scenarios increased a mean of 8.0 Mg CO2-equivalent GHG (CO2e) ha?1 from baseline to high emissions. Conversely, in Texas, most treatments increased SOC, and N2O was relatively constant. Every no-till treatment reversed GHGnet in both the baseline and high-emissions climate scenarios but all management scenarios increased a mean of 0.6 Mg CO2e ha?1 under high emissions. At both sites under high-emissions climate change, cover crops and no-till resulted in the lowest GHGnet overall. Overall, the study showed that no-till, especially with residue retention, and cover crops are important CSA practices to lower the GHGnet of agriculture, but there remains much room to find even more effective solutions to adapt to climate change.",https://cals.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mksihimodel1500-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 15:06:33.038648

OLYMPIA, Wash. – The Washington State Department of Commerce delivered $41.1 million to 49 Clean Energy Community Grants awards in 22 counties this year. The grants will support projects such as rooftop solar, battery storage, decarbonization efforts, electric vehicle (EV) charging, and feasibility studies.

The awards were made this spring and summer, and many awardees now have their projects under contract. The funding aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while delivering meaningful benefits to tribes, overburdened communities and vulnerable populations in Washington. They were funded by the Climate Commitment Act (CCA).

“As the Trump Administration steps back from our clean energy economy, we’re stepping up,” said Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson. “Washington will continue to be a leader in making investments in the future. We’re supporting clean energy, good-paying jobs and community resiliency.”

By reducing their carbon emissions, awardees may also be able to invest more resources in the communities they serve. That’s the hope for the Latino Educational Training Institute, which received $50,000 for a solar and battery storage feasibility study at its community center in Everett during the second round of awards.

“This project will help LETI’s mission to build a sustainable, resilient community hub that supports immigrant wealth-building, job creation, and opportunity in South Everett’s Latino community,” said Marisol Bejarano, LETI’s director of health and wellness programs. “It’s a step toward long-term economic empowerment, environmental sustainability, and a more equitable future for our community.”

It also means cost savings, as is anticipated in the Easton School District in Kittitas County. Easton School District Superintendent Aaron Kombol said the $411,000 awarded for a solar array will save the district an estimated 15-20% on its electrical needs. The savings will let them reinvest in the district’s students.

“We are very excited to have been awarded this grant,” Kombol said. “Not only will the district be able to reduce its ongoing utility bills, but we will also be able to incorporate solar panel system technology into our STEM classes.” The array will allow them to maximize utility cost savings and use those savings to offer more opportunities for students, he said.

Commerce awards CCA funding based on the state’s commitment to helping communities improve their resilience, reduce carbon emissions, and increase equitable access to clean technology. It was administered through Commerce’s Clean Energy Community Grant program. The first round was announced last spring, while the final awards were made in the spring and summer.

“We’re putting this money back into communities who need it,” said Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn. “Our goal is to reduce carbon emissions, and the people who know best how to do that are the people receiving these critical investments.”

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects.
The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

There have been a lot of headlines and spirited debate around recently passed federal legislation to expire federal tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs).

The good news is that regardless of your stance, even without federal incentives, EVs can save money for state and local government fleets in Arizona.

Recent data released by Arizona PIRG Education Fund, The Nature Conservancy Arizona, and Frontier Group found that Arizona can realize savings of more than $100 million over the next decade – $44 million of that for Arizona state agencies – by replacing retiring light-duty trucks, SUVs and vans in Arizona’s state and local government fleets with comparable EVs.

Consider the following:

State and local governments in Arizona own thousands of vehicles

State and local governments in Arizona own more than 100,000 vehicles, with more than 7,500 in the state fleet alone. Most of Arizona’s fleet vehicles – from sedans to pickup trucks to construction vehicles – are internal combustion engine vehicles that use gasoline or diesel, which are costly to fuel and to maintain.

EV models offer options to get the job done

EVs are more efficient and cheaper to fuel and maintain than traditional vehicles – and are often just as capable. EVs can travel much farther on a charge than those that were available just a few years ago. And there are also more choices than ever before, with more than 100 models of light-duty and larger EVs currently available and on our roads, including pickup trucks and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles such as electric buses, cargo vans, freight trucks and garbage trucks.

EVs improve air and health

In addition to saving money for taxpayers, the recent research found by driving EVs instead of gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles over the next decade, Arizona state and local governments could save more than 1 million barrels of oil; cut emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds by 103,000 pounds and 496,000 pounds, respectively; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 387,000 tons (carbon dioxide equivalent), the same amount as produced by 81,000 typical cars in a year. Of those reductions, 98,000 tons could come from electrifying the state fleet alone.

Clearly, EVs provide a big opportunity for Arizona to save money for taxpayers and to reduce air pollution. To tap that promise, Arizona governments should follow this roadmap: make bold commitments and stick with them, showing the resolve of the state and local governments to save taxpayers money by electrifying vehicles; develop a detailed fleet electrification plan to set purchasing priorities and guide investments in charging infrastructure; take full advantage of incentives offered by APS, SRP, and TEP, including technical assistance programs that offer an analysis of the current fleet and opportunities and options to transition to EVs; and share expertise and pool resources across state and local governments.

While Arizonans do not agree on everything, the vast majority of us can agree that spending our tax dollars more wisely and in a manner that contributes to improved air quality and public health is a worthwhile endeavor.",https://arizonadigitalfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Diane-Brown.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:04:14.840720

DTE Energy, a major player in the U.S. energy sector, faces mounting legal and environmental risks as its subsidiary, EES Coke Battery, contends with a partial summary judgment ruling from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over Clean Air Act violations. This case is not merely a legal dispute but a microcosm of broader systemic challenges in aligning corporate practices with the demands of a decarbonizing economy.

The EES Coke Battery Case: A Legal and Environmental Flashpoint

According to a report by Planet Detroit, the trial court granted the EPA’s motion for partial summary judgment on August 25, 2025, ruling that EES Coke Battery violated the Clean Air Act by emitting excessive sulfur dioxide and failing to comply with new source review (NSR) requirements [2]. The court also rejected DTE Energy’s argument that it should not be held liable for the actions of its subsidiary, a decision that underscores the growing legal precedent for parent-subsidiary accountability in environmental matters [1].

The environmental implications of these violations are stark. Sulfur dioxide emissions from EES Coke Battery contribute to respiratory illnesses and acid rain, disproportionately affecting nearby communities [2]. The EPA’s trial brief, which includes requests for civil penalties, highlights the agency’s renewed focus on enforcing air quality standards amid a regulatory landscape shaped by the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda [1].

Regulatory Risk in the Energy Transition Era

The EES Coke Battery case must be understood within the context of shifting regulatory priorities. Since 2020, the EPA has oscillated between enforcement and leniency. A 2025 study by Environmental Data Governance notes that the agency’s enforcement efforts declined sharply during the pandemic, with 40% fewer emissions tests conducted in early 2020 compared to 2019 [1]. However, recent actions—such as the EPA’s repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule and its push for stricter greenhouse gas standards—signal a return to proactive regulation [3].

This regulatory ambiguity creates significant uncertainty for energy companies. For instance, the SEC’s climate-related disclosure rules, though temporarily stayed, compel firms to consider how climate risks affect their financial performance [2]. Parent companies like DTE Energy must now navigate overlapping frameworks, including the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which mandate supply chain transparency and climate transition plans [1]. These requirements extend liability beyond a company’s direct operations, forcing firms to scrutinize subsidiaries for compliance with increasingly stringent standards.

The Financial and Reputational Stakes

DTE Energy’s inability to predict the financial implications of the EES Coke Battery case reflects the broader volatility of corporate liability in the energy transition. A trial for remedies, including potential penalties, is scheduled for September 15, 2025, with DTE planning to appeal the court’s decision [1]. Even if the company succeeds in overturning the ruling, the reputational damage from prolonged litigation could erode investor confidence.

The financial risks are compounded by the EPA’s enforcement patterns. Research from ScienceDirect indicates that EPA actions can indirectly drive corporate green innovation, as firms seek to avoid penalties by adopting cleaner technologies [1]. For DTE, this means either investing in costly retrofits for EES Coke Battery or facing escalating fines and operational restrictions. Either path could strain profitability, particularly as the energy sector shifts toward renewables.

A Broader Trend: Parent-Subsidiary Liability and Global Standards

The EES Coke Battery case also illustrates a global trend toward stricter parent-subsidiary liability. The CSRD and CSDDD, for example, require companies to assess environmental and human rights risks across their entire value chains, including subsidiaries [1]. This aligns with the court’s rejection of DTE’s argument that it is not responsible for EES Coke’s actions. Such rulings are likely to become more common as regulators and courts recognize the systemic risks posed by opaque corporate hierarchies.

Meanwhile, the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Inventory of U.S. Emissions provide granular data on corporate pollution, enabling more precise enforcement [2]. For investors, this transparency is a double-edged sword: it reduces information asymmetry but also increases the likelihood of penalties for non-compliance.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The EES Coke Battery case is a harbinger of the challenges facing energy companies in the 21st century. As regulatory frameworks evolve to address climate change and social equity, firms must balance short-term compliance costs with long-term sustainability. For DTE Energy, the path forward will require not only legal strategy but also a recommitment to environmental stewardship. Investors, in turn, must weigh the financial risks of litigation and penalties against the reputational and operational costs of inaction.

New England needs homegrown offshore wind energy to keep the lights on and our electricity affordable.""","Critics over the weekend heaped scorn on the US Department of Energy after it made demonstrably false claims about renewable energy.

In a post on X late last week, the Department of Energy (DOE) argued that ""wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing,"" even though batteries allow the storage of energy from both sources that can be used long after its initial generation.

The post drew immediate ridicule from social media users who expressed astonishment that the people running America's energy policy seem to be woefully ignorant about renewable energy storage.

""We are governed by some of the dumbest people in the history of this country, proudly, unashamedly, openly moronic and ignorant, and I am genuinely not sure how the US ever recovers from this,"" commented Zeteo editor-in-chief Medhi Hassan. ""These people make George W. Bush and Sarah Palin look like savants.""

The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom sarcastically tried to educate the president's team about how energy storage works.

""We're excited for the Trump administration to learn about BATTERIES (we have them here in California, and they've helped the Golden State shift to green, clean energy AND keep the lights on),"" they wrote.

Alex Stapp, the cofounder of the Institute for Progress, also touted California's embrace of renewable energy, and he pointed out that batteries on a given day provide more than a quarter of all energy in the state at peak hours.

Fossil fuel industry watchdog Oil PAC Tracker argued that this kind of ignorant rhetoric about renewable energy was part of a pattern from US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is the former CEO of onshore oilfield services company Liberty Energy.

""Secretary Wright should be fired for lying to American people,"" they wrote. ""He profits off this kind of misinformation because he is a fossil fuel executive. Killing clean energy deployment also hurts our economy, makes electricity expensive and increases our power sector emissions.""

Meteorologist Matthew Cappucci also leveled the administration for pushing misinformation about renewable energy.

""The fact that such an obviously false and, frankly, asinine tweet was just issued by a federal government account is an insult to the American people,"" he argued. ""Renewables could make up the majority of our energy in a multi-layered system with better energy storage if we actually tried.""

The DOE's post came at a time when the Trump administration is shutting down wind and solar power projects across the country and when American's energy bills are rising due in part to increased demands being placed on the electric grid by artificial intelligence data centers.

A report released earlier this month by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis declared that Trump's energy agenda ""will fail... unless the White House stops issuing stop-work orders for offshore wind.""

The report further added that ""renewable energy and dispatchable storage are the only option for adding significant amounts of new generation capacity to the US grid for at least the next five years,"" while also detailing that there are simply no short-term alternatives for rapidly building up capacity.

Susan Muller, a senior energy analyst, similarly took aim late last month at the administration's order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of New England, which she argued would have provided fast relief to people in the region struggling to pay their utility bills.

""This stop-work order from the Trump administration is a lose-lose for pretty much everyone except fossil gas corporations,"" she said. ""Stopping the project could not only cost thousands of jobs and ratepayers real money but have life or death consequences if we lose power in the middle of a cold snap.

The company also said it is also exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority to recycle the utility’s spent fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA. According to Oklo, the collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel using modern electrochemical processes.

Curio details: According to Curio, NuCycle is the first nuclear fuel recycling technology designed from the ground up with safeguards and proliferation-hardening integrated into its process to be tested and validated at the lab scale.

At ORNL, Curio demonstrated its voloxidation techniques, which the company said offer unprecedented efficiency and scalability in decladding spent fuel. During testing, more than 99.75 percent of the fuel was released from its zircaloy cladding, according to Curio. Under the DOE’s GAIN voucher program, ORNL completed criticality safety assessments of Curio’s next-generation equipment designs with no safety constraints identified, the company added.

The pulverized product from the decladding process was then shipped to PNNL, which validated Curio’s fluorination circuit. The decontamination process yielded enrichment-ready uranium hexafluoride at some of the purest levels ever recorded from a single-stage process, according to the company. Working with PNNL, Curio said it scaled the chemical process from milligram-level experiments to 100 grams, proving both its viability and scalability.

INL, meanwhile, provided Curio data on its electrolysis process for recycling fuel, in which a molten-salt bath was used to separate actinides. By systematically varying temperature and concentration, researchers were able to study the fundamental redox chemistry that will enable co-extraction of plutonium with uranium and minor actinides in a proliferation-hardened manner, the company said.

Data from these lab-scale experiments are now informing Curio’s work with Sandia to develop a comprehensive safeguards and security model. This collaboration will conduct iterative material control and accounting analysis, using the experimental results to create a nuclear fuel recycling process that is safeguarded by design.

Curio intends to complete its lab-scale demonstration with actual spent nuclear fuel at INL and is actively exploring a first pilot with the DOE.

Quotables: “Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo cofounder and CEO. “By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power.”

Curio CEO Ed McGinnis noted, “We are moving at a pace the industry has never seen to deliver a fundamentally new, safeguarded-by-design platform that will redefine the economics and security of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. These unprecedented results demonstrate the strength of public–private collaboration in advancing sustainable nuclear solutions.”",https://www.ans.org/file/21524/l/Fuel_Recycling_Render_PR.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:05:42.640522

Hitachi Energy will build a $457 million transformer production facility in South Boston, Virginia, and make more than $500 million in other investments to meet the growing need for U.S. grid equipment, the company, state officials and the Trump administration announced Thursday.

The investment comes as lead times for utilities to procure transformers have stretched from weeks to years, as grid expansion and a shortage of manufacturing capacity have created a bottleneck. In particular, large transformers like the ones Hitachi will make in Virginia can now take up to three years from order to delivery, experts say.

“Bringing production of large power transformers to the U.S. is critical to building a strong domestic supply chain for the U.S. economy and reducing production bottlenecks, which is essential as demand for these transformers across the economy is surging,” Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy, said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

“Power transformers are a linchpin technology for a robust and reliable electric grid and winning the AI race,” Schierenbeck said.

The U.S. grid now faces rapid load increases following decades of stagnant growth. Data centers could be the source of 44% of U.S. electricity load growth from 2023 to 2028, Bain & Co. estimated in October. They could potentially consume 9% of domestic electricity generation by 2030 — double the amount consumed today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Electrification of transportation and buildings, and an industrial expansion, are also creating demand for electricity and a need to expand the power grid.

“Particularly at this critical moment for our growing energy demands, I’m excited to see Hitachi Energy expand their Virginia footprint,” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement.

The company already owns a transformer production facility in South Boston. And in March, it announced a $250 million investment to expand global production of critical components for electrical transformers, including enhancing production capacity at the company’s factories in Virginia, Missouri, and Mississippi.

Construction on the new facility will begin before the end of this year, and it “should be operational by 2028. We won’t be at full production right away, but will ramp up fairly quickly,” Kurt Steinert, Hitachi head of external communications, North America, said in an email.

The details of the Virginia production capacity expansion are commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed, he said. But other projects in the $1 billion investment include:

$106 million for the company’s transformer components facility in Alamo, Tennessee.

$22.5 million for a capacity expansion at Hitachi Energy’s dry-type transformer factory in Bland, Virginia, and a new supporting facility in Atkins, Virginia.

$70 million for the expansion of high-voltage components production facilities in and around Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania.

And other projects that Hitachi expects to announce later this year.

Extended timelines to procure grid equipment have led to delays in connecting new demand. The President’s National Infrastructure Advisory Council last year recommended the federal government should establish a “strategic virtual reserve” of electric transformers to ensure challenges surrounding U.S. manufacturing of the critical grid components do not slow electrification efforts.

Hitachi Energy said the planned investments are aligned with the Trump administration’s AI action plan. “The United States must develop a comprehensive strategy to enhance and expand the power grid,” that plan concluded.

“If we are going to win the AI race, reindustrialize, and keep the lights on, America is going to need a lot more reliable energy,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement. He praised Hitachi’s investment and said the Trump administration “looks forward to continuing to partner with private industry to ensure the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy and thousands of high-paying jobs.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Qw0YPanqFpyt_nHG0dNYhh82jnC7XmudqIJOqQdsuks/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9oaXRhY2hpLWVuZXJneS1zb3V0aC1ib3N0b24tZmFjdG9yeS0yMDI1LmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2025-09-08 14:05:40.928377

Following a significant leadership change in early 2025, the company replaced top production staff including CEO and COO, implementing urgent operational improvements that dramatically enhanced recovery efficiency.

Secured $115 million through convertible notes at 5.5% coupon rate, attracting institutional investors including funds managing $10-30 billion, with approximately 45% from long-term oriented funds rather than typical hedge fund converts.

Acquired the Tacubaya project adjacent to flagship Alta Mesa, adding significant uranium resources while identifying new productive sands through enhanced data analysis of thousands of existing drill holes.

Maintains America's only two operational ISR plants while developing South Dakota project (Fast-41 designated) and exploring approximately 20 advanced exploration projects across the US, positioning for industry consolidation opportunities.

William Sheriff, Executive Chairman of enCore Energy, embodies the urgency driving America's leading in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium producer through a period of operational transformation and strategic expansion. With uranium demand surging globally and supply constraints tightening, enCore's position as one of the few actual producers has become increasingly valuable in a market where execution trumps promises.

The company's journey through 2025 illustrates both the challenges and opportunities facing uranium producers in an environment where regulatory complexity, talent shortages, and capital requirements create significant barriers to entry while rewarding those who can deliver consistent production.

Operational Excellence Through Crisis Management

enCore's transformation began with a management crisis that could have derailed the company but instead became a catalyst for operational excellence. In early 2025, the company made difficult but necessary leadership changes, removing the CEO, COO, and lead plant manager due to concerns about operational urgency.

Sheriff explained that while former CEO Paul Goranson was instrumental in building the plants and achieving initial production, the company needed different leadership for the next phase of growth.

The results of this management overhaul have been dramatic. The company reduced average well completion times from over seven days to just 1.3 days, a metric Sheriff considers ""rather profound"" because it directly correlates to production capacity. This improvement came through internal promotions rather than external hiring, demonstrating the strength of enCore's existing talent bench.

""Our production rate on a daily basis has gone, depending on what time frame you're measuring it against, from up 200% to up 300%.""

The Drilling Revolution

Central to enCore's production surge is an aggressive drilling program that has expanded from 12-14 rigs to 29 currently operating, with plans to reach 32 by October 2025. This expansion reflects both the rapid recovery characteristics of South Texas uranium deposits and the company's newfound operational discipline.

""In order to up your production you've got to get more wells in the ground, right? More wells, more fluid flow, more uranium going through the plant, higher recovery, higher daily production rate.""

The company has also become more selective with drilling contractors, purchasing several rigs on lease-back arrangements while maintaining the flexibility to dismiss underperforming contractors.

This operational discipline extends to understanding decline curves, or what Sheriff prefers to call ""recovery curves."" The rapid recovery characteristics of ISR operations accelerate cash flow but require constant drilling ahead of production to maintain output levels.

Strategic Financing and Institutional Validation

Perhaps the most significant development for enCore has been its successful $115 million convertible note financing, completed at terms rarely seen in the uranium sector. The 5.5% coupon rate on unsecured notes represents ""financing that we've not seen before,"" according to Sheriff, who compared it favourably to federal government rates.

The financing structure attracted an entirely new class of institutional investors to enCore's shareholder base. During more than 20 discussions with major institutions, Sheriff engaged with funds managing $10-30 billion, with one fund exceeding $100 billion in AUM.

""Roughly 40, 45, 50% of ours were done with long holds,"" Sheriff noted, contrasting this with typical convertible note structures dominated by hedge funds that immediately short the underlying stock. The proof came in market behaviour, with only 12% short interest compared to the typical 20-25% seen with hedge fund-dominated convertibles.

This institutional validation opens doors beyond immediate capital needs. ""It introduced us to an entirely new level of investor,"" Sheriff emphasized, describing how the financing created relationships with generalist funds that represent ""the biggest box of cash out there.""

Interview with William M. Sheriff, Executive Chairman, enCore Energy

Resource Base Expansion

enCore's acquisition strategy focuses on extending the productive life of existing operations while building a pipeline for future growth. The company recently completed acquisition of the Tacubaya project, immediately adjacent and down-dip from the flagship Alta Mesa operation.

""Over 200 property owners. It's taken over two years to get them all lined up. It’s very difficult to get consensus among three people, much less 200.""

The Tacubaya acquisition provides critical geological continuity, as Sheriff explained: ""Mother nature doesn't have north south straight lines or any other direction straight lines. So clearly it was a property boundary,"" referring to how their resource maps had previously terminated at artificial property boundaries rather than geological boundaries.

Equally important is the company's enhanced data analysis of existing resources. With thousands of drill holes at Alta Mesa, enCore has identified new productive trends by analyzing data on a more granular basis, looking at specific geological horizons rather than broad ore zones.

""We've taken each sandstone separately and looked at what are the cutoff grades, and we're seeing new trends emerge within that giant body of data.""

This approach has already yielded ""wellfield 3 extension"" and identified three additional areas with potential for development.

Fast-Track Permitting and Development Pipeline

enCore's South Dakota project received Fast-41 designation from the federal government, a significant milestone that provides timeline certainty while imposing performance obligations on the company.

""It gives you a much more certain and much more acceptable timeline to get through all of your filing. It puts a burden on the company to meet their timelines because it's completely transparent.""

This designation reflects the company's established track record with regulators.

""We're established. We have a track record and that gives them some certainty of counterparty reliability.""

The development pipeline extends beyond individual projects to a broader acquisition strategy. enCore has identified approximately 20 exploration and advanced projects in the US, budgeting to successfully acquire four or five of these properties.

The Investment Thesis for enCore Energy

Operational Leadership: Proven ability to rapidly scale uranium production through operational excellence, demonstrated by 200-300% production increases following management changes and systematic drilling optimization

Institutional Validation: Successfully attracted $115 million from top-tier institutional investors at favorable terms (5.5% convertible notes), validating business model and providing capital for strategic growth

Resource Expansion: Strategic acquisitions like Tacubaya extend productive life while enhanced data analysis unlocks additional value from existing assets, creating multiple avenues for organic growth

Regulatory Advantages: Established track record with regulators provides Fast-41 designation benefits and permitting certainty that competitors lack, reducing execution risk for future projects

Consolidation Catalyst: As one of few actual uranium producers, enCore is positioned to lead industry consolidation while benefiting from supply scarcity that penalizes failed execution by competitors

Market Timing: Operating leverage to uranium prices through existing production while maintaining delivery flexibility and avoiding the forward-sale risks that plague development-stage competitors

The uranium market is experiencing a fundamental shift from speculative development stories to operational execution, creating significant value differentiation between producers and project companies. enCore Energy represents the beneficiary of this transition, with institutional capital increasingly recognizing that uranium production requires specialized expertise, regulatory relationships, and operational discipline that few companies possess.

The company's rapid production scaling demonstrates the inherent leverage available to successful ISR operators, where improvements in drilling efficiency and well field management translate directly into production increases and cash flow acceleration. This operational leverage, combined with the company's expanding resource base and institutional backing, positions enCore to capitalize on uranium market fundamentals while maintaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions.

With uranium demand surging globally and few new producers successfully reaching commercial production, enCore's established operations and growth pipeline provide sustained competitive advantages in an increasingly supply-constrained market.

TL;DR

enCore Energy has transformed from operational crisis to production leadership through management changes and drilling optimization, achieving 200-300% production increases while securing $115 million in institutional financing at favorable terms. The company's proven ISR operations, expanding resource base, and strategic acquisition pipeline position it as a consolidation catalyst in a supply-constrained uranium market where execution capabilities create sustainable competitive advantages over development-stage competitors.

Dive Brief:

Sodium-ion battery manufacturer Natron Energy has ceased operations, according to its website, halting plans for a giant factory in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

The Santa Clara, California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment about what happened. The Raleigh News & Observer reported that Natron had unresolved funding issues, and investor Sherwood Partners is expected to sell the assets.

This comes about a year after the battery maker said it would build a gigafactory in northeastern North Carolina with an investment of $1.4 billion, creating more than 1,000 jobs for the area.

Dive Insight:

Beyond the company’s plans for North Carolina, Natron operated two U.S. battery facilities. In a letter dated Aug. 28, the company informed Michigan officials that it would permanently close its facilities in Holland, Michigan, and Santa Clara, California, on Sept. 3, affecting 95 employees across both states.

Prior to the closure, Natron was seeking out capital from new and existing investors, as well as new purchase orders that would have resulted in future revenue, the company said in its letter. However, on Aug. 27, its board of directors determined Natron’s efforts were unsuccessful, sparking the layoffs and ultimate shuttering of the company.

Established in 2012, Natron designed its batteries for a range of customers in the industrial power space, including for data centers, electric vehicle charging, telecommunications and more.

Unlike competing batteries made of lithium-acid or lithium-ion, Natron’s sodium-ion batteries did not require expensive materials such as lithium, cobalt or nickel, according to Natron’s website.They also had a stronger battery life due to its Prussian blue electrode structure, the company said.

The 1.2 million-square-foot plant would have produced 14 gigawatts of sodium-ion batteries in North Carolina, expanding Natron’s production 40 times over. The Michigan location began operations in April 2024.

Typically, companies provide a 60-day notice prior to plant closures. Following this rule would have required Natron to disrupt operations and harm its chances of securing funding from investors and customers, the company said in its letter. Sherwood Partners did not immediately respond to request for comment.

“Accordingly, Natron is providing this notice…as soon as practicable,” wrote Elizabeth Shober, Natron’s head of team and talent.

The closure is the latest among companies looking to manufacture batteries outside of Asia. In June, Oregon-based Powin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and, more recently, sold its assets to FlexGen Power Systems. Sweden-based Northvolt also filed for bankruptcy earlier this year in its home country, citing rising capital costs, geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions.

SPR (SolarPanelRecycling.com) is tripling its solar recycling capacity in North Carolina, adding a 50,000-sq-ft processing plant and a fourth advanced recycling technology to its Salisbury headquarters. The expansion boosts throughput at the site from 500,000 to 1.5 million panels per year, on top of another 1 million panel capacity already in operation at facilities in Texas and Georgia.

The announcement comes as demand for utility-scale decommissioning rises and states such as North Carolina prepare to enforce new recycling mandates. Beginning November 1, 2025, projects over 2 MW in the state must submit decommissioning plans, secure financial assurances for recycling, and meet environmental recovery standards. SPR says its expanded campus and in-house compliance team are designed to give asset owners both the scale and regulatory expertise to meet these obligations.

Fourth technology enhances purity of recovered materials

This latest investment includes the introduction of thermal separation processing, SPR’s fourth distinct recycling method. Earlier this year, the company became the first in the nation to bring bifacial panel recycling to utility scale, complementing two other separation techniques already in use. By combining multiple approaches, SPR says it can maximize recovery rates and deliver higher-quality commodity outputs across a wide variety of panel types.

“We are not storing panels or output for future ideas,” said Brett C. Henderson, CEO of SPR. “Our customers know that we are recycling at scale right now, with verifiable consumers of our clean outputs.”

Industry support for scale and compliance

Utility-scale decommissioning firms welcomed the move. “Our asset owners are facing increasing obligations to responsibly manage end-of-life panels,” said Justin Wright, executive vice president of RCI Energy Services. “SPR’s advanced recycling technology and increased capacity give us confidence that we can meet these requirements cost-effectively while supporting the broader shift to a cleaner, more resilient grid.”

SPR currently operates the largest distributed network of owned and operated solar recycling plants in the U.S., with additional sites planned for 2026. The company emphasizes that scaling its geographic footprint also cuts transportation costs and emissions—two often-overlooked factors in the lifecycle of utility-scale solar projects.

Proponents envision a future where attorneys and law schools nationwide become as well-versed in Texas business law as they are today in Delaware’s.
In the meantime, firms are ramping up their securities practices, with some devoting entire teams to Texas corporate governance.","In Ernest Hemingway’s debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, one character asks another how he went bankrupt. The man answers: “Two ways…Gradually and then suddenly.” The authors of a new Texas law hope they’ve engineered a similar progression for the state’s business supremacy. Senate Bill 29, passed earlier this year, aims to leverage Texas’ economic and judicial infrastructure to create an unparalleled business environment—one that appears to be accelerating slowly at first, and then all at once.

The state has long fostered an environment ideal for entrepreneurs and corporations, thanks to its low cost of living, relaxed regulatory climate, growing population, and a mindset that balances independence with hospitality. Now, lawmakers are providing additional legal consistency for companies incorporated in Texas. The new law builds on other recent developments—such as the creation of a local stock exchange and a business court system.

In the closing weeks of the 2025 legislative session, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB29, codifying a business judgment rule that protects directors from liability for decisions made in good faith. The bill also allows Texas companies to set trial venues and waive jury trials for internal entity claims, ensuring experienced judges rule on complex business matters. In essence, it protects boards and corporations from unmerited shareholder lawsuits following significant decisions, like mergers or acquisitions, and offers a consistent legal framework businesses can rely on.

Chris Babcock and Chris Converse, Dallas-based securities law partners at Foley & Lardner, helped write the legislation and shepherd it through the Capitol. They aren’t regular lobbyists, but they dove into the legislative process when they saw a timely opportunity: the emergence of Texas business courts and growing corporate dissatisfaction with Delaware’s chancery system.

“We saw an opportunity with the advent of the business courts to marry them with an innovation of our Texas corporate code,” Converse says. “To attract companies to incorporate in a jurisdiction, you need a clear set of rules—and a specialized expert or a business court.”

SB29 also raises the threshold for shareholders to challenge decisions made in good faith by a public company’s board. Instead of allowing a single shareholder to file a suit, companies can now require that no less than 3 percent of shareholders must join together to bring a corporate governance claim. The goal: to reduce frivolous litigation and foster a more predictable legal environment.

Corporate concerns about questionable shareholder lawsuits are well-founded. A report analyzing securities suits filed between 2018 and 2020 found that a single individual ranked second—after the SEC—in total lawsuits brought. During that period, Shiva Stein filed 124 securities claims, more than even the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency tasked with regulating financial markets. These are not class actions but individual suits, often alleging inaccurate disclosures after mergers. The new law aims to shield companies from repeat lawsuits brought by so-called rogue shareholders working with law firms that may be more focused on quick payouts than governance concerns.

“Corporate decision-making should be controlled by shareholders and their elected boards—not by third-party activists who hijack the mechanisms of corporate governance for their own enrichment,” Babcock says.

The hope is that this will lead to what some are calling “Dexit”: a migration of incorporations from Delaware to Texas. The legislation seeks to capitalize on inconsistent Delaware chancery court rulings and the launch of Texas business courts to encourage companies to rethink where they incorporate—or to consider Texas when going public. Supporters also believe the law will boost relocations and stimulate broader economic growth.

“If a board acts in good faith and uses its best judgment to make a decision, that shouldn’t be scrutinized—unless there’s clear misconduct,” says Brad Foster, a securities partner at Haynes Boone. “We’ve got great companies and great boards, and they have a right to exercise their judgment without fear of constant second-guessing. That’s not the way to run a company.”

Delaware isn’t conceding easily. In March, its legislature passed a law limiting average stockholders’ rights and protecting controlling shareholders and directors from certain liabilities.

Time will tell if Delaware’s reforms are enough to stem an exodus. But if SB29 delivers on its promise, what could that mean for Texas’ securities law industry? Proponents envision a future where attorneys and law schools nationwide become as well-versed in Texas business law as they are today in Delaware’s. Currently, any serious corporate firm or law school course catalog includes Delaware law. SB29 could put Texas on that same footing.

In the meantime, firms are ramping up their securities practices, with some devoting entire teams to Texas corporate governance. The business community hopes that incorporations and relocations will grow gradually—then suddenly.

“There’s already a broad base of lawyers familiar with both Texas and Delaware law, and we’re here and open for business to assist companies,” says Matt Fry, Dallas-based co-chair of Haynes Boone’s capital markets and securities practice. “But the real goal is to get companies to move their operations, personnel, and headquarters to the state of Texas.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/capitol-building-senate.webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:10:04.361944

It’s a large brown and tan shorebird with long legs and a curved beak it uses to dig into the sand and mud for food.

And there are wind turbines—176 of them to be exact—being built about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach to produce 2.6 gigawatts of electricity.

As the whimbrel flies south for the winter, and humanity seeks the clean energy that could stave off the worst consequences of climate change, researchers in Virginia are seeking to answer a question: Can the whimbrel and turbines in its flight path coexist peacefully?

“We need to know a lot more about how the birds are moving out over that open water,” said Alex Wilke, a coastal scientist with The Nature Conservancy. “How might this additional infrastructure—these offshore wind energy projects—impact them?”

The Nature Conservancy, Dominion Energy and the William and Mary Center for Conservation Biology are working to answer the question by studying the whimbrel’s interaction or avoidance with the utility’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, expected to be the largest offshore wind project in the country once it comes online in 2026.

The conservation group has used funding from Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, for research that found about 42 percent of all whimbrel will fly over the wind energy area designated for the utility’s offshore wind project, and a smaller one further south, off the coast of North Carolina. The new research is finding that, on their north and southbound journeys, a handful of the 31 tracked birds have come into contact with the area within the turbines’ spinning blades.

“Anytime you put a hazard in the airspace that birds use, there’s a chance that birds will fly into it. We see that all the time,” said Bryan Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology. “They fly into transmission lines, they fly into towers. Yes, there’s a chance that birds have hit (the turbines).”

The goal of the research is to attain more specific data on the whimbrel’s flight patterns that will help guide policy decisions around future offshore wind projects. Environmental and ratepayer groups see the project as a way to provide massive amounts of electricity cheaply, even as President Donald Trump has moved to block offshore wind projects in Rhode Island and Maryland.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has instructed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to review how wind projects may be harming the bald eagle. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs have also already increased the CVOW project’s initial $9.8 billion cost by $500 million, and could further increase costs to $11.2 billion-to-$11.3 billion through 2026 if the duties remain.

Despite those challenges, Dominion is continuing with the project, which is intended to satisfy a requirement under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the state’s decarbonization law, and researchers haven’t recorded any whimbrel deaths thus far.

“Offshore is a lot different than onshore,” said Matt Overton, a biological consultant at Dominion. “It’s really still developing.”

The Whimbrel

The whimbrel is among hundreds of millions of birds, from 200 different species, that travel down the Western Atlantic Flyway as part of a migration to the top of the Amazon rainforest in South America. The journey begins at their summer home in the subarctic and arctic regions of Canada and northeastern Alaska.

A member of the curlew family, the whimbrel will stop on the Delmarva Peninsula as it makes its way south. Many congregate on the southern portions of the peninsula, on the eastern shore of Virginia, in the early fall and again in the spring when they fly back north for summer.

“They’re using our marshes for roosting. Sometimes they’re on the beaches,” said Wilke. “They’re using this kind of mosaic of different habitats out in the system.”

With their elongated and curved beak, the Whimbrel will burrow into marshes and mud flats along shorelines for fiddler crab feedings. The bird will increase their body mass by 50 percent over their period of recharging, Watts said.

“They’re in the air for five or six days without stopping,” said Watts. “The Delmarva Bay is a critical staging area for them.”

The reliance on the land for their livelihood, which is considered to be at a tipping point, emphasizes the importance of maintaining the ecosystem, particularly in the face of climate change, Wilke explained. The Eastern Shore’s barrier islands, including Paramore Island, serve to weaken the Atlantic Ocean’s tide strengths before it reaches the shore and causes erosion and flooding.

Between the island and the shore are the swaths of marshland that are intertwined with channels that feed the grasses where the whimbrel feed. While the Nature Conservancy has some land into conservation areas to maintain the area’s ecological features, sea level rise is expected to turn about 3,800 acres of beach and dune features and barrier islands into open water by 2080, according to Virginia’s Coastal Resilience Master Plan.

The whimbrel needs protected undisturbed areas, clean water, good prey and good food sources, Wilke said. “If any one thing breaks down or goes away or is really negatively impacted at any one of those points, it can really impact the survival of that species and that bird,” he said. “These staging areas are just so important.”

The Wind Turbines

In a somewhat awkward irony, the whimbrel could benefit from CVOW’s emissions reductions over the long haul but could face more immediate harms from the turbines.

Government officials had studied the CVOW’s 112,000-acre wind energy area before identifying it as available in 2012. An analysis by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ultimately found that the areas “would not adversely affect” birds listed under the Endangered Species Act, including the Roseate Tern and the Piping Plover. A further analysis found that another endangered species, the Bermuda petrel or cahow, “may seasonally occur in the vicinity of the Virginia” wind energy area.

Wilke lauded that the area had been chosen as the site for Dominion’s offshore wind project, in part because of its distance from the shore, away from many birds that fly closer to the coast. If built about 50 miles further east, the turbines would have had to float, which is more costly than driving the monopiles about 100 feet deep and then another 100 feet into the sea floor.

“Dominion has acted as a responsible actor in placing the turbine field where they have. They considered all of the available information on how to minimize bird impacts,” said Watts. “Whenever you place these things, you’re always making some type of compromise. I think they made the best compromises that they could in siting the location.”

Even though “the lease site was set years ago,” Watts said, “that doesn’t mean there aren’t things to be learned so that site placements can be improved … in the future.”

Watts and Wilke had been studying the whimbrel for years, in part because the species uses the Western Atlantic Flyway for both their spring and fall migrations. They are good to track because they’re also big enough to carry trackers, which at first were connected via satellite. Now, the birds are tracked using cell service that is able to monitor their flight patterns more frequently.

“It’s really quite amazing that you can do that and then sit back at your computer and basically watch where these birds are going and what they’re doing,” said Wilke.

To apply the tags, the researchers used fishing line to make carpet like nets with loops and place them on mudflats the whimbrels frequent. When one stepped into the loop, it became trapped and the researchers emerged from their hidden marsh covering to grab the bird.

“You zip over there because sometimes they can get free. And then you tag them and then let them go,” said Wilke. “Or, in some places, it depends on where we are, they can be really sensitive to the heat. We would actually take them to the boat ramp, which was pretty close, and we’d process them in an air conditioned vehicle to help them not overheat.”

While many of the birds are not flying over the wind energy area, instead staying closer to the shore, another update to the technology now being used is crucial for a measurement, which is called tracking the altitude, or flight height.

That flight height is used to determine if the whimbrels are flying within what is called the rotor swept zone, which begins at a center point about 482 feet above the average sea level mark. The zone is what is included within the area the blades rotate around, each of which has a 782-foot diameter.

Of the tagged birds, the percentage of whimbrels expected to be exposed to the windfarm’s swept zone on southbound flights is 6.8 percent. For the northbound trips in the spring, research indicates 4.7 percent of whimbrels would be exposed to the windfarm’s sweptzone.

Overton said the turbines have cameras and he was pleasantly “not surprised” that there hadn’t been observed deaths, though Watts acknowledged there may have been deaths among birds that weren’t tracked.

What’s next is to understand the population of birds using the staging area and how much of a risk comes from placing a certain wind farm in a certain location. If a certain amount of the bird population could be lost, that could inform how much compensation or mitigation needs to occur to make up for potential damages, Watts said.

Other measures, like painting the turbines a dark color, could make them stand out, though their whitish color is chosen to make them less visible to beachgoers. The turbines are already equipped with blinking lights for aircraft that may be flying in the area.

When the project is complete and all 176 turbines are lined up next to each other, they could act as more of a visual deterrent.

“We’re going to be in a pause period here for a while, but in the long term, these green energies are going to move forward,” said Watts. “They make the most sense for the planet. Ultimately, I think they’ll make the most sense economically.”

Once various offshore wind projects are up and running, it’s worth continuing the research, Wilke said, to see how any altered flight patterns might affect birds by causing them to expend more energy to fly around the turbines, or not.

“We’ve got these tagged birds in the system that are still collecting data, and they were out there before this project was built, during the project, and hopefully after,” said Wilke. “With the young ones, it’s possible that we could have the chance to see some of the same birds after the project is fully operational, which would be phenomenal.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CVOW-Offshore-Wind-Turbines-Edits-4-27-21-180-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:08:59.013434

Growing opposition in rural Louisiana has included attempts to pass parish-wide moratoriums on carbon capture and demands that residents or local governments be allowed to vote on whether to allow the technology, among other grassroots initiatives.

Those are ""a direct result"" of a lack of communication from companies, said Dustin Davidson, the new secretary of Louisiana's energy and natural resources agency.

""I can tell you that a lot of the moratoriums we're seeing from different parishes is a direct result of not knowing who these operators are and not knowing who the people are who are coming in and setting up their seismic surveys or their drilling rigs, not knowing what's going on,"" Davidson said on the final day of a three-day industry conference on carbon capture at LSU on Friday.

""There has to be direct communication with the parish,"" he said.

Davidson, whose agency is the state's chief regulator of carbon capture projects, added that residents and leaders in rural Louisiana need to be able to put ""a face to a name"" and have someone to whom they can ask questions.

He added that the opposition is an indication that ""we have a public engagement problem that we really need to address.""

Industry and state economic policy officials as well as scientists in LSU's geology and petroleum engineering disciplines see carbon capture as one of the most readily available ways to decarbonize Louisiana's major industries, which have intensive greenhouse gas emissions.

They argue the technology remains safe, well suited to the state's geology and keeps Louisiana industries competitive in a decarbonizing global market.

'A key strategy'

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, explained at the conference that demand for low carbon energy sources and production methods, like carbon capture, was being driven by the increased use of Louisiana's energy and chemical production for foreign export.

Companies are trying to find ways to reduce the emissions of those products in a cost-competitive way to meet global demand and their own internal goals for low carbon products, regardless of political winds in the United States, Upton added.

""Of course, carbon sequestration is a key strategy that could be used to reduce emissions intensity of products,"" he said.

Davidson said that part of the message local officials need to hear is that carbon dioxide storage brings in businesses looking to make more competitive exports.

But fears about what decades of stored carbon could do to groundwater — critical for drinking water and agriculture in rural Louisiana — and worries over the risk of CO2 pipeline leaks has sparked grassroots opposition in Republican and typically pro-oil-and-gas sectors of the state.

The opposition has spurred continuing legislative and local attempts to block or restrict the technology and become a campaign issue for U.S. Senate candidate and State Treasurer John Fleming.

In 2022, Livingston Parish adopted a moratorium over a proposed carbon capture field under Lake Maurepas and another planned under timberland and country estates near Holden, only to see a court block the law due to the state's authority in permitting the projects.

Early last month, Allen Parish withdrew its own carbon capture permitting regime after ExxonMobil sued in federal court in July, arguing state primacy in permitting trumped the local permitting rules.

Late last month, the Iberia Parish Council considered a moratorium until the parish's attorney warned the law wasn't on its side.

'Cooperation is more critical'

While state officials, university scientists and industry executives participated in the high-level talk about better presenting carbon capture Friday, officials at DENR were grappling with new legislative pushback over a CO2 pipeline project in southwestern Louisiana.

A letter signed by 32 legislators asked DENR on Wednesday to delay a hearing planned Tuesday to decide whether to grant Low Carbon Logistics CCS Transport's pipeline certificates that would have allowed the ExxonMobil subsidiary to expropriate land for the pipeline corridor.

The land takings, which require fair market value payment, are another flashpoint for opponents of carbon capture.

The legislators wrote that new state rules, which would make getting those expropriation rights tougher, were adopted in the most recent session and take effect Oct. 1, less than a month after the now canceled hearing.

This pipeline also wasn't legislatively granted a waiver to the new rules as a project in St. James Parish has been, the letter added. The legislators said the public needs more time to gather information and comment and couldn't do so before the Tuesday hearing.

""We are in a moment where cooperation is more critical than temporary success,"" the letter said. ""Our citizens and our culture are in some places fractured due to the uncertainty brought on by these projects and by the threats to property rights that actions like these might bring about.""

State Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, and state Sen. Valarie Hodges, R-Denham Springs, were the first two names on the list of signatories.

On Friday, DENR issued a statement that the ExxonMobil subsidiary was withdrawing the application and also defended its public notice of the hearing.

The agency statement explained that the now scuttled hearing wasn't to permit the pipeline but would have served as an evidentiary hearing to verify procedural steps, including that the line had end users, and so followed different, more limited public notice requirements.

The line west of Lake Charles would have linked a methanol plant to an existing CO2 line owned by Denbury, another ExxonMobil subsidiary. The line would have carried the plant's CO2 to Texas, both to a permanent storage site and to an enhanced oil recovery field.

An ExxonMobil spokeswoman said the company asked for the cancellation ""to allow more time to review the route with potential stakeholders.""

""We’re following Louisiana’s pipeline approval process, sharing information with relevant parties and engaging landowners transparently.

While drivers may be pleased about the relatively low gas prices, those working in the industry might not.

Gasoline prices in Michigan dropped from a week ago, on average to $3.18 a gallon for regular unleaded, down from $3.30 a gallon. But before rejoicing, consider what might be a kind of gas price dilemma.

This dilemma highlights conflicting goals and challenges that fuel prices raise, as well as different perspectives on energy policy. While drivers may be pleased about the relatively low gas prices, those who work in the industry may not.

Both affect the economy.

Gas prices affect transportation costs, travel and consumer confidence.

And there’s the environmentalist, who is concerned about carbon emissions and sometimes makes the case that, overall, higher gas prices are good for the planet as an incentive for people to seek and use alternative energy sources.

Emissions, they argue, are affecting climate change and producing more extreme weather and all sorts of disasters, like violent hurricanes, ice storms and droughts that cost money.

With West Texas Intermediate, a grade of crude oil, trading at about $63 a barrel, gas prices are still relatively low, 13 cents less a gallon than last week and more than $2 a gallon less than in 2022, when gasoline prices hit an all-time high.

According to AAA, the highest prices on Sept. 7 in Michigan, on average, were in Ann Arbor, $3.27 a gallon; metro Detroit, $3.26; and Benton Harbor, $3.18; the lowest, in Traverse City, $3.04; and Flint and Saginaw, $3.05.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, which also tracks gas prices, noted that Michigan and some other Great Lakes states ""saw significant relief thanks to the restart of BP’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery.""

Severe weather caused a temporary outage.

But, he said, the West Coast may see continued increases due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the shutdown of a refinery in southern California, which will keep the supply tight.

Additionally, he added, OPEC+ — a group of oil-producing nations — announced an increase in oil production starting in October, which could help keep oil prices lower for longer.

At the same time, because of the low oil prices, oil-industry companies have been laying off workers, which, overall, is also not good for the economy.

ConocoPhillips, headquartered in Houston, was one of the latest to announce job cuts. The company this week said it would slice off up to 25% of its global staff, starting before the holidays.

The news came as data showed a spike in job cuts in August nationwide and a worsening economic outlook contradicted Trump’s claim that the economy is the hottest it has been in years.

But the news also could nudge the Fed to lower interest rates.

Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts in August were up 39% from July, and up 13% from the same month a year ago. August’s total, the firm said, was the highest for the month since 2020.

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, in a Sept. 4 meeting with employees, blamed the cuts, in part, on acquisitions, Reuters reported. ConocoPhillips bought Marathon Oil a year ago, and Concho Resources and Permian assets from Shell in 2021.

But Reuters reported more than a dozen oil companies since 2024 are laying off workers, and that the oil industry job reductions undermine the president’s ""promise to increase U.S. oil and gas production and its clout in global markets.""

In February, Chevron said it would cut 15%-20% of its global workforce, and the month before that, it was reported BP would cut more than 5% of its global workforce to reduce costs and boost investor confidence.

The Trump administration has been working to overhaul America’s energy policy, rolling back emissions regulations and relaxing permitting rules, which should help boost the bottom line of fossil fuel companies.

U.S. oil prices averaged closer to $75 a barrel in 2024, and $78 a barrel the year before that. In 2022 — when, according to AAA, gas in Michigan hit a high of $5.22 a gallon — oil was trading at about $95 a barrel.",https://www.freep.com/gcdn/-mm-/9b2a0d29aa962592489b1d71c96fae5e13a381e0/c=0-198-2400-1554/local/-/media/2017/09/25/DetroitFreeP/DetroitFreePress/636419433297166124-GettyImages-174263267.jpg?width=2400&height=1356&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:45.246557

At the heart of this transformation lies tax equity financing, a capital structure tool that has become indispensable for scaling solar and storage projects. By pairing federal tax incentives like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) with innovative financing mechanisms such as power purchase agreements (PPAs) and green bonds, developers are unlocking unprecedented scalability while mitigating the high upfront costs of renewable infrastructure.

Capital Structure Innovation: Bridging Policy and Private Capital

Tax equity financing operates by allowing developers to partner with investors who can efficiently utilize federal tax credits, often through structures like Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) or partnership flips. This model has been pivotal in utility-scale solar and storage projects, where upfront capital demands are substantial. For instance, the Palmer Solar Project, a 60 MW installation, leveraged a 25-year PPA to secure long-term revenue predictability, while tax equity investors covered over 40% of the project’s costs through ITCs [2]. Such hybrid structures reduce the cost of capital and align public policy goals with private-sector returns.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further amplified this dynamic. By introducing direct pay provisions, the IRA enables non-tax-paying entities—such as municipalities and non-profits—to monetize tax credits directly with the IRS, bypassing traditional tax equity intermediaries [3]. This shift has expanded the pool of eligible investors and streamlined project timelines. For example, Valley Children’s Healthcare in California deployed a $30 million solar and storage microgrid, with tax credits covering over 40% of the project’s cost, while Boston Medical Center used ITCs to fund a solar facility that provides energy credits to patients facing energy insecurity [2]. These cases underscore how tax equity financing is democratizing access to clean energy infrastructure.

Scalability and Cost Efficiency: Metrics Post-IRA

The IRA’s $370 billion clean energy incentives have catalyzed a surge in deployment. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar now accounts for 7% of U.S. electricity generation, up from 0.1% in 2010 [1]. J.P. Morgan’s Tax Oriented Investments (TOI) team has invested $5–6 billion annually in utility-scale solar and storage projects since 2022, with a landmark $680 million deal with Ørsted supporting assets in Texas and Arizona [3]. These investments highlight the scalability enabled by tax equity-PPA hybrids, which have driven an average annual solar deployment growth rate of 28% over the past decade [2].

Cost efficiency has also improved. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar projects has declined due to IRA-driven economies of scale and domestic content incentives. For instance, projects using U.S.-manufactured components or located in energy communities qualify for additional ITC bonuses, enhancing returns [3]. Meanwhile, energy storage costs have fallen by 40% year-on-year in 2024, though U.S. battery energy storage system (BESS) prices remain higher than in China, reflecting ongoing manufacturing challenges [5].

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite these gains, systemic bottlenecks persist. Interconnection backlogs, labor shortages, and tariffs on Chinese solar materials threaten to slow deployment [3]. Political uncertainties, such as revised definitions of “start construction” for tax credits, also create risk. However, the sector is adapting. Green bonds and public-private partnerships (PPPs) are emerging as complementary tools to diversify funding sources. For example, Virginia’s Clean Energy Innovation Bank and Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools program leverage state-level grants and loans to supplement federal incentives [5].

Looking ahead, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) could reshape the landscape by reducing ITC and PTC availability, prompting a shift toward green bonds and alternative capital structures [4]. Developers must also prioritize recycling and infrastructure compatibility to address long-term sustainability concerns [2].

Conclusion

Renewable energy tax equity financing is not merely a financial tool but a strategic lever for the U.S. clean energy transition. By innovating capital structures—whether through SPVs, PPAs, or direct pay mechanisms—developers are scaling solar and storage projects at unprecedented speeds while navigating systemic challenges. As the IRA’s incentives mature and new legislative dynamics emerge, the sector’s ability to adapt will determine its long-term success. For investors, the message is clear: Tax equity financing, paired with agile capital structures, remains a cornerstone of scalable, cost-effective clean energy deployment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 15:06:00.058324

A community cannot survive on its wealthiest citizens alone. It is the middle- and lower-income brackets that provide the manpower, labor, and the fertile grounds of innovation that a community needs to grow. By not having healthy inventories of quality and affordable middle- and lower-income housing, we are forcibly exiling those demographics.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

SEIA and Wood Mackenzie: U.S. solar installs 18 GW in first half of 2025, but warn of potential for sharp declines ahead

The U.S. solar industry delivered nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first six months of 2025, even as the Trump administration rolled out policies aimed at slowing clean energy. Solar and storage still accounted for 82% of all new power added to the grid in that period, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.

But the report also warns that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) and recent federal actions could cut deployment forecasts by 44 GW by 2030—an 18% drop compared to the pre-HR1 outlook. Layer in the policies already in place, and the U.S. risks losing 55 GW of solar by 2030, or a 21% decline.

Growth in Trump states, despite federal headwinds

SEIA notes that 77% of new solar capacity this year has been installed in states won by President Trump, including eight of the top 10 markets: Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment … But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering.”

Manufacturing boom stalls

The U.S. added 13 GW of new module manufacturing capacity in the first half of 2025, with new or expanded factories in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. That brings total domestic module capacity to 55 GW. However, the report flagged that no new upstream manufacturing investments were announced in Q2, citing federal actions that threaten to stall momentum and risk billions in private capital.

Permitting orders create additional risk

The Department of the Interior (DOI) has issued new permitting rules that single out solar for more obstructive treatment, a move Wood Mackenzie analysts say could put 44 GW of planned capacity at risk—particularly in Arizona, California, and Nevada.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment … incredibly challenging.”

Looking ahead

SEIA says near-term growth is still supported by projects already underway, a rush to capture expiring tax credits, and strong power demand as gas generation grows more expensive. But longer term, the report warns that without course corrections, solar deployment will be significantly lower, threatening jobs, reliability, and competitiveness.

SEIA has urged the DOI and other agencies to reverse course. Last week the group also released a grid reliability agenda calling for local, state, and federal leaders to strengthen planning and policy to meet rising demand with solar and storage.",https://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dreamstime_s_7426677.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:23:04.100593

President Donald Trump has been racing at breakneck speed to keep all his campaign promises. Yet he has only four months left to fulfill his vow to halve electricity prices by the end of his first year. Fighting against the fallout of the Biden administration’s harmful anti-fossil fuel agenda, the president faces stiff headwinds. The only way the president can meet his self-imposed deadline is to change course quickly, reject Biden’s mistakes and unlock the potential of every available electron.

So far, the trend lines aren’t looking good. In the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation, and the Energy Information Administration estimates that retail electricity prices will continue to outpace inflation through next year, with residential prices surging between 13% to 18% higher than in 2022.

Though, traditionally, consumers have been much more concerned about gas prices — a number they see projected on highway signs and experience firsthand multiple times a month at the pump — the experience of electricity price spikes instead of the promised price cuts will risk diminishing Trump’s popular support.

'WEB OF DARK MONEY' TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN

What’s worse, these price hikes will arrive before the midterms, when Trump will be battling to retain his slim congressional majorities.

The current price hikes aren’t Trump’s fault. Instead, he inherited a market with increasing and unprecedented energy demand coupled with the fallout from the Biden administration’s harmful policies to phase out fossil fuels.

Technological innovations like cloud and quantum computing, crypto mining, electric vehicle adoption, streaming services and, most of all, AI data centers, all have tremendous energy demands, which drive electricity prices higher. Rand estimates global AI data centers alone will need 327 GW of energy by 2030. To put that into perspective, the entire state of California used 86 GW of energy in 2022.

'LEFTIST' TAXPAYER-FUNDED ACADEMY SPARKS BACKLASH AFTER MOVING AGAINST TRUMP'S ROLLBACK OF KEY REGULATION

In the face of rising demand, the Biden administration embarked on an aggressive program to curtail legacy energy production. The Biden EPA imposed new emissions restrictions that effectively forced the retirement of coal and natural gas power plants and manipulated regulations across agencies to hem in traditional fuel sources.

If these Biden-era policies didn’t cause the current electricity price spikes, they at least allowed today’s demand-induced price increases to hit consumers unabated.

Trump now has to deal with a crisis not of his own making. With his firm commitments to win the AI race, advance crypto and reshore energy-intensive manufacturing such as semiconductor production, Trump can only keep electricity prices in check by massively increasing supply to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, his administration appears to be repeating the same mistakes as Biden’s, just colored with a different ideology.

TRUMP BREAKS 'DAY ONE' PROMISE TO LOWER COSTS AS PRICES SURGE ACROSS AMERICA IN FIRST SIX MONTHS

Where the Biden administration cut energy supplies by attacking fossil fuel production, the Trump administration is limiting alternative and renewable energy sources.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

The One Big Beautiful Bill rescinds tax incentives for renewables, while the administration has advanced multiple orders and rules that limit clean energy, from halting offshore wind leases to curbing solar tax credits.

""Drill, baby, drill"" is a great energy policy, but it’s not enough by itself. While America produced nearly enough energy from fossil fuels (86.3 quads) to supply our nation’s entire energy consumption (93.59 quads) in 2023, the fact is, we need alternative energy sources just to meet current demands. When the future requires even more energy, the necessity for alternative energy will only increase.

The cheapest way to put more electrons into the power grid immediately is to erect significantly more solar and energy storage infrastructure, coupled with natural gas peaker plants that can be rapidly turned on during peak hours.

WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR

In the medium term, America needs to increase nuclear energy production, build more energy infrastructure like electric transmission lines and natural gas pipelines, and construct geothermal power plants while deploying grid-enhancing technology, improving demand response and increasing energy efficiency. With the growing adoption of solar and EVs, the United States can even create an aggregated network of residential, virtual power plants that only draw energy in low-use times while feeding energy back into the grid when it’s needed most.

If these Biden-era policies didn’t cause the current electricity price spikes, they at least allowed today’s demand-induced price increases to hit consumers unabated.

The point is, every energy source and efficiency measure must be deployed if we have any hope of keeping prices in check.

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices. But he could be blamed down the road if his administration continues to limit supply by favoring one source of energy over others. At the end of each month, most consumers don’t care where their energy comes from; they only care that it’s cheap.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/01/nm_solar_panels.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:09.165376

NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / September 8, 2025 / The two largest companies that provide advice to institutional investors on how to vote their corporate proxies are fighting back against a Texas law that would limit their ability to advise clients on environmental, social and governance practices. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which advises about 2,000 clients for more than 51,000 shareholder meetings, and Glass Lewis, with than 1,300 clients, both filed suit in July to block Texas Senate Bill 2337 that was scheduled to take effect on September 1.

In our Top Stories for the issue, the law firm Gibson Dunn reports that on August 29, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the new Texas law until a trial is held, which is set for February 2, 2026.

According to Gibson Dunn, SB 2337 ""will impose extensive public and directed disclosure obligations on proxy advisory firms when their recommendations or services are based on non-financial factors, which include environmental, social and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) considerations, diverge from company management's recommendations, or provide conflicting advice across clients.""

In their lawsuits, ISS and Glass Lewis argued that SB 2337 is unconstitutional since it would violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution by ""forcing the proxy advisors to state that recommendations inconsistent with management or incorporating ESG/DEI are not in shareholders' financial interest.""

Reuters reported in July that the proxy advisors said the new law was an attempt ""to force proxy advisers to broadcast Texas' preferred viewpoints when their own differed, including on hot-button issues that a Republican state legislator perceived as having a ‘hard left bent.'""

The State of Texas, under the leadership of Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, has been at the forefront of Republican efforts to attack ESG and DEI programs at corporations, schools and in government. The state passed a law in 2023 banning DEI offices at public universities and colleges and this year passed a law, which is being challenged by the ACLU, to ban DEI programs in K-12 schools.

In our other Top Stories, Reuters and NPR report that state attorney generals and leading environmental and scientific groups are pushing back against the proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to invalidate the 2009 Endangerment Finding -- which underlies regulations for controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reuters reported that Arizona Attorney General Chris Mayes said, ""the EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting costs of climate change for all Americans.""

NPR reports that in August, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA alleging that the government's report used to support its proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding was unlawful since it was created in secret. Public comments regarding the proposed EPA repeal of the Endangerment Finding can be submitted through September 15, with instructions available here.

,Texas Environment,2025-09-08 15:53:18+00:00,Texas Standard,Weak demand and OPEC moves may lower gas prices. But could it hurt Texas oil companies?,David Brown,,,,,https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/energy-texas-oil-gas-prices-opec-supply-hurricane-season/,"The company says it’s part of streamlining and restructuring, but it’s worth noting a number of other oil companies have announced similar plans this year as oil prices and crude oil futures have fallen.
And particularly because there’s that added seasonal element there where you see gas prices lowest – kind of December, January time.
I mentioned these layoffs in the Texas oil industry.
Writ large, what’s the health of the Texas oil industry like as far as you can tell?
We’re already forecasting that production will be lower next year because of the prices being in check.","Newsweek reports Houston-based ConocoPhillips plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce or roughly 3,200 employees and contractors.

The company says it’s part of streamlining and restructuring, but it’s worth noting a number of other oil companies have announced similar plans this year as oil prices and crude oil futures have fallen.

Against that backdrop, some news over the weekend from OPEC, which has been increasing production since April.

Matt Smith, head analyst at Kepler, joined Texas Standard to bring us up to speed on the latest from the energy front. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So the big news over the weekend: OPEC’s decided to unwind a new tier of production cuts, boosting output essentially. How big a deal is this?

Matt Smith: Well, it’s a big deal from a symbolic perspective, right? Because it signals that OPEC+ believes the market is strong enough to take these additional barrels.

As you mentioned, they’ve already unwound 2.2 million barrels a day of cuts. This latest one is for 1.65 million barrels per day. But the devil is in the details, really, because that’s going to be spread across a year here. So it’s only about 135,000 barrels a day – around that number.

So, the cuts are going to be small and incremental, but also the volume is likely to be lower than announced because some members have been unable to compensate for earlier oversupply here. So yeah, it’s symbolic, really.

Well, I know that there’s been a lot of talk about a potential oil glut. I mean, isn’t this likely to push prices lower? Why are they doing this in the first place?

Well, I think it gives them the flexibility to add more onto the market if they feel that the market can take it. But it is surprising because, to your point, a lot of us that follow oil closely can see oversupply coming.

And so essentially, you’ve got a lot of supply that’s coming from non-OPEC, so from Canada and Norway, but particularly from Guyana and Brazil – so from Latin America. That’s hitting them.

But it’s happening at a seasonal time, as well, when you have weaker demand. So you have refineries going through maintenance. So it’s kind of a double whammy: Stronger supply, weaker demand, and we’re going to get this surplus – causing inventories to be higher and therefore weighing on prices.

So, gasoline prices should follow.

Yeah, exactly. And particularly because there’s that added seasonal element there where you see gas prices lowest – kind of December, January time. So, if we’re at $3.20 on the national average right now, $2.75 for the Texas average, we’re going to be dropping at least a quarter, if not more here in the next month or two.

We’ve got to talk about something else that’s obviously important to the oil industry and certainly important to everyday Texans, too. Wednesday marks the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Feels like this has been a rather quiet season, no?

It really has and it’s funny because I remember we talked about this before the season started and because it was expected to be more active than usual and that kind of how it’s felt over the last few years. But we’ve only had six named storms five tropical storms, one category 5 hurricane – that was Erin and that didn’t make landfall, that was just whirring in the Atlantic there.

There was the one in Texas, though. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry caused the deadly flooding in Central Texas there over July 4th holiday. So that was terrible, right, but that’s the limited impact that we’ve seen from the Atlantic hurricane season.

To your point, on Sept. 10, you’re almost guaranteed to see a named storm in the Atlantic and yet there is nothing. We haven’t seen anything recently and there’s nothing on the forecast for the next seven days either.

Complacency? You concerned about any of that?

No, because it ramps up to Sept. 10 and then it ramps down again. And so as long as we can get through September here, it seems like we’ve got away unscathed without having a storm make landfall in Texas.

I mentioned these layoffs in the Texas oil industry. Writ large, what’s the health of the Texas oil industry like as far as you can tell?

It’s starting to be concerning, right? Particularly if we see prices drop below $60 moving towards $55 on WTI by year end here.

What that means is that we’re going to be seeing Texas producers likely shutting in some production. We’re already forecasting that production will be lower next year because of the prices being in check. And so very much a concern on that side of things.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/52730987335_3e904f4304_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:21:55.074965

The new plan also has new sections on implementation and advocacy, including a recommendation to update the plan every five years.
The sustainability board’s plan also sits alongside the Edgewater2040 Comprehensive Plan, which has 120 recommendations that mainly cover land use, but touch on some topics similar to the newly updated sustainability plan.
On-Going Actions Update the Sustainability webpage to function as a Community Sustainability Dashboard/resource.
Long-Term Actions Develop a specific youth engagement plan centered around Sustainability to promote long-lasting community benefits.","On Tuesday, the Edgewater City Council heard an update from community leaders on the city’s updated sustainability plan. The plan, which is 25 pages, lists goals and priority actions for the city staff and community members across four major categories: land and water; waste & materials; energy; and social vibrancy.

Andy Rutz, the Principal of Cresendo Planning and Design, provided a briefing to the council. Andy is a consultant to the city, responsible for facilitating the process by which changes were made to the original plan, which was published in 2019. The updated plan reflects the input gathered from six focus groups, 121 respondents to a survey distributed by the city’s Town Cryer newsletter, six board work sessions from October to July, and an April 13 event attended by 35 community members.

Rutz reported that one major framing update was to center “pollution reduction” as a goal that cuts across all four categories of work; among other reasons, community leaders who shaped the plan believe will boost the odds the city receives grant funding from the Denver Regional Council of Governments’ Decarbonize program. The organization was a recipient of a $199M grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. The funds, which were received during the Biden administration in 2024, will be regranted to local governments across the region.

Rutz says the Edgewater community should be proud of the progress the small city has made, in part due to the city’s new sustainability coordinator Shaima Shahbaz. As a result of the progress, the updated plan reorganizes some of the original recommendations to acknowledge the progress that has been made and better delineate the level of attention each will need in the future. The new plan identifies three types of actions under each of the four major categories. Those include:

Priority actions, which the city hopes to achieve in the next five years;

Ongoing actions, which may never be “finished” but will be standards of practice; and,

Long-term actions, which may require significant allocations of staff or financial resources to be achieved.

In total, 42 recommended actions level up to 13 different goals. The actions can be found at the end of this article, or on pages 19-22 of the plan. The goals are:

Land & Water:

Create, protect and sustain a robust urban ecosystem and tree canopy for a healthy community and its residents.

Save and protect water resources for the watershed, as well as current and future residents.

Minimize pollutants and reduce the urban heat island effect through strategic landscape design, green infrastructure, and sustainable development practices.

Improve land and water resilience by enhancing built environment permeability, managing runoff, and investing in nature-based solutions that respond to changing climate conditions.

Waste & Materials

Establish and maintain Edgewater as a leader by increasing residential waste diversion year over year.

Reduce commercial and public sector waste.

Reduce pollution through science-based material selection and infrastructure design.

Energy

Increase energy efficiency opportunities for homes, businesses, government and transportation.

Commit to statewide goals (HB19-1261) to reduce 2030 greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors by at least 50%, and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90% of the statewide greenhouse gas emissions that existed in 2005.

Increase the use of clean renewable electricity to 70% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

Social Vibrancy

Facilitate the expansion of small businesses – prioritizing a walkable environment – to foster a culture of economic, social and environmental resilience for all parties.

Expand communication and outreach to better engage the community.

Foster a community that enables active neighborhood engagement and intergenerational interactions to promote positive relationships and mental health for residents and visitors.

The new plan also has new sections on implementation and advocacy, including a recommendation to update the plan every five years. Rutz specifically commented on the city’s progress in residential areas and on city-owned properties, while naming an opportunity to enroll the city’s business community in the plan more.

Mayor Steve Conklin and Council Member Hannah Gay Kaeo congratulated the sustainability board on the accomplishment. The board includes: Xerxes Steirer (Chair); Jaclyn Poliseo (Vice-Chair); Jeanette Papp; Bruce Perry; Andy Vieth; and Council Member Lilly Steirer.

Gay Kaeo suggested the board work closely with the city’s History, Arts, Recreation, and Parks (HARP) board, which is also updating its strategic plan. The sustainability board’s plan also sits alongside the Edgewater2040 Comprehensive Plan, which has 120 recommendations that mainly cover land use, but touch on some topics similar to the newly updated sustainability plan.

Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin joined the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition last week, increasing membership to 13 state governors.

Launched in May, the coalition aims to promote more affordable electric vehicles, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and preserve states’ authority under the Clean Air Act.

The coalition was formed by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 24 governors. States will address their own challenges and opportunities while working together to achieve the coalition’s collective goals, the Climate Alliance said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

New electric vehicle sales were strong in the past two months as buyers rushed to take advantage of federal incentives before they expire Sept. 30. However, the share of EVs compared to total automotive sales declined in the second quarter both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter, according to CleanTechnica.

“Sales of EVs will likely fall dramatically when tax credits expire,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough in an August 27 statement.

A further blow to EVs came in June when Congress and the Trump administration ended California’s authority to set its own stronger vehicle emission standards. A 1990 federal law allows 17 additional states and the District of Columbia to follow California’s vehicle emissions regulations.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing many of the industry’s automakers and suppliers, supported the administration’s actions. “An aggressive regulatory push toward battery electric vehicles – ahead of consumer demand and without market readiness – will reduce U.S. vehicle production and auto jobs versus a more balanced approach that prioritizes and preserves vehicle choice,” said the group’s president and CEO, John Bozzella, in an April 29 blog post.

The coalition’s 11 initial governors said in a May 23 statement that “The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market.”

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a Sept. 4 statement, “We need to make it easier, not harder, for consumers to upgrade to electric vehicles — and that’s exactly what we’re doing through this state-led partnership.”

The Climate Alliance said it is making resources available to coalition members to help them reduce vehicle pollution and enable consumer access to more affordable zero-emission vehicles.

Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in an emailed statement that the organization is “proud of Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin for joining 11 other states to improve access to electric vehicles at a time when the federal government works to prop up the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our economic well-being and health.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Vh3Q-yrLd0frxR23T1lSKf7mCD9z1fkXoEc-JCJUePg/g:nowe:0:233/c:2500:1412/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjA0NTg4MDQ0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-08 12:16:36.144749

BACKGROUND

Sen. Cruz has long been a leader in pushing for American energy dominance and protecting America’s energy workers.

In July, Sen. Cruz sent aletter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to expeditiously reissue the appropriate authority for the Rio Grande LNG project. This project supports thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in the Rio Grande Valley.

In March, Sens. Cruz, Cornyn, Wicker, and Tim Scott reintroduced theProtect LNG Act, which would ensure that a court cannot vacate a previously authorized LNG permit, clarifies the venue for LNG lawsuits before federal courts, and mandates that courts grant expedited decisions in relevant cases. Cruz first introduced this bill in 2024.

Sen. Cruz led a bicameral and bipartisan amicus brief in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision to vacate the authorizations for the Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG Brownsville projects. His amicus brief is availablehere andhere. Following the court’s recent decision to reinstate approvals for both projects, Sen. Cruz issued astatement welcoming the ruling.

In 2024, Sen. Cruz, Cornyn and Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., authored an op-ed highlighting the U.S. Court of Appeals decision vacating already-issued liquefied natural gas permits in South Texas in a recent op-ed for the Rio Grande Guardian.

His “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, will end the federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30.

Until then, eligible buyers can still knock $7,500 off the sticker price—on top of other incentives— but once the deadline is here, the perk disappears. Additionally, the bill has scrapped the penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Just a few years ago, under the Biden administration, automakers were doubling down on EVs. Tax breaks, supportive policies and stricter emissions rules pushed companies to speed up their e-mobility efforts.

But things have changed now. Trump’s rollback of incentives and regulations, along with new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, is changing the economics of EVs in the United States. The shift is forcing legacy automakers to rethink their electrification plans.

Detroit’s Legacy Carmakers Welcome the Shift

For traditional automakers like General Motors GM and Ford F, the policy change comes as a financial breather. Bloomberg recently reported that this rollback could unlock billions of dollars for Detroit carmakers to reinvest in gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley even called the policy shift a “multibillion-dollar opportunity” for its gas and hybrid business. GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.

The reason is simple— without fuel economy fines, Ford and General Motors no longer need to buy regulatory credits from EV-only players. GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year. They can now redirect the money into profitable gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

GM and F currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GM and Ford Scale Back EV Ambitions

This policy reset is showing up in production plans. GM recently announced it will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ between Sept. 2 and Oct. 6. While the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups remain in production, GM has delayed its second electric truck plant and Buick’s first EV by six months. Instead, the automaker revealed $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles—clear evidence it’s not betting everything on EVs anymore.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/f7db1b4fdf6819356154790d60da1362,N,,2025-09-08 13:08:40.751947

Now steep cuts are required.” The International Renewable Energy Agency says that 90 percent of the world’s electricity can and should come from renewable energy sources by 2050.
It’s reasonable to ask whether a future without fossil fuels is possible.
As it happens, climate activists come much closer than fossil fuels’ defenders to what science and self-interest dictate we must do.
He also served as special assistant to the department’s assistant secretary of energy efficiency and renewable energy.","Paul Bledsoe is a highly respected veteran of America’s climate battles. He has been in the trenches a long time, including a stint in former President Bill Clinton’s Climate Change Task Force. He is now a lecturer at American University.

Writing in The Hill recently, Bledsoe warned that millions of Americans have been turned off by radical “fossil fuel prohibitionists” who want to ban traditional fuels and undermine “average citizens’ ability to enjoy a middle-class lifestyle.”

Of course, it’s the rapid advance of climate change, not opposition to fossil fuels, that most threatens our lifestyles. The climate-action advocates with whom I’m familiar argue (correctly) that a decarbonized economy would allow a considerably better quality of life than Americans enjoy today.

With more than 80 percent of U.S. energy consumption provided by oil, natural gas and coal, 90,000 Americans die prematurely each year because of fossil-fuel pollution. In fact, 156 million live where breathing is unhealthy, and 99.5 percent of congressional districts experienced at least one federally declared weather disaster between 2011 and 2024.

Given those consequences, life without fossil fuels looks inviting. It also looks desirable for pocketbooks. Even without counting the social costs of carbon, electricity generated from unsubsidized sunlight and wind is less expensive than electricity from coal- or gas-fired power plants. That’s been the case for the last 10 years, according to the financial analysis firm Lazard.

It makes little difference to the typical family whether their lights are powered by coal, natural gas, sunlight or wind turbines. However, it makes an enormous difference to the quality of the air they breathe, the outside temperatures, and the price of disaster insurance.

America’s middle-class lifestyles have survived big energy shifts before. This one is admittedly more significant, but so is the danger of more delay.

It has been 60 years since science advisers warned President Lyndon Johnson about the danger of fossil fuel pollution collecting in the atmosphere, and 48 years since President Carter told the nation, “We must start now to develop the new unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century.” Thirty-eight years ago, the government’s chief climate scientist warned Congress that we were running out of time to prevent a global warming disaster. A full 33 years have gone by since the United States signed a treaty to stabilize the atmosphere, and 10 years since the U.S. and 195 other nations agreed to limit global warming. Two years ago, Congress and the Biden administration approved America’s largest-ever federal investment in clean energy.

It has taken President Trump and Republicans in Congress less than eight months to undo it all.

The real enemies of the middle class are the greedy captains of the oil-and-gas sector who continue gaslighting the American people, greenwashing the sector’s reputation, harassing opponents with lawsuits, placing profits above country and conspiring with the best politicians their money can buy.

They scored big with Trump. He is openly defying free-market orthodoxy by manipulating markets to accelerate fossil fuel production and suppress investments in clean energy. Fiscal conservatives should be marching in the streets.

Trump now says his administration will stop approving solar and wind projects. His energy policies arguably violate the federal securities and antitrust laws that prohibit anti-competitive practices. They definitely jeopardize the health and welfare of the American people.

Let’s be clear: It’s the laws of physics, not radical leftists, that determine the Earth’s “carbon budget” and the timing of the energy transition. By mid-century, we must emit no more greenhouse gases than we and nature can absorb. Then we must draw down the gases already in the atmosphere until they return to safe and stable levels — a capability we currently lack.

How disruptive would an adequate energy transition be? President George W. Bush, a former oilman, provided a useful analogy when he characterized America’s oil dependence as an addiction. The state of an addict’s health influences whether they must stop cold turkey or can undergo more gradual withdrawal.

Climate “doctors” say our Goldilocks environment is approaching end-stage failure. As Nature reported two years ago, “Had nations acted earlier to reduce emissions, they could have taken a much more gradual approach to limit warming. Now steep cuts are required.”

The International Renewable Energy Agency says that 90 percent of the world’s electricity can and should come from renewable energy sources by 2050. To get there, the world must double its current investment in solar, wind and other clean energy technologies.

It’s reasonable to ask whether a future without fossil fuels is possible. Reputable experts say an economy powered 100 percent by carbon-free energy is doable. Several have developed roadmaps on how to get there. Despite Trump’s efforts to suppress these technologies, their use is expanding worldwide.

Fossil fuels will not have a role in the future unless the industry eliminates carbon emissions not only at the point of combustion but also across their entire life cycles and value chains. They have yet to develop commercially scalable ways to do that. Even if they did, decarbonizing carbon fuels would significantly increase their costs, which would further cripple their ability to compete with renewable energy.

What will our lifestyles be like in a decarbonized economy? We can ask the neighbors who drive electric vehicles or have solar panels on their roofs. Their beer is still cold, their showers are still hot, and their EVs save money.

“The time for ideology on climate is over,” writes Bledsoe. “Neither the far right nor far left should define the terms of climate politics and policy.” He’s correct. The terms should be defined by science and humanity’s interest in a livable planet. As it happens, climate activists come much closer than fossil fuels’ defenders to what science and self-interest dictate we must do.

The United States is relatively new to making these batteries.

A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine.","The immigration raid last week on an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia owned by two South Korean manufacturers was yet another setback for what had been a fast-growing industry in the United States.

The sector was already beleaguered by lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles, tariffs on raw materials and the rapid phaseout of a federal tax credit for purchases of E.V.s, which have led companies to delay or scale back production.

But the raid at the plant under construction in Ellabell, Ga., which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and battery supplier LG Energy Solution, raised more risks for foreign manufacturers in the United States. Immigration officials arrested 475 people. Of them, about 300 were South Korean citizens, according to the South Korean foreign minister’s office.

It is not yet clear how many of those detained by ICE last week were building the plant and how many were workers brought in to install and calibrate specialized equipment, or to train the local work force.

Some American workers in the area have complained that they have not been given a fair chance at employment at the $7.6 billion taxpayer-subsidized complex, which has been billed as the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.

These labor tensions have been building as the federal government, seeking a stronger foothold in the battery business, has wooed foreign companies to expand manufacturing on U.S. soil.

The United States is relatively new to making these batteries. The leading manufacturers are headquartered in Asia, and they typically bring engineers and technicians from their home countries to set up new factories, where assembly lines of robots coat, slice and assemble the components that help power a car. Much of the battery cell technology is proprietary, and there is little margin for error.

“When you don’t have a whole cohort of people who know how to run cell-making factories, you rely heavily on the folks from the home factory,” said Celina Mikolajczak, who was been an executive at battery companies including Panasonic.

That practice has not gone over well with American labor unions that want those jobs, said Betony Jones, who was director of the office of energy jobs at the Department of Energy during the Biden administration.

“E.V. battery companies are very secretive about I.P., so they were bringing in their own workers when it came to installing their machines and maintaining their machines,” she said, referring to intellectual property. “But unions were really pushing for that work.”

Over the weekend, LG Energy Solution said it suspended all U.S. business trips except for customer meetings, conferences and exhibitions, and advised all traveling employees to “immediately return home or remain at their accommodations, considering their current work status.”

The company’s pullback comes as investment in U.S. battery manufacturing was beginning to slow. Tesla’s success in popularizing electric vehicles, paired with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act three years ago, brought a flood of money to the sector. Companies poured roughly $80 billion into U.S. battery manufacturing since the middle of 2022, up from around $10 billion in the three years earlier, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investments with M.I.T.’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

But the business outlook was darkening as E.V. sales fell behind many companies’ lofty expectations. The Trump administration’s efforts this year to raise trade barriers and remake federal energy policy to be more favorable toward fossil fuels introduced new uncertainty and financial challenges. Perhaps most notably, starting next month, electric vehicles will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit that had helped make the cars more affordable for many buyers.

Other critical sectors have used labor from abroad as they build in the United States. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, for example, relied heavily on labor from Taiwan at its plant on the outskirts of Phoenix.

The raid has also caused outrage in Seoul, where major media outlets ran articles highlighting the poor conditions in which Korean workers would be held, and included a photograph released by ICE of the workers being arrested. News outlets also focused on the difficulty South Korean companies experience in securing work visas for the technicians they need to complete plants in the United States.

South Koreans can enter the United States without a visa for 90 days under a visa-waiver program that allows them to participate in tourism or attend some business meetings, but not full-time work, according to Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research think tank. A temporary business visa, known as B-1, allows for short-term training and consulting, but not full-time construction work.

On Sunday, the two countries reached a deal to free those detainees and send them home to South Korea via a chartered plane, according to Kang Hoon-sik, the chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea.

Still, the sweeping nature of the raid could make skilled technicians more apprehensive about coming to the United States, even for short stints. That could increase the cost of establishing new U.S. factories and slow construction.

“The current situation is creating a dilemma,” said Andrew Yi, a Seoul-based partner for Roland Berger, a consulting firm. Strict enforcement of certain visa rules “would in the short term delay the completion of the factories that are going up.”

Barry Zeigler, business manager of Local 188, a union that represents plumbers, pipe-fitters, welders and HVAC service technicians for 15 counties in Georgia, said South Koreans were working as welders and pipe-fitters in the Georgia plant — jobs that he said should have been given to Americans. He said he had visited the plant in the past, adding that about 65 members of his union were hired by subcontractors to lay pipes there, but were let go a few months ago.

“People think the Koreans are here to do a special job; that’s B.S.,” he said, adding that politicians had turned a deaf ear to his complaints about the factory until the raid.

The plant has been dogged for months by investigative reports by the local TV station WTOC about poor safety conditions and widespread use of unauthorized laborers. At least three workers have died at the megasite, including a man identified as Sunbok You, who was run over by a forklift in March, according to local law enforcement. The police report obtained by the station identified the forklift driver as Sunhwam Bae, who spoke to officers through a translator.

LG Energy Solution has faced safety issues at other plants as well. A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine. And this past weekend, 15 people from the same facility were hospitalized after a chemical spill, according to local news reports.

Ms. Jones, the former Biden administration official, said American workers had a right to be angry if E.V. battery manufacturers were cutting corners with safety and declining to hire and train American workers.

“There are a lot of battery factories being built across the U.S. and their workers are not dying,” she said.

In a statement, LG Energy Solution said the company prioritizes “the safety and well-being of our team” and that its $25 billion investment in North American manufacturing would create about 14,000 jobs in the United States by 2027. Hyundai said the company was “committed to maintaining the highest safety standards.” It also said its employees “are required to comply fully with U.S. laws and regulations.”

The politics are awkward for Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican who embraced the Biden administration’s clean energy policies, showering the project with an estimated $2 billion in tax credits and incentives in a bid to make Georgia the “electric mobility capital of the country.” President Trump has relentlessly attacked both electric vehicles and Mr. Kemp, who resisted Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn 2020 election results in Georgia.

Marie Hodge Gordon, director of communications at the Georgia Department of Economic Development, released a statement that emphasized the fact that electric cars — the Hyundai IONIQ 5 — have already begun rolling off the assembly line at the auto plant on the site. It stressed that the incentives for the project “are based on new, long-term Georgia jobs, not the roles under investigation by law enforcement.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/07/multimedia/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:16:43.960503

Two months after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which trimmed the lifespan of most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, the industry is still trying to understand the implications of the legislation’s new foreign entity of concern rules and hoping for clarity from upcoming Treasury Department guidance.

“I discuss this almost every day, it seems like,” said Vinson & Elkins tax partner Jenny Speck. “Having clear, administrable rules is the first step, because we already have a statute that creates ambiguity. We’re hearing that this is priority guidance — it should be at the top of their list in terms of what they’re working on.”

The FEOC provisions in OBBBA were expanded from the IRA’s original rule restricting foreign entities of concern – entities with ties to China, Russia, North Korea or Iran – from claiming clean vehicle tax credits. The new FEOC rules apply to the 45X advanced manufacturing credit, the 45Y production credit, and the 48E investment credit.

“We look at wind, solar and 45X as the three that are going to have probably the most rigorous diligence,” Speck said.

Ties to foreign entities of concern “can be such things as 25% or more ownership by a single Chinese shareholder or 40% by two or more such shareholders or at least 15% of total debt held by Chinese lenders, only counting debt holders at original issuance,” law firm Norton Rose Fulbright said in a July article. “Licensing arrangements with Chinese interests can also turn a supplier into a prohibited foreign entity … It is not clear how U.S. developers will be able to spot such arrangements.”

Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, said he thinks there’s “some understanding of what the cost percentages of prohibited content look like,” but as far as “what kinds of licensing or servicing agreements might violate a FEOC rule, or what kinds of prohibited foreign entities actually are already in these construction processes — I just don’t think we have that clarity yet.”

“Having clear, administrable rules is the first step, because we already have a statute that creates ambiguity. We’re hearing that this is priority guidance — it should be at the top of their list in terms of what they’re working on.”

The Treasury Department and IRS released OBBBA guidance on Aug. 15 clarifying how project developers can prove they commenced construction before the deadline to qualify for the 45Y and 48E tax credits, and said in a footnote that they are “currently drafting additional guidance as is necessary and appropriate” regarding the FEOC rules.

The FEOC rules “are extremely onerous,” said Vinson & Elkins tax partner Lauren Collins. “They are extremely complicated. They have multiple traps for the unwary. If you do not spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand these rules and diligencing ownership structures and debt structures, you’re bound to come into some issues.”

Collins said that as her firm unpacks the rules, they are finding “new issues almost every day, in trying to apply them to real world circumstances.”

“My basic takeaway is there are very few circumstances where taxpayers will actually trip these rules, and actually become a prohibited foreign entity once they’re applied,” she said. “It’s just that they’re so hard to apply and diligence that the administrative burden of proving it out is really the issue. It’s not really a substantive issue of, will we trip this? It’s just, how do we prove it with any level of certainty?”

Resulting industry shifts

Bryen Alperin, a partner and managing director at Foss & Company, also called some of the new FEOC restrictions “onenous” and said being able to meet these new requirements “is going to be one of the greatest challenges for the industry ... it might add a lot of costs in terms of legal compliance, et cetera.”

Alperin said that investors are already starting to opt for 45Y production tax credits over 48E investment tax credits, as the latter are subject under the FEOC rules to potential recapture.

“With an investment tax credit transaction, you get all your tax credits up front in the first year, but they’re going to have a ten year compliance period where they could have their credits recaptured,” Alperin said. “Let’s say that you build a solar power plant in 2028 and you claim your tax credits in 2028. Our investor gets their tax credit, and then eight years later — there might even be a new owner of the project at that point, we’re no longer involved, and somebody accidentally hires a Chinese company to do maintenance on the project.”

In that scenario, the tax credit from eight years ago could be recaptured, Alperin said.

“That’s, I think, the big worry — that no matter what the rule ends up being, once the administration releases it, that you just have a quite substantial compliance burden that you have to take on yourself. And then, of course, there’s the greater legal risk — where the IRS’s statute for recapture is also longer now, in a way that puts you on the hook for a much longer time period.”

“That’s got a lot of our investors nervous,” Alperin said. “A lot of our investors who used to only do solar are now looking at doing wind transactions, because those generate production tax credits. In the future, we might see more solar projects electing to go with production tax credits instead of these investment tax credits, because there’s going to be a bit of a risk premium applied to the investment tax credit that investors will be uncomfortable with.”

Arun said the FEOC rules also inherently disadvantage small developers, who have fewer resources to devote to ensuring supply chain compliance.

“That’s, I think, the big worry — that no matter what the rule ends up being, once the administration releases it, that you just have a quite substantial compliance burden that you have to take on yourself,” he said. “And then, of course, there’s the greater legal risk — where the IRS’s statute for recapture is also longer now, in a way that puts you on the hook for a much longer time period.”

Developers are also shifting their strategies in response to guidance that the Treasury Department released in August, which stipulated that construction on most wind and solar projects is considered to have begun “when physical work of a significant nature begins,” instead of when 5% or more of the total cost of the project has been paid. Solar facilities with a net output of less than 1.5 MW can still use the 5% test.

“[The physical work test] is definitely a little bit more subjective,” Arun said. “With 5%, if you have your contracts, if you’ve demonstrated payments, it’s easy enough to show those to the IRS and to verify. But the other thing that they changed about the physical work test is there’s a difference in language now between ‘physical effort’ versus ‘program of construction’, where payments and contracts just simply don’t count anymore toward a facts or circumstances based-analysis the IRS might run.”

The IRS now has “discretion” in a way that adds “more squishiness” to the process, Arun said.

Alperin noted that the Trump administration is moving toward more subjective discretion in general, putting pressure on solar and wind projects “not just with the IRA, but also with permits that may not be granted — that used to be just trivial, standard permits that the government would grant.”

Overall, Alperin said the industry is still digesting the physical work test guidance, “but from what I’ve heard, it’s not as impactful as some feared it may be.” He said it “was a relief” that the commence construction guidance “wasn’t retroactive, and that it didn’t really change the playing field that much.”

Collins said she and her colleagues view the latest guidance as “very workable.”

“We’re seeing many clients and developers start acting in response to it, and start engaging in the various forms of significant physical work in order to safe harbor their wind and solar projects,” she said. “The physical work test has been used for well over a decade. We have pretty clear rules on how to apply it that weren’t changed, and it’s cheaper than the 5% safe harbor method.”

Collins noted, though, that the 5% test “is not subjective. It is, you know, you pay that amount and you’re safe harbored, and that has a level of certainty that the industry has liked. But the significant physical work method has really gained favor over the years and is well established.”

Like the lack of clarity around FEOC rules, Arun said, the move away from the 5% test may disadvantage developers large enough not to qualify for the 1.5 MW solar exemption but small enough to be a “minnow” instead of a shark.

“Obviously, I think everyone’s correct in arguing that this isn’t the worst case scenario for the industry,” he said. “But I think the ability to prove to the IRS conclusively that you’ve begun construction, that you’re performing construction activities, relies on having the kind of market share and relationships in the market already that allow you to have already built gigantic pipelines of these projects.”

Wind and solar projects that commence construction before July 4 next year can still qualify for the placed-in-service deadline of Dec. 31, 2030, under a safe harbor provision, while projects that commence construction after that have to be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify.

In addition, the OBBBA includes a provision that projects that start construction by the end of 2025 are not subject to some of the new FEOC restrictions. In response, developers are pushing to get projects under construction as quickly as possible, Alperin said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1rGNnJLZKG1MeAHIDelHD6xPDVErj91CIeVavk2zDuA/g:nowe:0:325/c:3200:1807/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XSU5EXzIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-08 12:16:55.926148

According to Bloomberg, GM will start production on its Chevrolet Bolt EV in December with one shift at its plant in Kansas. Two shifts were originally planned for Bolt production.

Production will also be reduced at GM’s Spring Hill, Tennessee assembly plant to one shift from January through May, Bloomberg reports. The plant builds the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq EVs. It also builds the ICE Cadillac SUVs.

“General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand,” the company said in a statement to Bloomberg.

GM reported Tuesday that it set an all-time monthly record for EV sales in August, ahead of the expiration of the EV tax credits.

“August was our best month ever for EV sales — and we expect that buying surge to pay long-term dividends, given our industry-leading manufacturer loyalty, and EV customers’ overwhelming commitment to the technology,” a statement posted to the company’s website from Duncan Aldred, GM senior vice president and North America president, says. “I’m grateful to our team and our dealers for helping us outperform nearly every EV competitor.”

He notes in the statement that strong demand will likely remain in September, but the market is expected to shrink after the credit expiration.

Other OEMs reported strong EV sales as the tax credits near expiration. For example, Ford reported August U.S. sales increased by 3.9% to 190,206 vehicles sold in the month compared with the year-ago August, according to Yahoo Finance.

“There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end September 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,” Aldred wrote. “We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce. Still, we believe GM can continue to grow EV market share.”

He points to some positives with EVs, with the expansion of public fast-charging bays across the country. He writes that customers will have access to more than 65,000 bays by the end of the year. GM expects that to grow by 80,000 by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2027.

Mercedes-Benz is also pausing U.S. production of its EV models ahead of the rebate expiration, including the EQE and EQS models.

The company initiated a “fire sale” of its electric models ahead of the expiration of the tax credit. Other companies, such as Tesla and Ford, have also offered deals in recent months.

ContourGlobal’s first U.S. renewable energy facility comes online in Colorado

ContourGlobal has started operations at Black Hollow Sun I (BHS I), a 185 MWp solar photovoltaic facility located near Severance, Colorado. BHS I represents the UK-based company’s first operating renewable plant in the United States and the initial phase of the Black Hollow Sun complex, which will also include BHS II (139 MWp). When fully completed in 2026, the power complex will reach a total capacity of 324 MWp, making it Northern Colorado’s largest solar project and Platte River’s largest contracted solar asset.

Once fully operational, the complex will produce around 608 GWh of renewable energy each year, which will be delivered to Platte River Power Authority, the community-owned utility serving Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. ContourGlobal is using American-manufactured solar modules supplied by its partner Qcells, which is also providing its integrated EPC solutions for this project.

Cool factor: This milestone marked a highlight of ContourGlobal’s 20th anniversary celebrations, underscoring both its origins in the United States two decades ago and its commitment to becoming a predominantly renewable independent power producer (IPP) also through other relevant investments in the country.

“The start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I is a pivotal moment for ContourGlobal, marking our first U.S. renewable plant to reach operational state, and especially meaningful as we celebrate our 20th anniversary since the company was incorporated in the U.S.,” said Antonio Cammisecra, CEO of ContourGlobal. “This project, together with Black Hollow Sun II targeted for completion by the end of 2026, exemplifies our strategy to deliver clean, reliable power while strengthening our commitment to local communities and partners such as Platte River Power Authority”.

The completion of BHS I adds 185 MWp of new renewable capacity to ContourGlobal’s overall U.S. portfolio, which now totals 2.8 GW of power generation capacity in operation, under construction or in late-stage of development. ContourGlobal’s planned renewable capacity in the United States includes an additional 1 GW of solar PV and 0.3 GW of battery energy storage system (BESS) projects at various stages of maturity, from late development to advanced construction.

SolarEdge, Arch Solar complete rooftop PV system Wisconsin high school

SolarEdge Technologies and Arch Solar have collaborated on the completion of a rooftop solar project at Nicolet Union High School in Glendale, Wisconsin. Since coming online in fall 2024, the system has been generating clean energy and reducing operational costs for the school while serving as a hands-on educational resource for students.

Designed and installed by Arch Solar, the system spans seven distinct rooftop sections and uses TerraGen racking at 15° and 23° tilts. The design overcame complex challenges, including varying roof heights, shading, and structural limitations. Using SolarEdge Designer, the project team optimized the layout and production while incorporating future scalability into the electrical and inverter infrastructure.

Cool factor: The solar array — featuring 715 high-efficiency modules and three SolarEdge SE100K-US inverters — has produced more than 477 MWh of electricity in its first operational year. The system now powers nearly 19% of the school’s annual energy needs, delivering more than $52,000 in annual utility savings, with a projected lifetime savings of $2.2 million. Additionally, the system offsets hundreds of tons of carbon emissions annually, aligning with the school’s goals for environmental stewardship and financial responsibility.

“This wasn’t just another install; it was a community investment,” said Andrew Holmstrom, business development supervisor at Arch Solar. “Many of our employees live nearby, and my own kids will one day attend Nicolet High School. Knowing that they’ll be learning under the same roof that we’ve helped transform with clean energy makes this incredibly personal. It’s not just about panels, it’s about setting an example for the next generation and showing our community what’s possible when you invest in sustainability.”

The project was part of a broader $80 million campus renovation initiative and was supported by federal and state incentives, including the Inflation Reduction Act and Wisconsin’s Focus on Energy program. With these incentives, Nicolet cut its anticipated solar project costs in half, resulting in a payback period of just 6.4 years.

[A recent Carbon Brief factcheck has highlighted more than 100 false or misleading statements in the report.]","Chris Wright, the climate-sceptic US energy secretary, has dismissed the impacts of climate change as “not incredibly important” and described the Paris Agreement as “silly”, reports the New York Times. Speaking at a thinktank on Friday, Wright – a former fracking executive – defended the Trump administration’s decision to block a nearly complete $6.2bn windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island “by saying offshore wind increases electricity prices and by downplaying the jobs at stake”, the newspaper says. It quotes an academic who points out that “there’s no evidence for that”. Regarding the impact of warming on quality of life, Wright claimed that, “in fact, if it wasn’t in the news, in the media, you wouldn’t know”, the article reports. It continues: “Wright said the focus in the US to transition away from fossil fuels had hurt the country. It’s a message he said he intended to take on a multileg trip next week to Europe, where he will encourage countries to buy more American gas. The US is currently the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas as well as the largest producer of oil.”

Speaking to reporters after the event, Wright said there was a “very active dialogue in the administration” over the fate of the blocked windfarm, Bloomberg reports. It notes: “Earlier this year, the Trump administration lifted a similar stop-work order for a windfarm being built near New York after reaching an agreement with the state’s governor over new energy projects.” Ørsted – the Danish firm developing the blocked project – has won shareholder approval for a $9.4bn emergency rights issue for new shares to “help fund US projects thrown into uncertainty”, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, E&E News says that a federal court was “sceptical” about whether it could order a pause on Trump’s presidential action – issued in January – ordering agencies to stop issuing or renewing permits for onshore and offshore wind projects.

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has announced a delay to minimum sales targets for electric vehicles – due to come into force next year – as the industry “deals with US president Donald Trump’s tariffs”, the Associated Press reports. Canadian car manufacturers will no longer have to meet the target, established by then-prime minister Justin Trudeau in 2023, requiring that 20% of cars sold in 2026 should be zero-emission, the newswire explains. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Carney said: “We have an auto sector that, because of the massive change in US trade policy, is under extreme pressure…The EV mandate adds to the liquidity issues they have…They’ve got enough on their plate right now so we are taking that off,” the article notes. The Canadian government will launch an “immediate 60-day review” to reduce costs linked to the EV sales requirement, says Al Jazeera. It notes that Carney also announced a new C$370m (£198m) biofuel production incentive. Politico, Bloomberg, BBC News, Financial Times, Reuters and CBC News all have the story.

The World Nuclear Association (WNA) has warned that a revival in nuclear energy could trigger a shortfall in uranium supplies unless new sources are found, says the Financial Times. In a report published on Friday, the industry lobby group projects that global uranium demand for reactors is set to rise by one-third to 86,000 tonnes by 2030 and to 150,000 tonnes by 2040, the newspaper explains: “But output from today’s mines is expected to halve between 2030 and 2040 as existing deposits are exhausted, leaving a ‘significant gap’ that threatens the nuclear power revival. The report called on the industry to secure investment to locate more uranium and extract it from current as well as new and idle mines to avoid a supply crunch.” According to the WNA, uranium demand is set to increase as more governments rely on nuclear power to meet zero-carbon targets, says Reuters, adding: “Concerns over energy security and independence due to geopolitical factors have also boosted interest in nuclear power, it said.”

In other news, Greg Jackson – the chief executive of Octopus Energy – has said that the UK should stop investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) for use in energy systems, reports the Financial Times. Speaking at the FT Weekend Festival on Saturday, Jackson said: “It’s a boondoggle for oil and gas and we would be better off in the UK just burning unabated gas, because the cheaper we make electricity, the cheaper our heat pumps and electrics cars are going to be, and they are the key to emissions reductions.” The Sunday Telegraph has also interviewed Jackson and leads its coverage with his criticism of curtailment fees, which the newspaper describes as the “sums handed to windfarms to switch off when the grid is too congested to handle their power”. Jackson is also not opposed to renewed drilling in the North Sea, telling the newspaper: “When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas…If we’re going to produce gas then I’ve got no problem in using local stuff.” [A Carbon Brief factcheck shows that CO2 emissions from UK production are only around 15% lower than those from LNG imports.]

There is widespread reaction to – and analysis of – policy proposals by the UK’s hard-right, populist Reform party after its two-day conference ended on Saturday. BBC News’s Ben Chu – a policy and analysis correspondent in the BBC Verify team – assesses Reform’s economic plans, including its claims that it could save £30bn every year for the next 25 years by scrapping net-zero targets. Chu notes that two-thirds of the £30bn “fiscal cost” of the net-zero transition, as estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), would be down to lost fuel-duty receipts, if people continued to switch to electric vehicles “and the government did not replace fuel duty with a new levy on road users”. Chu notes that “it’s also important to bear in mind that the OBR stresses the economic and fiscal costs to the UK” if net-zero is not achieved globally. The OBR estimates that around 3C of climate change “could add 2% of GDP to UK primary borrowing (before interest costs) by the early 2070s”, Chu adds.

Meanwhile, the Guardian’s environment reporter Helena Horton speaks to Reform members, noting that their positions on climate change and energy are more “nuanced” than the party’s leadership. The Associated Press reports that “some of the positions” that Reform leader Nigel Farage “shares with Trump, such as opposition to net-zero climate goals, are unpopular in Britain”. However, Times columnist Fraser Nelson says that fringe debates at the Reform conference are on how to abolish net-zero and promote “climate realism”. He says these events “seem a lot more popular” than the pro-net-zero talks at other party conferences. The Press Association reports that three climate protesters were removed from the conference “after shouting at Nigel Farage while he was on stage”. Finally, the Financial Times speaks to Jonathan Brown, lead of the pro-Reform UK thinktank, the Centre for a Better Britain (CBB), who says his second priority – after the UK’s fiscal situation – will be to focus on UK energy policy and “how to rebalance objectives in terms of net-zero not being the top priority”.

Writing the Financial Times, James Meadway – senior director for economics at the Opportunity Green thinktank – says that the Trump administration’s “America First” policies are “opening new spaces for action on climate change”. While ”this has not been immediately obvious”, Meadway says, new analysis from his thinktank shows that “some effects of its tariffs are actually likely to be positive for climate change”. He cites a reduction in shipping as trade falls, noting: “The benefit here is that even relatively small differences in weights and transport distances, as goods are rerouted or resourced, can add up to meaningful reductions in emissions across a massive global trading system”. Another benefit is that imported goods might be replaced with local production, or the “recycling, repair and reuse of existing products”, he says.

Elsewhere, in a Guardian “featured essay”, veteran climate activist Bill McKibben writes that solar power is the “climate solution both the right and the left can get behind”. A Washington Post editorial defends the renaming of the US Department of Defense as the Department of War.

Climate change is a problem, but fighting it is not the military’s job. Nor is nation-building.” And the climate-sceptic theoretical physicist Steve Koonin, one of five authors of the recent US Department of Energy climate report, claims in the Wall Street Journal that “reports like ours may draw a lot of anger but our work accurately portrays important aspects of climate science”.

But before rejoicing, consider what might be a kind of gas price dilemma.

This dilemma highlights conflicting goals and challenges that fuel prices raise, as well as different perspectives on energy policy. While drivers may be pleased about the relatively low gas prices, those who work in the industry may not.

Both affect the economy.

Gas prices affect transportation costs, travel and consumer confidence.

And there’s the environmentalist, who is concerned about carbon emissions and sometimes makes the case that, overall, higher gas prices are good for the planet as an incentive for people to seek and use alternative energy sources.

Emissions, they argue, are affecting climate change and producing more extreme weather and all sorts of disasters, like violent hurricanes, ice storms and droughts that cost money.

With West Texas Intermediate, a grade of crude oil, trading at about $63 a barrel, gas prices are still relatively low, 13 cents less a gallon than last week and more than $2 a gallon less than in 2022, when gasoline prices hit an all-time high.

According to AAA, the highest prices on Sept. 7 in Michigan, on average, were in Ann Arbor, $3.27 a gallon; metro Detroit, $3.26; and Benton Harbor, $3.18; the lowest, in Traverse City, $3.04; and Flint and Saginaw, $3.05.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, which also tracks gas prices, noted that Michigan and some other Great Lakes states ""saw significant relief thanks to the restart of BP’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery.""

Severe weather caused a temporary outage.

But, he said, the West Coast may see continued increases due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the shutdown of a refinery in southern California, which will keep the supply tight.

Additionally, he added, OPEC+ — a group of oil-producing nations — announced an increase in oil production starting in October, which could help keep oil prices lower for longer.

At the same time, because of the low oil prices, oil-industry companies have been laying off workers, which, overall, is also not good for the economy.

ConocoPhillips, headquartered in Houston, was one of the latest to announce job cuts. The company this week said it would slice off up to 25% of its global staff, starting before the holidays.

The news came as data showed a spike in job cuts in August nationwide and a worsening economic outlook contradicted Trump’s claim that the economy is the hottest it has been in years.

But the news also could nudge the Fed to lower interest rates.

Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts in August were up 39% from July, and up 13% from the same month a year ago. August’s total, the firm said, was the highest for the month since 2020.

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, in a Sept. 4 meeting with employees, blamed the cuts, in part, on acquisitions, Reuters reported. ConocoPhillips bought Marathon Oil a year ago, and Concho Resources and Permian assets from Shell in 2021.

But Reuters reported more than a dozen oil companies since 2024 are laying off workers, and that the oil industry job reductions undermine the president’s ""promise to increase U.S. oil and gas production and its clout in global markets.""

In February, Chevron said it would cut 15%-20% of its global workforce, and the month before that, it was reported BP would cut more than 5% of its global workforce to reduce costs and boost investor confidence.

The Trump administration has been working to overhaul America’s energy policy, rolling back emissions regulations and relaxing permitting rules, which should help boost the bottom line of fossil fuel companies.

U.S. oil prices averaged closer to $75 a barrel in 2024, and $78 a barrel the year before that. In 2022 — when, according to AAA, gas in Michigan hit a high of $5.22 a gallon — oil was trading at about $95 a barrel.

In late June, a group of tribes, nonprofits and local governments sued the administration for what they said was an unlawful termination of the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Grant programs “despite a congressional directive to fund them.”

Earthjustice, Southern Environmental Law Center, the Public Rights Project and Lawyers for Good Government filed the challenge on behalf of ECJ grant recipients to seek the restoration of the nationwide program and to require the reinstatement of awarded grant agreements, according to a press release from Earthjustice.

The 23 plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit sought to restore the $3 billion that was promised to “community-driven” projects across the country, including $20 million to Springfield for various initiatives combatting climate change.

That money is now in jeopardy after Judge Richard Leon in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to dismiss the challenge on Aug. 29, ruling that the claims must be heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

“We are disappointed in the court’s ruling, but we will continue to fight for communities across the country that relied on this EPA program to reduce pollution, increase climate resilience and build capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Earthjustice senior attorney Hana Vizcarra, in a statement. “The legal team is considering next steps.”

In a statement to Reminder Publishing, Springfield City Solicitor Stephen Buoniconti called the judge’s decision “disappointing.”

“The court ruled that the grant was in essence a contract and that the Trump administration has the executive authority to rescind the funding,” Buoniconti said. “The court decision is a major loss for the residents of the city and the region.”

The $20 million was supposed to fund a community solar project, complete home rehabilitation projects, plant 1,500 trees throughout the city and retrofit 30 one-to-four-unit homes to improve indoor air quality.

Additionally, the money would support a workforce development program for HVAC-R technicians and convert two city-owned buildings to non-grid clean energy sources while expanding their use as community resilience hubs and emergency shelter locations.

That money and other grants were part of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which was created by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act under Clean Air Act Section 138. The grants were eliminated across the country in early 2025 as part of Trump’s efforts to down size the role of the federal government in energy and environmental spaces.

In his statement, Buoniconti said that Springfield was the only city in the state to receive the grant, the bulk of which was going to reduce asthma and lead exposure. In 2019, Springfield was dubbed the “asthma capital of the country,” according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and was named the fourth most challenging place to live with asthma as of 2024.

A key tax policy change in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' means a federal tax credit that made it cheaper for Americans to buy an electric vehicle will expire after this month. Additionally, a 25% tariff on automobiles and parts from most countries, as well as other duties, are set to push vehicle prices higher.

EV Sales Are Set To Jump

The tax credits give buyers $7,500 off their 2025 tax bill if they purchase a new clean vehicle and $4,000 for a used clean vehicle — until Sept. 30, 2025. Buyers will get the credit if they have entered into a written contract and made a payment, which includes a down payment or a vehicle trade-in, before the month ends.

This month, many dealers are making a ""final, aggressive push to move remaining inventory,"" Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said in a press release. EV dealers are using advertising and promotions to bring more consumers in the door, said Brent Gruber, executive director of the electric vehicle practice at J.D. Power.

And it seems to be working. EVs are expected to account for 12% of all the cars bought in August — an all-time high. The boost was driven by consumers moving up their car purchases to beat the expiration of the EV tax credit, King said.

Tariffs Will Also Hike Prices

On top of the tax credits going away, King said tariffs are expected to increase the price of an average EV by $4,275. So far, car manufacturers have been able to offset many of the cost increases from tariffs, but they can't continue to do so long-term, Gruber said.

""Ultimately, what you'll see is prices rising on all vehicles,"" Gruber said. ""When it comes to electric vehicles, specifically, and you factor in the loss of that $7,500 tax credit, you could be talking about a product that is considerably more expensive a month from now than it is right now. It could be a double whammy for electric vehicles.""

Gruber said consumers who have been thinking about purchasing an EV should do so now, as the clean cars will likely never be priced this low again.

""[People who] are generally interested in them but haven't decided whether or not to make the leap into electricification, I would encourage those folks to at the very least go visit a dealer and get an in-person experience with the electric vehicles,"" Gruber said. ""Take advantage of this tax credit while it is here.""",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/LGzuRVfdZIMIKPG9s2FlJqnA3LU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-651424159-95b5b24dabe64beda12ab14a8ada0c6e.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:17:05.195711

However, Chinese companies seem poised to catapult further ahead based on recent announcements by CATL and BYD.
How Chinese Companies Got So Far Ahead Several factors have enabled Chinese OEMs to gain a competitive edge.
The first is a multi-year push by China into Mexico - albeit no Chinese EV companies currently produce vehicles in Mexico.
There are some exceptions, such as Ford’s licensing of battery production technology from China’s CATL for its battery production facility in Michigan.","The Canadian government has identified decarbonizing the transportation sector as one of the key levers for reducing emissions economy-wide. In 2023, the Trudeau government implemented regulations that would have required zero-emission vehicles to comprise 20% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2026, with the target rising to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. However, Prime Minister Carney recently announced the suspension of the 2026 sales target as electric vehicle (EV) sales have slowed sharply in 2025, putting the target virtually out of reach for an auto sector that is already struggling to adapt to the U.S. trade war (chart 1). In the first quarter of the year, battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles comprised 8.7% of new vehicle registrations, down from nearly 15% in 2024. The slowdown in EV sales momentum was driven in part by the drying up of federal and provincial consumer subsidies in 2025. Additionally, EV prices remain elevated relative to comparable internal combustion models, with the added disadvantage of consumer concerns regarding insufficient charging infrastructure. In recognition of the role affordability plays in EV adoption and achieving the larger goal of decarbonizing the transportation sector, the government has tasked itself with finding ways to bring more affordable EVs into the Canadian market.

To some degree, the challenges related to domestic prices and the charging infrastructure reflects a strategic choice the government made to confront perceptions of “dumping” into the Canadian market from China’s EV overcapacity, which was a byproduct of nearly two decades of significant subsidization of their industry to the tune of about US$230 billion1. This risked displacing domestic production through an unfair advantage, resulting in a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs last year. However, in doing so, Canada has inadvertently curtailed the adoption of the most advanced battery technology on the market. This risks throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Policies should be more strategically designed rather than a blanket approach. There are opportunities to enhance the domestic EV industry to improve the rate of adoption with a lower cost structure and enhanced technology while also generating domestic jobs. Partnering with China’s leading companies, if managed strategically and pragmatically, could vastly enhance Canada’s EV ecosystem and bolster the domestic industry.

How Do Global EV Technologies Compare?

Much has been written about the relative technological advantage of Chinese EV technology relative to that in North America and Europe. The technology gap is to be expected given that China began fostering this advantage nearly 20 years ago with hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to aid the sector2. However, defining this gap in more definitive terms is required to assess relative differences and the feasibility for traditional automakers to catch up.

The first consideration is how far EVs can travel on a single charge. On this front, the differences are not material between Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their Chinese counterparts (chart 2). For example, the driving range of the different trims of the 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E is between 380-515 km versus 420-530 km for BYD SUVs sold in the E.U. Moreover, these distances are already comparable to the mileage one would get from a full tank on a gasoline SUV and are more than sufficient for daily commuting for most people. EV range generally increases with the energy capacity of a battery, but larger batteries also cost more. OEMs typically balance the range and cost tradeoffs by offering different trims of the same model that have different battery sizes/range and, by extension, price.

When it comes to consumer concerns on charging time, the current best-in-class models offered by some Chinese OEMs, such as Li Auto, are slightly ahead of the top-rated offerings from western OEMs like Mercedes-Benz and Lucid (chart 3). However, Chinese companies seem poised to catapult further ahead based on recent announcements by CATL and BYD. Both noted new battery technologies that can add 520 km and 400 km of range, respectively, in 5 minutes of charging. This would be comparable to the time it takes to fill a tank of gasoline for a similar range. This is an exciting development for EV innovation, but it will take time for companies to develop vehicles that are compatible with this new technology along with compatible charging infrastructure. Additionally, electricity grid upgrades will be necessary to enable the safe accommodation of the load demand from these ultrafast chargers to avoid straining the grid. To contextualize this, the new BYD 400km/5min Super e-Platform has a maximum charging power of 1 megawatt (MW), which means the power demand of charging just 500 vehicles simultaneously would be equivalent to about 10% of Toronto’s peak demand!

The last, and most consequential, consideration is the cost of the vehicle. Once again, Chinese OEMs are miles ahead of everyone in offering affordable models in the domestic Chinese market that in some cases, are cheaper than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles (chart 4). According to data from the International Energy Agency, electric SUVs were only 2% more expensive than ICE SUVs in 2024 in China. Average electric car prices had fallen below those of conventional cars, as of 2023. In contrast, electric SUVs had a price premium of 26% in the U.S. and 20% in Germany while cars had a 21% and 38% premium in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.

Although Chinese EV manufacturers selling in overseas markets offer prices that are competitive, they are not the exceedingly low (US$10-20k) prices that are offered domestically in China. For example, the BYD Atto 3 Comfort model costs more than twice as much in Germany as it does in China.3 In part this is because when these vehicles are exported, they face higher costs related to shipping and logistics, tariffs, and vehicle specifications that conform with local standards. However, Chinese OEMs also charge higher prices net of these considerations to capitalize on stronger profit margins, in part to offset the lower profits earned in their competitive domestic market.

How Chinese Companies Got So Far Ahead

Several factors have enabled Chinese OEMs to gain a competitive edge. First, China’s EV industry has benefited from nearly two decades of production and consumer subsidies which have not only helped the industry to develop economies of scale but have also led to a battery manufacturing overcapacity. This overcapacity has driven down battery prices in China4, resulting in the low-cost EV models offered today.

Secondly, Chinese companies largely specialize in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, while in Western countries, nickel, manganese and cobalt-based (NMC) batteries are more common. While NMC batteries have higher energy density (energy capacity per unit of weight) and perform better in cold temperatures, LFP batteries are less costly since iron is more abundant and cheaper than nickel and cobalt. One estimate suggests the cost of production could be 35% lower for LFP batteries relative to NMC batteries.5 Furthermore, LFP batteries are less prone to overheating, making them more compatible with fast charging, a feature that has helped Chinese companies make significant advancements in developing fast charging technologies.6

Third, vertical integration has enabled Chinese companies like BYD to have better control over supply chain costs in a way that many non-Chinese companies (barring a few like Tesla) do not. As an example, BYD, which started as a battery manufacturer, makes its own batteries and does so at a much lower cost than leading battery manufacturers such as LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and Panasonic, which supply many western OEMs.7 This is a notable advantage as batteries comprise a large proportion of EV manufacturing costs. For EVs available in Canada, battery costs are estimated to be over a quarter of total vehicle production costs (chart 5).8

Narrowing the Gap

Given the head start in EV technology that China gave itself and the subsequent gap that prevails between Chinese and Western OEMs today, the question then turns to whether this gap can be narrowed. Over the past few years, governments in Western nations invested tens of billions of dollars into consumer and production subsidies. In turn, the gap was narrowing. However, many of these subsidies have been wound down globally and OEMs will have to compete more directly.

Currently, OEMs are focusing their efforts on the highest cost component of an EV, the battery. Companies such as GM and Ford are pivoting towards LFP batteries for new entry level models that are expected to have lower prices compared to most current models. In North America, LFP battery production is expected to increase over the next few years as the Ford plant in Michigan comes online in 2026. In Canada, the PowerCo (Volkswagen) plant in Ontario will produce LFP batteries along with other battery chemistries, with production beginning in 2027. As well, Ultium Cells (a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture) recently announced plans to convert part of its battery cell manufacturing facility in Tennessee to producing LFP batteries, with production expected to start in 2027. Other Korean and Japanese battery manufacturers are also investing in LFP batteries and ramping up production globally.

In terms of reducing charging times, non-Chinese manufacturers have been investing heavily in R&D. For instance, Samsung SDI announced about a year ago that it was on track to introduce batteries that can add 300 km of range in 5 minutes by 2026.9 While that range is now eclipsed by BYD’s 400 km and CATL’s 520 km announcements from earlier this year, it is still a big improvement relative to the current state of technology and also highlights that notable technological progress is happening outside China.

As well, many OEMs are partnering with Chinese battery makers and automakers to benefit from the technological advancements. The level of partnership varies. For instance, GM is directly buying batteries from CATL while awaiting the start of production at its Tennessee plant, while Ford is licensing battery and manufacturing technology from CATL for its Michigan plant. Other western OEMs are pursuing collaboration with Chinese OEMs to develop low-cost EV models. For example, Stellantis has acquired a 20% stake in Leapmotor and the two companies have formed a joint venture that will sell and manufacture affordable EVs outside China. The partnership is mutually beneficial as Leapmotor can expand its global sales by benefiting from Stellantis’ brand recognition and deep distribution and service networks, while Stellantis can capitalize on Leapmotor’s cost-efficient high-tech EV products to reach its EV sales targets. These types of partnerships could also enable western OEMs to learn from the operational processes of their Chinese partners, which have yielded faster vehicle development times and lower capital costs.

Global Trade Tensions, Old and New

The relative lack of Chinese EVs on the road in North America and most of Europe has been a deliberate government policy choice, with most nations implementing tariffs to protect their domestic manufacturing base. Less than a year ago, the U.S. and Canada imposed 100% tariffs on imported Chinese EVs, while the E.U. imposed 17-35% tariffs on EV firms producing in China – Tesla received a lower 7.8% tariff from the E.U. on vehicles produced in China. These measures became necessary in the eyes of these nations. EV adoption rates soared during the post-pandemic period and Chinese EV companies, many of which having already established economies of scale domestically, began to explore export opportunities. Several nations, including the U.S. and Canada, had imposed restrictions on the eligibility of Chinese EVs for consumer subsidies in years prior, but decided to take more direct action.

In contrast, other nations including the U.K., Norway, Australia, and New Zealand have not implemented measures to restrict Chinese EVs. Prior to the implementation of tariffs, the EV market share accounted for by Chinese companies in Europe was comparable across countries (chart 6). In the Oceania region, China’s relatively higher share is likely owing to geographic proximity. Interestingly, the high and low end of the spectrum are found in North America, where China’s sky-high 70% share of the Mexican EV market sharply diverges from the 0% share in the U.S. and Canada. The juxtaposition is striking, but can largely be explained by two factors. The first is a multi-year push by China into Mexico - albeit no Chinese EV companies currently produce vehicles in Mexico. The second is the exclusion of Chinese EVs from consumer subsidies in Canada and the U.S.

Canada’s tariff on Chinese EVs was implemented 4 days after the U.S. tariff went into effect, with both nations citing the risks posed to the North American market by unfair competition. This was not surprising as the two markets are heavily integrated in both production and sales. Roughly 95% of Canadian motor vehicle and parts exports are sent to the U.S. every year, while roughly 40% of U.S. motor vehicle and parts exports are sent to Canada. The former of these two statistics is largely why unilateral policy decisions in relation to the automotive industry are challenging for Canada, at least in terms of production. Since most finished motor vehicles produced in Canada are sent to the U.S. (over 80%), it would be infeasible to produce vehicles that are essentially banned by the U.S. This is not solely in relation to U.S. tariffs. The U.S. also has regulations which restrict Chinese software from being used in vehicles sold in the country.10 This means that even if a Chinese EV company were to produce vehicles in Canada that met the domestic content requirements of the USMCA, it would still be banned in the U.S. if its software was Chinese in origin. While full-scale production of Chinese EVs in Canada is unlikely, there are still several areas where Canada can look to bolster its EV industry through potential partnerships with China.

Policy Considerations

Given the EV technology gaps that remain between China and other nations and China’s desire to expand globally, some form of partnership could aid Canada in improving its EV ecosystem. This is already taking place in the sourcing of EV batteries and battery materials, with most major automakers partnering in some capacity with Chinese firms on this front. However, to date, this has largely occurred through trade, rather than investment partnerships. There are some exceptions, such as Ford’s licensing of battery production technology from China’s CATL for its battery production facility in Michigan. This is the same facility which will be used to produce the batteries for Ford’s recently announced US$30,000 electric pick-up truck.11 The question for Canadian policymakers is whether there’s a path for partnerships of this nature within its borders to the benefit of domestic workers and facilities?

Doing so would provide automakers that produce in Canada with options for enhancing partnerships with Chinese EV companies in areas such as battery components, batteries, charging infrastructure, and even EV production. Examples could include licensing agreements for battery production technology, partnerships in charging infrastructure technology, battery chemistry research and development partnerships, or joint EV platform development. Any of these options in isolation could help domestic automakers to accelerate innovation, lower production costs, and enhance consumer product offerings. Simultaneously, it would likely help Canada return its EV adoption rate to an upward trajectory by overcoming persistent consumer concerns related to cost and range anxiety. Even if these partnerships only impact the margins of the EV ecosystem, Canada could still vastly improve its EV infrastructure, providing material benefits to its economy and ambitions for EV adoption.

American automakers are already pursuing aspects of these proposals domestically and internationally by partnering with Chinese EV companies, and Canada should not overlook similar opportunities to diversify its auto production supply chain while also offering better and less expensive technology in addition to more consumer choices.

Canada is currently caught in the middle of growing strains in trading relationships with both the U.S. and China. But a strategy to diversifying auto exposure and production should not ignore the benefits of partnerships with other countries, especially a market leader like China. Canada could also consider pursuing these objectives jointly with other nations, such as the E.U., to diversify risk further.

Bottom Line

At the end of the day, there is a growing consensus that Canada needs a new gameplan when it comes to global trade and domestic policy. The EV market is a prime example of an industry that Canada has inherent competitive advantages (i.e. abundant critical minerals suitable for both LFP and NMC batteries, affordable clean energy, EV and battery manufacturing capacity, government support, and a ready-made skilled labor force in manufacturing production). This could be enhanced by partnerships with established leaders in innovation in the industry. Pragmatism will remain as essential as ever.

The two new gas plants are projected to be completed by 2031 and could be operational past 2070.
Environmental activists based in Lexington have also criticized its local government leaders for agreeing not to oppose the LG&E/KU settlement terms.
In the August PSC hearing, Chairwoman Hatton questioned Bellar on how LG&E/KU weighs the climate goals of Louisville and Lexington when determining its operation plans.
They recently passed legislation that makes it more difficult for utilities to retire coal plants.","Kentucky’s two largest cities and the parent company of its largest electric utility company each have set lofty goals to address the severe threats of climate change, seeking to reach net-zero carbon emissions in the coming years.

But environmental activists say the utility and local governments are now abandoning their greenhouse gas commitments in a proposed settlement before state regulators, in which the company seeks to build two more gas plants, extend the life of two coal plants and scrap a plan for a large battery storage facility — all part of Kentucky’s effort to attract and serve future data centers.

PPL Corporation, the parent company of Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities, announced its goal in 2021 to reduce its carbon emissions 70% from 2010 levels by 2035, then have an 80% reduction by 2040, and ultimately achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Lexington’s city council unanimously voted in 2023 to set their own community-wide net-zero carbon emissions goal for 2050, with the city unveiling more detailed plans for how to meet that goal this June.

A non-binding resolution passed in 2020 by Louisville Metro Council was even more ambitious, seeking 100% clean energy across the city by 2040 — in addition to 100% clean electricity for city government operations by 2030 and 100% clean energy for its vehicle fleet and heating and cooling systems by 2023.

Former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer signed an executive order shortly before leaving office in 2022 that put the 2040 net-zero goal in place, with his eventual successor — current Mayor Craig Greenberg — pledging during his campaign that he was “wholly committed” to meeting that goal.

Critics now say that both the local governments and LG&E/KU are essentially abandoning these net-zero goals to address climate change in a proposal that is currently before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

LG&E/KU sought permission from the PSC in February to spend $3.7 billion to build two new 645 megawatt natural gas power plants in Louisville and Mercer County, in addition to upgrades to extend the life a coal-fired plant in Carroll County and the construction of a 400 megawatt sustainable battery storage facility in Louisville. The utility laid out a case that the extra power generation was needed to meet an upward spike in forecasted demand, mostly from the energy-guzzling data centers they expected to locate in Kentucky because of new tax incentives.

On July 31, LG&E/KU announced that they had reached a proposed settlement in this case with the Kentucky attorney general, the Kentucky Coal Association and other business groups. In the stipulation, they modified the request by seeking to extend the life of an additional coal unit at Louisville’s Mill Creek plant that was set to be retired in 2027, as well scrapping plans to build the battery storage facility.

While not directly entering into the settlement like the attorney general’s office, representatives of Louisville and Lexington’s city governments did sign the agreement — stating that they take no position on the stipulation, but also pledging they “will not oppose it at the hearing” of the case before the PSC.

At the three-day hearing at the Public Service Commission headquarters in early August, both local governments stayed true to their words, as attorneys for both attended and did not weigh in or question witnesses.

That did not sit well with some in the audience who gave public comments against the LG&E/KU plan at the onset of the hearing, who said their pledge to not oppose a massive increase in fossil fuel emissions for many years to come amounted to tacit approval.

“I am also disappointed in my Metro Government, I’ll tell you,” said Kimberly Crum of Louisville. “(Greenberg) is laying down for this, and I’m disappointed in him.”

Sarah Lynn Cunningham of the Louisville Climate Action Network put her disappointment with Greenberg in more stark terms, noting that the new gas plants will likely have a life span of 40 to 50 years and stiff-arm efforts to build up Kentucky’s renewable energy portfolio.

“That was a deal with the devil, and the mayor went along with it,” Cunningham said. “We’ve got a mayor who’s saying ‘Okay, fine, bring us more fossil fuel power plants.’”

Asked by Kentucky Public Radio on the day the settlement was announced if Louisville’s agreement not to oppose it contradicted the city’s own net-zero carbon emissions goals, Greenberg spokesman Kevin Trager initially said via email he would respond later that day. Trager has still not responded in the following six weeks, despite numerous follow-up requests for comment over that period.

‘I call B.S.’ LG&E/KU extending reliance on fossil fuels

Outside the Public Service Commission office in Frankfort on the first day of the August hearing, consumer and environmental activists blasted several aspects of the LG&E/KU settlement.

In addition to fears that current ratepayers would bear the burden of paying for the new plants if new data centers did not actually materialize in Kentucky — or wind up using significantly less energy than the utility’s staggering projections — they said the proposal would double down on greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come.

Sam Avery of the Renewable Energy Alliance of Louisville said LG&E/KU wanted to spend billions of dollars “to build an enormous new obsolete climate busting fossil fuel infrastructure that will keep you and your families dependent into the second half of this century on obsolete energy sources that will ruin the climate of this earth for all living beings who live on the earth.”

Cunningham of Louisville Climate Action Network focused on the utility’s recent pledge to nearly end fossil fuel emissions in 25 years, saying the proposed build out would render that impossible.

“PPL, that owns LG&E and KU, said a few years back, 'we're going to be net-zero, no more greenhouse gas emissions after 2050,’” Cunningham said. “I call B.S. That isn't gonna happen when they do stuff like this.”

The energy generation of LG&E/KU is currently dominated by coal, but reliance on natural gas is on the rise. Power plants burning natural gas release about half the amount of carbon dioxide as coal-fired plants, but they also release significant amounts of methane, a potent, though shorter-lived greenhouse gas.

As of today, 84% of the utility’s power comes from burning coal, followed by gas at 15% and renewable energy at 1%. However, those percentages are projected to shift in the next few years, thanks to a request approved by the PSC in late 2023.

Under that PSC decision, LG&E was allowed to retire two coal units, replacing them with a new gas plant at Mill Creek in Louisville and several new solar and battery storage facilities. LG&E actually wanted to go further, but the PSC denied its request to shut down two additional coal units and build an additional gas plant — the one it now wants to build in Mercer County.

At the time of the PSC decision, LG&E estimated when these projects were complete that their energy mix would shift to 64% coal, 29% natural gas and 7% renewable energy.

Despite that shift, such an energy mix would still be well short of what would be needed to become net-zero by 2050 — and that’s before the current LG&E proposal to build two new gas plants, extend the life of two coal plants and scrap a battery storage plan. The two new gas plants are projected to be completed by 2031 and could be operational past 2070.

In the August hearing, PSC chair Angie Hatton asked Lonnie Bellar, a top executive at PPL, if the settlement to extend the life of an additional coal plant and strike the battery storage facility would change its 2050 net-zero goals.

“It potentially could,” Bellar answered. “We've stated publicly with respect to those goals, we reassess those at the end of the year. Part of that reason is to understand what the approvals are in this proceeding.”

Bellar noted that part of the settlement was an agreement that LG&E/KU conduct a request for proposal (RFP) on a new renewable energy and storage project by mid-2026, and “if we find cost-effective resources as part of that, we’ll make a filing for their approval with the commission by the end of 2028.”

But just because an RFP is conducted does not mean a project will come to fruition. LG&E issued an RFP for renewable energy projects in 2024, but chose not to pursue any of the submitted proposals.

Ken Shapero of the Louisville Climate Action Network said this aspect of the settlement is not reassuring, calling it “some vague promise that down the road there’ll be competitive bids on sustainable energy.”

‘This is not an optional goal’ Locals decry city leaders

When asked by Louisville Public Media during his 2022 campaign if he intended to fulfill then-Mayor Fischer’s 2040 community-wide net-zero goal, current Louisville Mayor Greenberg said he was all in.

“This is not an optional goal and I am wholly committed to meeting it by 2040 or sooner if possible,” Greenberg said. “We must work together to make Louisville a safer and healthier city.”

He also said the science is clear that “our climate is rapidly changing and that change is being driven by human activity, most notably the burning of fossil fuels.”

“There is near universal consensus that the time has come to begin winding down the use of fossil fuels, build a sustainable future based on renewable energy, and prepare for extreme weather pattern changes before it is too late,” Greenberg said.

While Greenberg’s administration agreed not to oppose LG&E/KU’s settlement in the PSC hearing, other Louisville elected officials showed up to the hearing to express their opposition.

Metro Councilwoman Tammy Hawkins, who represents the West End district where a massive 525-megawatt data center has been proposed, told the PSC commissioners they should not let LG&E/KU build the new gas plants — citing both the possibility of increased utility bills and environmental harms.

“Our climate and health demands that we choose energy sources that do not rely on fossil fuels,” Hawkins said. “Energy efficiency, solar and battery storage are all cheaper, safer and more reliable than natural gas.”

Metro Councilwoman Betsy Ruhe also spoke against the LG&E/KU plan, saying that renewable energy is cheaper than burning fossil fuels — counting both customer utility bills and the added costs of dealing with the effects of climate change.

“You can add all those climate impacts on here that are additionally going to cost us money,” Ruhe said. “We have higher storms. I hope you like the weather the last month or so where we went outside in the morning and it's like 78 degrees day after day after day. This is not going to get better. It is going to get worse.”

Last week, Mayor Greenberg dropped a plan to buy renewable energy certificates from a future solar energy project in western Kentucky — part of its effort to meet the city’s 2030 goal of powering city government operations with 100% clean electricity. The measure did not gain enough support among members of Metro Council to pass.

Environmental activists based in Lexington have also criticized its local government leaders for agreeing not to oppose the LG&E/KU settlement terms.

“This settlement, which commits Lexington to decades more of expensive fossil-based electricity generation, and fails to reduce demand with cost-saving options such as intensified energy efficiency programs, represents an abandonment of Lexington's net zero commitment and the needs of Lexington rate payers for affordable energy,” said Catherine Clement, a Lexington resident and member of Kentuckians For The Commonwealth, one of the groups intervening in the PSC case.

Spokespersons for Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton have not returned a request for comment.

In the August PSC hearing, Chairwoman Hatton questioned Bellar on how LG&E/KU weighs the climate goals of Louisville and Lexington when determining its operation plans. He answered that LG&E/KU offer green tariff programs where cities can pay into a renewable power agreement, but added that “you're correct in pointing out there's a natural tension there between the overall objective function that we operate off of and those individual goals.”

“And some states have green energy mandates,” Hatton added. “North Carolina has green energy mandates, but Kentucky doesn't. Maybe the opposite of that, in a lot of ways.”

“Correct,” Bellar answered. “We try to comply with all the directions of the legislature, the commission, and comply with all the environmental rules, and do that in the lowest reasonable cost.”

“So that sounds easy,” Hatton replied, sarcastically.

The Kentucky General Assembly is dominated by Republicans who are enthusiastic supporters of the state’s coal industry and skeptical of the importance or scientific reality of climate change. They recently passed legislation that makes it more difficult for utilities to retire coal plants.

Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear says he believes in the threat of climate change, but rarely mentions it unprompted in his press conferences and speeches. He touts an all-of-the-above energy approach for Kentucky.

Beshear appoints the three commissioners of the PSC, but they must be confirmed by a vote of the GOP-led Senate — which has several times declined to do so.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f4e2d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+1/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F08%2F9a78519844e1ae4fae94116c78c4%2Fdji-fly-20250905-143040-474-1757097129432-photo-optimized-2.JPG,N,,2025-09-08 12:23:52.473347

Why It Matters

Trump has long been an opponent of wind turbines. He campaigned on expanding fossil fuels for American energy and paused federal wind permits while ending tax credits that had supported renewable developments in the U.S.

What To Know

""Amazing phenomenon — Any Country that relies on Windmills is DEAD,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday afternoon. ""Their Energy Costs have gone through the roof, and their populations are angry. Windmills aren't only killing the birds, they're 'killing' lots of bad politicians who are losing their jobs because of them!""

After returning to office in January, Trump declared a national energy emergency and signed an executive order stating that federal wind leasing programs suffered from ""various alleged legal deficiencies.""

The order said that these could result in ""negative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine mammals.""

In August, the Department of Commerce announced it would be expanding the scope of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum to include 407 new product categories, including wind turbines and their ""parts and components.""

In 2023, Trump also falsely claimed at a South Carolina rally that wind turbines had killed a large number of bald eagles.

""Wind turbine collisions kill way less birds in the U.S. than domestic cats or building collisions,"" Elie Bou-Zeid, a professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University, told Newsweek. ""If he is worried about birds, he should let more Haitian immigrants into the U.S., since he says they eat the cats and the dogs.""

Bou-Zeid continued: ""Wind turbines produce the cheapest electricity in the U.S. of any source, 25 percent cheaper than combined cycle gas, which is the cheapest source of electricity from fossil fuel. So, Trump is hallucinating facts and vomiting them on social media, as usual.""

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump on Truth Social in August: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS.""

Trump, at a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland in July: ""Wind is the most expensive form of energy. And it destroys the beauty of your fields and your plains and your waterways. And look, look out there—there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills. If, when we go to Aberdeen, you'll see some of the ugliest windmills you've ever seen. They're the height of a 50-story building. And you can take a thousand times more energy out of a hole in the ground...It's called oil and gas.""

EV Pure Plays Lose a Safety Net Tesla, Rivian and Lucid are losing a major source of revenues.
That’s because Trump’s rollback not only ends consumer tax credits but also kills the market for regulatory credits.
Tesla, Rivian and Lucid were prime beneficiaries of this system.
Final Thoughts GM and Ford, with their deep gas and hybrid portfolios, are among the winners from the EV policy changes.","U.S. President Donald Trump’s unfriendly stance on electric vehicles (EVs) is set to reshape the auto industry. His “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, will end the federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30.

Until then, eligible buyers can still knock $7,500 off the sticker price—on top of other incentives— but once the deadline is here, the perk disappears. Additionally, the bill has scrapped the penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Just a few years ago, under the Biden administration, automakers were doubling down on EVs. Tax breaks, supportive policies and stricter emissions rules pushed companies to speed up their e-mobility efforts.

But things have changed now. Trump’s rollback of incentives and regulations, along with new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, is changing the economics of EVs in the United States. The shift is forcing legacy automakers to rethink their electrification plans.

Detroit’s Legacy Carmakers Welcome the Shift

For traditional automakers like General Motors GM and Ford F, the policy change comes as a financial breather. Bloomberg recently reported that this rollback could unlock billions of dollars for Detroit carmakers to reinvest in gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley even called the policy shift a “multibillion-dollar opportunity” for its gas and hybrid business. GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.

The reason is simple— without fuel economy fines, Ford and General Motors no longer need to buy regulatory credits from EV-only players. GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year. They can now redirect the money into profitable gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

GM and F currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GM and Ford Scale Back EV Ambitions

This policy reset is showing up in production plans. GM recently announced it will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ between Sept. 2 and Oct. 6. While the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups remain in production, GM has delayed its second electric truck plant and Buick’s first EV by six months. Instead, the automaker revealed $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles—clear evidence it’s not betting everything on EVs anymore.

Ford is making similar adjustments. The company cut its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn—where the F-150 Lightning is built—to a single shift. It also scrapped plans for an all-electric three-row SUV in Ontario. Instead, Ford is leaning into hybrids, especially in its best-selling truck lineup. Farley has said the Ford Blue division, which builds gas and hybrid vehicles, had been shouldering most of the compliance burden under stricter rules. With Trump’s rollback, that division stands to benefit the most. In fact, Ford is retooling its Oakville plant to make Super Duty F-Series pickups starting next year, reversing its earlier plan to build EVs there.

While Detroit’s legacy automakers view the rollback as a relief, the story looks very different for pure play EV companies like Tesla TSLA, Lucid Group LCID and Rivian Automotive RIVN, which relied heavily on incentives and credits to fuel demand and profits.

EV Pure Plays Lose a Safety Net

Tesla, Rivian and Lucid are losing a major source of revenues. That’s because Trump’s rollback not only ends consumer tax credits but also kills the market for regulatory credits.

Under the old rules, automakers that fell short of fuel-economy targets had to either pay fines or buy credits from companies that exceeded the standards—mostly EV makers. Tesla, Rivian and Lucid were prime beneficiaries of this system. Now that the fines are gone, so is the need for credits. And the impact is beginning to show.

Rivian said regulatory credits made up 6.5% of its total revenues in the first half of 2025, but it doesn’t expect any credit sales for the rest of the year. Last year, Rivian earned more than $400 million from these sales. Losing that cushion makes its path to profitability even steeper.

Lucid is facing a similar squeeze. It is already battling demand and profitability challenges, so the loss of this income stream just adds to the hurdles.

Tesla, meanwhile, is taking the biggest hit in absolute dollars. Since 2019, Tesla has generated over $10.6 billion from credit sales—profits that often made the difference during lean quarters. In the last reported quarter alone, Tesla booked $439 million from credits. While that sounds strong, it’s down nearly 50% from the $890 million it earned a year earlier. The decline has been steady, quarter after quarter, and Trump’s rollback threatens to accelerate the slide.

Final Thoughts

GM and Ford, with their deep gas and hybrid portfolios, are among the winners from the EV policy changes. They would gain flexibility, save billions in compliance costs, and push forward with vehicles that still deliver strong margins.

On the losing side are Rivian and Lucid, whose business models counted on credit revenues to partially offset losses from selling EVs. Without that extra income, their road to profitability looks longer and riskier. Tesla, too, faces margin pressure as one of its reliable profit levers disappears.

The government will conduct a 60-day review of its EV mandate policy and is waiving the requirement that 20 percent of all new car sales be ZEVs for 2026.

Data published by Transport Canada shows that ZEVs had a 13.7 percent market share in July 2024. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s mandate required at least 20 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in Canada to be ZEVs by 2026. This requirement increases to 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035.

Although EV demand is lagging behind the goal of 20 percent market share, and Canada ended its federal EV tax credit early this year, Prime Minister Mark Carney is blaming the U.S. for the change in policy. “We have an auto sector which, because of the massive change in U.S. policy, is under extreme pressure. We recognize that,” Carney said at a news conference. “They’ve got enough on their plate right now. So we’re taking [the EV mandate] off.”

Automakers and opponents of Canada’s Liberal Party have opposed the EV mandate as an unrealistic burden on the auto sector. “Now, businesses who would otherwise consider investing in automaking here in Canada will have to put that investment on hold while Mark Carney dithers for another year,” Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre told the press. He called Carney’s move a “clumsy retreat.”

Canada’s federal EV tax credit of up to CA$5,000 ended in January because the program ran out of money. Similarly, several provincial tax credits for EVs dried up this year. This has had a negative impact on EV demand in Canada.

The mirrors tilt to varying degrees throughout the day, tracking the sunrays and projecting them onto a tower. The tower houses a receiver that absorbs intense heat, boils water and produces high-pressure steam. This is then converted into 50 megawatts of electricity — enough to power over 40,000 households for 24 hours.

The KHI Solar One project is one of many looking to add renewable energy to South Africa’s power grid, which is heavily reliant on coal-fired power stations.

However, as hundreds of delegates prepare to gather in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit this week, it’s clear that many more such projects are needed to bring electricity to millions of people on the continent who need it and to fight the impacts of climate change.

Africa’s energy needs

According to the International Energy Agency, about 600 million people on a continent of some 1.5 billion live without electricity, leaving children without lights to study at night and homes without power for appliances.

The World Bank estimates that Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people have no electricity, the electrification rate is as low as 8%.

The lack of electricity also limits the continent’s access to quality health care, education and economic growth brought about by a sufficient and uninterrupted power supply.

The continent’s embracing of renewable energy has been slow when compared to more developed economies like China, European countries and the U.S., which account for 80% of renewable power capacity installed worldwide.

Only 1.5% of installed renewable power capacity is in Africa.

Renewable energy potential in Africa

According to a report by the United Nations released in July, Africa has 60% of the world’s best solar resources with the continent’s deserts and warm climate creating massive potential for solar projects.

Despite this, Africa received just 2% of global clean energy investments in 2024.

At a climate summit in January this year, African leaders committed to bringing renewable energy capacity in Africa to 300 gigawatts by 2030. That amount of power equals the output of about 114 large power stations — enough to power a large city or a small country. Meanwhile, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that 90% of Africa’s power could be generated from renewables including solar by 2050.

This includes other renewable energy sources besides solar, with countries like South Africa opting for an energy mix that includes hydropower and wind energy.

China’s rising solar exports to Africa

Some recent analysis of Chinese export data has shown that exports of solar panels to Africa have increased significantly over the last 12 months.

A report by energy think tank Ember notes that imports from China rose 60% in the last year to 15,032 megawatts, with 20 African countries setting a record for imports of solar panels in a 12-month period.

While the surge in solar panels had previously been buoyed by imports by South Africa, which went through years of power blackouts due to a lengthy electricity crisis, imports of solar panels from outside of South Africa tripled in the last 12 months.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/c4b320d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6551x3685+0+341/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F14%2F17%2Fd1bda29bb0e9cb5056e889fc4885%2Fbe9be53f1f534b64bcc8c476a06f09b3,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:13.731596

The ninth annual event celebrates innovation in clean energy, encompassing technologies such as solar, wind, storage, wave, hydropower, geothermal, nuclear, waste-to-energy, and natural gas. The event highlights the value of clean energy for promoting economic growth, creating jobs, achieving energy independence, and reducing energy bills.

Every year, the event draws a nationwide audience, particularly for its Policymakers Symposium, during which business and political leaders discuss emerging and pressing energy topics. “Since its beginning, the NCEW Policymakers Symposium has served as a platform for leaders to bring smart, commonsense clean energy ideas to the table, and we’re thrilled to see those ideas come to life again this year,” reflected Heather Reams, NCEW founder and chair, as well as Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) president and CEO. “Together, with the top voices in energy, we will discuss how America can lead the world in clean energy production while ensuring our economy and national security are at the forefront. We look forward to hosting these exciting conversations that will shape our energy future.”

The energy and technology industries are consistently well-represented at NCEW. 2024’s event, in particular, drew 56 industry experts. This year, some of the industry speakers include representatives from groups like CRES, the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), the Conservative Energy Network (CEN), the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and the National Hydropower Association (NHA).

Business leaders from companies like auto industry leader Ford Motor Company, utility-scale solar and storage company Avantus, storage company Hydrostor, renewable fuel companies Gevo and Growth Energy, fusion company Helion Energy, and gas leaders ExxonMobil Upstream Company and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) will also be in attendance.

Policymakers from both political parties are heavily involved in National Clean Energy Week. As NCEW says on its website, “National Clean Energy Week is dedicated to bipartisanship. Together, we harness the power of free market and government collaboration to create jobs, expand our economy, strengthen America’s national security and preserve our environment.”

Last year, seven administrative officials and 22 policymakers participated. Among the most prominent names were three Republican governors – Brian Kemp (R-GA), Bill Lee (R-TN), and Brad Little (R-ID). Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) were both in attendance. Members of the House included Reps. John Curtis (R-UT), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Jenn Kiggans (R-VA), Marc Veasey (D-TX), Susie Lee (D-NV), and Scott Peters (D-CA), all of whom will return this year, including Sen. John Curtis in his new position at the U.S. Senate.

On September 17, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Reps. Veasey (D-TX) and Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ) will kick off the Policymaker Symposium with their remarks. Rep. Lee (D-NV) and Rep. Kiggans (R-VA) will follow later in the morning, with Rep. Peters (D-CA) trailing in the afternoon. On the second day of the symposium, Sen. Curtis (R-UT) and Rep. Miller-Meeks (R-IA) will deliver their remarks, followed by Chairman Tim Walberg (R-MI) and Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA).

Beyond the keynote remarks, the two-day Policymakers Symposium will feature panels on a variety of pressing topics and issues:

The recent changes to and the future of energy and climate tax policy;

How investments in clean energy manufacturing can create jobs, speed up workforce development processes, and ultimately contribute to economic growth;

How domestic energy products can compete against the likes of Chinese counterparts on the world stage;

How the ethanol industry is transforming both the biofuel sector and rural communities in the Midwest;

How permitting reform can unlock America’s energy potential, simultaneously promoting energy and national security;

How domestic innovation can continue to deliver new technologies and projects, generating energy that is affordable and reliable;

How artificial intelligence is changing the energy sector, with improvements to efficiency, forecasting, and grid performance;

How to decide where to invest in a continually evolving energy market, which presents multiple challenges and opportunities;

The future of nuclear energy in America, with development possible everywhere from decommissioned plants to advanced, small nuclear reactors;

How offshore wind can contribute to filling domestic energy demand if it can overcome challenges, including permitting and leasing;

How various sectors, including policy, industry, finance, and government, can help prepare and grow energy infrastructure to meet expanding energy needs; and,

The importance of mining, processing, and recycling domestic critical minerals, while reducing reliance on foreign supply chains.

There will also be a VIP Reception and Dinner and a Young Professionals Happy Hour to provide attendees with additional opportunities to connect, learn, and network.

Much of National Clean Energy Week’s impact is felt and seen outside of the in-person gathering in Washington, D.C. Overall, last year’s NCEW generated 79 media mentions and more than 4 million social media impressions. 18 U.S. Senators and 50 U.S. Representatives engaged with NCEW content, and sixty-two governors and mayors issued proclamations recognizing Clean Energy Week.

This year, the first local leaders to issue proclamations recognizing Clean Energy Week included Gov. Henry McMaster (R-SC), Gov. Bill Lee (R-TN), Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), Gov. Tate Reeves (R-MS), and Mayor Muriel Bowser (D-DC). Since then, Gov. Brad Little (R-ID), Gov. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH), Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR), Gov. Larry Rhoden (R-SD), and Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) have joined them.

Reams noted, “This isn’t a red or blue issue—it’s a red, white and blue issue that transcends party lines. These proclamations underscore the desire states have to enhance innovation, create and retain jobs within their local economies, strengthen America’s global competitiveness and ensure our clean energy sector is not only expanded and protected, but empowered to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.”

Additionally, NCEW encourages other organizations to celebrate in their own communities by hosting their own Clean Energy Week events, such as a Policymakers Forum watch party, a local panel discussion, or a reception or networking event. NCEW will provide materials, including a communications guide, a social media toolkit, and an event kit featuring swag such as stickers, koozies, and posters, to make each of these events as successful as possible. They will also be listed as official participating organizations, highlighted on the NCEW calendar and social media channels. For example, the Puerto Rico Energy Forum is hosting a satellite event that will feature panels, workshops, and networking events.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NCEW-Policymaker-Symposium-2024TK022748-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:04:58.946244

But some say it's not enough,Not Available,,,,,https://www.kcur.org/environment-agriculture/2025-09-08/midwest-cities-clean-up-forever-chemicals-costs-drinking-water,"The class action settlements with companies including 3M, DuPont and Tyco includes hundreds of water systems across the country.
Burden of removing PFAS from drinking water PFAS are man-made chemicals that don’t break down and build up in the environment and the body.
He said public water systems are the ones primarily responsible for delivering safe drinking water to their communities.
“PFAS tends to pass through our water treatment processes, unless you upgrade them to a whole new level of engineering technology,” Strifling said.
Chemical companies face litigation Public water systems have taken PFAS manufacturers to court after detecting forever chemicals in their water systems, reaching nationwide class action settlements with the companies totaling more than $12 billion.","The city of Eau Claire in western Wisconsin had to shut down nearly half of its wells in 2021 after finding “forever chemicals” in its water supply.

The wells are close to the Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where fire fighting foams containing PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, had been used, according to the city.

Now, Eau Claire is building a $20 million filtration facility to address the issue, which it expects to open next year.

Part of the funding for that project will come from $12 million in settlements the city reached with PFAS manufacturers in 2023. But the settlement dollars the city expects to receive won’t cover the full project, said City Attorney Steve Nick.

“I would like to have seen more funds come in from this settlement, but it's still a substantial settlement,” he said. “The nature of compromise is usually you don't get everything you're looking for.”

Cities across the Midwest and Great Plains are in line for millions of settlement dollars meant to help clean up PFAS from their water supplies. The class action settlements with companies including 3M, DuPont and Tyco includes hundreds of water systems across the country.

Some cities have started to receive payments already, such as Eau Claire and West Des Moines, Iowa. Others are filing new lawsuits to help pay for removal efforts.

But the settlement dollars often fall short of the costs to eliminate the chemicals, city leaders say. And sometimes that means cities are relying on customers to cover the gaps.

Burden of removing PFAS from drinking water

PFAS are man-made chemicals that don’t break down and build up in the environment and the body. They increase risks of health problems like cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dave Strifling, director of the Water Law & Policy Initiative at Marquette University Law School, said the primary way people ingest PFAS is through drinking water. He said public water systems are the ones primarily responsible for delivering safe drinking water to their communities.

“PFAS tends to pass through our water treatment processes, unless you upgrade them to a whole new level of engineering technology,” Strifling said.

Kyle Burton is the field operations director for the drinking and groundwater program at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He said there are some proven treatment techniques to remove PFAS from drinking water, but they’re often “very costly.”

“Treatment systems for large communities can be in the tens of millions of dollars to install,” he said.

And the communities facing those high costs aren’t responsible for the pollution they’re fighting to keep out of the drinking water, said Christina Murphy, general manager of West Des Moines Water Works.

“It's absolutely frustrating,” she said. “We're not responsible for the contamination, yet we're required to meet the drinking water standards.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will set new drinking water limits for two widely studied PFAS chemicals at 4 parts per trillion, giving water systems until 2031 to comply. The original deadline was 2029, and had previously planned to set limits for four more chemicals.

Last year, the EPA estimated that between 6% and 10% of the 66,000 public water systems subject to the rule would have to take action to meet the standards.

Chemical companies face litigation

Public water systems have taken PFAS manufacturers to court after detecting forever chemicals in their water systems, reaching nationwide class action settlements with the companies totaling more than $12 billion.

The largest is with 3M, which agreed to pay between $10.3 and $12.5 billion. DuPont and its spinoffs, Tyco Fire Products and BASF contributed smaller amounts.

In most cases, Strifling said the goal is to use the settlement funds to refit water treatment plants with new PFAS removal technologies.

In a statement, a Tyco spokesperson said the company’s $750 million settlement agreement with public water systems has been approved by a court and an independent settlement administrator is processing claims and will make payments to water systems that were approved to receive funds.

“Tyco has fully funded the settlement and the court has dismissed the relevant cases against Tyco,” the spokesperson said. “Tyco resolved these cases to avoid the expense and uncertainty of litigation, and it does not constitute an admission of liability.”

Beyond the cases that have already settled, there are still active lawsuits against manufacturers of firefighting foam that contain PFAS. As of Sept. 2, there were more than 12,000 claims in a federal lawsuit against 3M and other companies, according to King Law, a law firm based in Rochester, New York.

In Missouri, Kansas City announced last month that it would file a lawsuit seeking damages related to environmental contamination caused by PFAS chemicals found in firefighting foam used at municipal sites.

“Kansas City seeks to ensure that the expenses of PFAS removal do not fall on taxpayers or the travelling public, but instead on the companies that profited while hiding the known dangers of PFAS,” a city spokesperson wrote in a statement.

Settlement dollars often aren’t enough

In Iowa, Des Moines Water Works has received notice that it will be awarded $9.7 million from a PFAS settlement with 3M, which is lower than initial estimates, according to Amy Kahler, CEO and general manager of Des Moines Water Works.

“These funds will help us continue investing in safe, clean water for the people of Des Moines while ensuring that those responsible for contamination contribute to the solution,” Kahler said in a statement.

Meanwhile, West Des Moines Water Works expects to receive a little more than $3 million across settlements with several PFAS manufacturers, according to Murphy.

Murphy said West Des Moines joined the class action lawsuit to recoup costs of either drilling more wells or investing in treatment systems. She said the water system has detected PFAS in a number of its shallow wells and is trying to identify new wells that are not contaminated.

“Unfortunately, that's proving to be a challenge,” Murphy said. “We've kind of struck out twice on trying to find wells that are PFAS-free.”

If the water system cannot find new PFAS-free water sources, she said it will have to “go back to the drawing board” and look at potential treatment options, “which is certainly going to cost a lot more money.”

She said the roughly $3 million in settlement funds will help West Des Moines drill some wells, but it’s not going to be much help if the utility has to look at treatment options.

“That money will be dedicated to any source water improvements, or even treatment improvements, if that's where we need to go,” she said. “But it will not fund 100% of the costs that we’re going to incur here.”

Some communities opt out

In Texas, Fort Worth and Dallas rejected two class action settlements in 2023 with 3M and DuPont and water systems across the country. Viewing the settlements as “inadequate,” the two cities opted out to pursue their own lawsuits against the chemical manufacturers, according to the Texas Tribune.

Hastings, Minnesota, where PFAS was present in all six city wells, also chose to opt out of nationwide settlements with 3M and DuPont.

Hastings Public Works Director Ryan Stempski said the city opted out because it calculated that it would receive $3 million to $4 million from the settlement, which is a “drop in the bucket” compared to the nearly $69 million in costs the city faces to build three PFAS treatment plants.

Instead, Hastings is trying to use settlement funds from a lawsuit Minnesota settled with 3M in 2018 for $850 million. So far, Stempski says Hastings has secured about $14 million after tying PFAS in one of its six wells to a nearby 3M plant, and it’s working with the state to connect the others.

“We haven't crossed over that hump yet,” he said. “Those are the studies going on currently. But we believe that through continuous efforts … that we can get to those interconnectivities and continue to get more funds for Hastings.”

BMW and Mercedes-Benz unveiled new models in Munich in recent days, positioning themselves in the fast-growing category led by Tesla’s Model Y.

BMW presented the iX3 while Mercedes launched an electric version of its GLC model. Both feature long driving ranges and AI assistants. Testing showed the iX3 can travel up to 497 miles on a charge while the GLC reaches 457 miles. Tesla’s updated Model Y long-range version, meanwhile, only hits 387 miles.

BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse presented the new car on Friday, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime moment” for his team. “When else do you get to reimagine a brand like BMW from the ground up?” he asked.

The launches come as Tesla is losing ground in its core U.S. market. The market share of its EV sales fell to 38% in August, the lowest level since 2017, according to research firm Cox Automotive.

The company’s share dropped from nearly 49% in June to 42% in July, the sharpest decline in more than two years. Tesla once commanded more than 80% of the U.S. EV market.

Sales of electric cars in the U.S. grew more than 24% in July as buyers rushed to benefit from federal tax credits and discounts. Tesla’s sales increased by 7% in that period, but competitors grew faster. In Europe, Tesla deliveries have declined by about one-third this year.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights, per Reuters.

""These legacy manufacturers are all benefiting from this sense of urgency, and they're able to have attractive offerings for their vehicles - and it's working,"" Valdez Streaty added.

Chinese manufacturers are also expanding in Europe with lower-priced SUVs that emphasize digital features. XPeng recently began selling its G6 model in Germany for about $55,800.

Meanwhile, industry giant BYD has overtaken Tesla’s sales in Europe this year, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. In July, Tesla’s sales in the region fell 40% year-over-year to 8,837 vehicles, while BYD’s rose 225% to 13,503.

The German automakers are also working with U.S. tech firms to upgrade digital capabilities. BMW is working with Qualcomm, while Mercedes has partnered with Nvidia, and Google and OpenAI are supplying the AI for Mercedes’ virtual assistant.

Analysts say the latest BMW and Mercedes launches mark one of the biggest efforts yet by traditional car makers to compete directly with Tesla on technology as well as performance.

But Steve Fowler, an industry consultant and car reviewer told the Wall Street Journal: “Have I seen anything in the Neue Klasse or the new Mercedes models that will make the Chinese scared? No.”

The iX3 will cost about $80,000 in Germany, according to BMW, compared with Tesla’s Model Y which starts at around $60,000 for the long-range model. Mercedes has not released pricing for its new model.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2233812129.jpg",N,,2025-09-08 12:17:28.212014

,American Energy,2025-09-08 14:59:27+00:00,Roll Call,White House embraces density concept in developing energy policy - Roll Call,Kelly Livingston,,,,,https://rollcall.com/2025/09/08/white-house-embraces-density-concept-in-developing-energy-policy/,"Density is a driving force in the administration’s energy decisions right now, a senior official in the Department of Energy’s Office of Policy said last week.
The official spoke on background for the purposes of engaging in a more candid discussion of the administration’s energy policies.
Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a system by volume or mass.
Now, the Trump administration has gutted many Biden-era grants and regulations, saying instead it will favor energy projects with greater energy and capacity density.
“If you look at fuel sources through the lens of capacity density and energy density and capacity factor, by default, some sources will be more attractive than others,” the senior DOE official said.","As the federal government reimagines American energy policy this year, support for projects hinges on a new metric — density.

The concept of density in energy production echoes throughout recent regulatory changes and funding rescissions across the Trump administration, leading to a demonstrably increased federal preference for fossil fuels and nuclear power over renewable generation sources such as wind and solar.

Broadly speaking, relying on density metrics prioritizes greater energy outputs for less investment of money and land. Density is a driving force in the administration’s energy decisions right now, a senior official in the Department of Energy’s Office of Policy said last week. The official spoke on background for the purposes of engaging in a more candid discussion of the administration’s energy policies.

“This government, like any government, has a limited amount of capital, and what we are committed to is ensuring that we get for the American taxpayer maximal return on our investment,” the DOE official said. “And what that often means is not just investing in a resource that gives us as much energy as possible — as that resource can generate — but also ensuring that that resource gives us as much energy as possible for every dollar of government investment.”

The official pointed to four measures—energy density, capacity density, capacity factor and cost—as keys to the administration’s strategy.

Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a system by volume or mass. Capacity density looks at how much energy a source offers relative to the amount of space it takes up — meaning sources that can offer stronger output with a smaller spatial footprint are preferred. Capacity factor considers actual energy output from a source over a given time period, compared to that same source’s maximum capacity — a metric that may cause intermittency to be viewed as a disadvantage.

The official said these measures complement a commitment from President Donald Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright “to ensuring efficient use of taxpayer funds,” adding, “From that perspective, when we also think about how much we are investing in many of these plants and resources to deploy these energy sources across the United States, it certainly does matter. It matters quite a lot.”

However, some congressional Republicans from districts with a lot of renewable energy projects — considered less desirable by some of the administration’s preferred metrics — have taken umbrage with some recent policy shifts, preferring more of what they call an “all-of-the-above” approach.

Rethinking U.S. energy priorities

The desire to use density and capacity metrics to determine how the government can get more energy for less money and effort has transformed the energy priorities of the U.S. presidency since January.

Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. government allocated billions of dollars to build out wind and solar capacity while placing harsh restrictions on coal and natural gas. They emphasized concerns about climate change and hopes that a cleaner energy mix would slow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to support their energy strategy.

Now, the Trump administration has gutted many Biden-era grants and regulations, saying instead it will favor energy projects with greater energy and capacity density.

“If you look at fuel sources through the lens of capacity density and energy density and capacity factor, by default, some sources will be more attractive than others,” the senior DOE official said.

In just the last month, the Trump administration has taken a series of actions against wind and solar projects, as well as others favoring coal, oil and nuclear power.

Abrupt rescissions of funding and approvals from the departments of the Interior and Transportation have stymied wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Michigan and California.

Solar projects also have been targets for funding cuts. The Agriculture Department announced it would stop subsidies for solar installations on the nation’s farmland. And the administration’s termination of the Biden-era “Solar for All” program pulled back $7 billion in grant funds for solar projects across the country.

At the same time, the Interior Department has approved multiple coal mine expansions and rolled out an expanded offshore oil leasing schedule. And the White House has set new and ambitious goals to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear power, which the DOE is supporting with regulations and resources.

“It does appear that they’re stacking the deck against certain technologies,” said Doug Vine, director of energy analysis at the nonpartisan think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.

Nick Loris, executive vice president of policy at the Conservative Coalition for Climate (C3) Solutions, agreed, saying the administration’s actions indicate an escalating “resource bias war” between Democrats and Republicans.

“There was always a bit of resource biases between Democrats and Republicans in that typically Republicans are favoring fossil fuels and nuclear, and the Democrats are favoring renewables,” he said.

Even though Republicans have recently championed an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, Loris said there’s been a noticeable shift.

“That’s certainly changed a bit, I would say, in the past several months with just the more political attacking of wind, primarily, but also solar to some extent and battery technologies and EVs to some extent,” he said. “So a little bit of a regression from the ‘all-of-the-above’ language to more specific attacks on specific technologies and industries.”

But the “all-of-the-above” strategy always had some ambiguity, Loris said, as there hasn’t always been clarity about whether the slogan meant the nation should subsidize projects so that all forms of energy flourish or if politicians should leave things up to market factors without providing subsidies or regulations.

Sticking to ‘all of the above’

On Capitol Hill, some Republicans who espouse an “all-of-the-above” approach have taken issue with some of the administration’s recent moves.

After news broke in late August that the administration would withdraw approval for a wind project off the coasts of Delaware and Maryland, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called on the White House to reconsider.

“As a supporter of an ‘all of the above’ approach for energy, which will lead to energy dominance for America, I find it odd that Pres. Trump would kill this 1,000 job project,” Bacon said in a post on X. “Our country needs a balanced mix of clean & reliable energy so we don’t have to rely on energy imports from Russia, Venezuela, & others. This project was 80 percent complete, with an investment of $1.3B already in the ground. I urge the Admin to reconsider this move.”

And ahead of the August recess, Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, put a hold on three Treasury Department nominations as a form of protest while he awaited the department’s guidance on new tax credits for wind and solar projects. The guidance, which has since been released, cut one of the two ways projects could previously qualify for the credits.

But the administration argues its moves don’t demonstrate “misalignment” with its party’s energy priorities.

“When we think about ‘all of the above,’ what we are saying fundamentally is that we are not going to prioritize a very specific energy source for reasons, frankly, that have nothing to do with improving the affordability, the reliability and the secure access to that source,” the senior DOE official said. “So I do not see a misalignment, as far as that’s concerned.”

Democrats focus on wind and solar

So far, references to density as justification for rescinding approvals and funding for wind and solar projects are not landing on the political left.

“It’s everything they can concoct to kill off clean energy and open up millions of acres of public land to fossil fuel development,” Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said. “None of this is a surprise.”

Congressional Democrats have shown increasing frustration over the cancellation of wind and solar projects, most of which have aimed at projects in blue states.

In a business meeting of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last week, ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., lamented the recent cancellations of projects off the coast of his home state, where he noted offshore wind is an “enormous industry.”

“About a little over a week ago, when a thousand trades workers were putting their gear together to go out and do their well-paid work on this facility, which is already 80 percent complete — out of the clear blue sky with no notice or warning, came a stop work order bringing the entire project to a halt,” Whitehouse said. “There’s been no plausible explanation of why, other than the individual predilections of a president who doesn’t like windmills.”

Energy demand on the rise

Demand for electricity is increasing across the U.S. for the first time in about 20 years, according to the Energy Information Administration. That upward trend often is attributed to increasing needs from AI data centers and industry.

With energy needs on the upswing, the Trump administration is making the case that by considering density and capacity, the government will get more for its money. Walking back some of the previous administration’s investments in favor of other sources is part of that effort.

“The administration’s commitment is to not prioritize very specific energy sources that, frankly, don’t necessarily deliver on their commitment,” the DOE official said, adding that capacity factor was a great example for offering generation comparisons.

The official said studies show “in general, the average capacity factor for a solar or wind farm is somewhere between 20 to 32 percent. That is remarkably low.”

“The average capacity factor for a nuclear plant is 92.5 or higher percent,” the official added. “If you are the government, and you are trying to ensure that energy is affordable, reliable and secure, which source would you pick?”

There are complications related to every energy source though, said Vine of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. For instance, he said, although nuclear power may offer greater density and capacity, it takes much longer to build out than wind and solar. And though wind and solar have greater capacity challenges, pairing solar with batteries or spreading wind farms over more land can help address those, he said.

“The electric power system has been referred to as one of the most complex systems that we’ve ever devised,” Vine said. “Each technology brings something.”

As debate continues over what the ideal energy mix to address the nation’s rising demand should be, C3 Solutions’ Loris said there’s a “very legitimate tension” among some Republicans about the administration’s pushback on wind and solar — including some sentiments that the agencies are “erecting barriers” that unnecessarily harm clean energy projects.

Whether Congress chooses to take that up this fall remains to be seen, Loris said. “If they are going to fight that fight, it’s going to be through a legislative process that really tries to fix permitting reform for all energy sources and technologies.”

“I think that’s the best hope in which you can kind of defang the agencies’ ability to block projects or put up additional regulatory barriers, if you fix some of those abilities to do so through the legislative process,” he said.

These approvals were issued by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC).

The approved projects include a 200MW facility in Coffee County with a 30-year PPA, a 260MW facility in Mitchell County with a 25-year PPA, and a 225MW facility in Laurens County with a 20-year PPA.

They also include a 183MW facility with 91.5MW battery storage in Wilkinson County and a 200MW facility in Jefferson County. Both projects come with a 20-year PPA.

These projects will support the company’s Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) 2023 programme.

They will be developed and maintained by third-party companies that bid in the CARES 2023 request for proposal (RfP), approved in the 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP) final order.

Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP, sanctioned in July, outlines up to 4GW in renewable energy procurement by 2035.

The company will initially focus on securing 1.1GW through utility-scale and distributed generation procurements.

The company plans to issue RfPs in 2026 for these additions, aiming to boost its renewable resource capacity to roughly 11,000MW by 2035.

Georgia Power director of renewable development Wilson Mallard said: “Renewable RfPs, such as the CARES 2023 RfP, are designed to procure valuable renewable energy that helps to diversify Georgia Power’s generation mix and increase reliability. Our planning models project that these resources will deliver benefits to customers long-term.

“The five projects we selected are economical and we expect they will provide energy and capacity benefits to the system and the most value for all Georgia Power customers.”

Released following approval in the 2022 IRP final order, the CARES 2025 RfP had set an August deadline for bid submissions.

Participants in this year’s CARES RfP were invited to propose utility-scale solar or solar plus storage projects, aiming to fulfil a quota of up to 2GW of utility-scale solar, which encompasses any outstanding capacity from the previous CARES 2023 RfP programme.

These projects are anticipated to be operational as early as 2028.

This May, Georgia Power initiated construction on new battery energy storage systems (BESSs) across Georgia, totalling 765MW.

Late last fall, my neighbors and I received a notice from our utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, informing us of proposed rate increases from an eye watering $761.3 million Billing Modernization Initiative. Digging further into their filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E highlights the need to update a profoundly outdated system, featuring a potpourri of vendor and custom in-house software from the 1990s and 2000s, much of it written in a programming language (COBOL) that peaked in popularity last century and for which there are vanishingly few engineers with expertise in it.

Additionally, the filing highlights that the billing system has been unable to keep pace with regulatory needs, forcing delays and complex workarounds. In brief, PG&E’s key digital systems are unable to satisfy business needs and therefore need an expensive overhaul, raising customer rates. As a result, my monthly electric bill is going up.

I pick on PG&E because I’m their customer and they offer a good example, not because they are an industry exception.

Most utilities and regulators struggle with these very same digital modernization challenges. Billing is a core function for any business. If utilities can’t maintain their core systems, then how can they be expected to roll out and operate more advanced digital functionality such as dynamic rates, distributed energy resource orchestration, virtual power plants, demand response programs, electric vehicle charging optimization and AI, all while defending against ever-increasing cyber security attacks and maintaining affordability? Short answer: they can’t, not without a serious culture change to become technology companies that embrace best practices for digital innovation.

As part of their CPUC filing, PG&E notes that Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric launched similar billing system upgrades in 2016 and 2017, respectively. This key point offers us a thread to pull on and the pathway to that culture change. Let’s take a brief detour to other industries, and then circle back here.

Sharing is caring (about efficiency)

Software engineers are known to be proudly lazy, with a penchant for automating repetitive tasks and creating shared, reusable building blocks to avoid duplication of effort. These building blocks are like Legos that get reassembled, repurposed and built on top of to create ever more complex software applications.

You may think that this sharing is limited to within one organization, but in fact it is industry-wide and even frequently happens between competitors. This collaboration is done through an approach called “open source,” in which software code is shared freely with others to reduce barriers for adoption and contribution. These shared software building blocks solve industry-wide problems more quickly, cheaply and securely than any one organization can do it themselves.

This approach has been wildly successful, delivering widespread and pervasive technologies such as Linux (an operating system ubiquitous across data centers and embedded devices), Kubernetes (runs most cloud workloads), and PyTorch (used to create many modern generative AI models). All of your modern digital tools, such as Microsoft’s products, are built on top of open source foundations. From Microsoft: “Our developers use more than 200,000 open source components every month while building products and services.”

As open source technology and collaboration has matured, industries have embraced it as a key business strategy to reduce costs, drive interoperability and maintainability, and improve cybersecurity.

The most visually appealing example is the film industry. Technology companies like AWS, Microsoft and NVIDIA work with film studios like Dreamworks, Sony Pictures and Disney to co-create the shared digital infrastructure for movies. The results are Oscar-winning pictures like Flow and Dune, powered with open source technologies. For a more heavily-regulated industry, look to finance. These aren’t your grandfather’s banks. Modern financial institutions are tech companies, fully embracing digitalization as a way to drive customer value, lower costs and improve security. Through the FINOS initiative, dozens of banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan join technology vendors like Google and Red Hat to solve problems faced by all banks, such as regulatory compliance, interoperability and data access. And to explore an industry using more operational technology, look to telecom where mobile operators like T-Mobile and Verizon collaborate with vendors such as Infosys, Nokia and Qualcomm.

These industries and others have learned that there is business value in creating an ecosystem of shared technology building blocks. All participants mutualize the investment cost to develop foundational elements necessary to drive the industry forward, pieces that are table stakes for the market to grow. Customers like the film studios, banks and mobile operators are able to work directly with their vendors not on static requirements documents, but on actual, working technology that can evolve and be iterated upon with industry needs. As an added benefit, working together in the open forces software development best practices, driving even more improvement. The resulting technology is useful, secure and scalable enough to execute sensitive financial transactions and operate massive telecom networks.

The status quo is a dead end. Open collaboration delivers affordability and more.

Now, back to PG&E and their Billing Modernization Initiative. They note that SCE and SDG&E recently launched similar efforts. Instead of each utility pursuing their own, independent initiative, what would it look like if they borrowed from the digital best practices exemplified by the film, banking and telecom industries?

The IOUs of California would get together and scope out areas of overlap. Once defined, they could engage with multiple technology providers to co-create the shared building blocks needed across all of them. The resulting technology assets would be open source, ensuring transparency to regulators and rate payers, straightforward cybersecurity audits, and implementation of software development best practices such as automated testing and continuous integration.

With these shared building blocks in hand, each utility could assemble them and customize as needed for their business, leveraging in-house expertise or technology vendors as needed. Because much of the investment burden was shared by utilities, overall initial development and ongoing maintenance costs are lower, and development speed is higher because resources can be focused on initiatives that directly deliver added value. Vendors waste less time on interoperability and instead can focus on strategic differentiators. And instead of going up, my utility bill goes down because PG&E is able to better optimize the grid through dynamic rate structures.

Keeping the status quo digital practices will yield more of the same — delayed projects, exploding budgets, and software that doesn’t work. We’ll never deliver on the energy transition if we stay on this path. It’s time for a culture change. Utilities and regulators should look to other industries and how they leverage open collaboration to lower costs, accelerate development and improve maintainability. Digital modernization should drive costs down, not up, allowing utilities to fully use physical infrastructure and avoid larger investments.

PV Tech reached out to energy analyst RMI about the role of fossil fuel projects in various US states’ IRPs earlier this year, and asked whether continued interest in fossil fuel developments reflects a lower levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for fossil fuel projects versus renewable alternatives.
“Our planning models project that these resources will deliver benefits to customers long-term,” said Wilson Mallard, director of renewable development for Georgia Power, of the five solar projects signed under the CARES programme.
“The five projects we selected are economical and we expect they will provide energy and capacity benefits to the system and the most value for all Georgia Power customers.”","The CARES programme allows commercial and industrial (C&I) customers to purchase a subscription for a share of a project’s renewable electricity generation, and the five projects approved under this programme will be built and maintained by third-party companies that made bids in 2023.

Across the five projects, the utility has signed off on PPAs lasting for at least 20 years: a 200MW project in Jefferson County and a 225MW project in Laurens county received 20-year offtake agreements; a 260MW project in Mitchell County signed a 25-year PPA; and a 200MW project in Coffee County signed a 30-year offtake deal. The fifth project is a 183MW solar project in Wilkinson County, to be paired with a 91.5MW battery energy storage system (BESS), which signed a 20-year offtake agreement.

The utility also closed bids in August for the 2025 edition of the CARES programme, making a request for proposals for up to 2GW of utility-scale solar, as Georgia Power looks to grow the proportion of solar in its energy mix. In July, the PSC approved the utility’s latest integrated resource plan (IRP), which will see the utility aim to add 4GW of new renewable power capacity by 2035.

Fossil fuels and renewables in Georgia

However, some of the IRP includes provisions for an expansion of a nuclear power plant and upgrades to a natural gas plant, as the utility looks to meet what it expects to be a growth in electricity demand of 8.5GW by the end of the decade.

PV Tech reached out to energy analyst RMI about the role of fossil fuel projects in various US states’ IRPs earlier this year, and asked whether continued interest in fossil fuel developments reflects a lower levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for fossil fuel projects versus renewable alternatives. An RMI spokesperson told PV Tech that fossil fuel LCOE has grown over time, and that “the price of a gas turbine when contracts are signed may be significantly higher than the price estimated during planning.”

The spokesperson went on to use the example of the Cayuga combined-cycle plant in Indiana, where procurement costs for the project were 36% higher than were estimated in previous IRPs, raising questions about the long-term financial security of fossil fuel investments in state IRPs.

Meanwhile, figures from Lazard show that the LCOE for utility-scale solar in the US fell 4% between 2024 and 2025, the third consecutive year that the LCOE of US solar has fallen.

“Our planning models project that these resources will deliver benefits to customers long-term,” said Wilson Mallard, director of renewable development for Georgia Power, of the five solar projects signed under the CARES programme. “The five projects we selected are economical and we expect they will provide energy and capacity benefits to the system and the most value for all Georgia Power customers.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/origis.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:19:48.867625

Most importantly for the solar industry, the OBBBA cuts short many of the federal tax credits previously available as a result of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Market and policy uncertainty for the solar industry has escalated over the last year, concretely impacting project development.

Most significantly since our last report, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law on July 4th and has fundamentally changed the federal policy landscape for energy.

In our US solar market insight Q3 2025 report, created in collaboration with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), we report on the downgrade of our US solar outlook since passage of the bill, as well as a low case forecast that captures further uncertainty from new Treasury guidance and permitting constraints.

Purchase the full report here, download the executive summary, or read on for some key highlights.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is a seismic shift for the solar industry

Officially signed into law on July 4th, the OBBBA has fundamentally changed the federal policy landscape for energy. Sweeping changes to tax credits across numerous technologies as well as new Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements will serve as an inflection point for multiple trends across the power sector. Most importantly for the solar industry, the OBBBA cuts short many of the federal tax credits previously available as a result of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The solar industry will no longer have access to the Section 48E and 45Y tax credits after 2027 or the Section 25D tax credits (for customer-owned residential solar) after 2025. These tax credits were previously available in full until US greenhouse gas emissions reached 25% of 2022 levels – a threshold that Wood Mackenzie forecasts would not occur until after 2040. However, if a solar project starts construction on or before July 4, 2026, it has at least four years to come online to earn tax credits. Otherwise, solar projects that begin construction after that date must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to be eligible for 48E and 45Y credits.

Given this new policy context, solar project developers are acting quickly to advance projects in their pipeline. From 2025-2030, our base case outlook puts total solar deployments at 246 GWdc – 4%, or 11 GWdc, lower than our pre-OBBBA outlook. The negative impacts of the OBBBA are muted in the near-term. This is due to projects already underway, the rush to bring projects online before tax credit deadlines, and intense demand for power supply as new gas generation has become more expensive and less available.

Our low case forecast captures downside risk from new US Treasury guidance and permitting uncertainty

On top of these massive tax credit changes, the solar industry is navigating several other federal policy actions. On July 15th, days after passage of the OBBBA, the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued a memorandum stating that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will need to personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for solar and wind projects. The scope of the memo is still unclear – it named dozens of actions that projects might need to take (whether they are directly sited on federal lands or not) that would be under heightened scrutiny.

Additionally, the Treasury Department issued new guidance on August 15th that made changes to the formal definition of the “beginning of construction” for solar and wind projects utilizing federal tax credits. Under the former definitions, a project could begin construction by one of two pathways: incur at least 5% of the project’s costs (referred to as the “Five Percent Safe Harbor”) or begin onsite or offsite “physical work of a significant nature” (known as the “Physical Work Test”). Once a project uses either pathway, it must be placed in service no later than the end of the calendar year that is four years after the beginning of construction.

Effective September 2nd, the new Treasury guidance mostly maintains these criteria. But for projects over 1.5 MWac, it removes the Five Percent Safe Harbor option, requiring these projects to utilize the Physical Work Test. While the solar industry is familiar with the Physical Work Test, it offers fewer bright line tests than the Five Percent Safe Harbor. This will create some uncertainty for solar projects aiming to start construction after September 2nd. And importantly, the Treasury noted that it has not yet addressed construction-start rules for the sake of the new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements that will apply to projects starting construction in 2026.

We’ve included a low case forecast of solar deployments in addition to our base case forecast this quarter to capture these additional uncertainties. Our low case outlook has more pessimistic assumptions for federal permitting and Treasury Department guidance.

Our five-year outlook predicts 246 GWdc of solar installations, with 18% downside risk (44 GWdc) in our low case

Our low case forecast results in about 30% less solar capacity coming online in 2026 and 2027 compared to our base case. The differential between the two forecasts softens from 2028 onward, averaging 17% less capacity in the low case.

Strong demand for new energy supply and rising power prices strengthen the market fundamentals for new solar projects in the long term. Overall, our low case is 18% lower (44 GWdc) than our base case over the next five years. The market reality for the solar industry will be shaped by federal policy actions and their outcomes in the coming months.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/solar/macro_solar/macro_power_istock-471670114.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-09-08 16:03:23.030323

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

These digital models simulate and optimise real-world energy systems like wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, and biomass.

But while they hold immense promise for improving efficiency and sustainability, the technology is still riddled with challenges – from environmental variability and degraded equipment modelling to data scarcity and complex biological processes.

As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, researchers at the University of Sharjah, UAE, are turning to a cutting-edge technology that could reshape the future of energy: AI-powered digital twins.

According to the researchers, these digital replicas of the physical world have the potential to transform the generation, management, and optimisation of energy across diverse clean energy platforms, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, which environmental scientists associate with global warming.

A cornerstone of innovation across industries

Digital twins' ability to replicate and interact with complex systems has made them a cornerstone of innovation across industries, driving improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and the development of novel solutions.

However, the scientists caution that current digital twin models still face notable limitations that restrict their full potential in harnessing energy from sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass.

""Digital twins are highly effective in optimising renewable energy systems,"" the researchers write in the journal Energy Nexus. ""Yet, each energy source presents unique challenges – ranging from data variability and environmental conditions to system complexity – that can limit the performance of digital twin technologies, despite their considerable promise in improving energy generation and management.""

In their study, the authors conducted an extensive review of existing literature on the application of digital twins in renewable energy systems. They examined various contexts, functions, lifecycles, and architectural frameworks to understand how digital twins are currently being utilised and where gaps remain.

To extract meaningful insights, the researchers employed advanced text mining techniques, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. This scientifically rigorous approach enabled them to analyse large volumes of raw data and uncover structured patterns, concepts, and emerging trends.

From this in-depth analysis, the authors drew several key conclusions. They identified research gaps, proposed new directions, and outlined the challenges that must be addressed to fully harness the potential of digital twin technology in the renewable energy sector.

Following a detailed discussion on the integration of digital twins across various renewable energy applications, the authors summarised their most significant findings across five major energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass.

Opportunities

Each source presents unique opportunities and challenges, and the study offers a comprehensive overview of how digital twins can be tailored to optimise performance in each domain.

The study reveals that digital twins offer significant advantages across various renewable energy systems:

Wind energy: Digital twins can predict unknown parameters and correct inaccurate measurements, enhancing system reliability and performance.

Solar energy: They help identify key factors that influence efficiency and output power, enabling better system design and optimisation.

Geothermal energy: Digital twins can simulate the entire operational process – particularly drilling – facilitating cost analysis and reducing both time and expenses.

Hydroelectric energy: The AI-driven models simulate system dynamics to identify influencing factors. In older hydro plants, they are used to mitigate the impact of worker fatigue on productivity.

Biomass energy: Digital twins improve performance and management by offering deep insights into operational processes and plant configurations.

But the authors' contribution to the field stands out in highlighting critical limitations in the application of digital twin technology across these energy sources. Their analysis underscores the need for more robust models that can address specific challenges unique to each renewable energy system.

Limitations

The authors identify several limitations in the application of digital twins across different renewable energy systems:

Wind energy: Digital twins face challenges in accurately modelling and monitoring environmental conditions. They struggle to simulate critical factors such as blade erosion, gearbox degradation, and electrical system performance – particularly in ageing turbines.

Solar energy: Despite their potential, digital twins still fall short in reliably predicting long-term performance. They have difficulty tracking panel degradation and accounting for environmental influences over time, which affects their accuracy and usefulness.

Geothermal energy: A significant obstacle is the lack of high-quality data, which hampers the ability of digital twins to simulate geological uncertainties and subsurface conditions. The technology also faces complexity in modelling the long-term behaviour of geothermal systems, including heat transfer and fluid flow dynamics.

Hydroelectric energy: Applied to hydroelectric projects, digital twins face challenges in accurately modelling water flow variability and in capturing environmental and ecological constraints. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in optimising system performance and sustainability.

Biomass energy: When used with biomass energy systems, digital twins still struggle to simulate the entire production supply chain. They fall short in providing precise models for biological processes, biomass conversion, and the complex biochemical and thermochemical reactions involved.

The authors emphasise the broader implications of these shortcomings for the renewable energy sector. To address these challenges, they offer a set of guidelines and a research roadmap aimed at helping scientists enhance the reliability and precision of digital twin technologies.

Their recommendations focus on improving data collection methods, advancing modelling techniques, and expanding computational capabilities to ensure digital twins can deliver trustworthy insights for decision-making and system optimisation.",https://www.engineersireland.ie/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/12283/img-a1m-digital-twin-of-oil-rig.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:04:41.559674

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she is optimistic about reforming the federal permitting process for energy projects.
“One of the things that’s holding you all up, the state up and others up for building is the permitting process,” she said.
Capito said she hopes her committee can produce a bill with “reasonable deadlines” that treats all types of energy projects the same.
“We’re going to have a shortage of power if we cannot permit and we cannot move forward with energy development,” Capito said.
“We have the resources here in this country, but we’ve got to get to permitting.” Capito said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the ranking member on the committee, also supports reform.","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she is optimistic about reforming the federal permitting process for energy projects.

Capito, who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, recently told attendees of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting and Business Summit that a bipartisan compromise finally could be possible after numerous stalled attempts.

“One of the things that’s holding you all up, the state up and others up for building is the permitting process,” she said. “The regulatory morass of trying to build something in this country is just ridiculous. It’s overburdened, it’s timely, it’s costly and some people just give up.”

Capito cited the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a natural gas project that faced years of delays due to lawsuits from environmental groups and ultimately required an act of Congress to be completed.

“Even though it sat there 95% complete,” she said.

Capito said she hopes her committee can produce a bill with “reasonable deadlines” that treats all types of energy projects the same.

“If you’re building a solar farm or if you’re building a natural gas pipeline or you’re doing a coal mine, if you can get the permit, you can go,” she said. “Quite honestly, the Biden administration had their foot on the scale for all renewables, and that’s where we ended up having even more time and more projects canceled and less energy.”

The country is expected to require more energy than ever before to power data centers and artificial intelligence systems, making permitting reform even more important, she said.

“We’re going to have a shortage of power if we cannot permit and we cannot move forward with energy development,” Capito said. “We have the resources here in this country, but we’ve got to get to permitting.”

Capito said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the ranking member on the committee, also supports reform.

“He and I are rolling up our sleeves and trying to find a solution,” she said. “He can’t get his solar panels built and I can’t get my coal mines open, or my natural gas pipelines or my wind farms if we can’t get this permitting done.”

Capito, along with former Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., has supported numerous attempts in recent years to overhaul the permitting process.

The delegation’s efforts to pass legislation have taken various forms over the past two years — as standalone bills, as deals with the White House and as part of larger legislative packages — but all have included reining in project timelines and limiting legal challenges.

Manchin called reforming the permitting process the “final goal” of his time in the Senate but was unable to see the project to fruition before stepping down at the start of the year.

In a 2022 op-ed, Manchin said the process is “broken” and “consumed by bureaucratic delays and endless litigation at every turn.”

“Let me be clear: The road ahead to enact meaningful permitting reforms is not easy,” Manchin wrote. “But if we put partisan politics aside and truly work on behalf of all West Virginians and the American people, like they deserve, then we can find a solution that strengthens our energy security and ensures America remains a global energy leader.”",https://www.capito.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:17.950936

Dive Brief:

Indiana’s governor last week pressed for lower utility rates from investor-owned companies with utilities in the state: AES, American Electric Power, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy and NiSource.

“We can’t take it anymore,” Gov. Mike Braun, R, said in a Sept. 3 press release. Braun directed Abby Gray, the state’s new ratepayer advocate, to evaluate utility profits and look for cost-saving measures that would ease utility rates. “I would also like to see the utilities’ investors bear more of the cost of doing business,” Braun said.

Analysts with Jefferies and Capstone say they doubt Braun’s comments will derail a proposal to create NIPSCO Generation, a company affiliated with NiSource’s Northern Indiana Public Service Co. that would build and own power plants to serve data centers and other “megaload” customers.

Dive Insight:

The action in Indiana highlights the nationwide affordability pressures that are colliding with the potential need to build power plants and power lines to serve planned data centers, manufacturing plants and other loads.

In Indiana, average residential electric bills surged about 17.5% over the 12-month period ending July 1 — the most in 20 years, according to analysis from Citizens Action Coalition, a ratepayer-focused advocacy group based in Indianapolis. Average residential bills increased 9.3% during that period in 2023-2024, the group said.

NIPSCO’s average residential bills saw the highest increase in the state, jumping 26.7% this year and 17.8% in 2024, followed by CenterPoint at 24.9% and 7.1% in the same periods, Duke at 19.8% and 1%, AES at 12% and 11.9%, and AEP’s Indiana Michigan Power at 3.9% and 8.8%, CAC said.

AES Indiana is seeking a two-part rate increase that could total about 13.5%, or $21 a month, for a typical residential customer by 2027, on top of a 6% increase set to take effect next year.

In other Indiana utility news, two members of the five-member Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Sept. 3 said without explanation that they are leaving the agency next month, before their terms expire. IURC commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett plan to step down on Oct. 10 and Oct. 17, respectively.

Freeman has been an IURC commissioner since September 2016; Bennett has served at the agency since May 2023. Freeman’s term expires on Jan. 1, 2026, and Bennett’s term ends April 1, 2026.

“Both commissioners were heavily involved in industry stakeholder engagement, including at [the] National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, and known favorably by investors,” Jefferies equity analysts said Thursday. The action is a “clear negative development” for NiSource, but also for the other IOUs in the state, the analysts said.

Braun’s comments on utility rates were likely driven by voter pressure, according to research firm Capstone. “However, we do not believe his messaging will result in meaningful rate impacts for utilities or an unfavorable IURC composition, given his alignment with Trump interests and a desire to maintain a favorable business environment in Indiana,” analysts said in a client note on Friday.

Capstone analysts said they expect the IURC will likely approve NIPSCO Generation’s data center power proposal before Bennett and Freeman leave the agency. If they leave before the decision is made, the IURC will still have a quorum to make a decision, they noted.

“We also believe Braun to be supportive of NIPSCO and other utilities’ efforts to increase generation capacity for meeting growing data center demand, largely in line with the Trump administration’s priorities,” the analysts said.

NIPSCO, NIPSCO Generation and the NIPSCO Industrial Group reached a settlement agreement on the plan in mid-July.

Creating a separate generation company would allow NIPSCO to serve megaload customers by meeting their unique demands so that Northwest Indiana does not lose out on economic development opportunities due to “regulatory obstacles,” NIPSCO Generation said in an Aug. 15 filing at the IURC.

The plan protects existing customers by isolating risks to the generation company while maintaining NIPSCO’s financial integrity, the company said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dY535YnLv-7phaJfsFRlO7F7tjlOUpHh-CInE4nih_k/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4OTY1ODk5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-08 11:04:35.694579

DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Easy Environmental Solutions Inc., previously known as Digital Utilities Ventures Inc. (OTC: DUTV) and listed under the same name, just officially announced receiving the full down payment for the first EasyFEN™ waste-to-liquid microbial fertilizer unit in Africa. The unit will now be shipped to Kenya in the next 90 to 120 days, firmly establishing the company’s Kenya launch and setting in motion what may be a large-scale initiative to combat food insecurity and soil degradation in a region where hunger remains a critical issue.

“This is a historic moment - not only for our company but for African agriculture,” said Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Easy Environmental Solutions. “The EasyFEN™ system isn’t just sustainable; it’s profitable, scalable and built to create lasting value for investors while transforming agriculture for entire nations. This is the model wherein doing the right thing for the planet also delivers strong financial returns.”

At full capacity, a single EasyFEN unit is expected to generate approximately $19 million in recurring annual revenue. That creates a scalable, high-margin growth model for the company and its shareholders, reports Easy Environmental Solutions.

Fighting Famine At Its Source

One-third of Kenya’s population lives below the poverty level, while 29% of the children in rural regions suffer from stunted growth due to famine. With 80% of the country’s land area arid or semi-arid, growing nutritious foods is a huge challenge. Climate change and inefficient food systems only add to the pain and suffering.

It’s not just Kenya that’s plagued by famine. About two-thirds of the continent is arid or semi-arid, and a large portion of the land used for agriculture is drying up. Desertification is a huge problem made worse by climate change, leading to starvation and a dire need for a solution. As of 2023, one in five people in Africa was going hungry. By 2030, 582 million people are projected to be undernourished globally, with over half of them living in Africa. Finding ways to grow crops is important to the continent’s survival.

That’s where Easy Environmental Solutions comes in. Its EasyFEN Modular Microbe Fertilizer System is what the company describes as a decentralized, fully automatic “Fertilizer Plant in a Box” that can be deployed at rural agricultural co-ops and communities all over the world. The fully automatic system converts waste from each local community into Terreplenish, the company’s organic microbial fertilizer that is made from recycled green biomass, food and crop waste and is targeted at lifeless, unproductive soil. The product can process two tons of biomass per hour, producing up to 2.7 million gallons of Terreplenish annually, reports Easy Environment Solutions.

Bringing Soil Back To Life

Validated by over 100 independent studies and backed by more than a decade of field data, the company says Terreplenish restores soil health, boosts yields and reduces irrigation or rainfall needs by up to 20%. Easy Environmental Solution says two gallons per acre delivers 45–60 lbs. of nitrogen and 15–20 lbs. of phosphorus, enabling each unit to treat 1.35 million acres (approximately 546,000 hectares) of farmland every year.

There are several other benefits to using Terreplenish, too, according to the company. They include improving plant growth, reducing chemical dependence and supporting sustainable, regenerative farming practices that strengthen soil health to naturally defend against fungal threats without the need for chemicals.

Spreading Across Africa

Once an EasyFEN unit is up and running, it can produce enough Terreplenish annually to support food production for more than five million people. As a result of that, it's not only Kenya that is interested. Easy Environmental Solutions has already delivered Terreplenish samples to the Congo, Tanzania and Somalia, with field trials exceeding expectations, reports the company. The idea is to deploy as many EasyFEN units as it takes to make a tangible dent in the hunger situation in Africa.

“This isn’t just about technology - it’s about sovereignty, stability and long-term agricultural independence,” said Bakry Osman, Director of Africa Operations. “Our goal is Terreplenish® in every African country by 2027. We’re not offering short-term fixes. We’re replacing broken systems at scale.”

World hunger is a growing problem, and Africa is ground zero. With desertification worsening, leading to starvation, it's a problem that needs a solution. Easy Environmental Solutions says it will soon demonstrate it has the answer in Kenya. With its first EasyFEN unit gearing up to be shipped and put into operation, it could be the start of a revolutionary agriculture shift for the better in Africa.

“This is what the world has been waiting for,” said Nate Carpenter, Vice President of Global Operations - Eastern Hemisphere. “High profits for developers and affordable pricing for farmers. In an era of famine and water scarcity, the EasyFEN™ isn’t just a solution - it’s the new gold standard, and we’re ready to lead the charge.”

But things have changed now. Trump’s rollback of incentives and regulations, along with new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, is changing the economics of EVs in the United States. The shift is forcing legacy automakers to rethink their electrification plans.

Detroit’s Legacy Carmakers Welcome the Shift

For traditional automakers like General Motors GM and Ford F, the policy change comes as a financial breather. Bloomberg recently reported that this rollback could unlock billions of dollars for Detroit carmakers to reinvest in gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley even called the policy shift a “multibillion-dollar opportunity” for its gas and hybrid business. GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.

The reason is simple— without fuel economy fines, Ford and General Motors no longer need to buy regulatory credits from EV-only players. GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year. They can now redirect the money into profitable gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

GM and F currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GM and Ford Scale Back EV Ambitions

This policy reset is showing up in production plans. GM recently announced it will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ between Sept. 2 and Oct. 6. While the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups remain in production, GM has delayed its second electric truck plant and Buick’s first EV by six months. Instead, the automaker revealed $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles—clear evidence it’s not betting everything on EVs anymore.

Ford is making similar adjustments. The company cut its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn—where the F-150 Lightning is built—to a single shift. It also scrapped plans for an all-electric three-row SUV in Ontario. Instead, Ford is leaning into hybrids, especially in its best-selling truck lineup. Farley has said the Ford Blue division, which builds gas and hybrid vehicles, had been shouldering most of the compliance burden under stricter rules. With Trump’s rollback, that division stands to benefit the most. In fact, Ford is retooling its Oakville plant to make Super Duty F-Series pickups starting next year, reversing its earlier plan to build EVs there.

While Detroit’s legacy automakers view the rollback as a relief, the story looks very different for pure play EV companies like Tesla TSLA, Lucid Group LCID and Rivian Automotive RIVN, which relied heavily on incentives and credits to fuel demand and profits.

EV Pure Plays Lose a Safety Net

Tesla, Rivian and Lucid are losing a major source of revenues. That’s because Trump’s rollback not only ends consumer tax credits but also kills the market for regulatory credits.

Under the old rules, automakers that fell short of fuel-economy targets had to either pay fines or buy credits from companies that exceeded the standards—mostly EV makers. Tesla, Rivian and Lucid were prime beneficiaries of this system. Now that the fines are gone, so is the need for credits. And the impact is beginning to show.

Rivian said regulatory credits made up 6.5% of its total revenues in the first half of 2025, but it doesn’t expect any credit sales for the rest of the year. Last year, Rivian earned more than $400 million from these sales. Losing that cushion makes its path to profitability even steeper.

Lucid is facing a similar squeeze. It is already battling demand and profitability challenges, so the loss of this income stream just adds to the hurdles.

Tesla, meanwhile, is taking the biggest hit in absolute dollars. Since 2019, Tesla has generated over $10.6 billion from credit sales—profits that often made the difference during lean quarters. In the last reported quarter alone, Tesla booked $439 million from credits. While that sounds strong, it’s down nearly 50% from the $890 million it earned a year earlier. The decline has been steady, quarter after quarter, and Trump’s rollback threatens to accelerate the slide.

Final Thoughts

GM and Ford, with their deep gas and hybrid portfolios, are among the winners from the EV policy changes. They would gain flexibility, save billions in compliance costs, and push forward with vehicles that still deliver strong margins.

On the losing side are Rivian and Lucid, whose business models counted on credit revenues to partially offset losses from selling EVs. Without that extra income, their road to profitability looks longer and riskier. Tesla, too, faces margin pressure as one of its reliable profit levers disappears.

A coalition of companies sponsoring SB 419 includes Shell, despite the oil and gas giant closing all of its hydrogen fueling stations for light-duty vehicles in California last year, citing a lack of demand.

The bill, which passed the state Senate and now sits in the Assembly, seeks to exempt hydrogen fuel from the taxes imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law for the sale, storage, use, and other consumption of hydrogen fuel in California. Authored by state Sen. Anna Caballero and sponsored by the California Hydrogen Coalition (CHC), the bill is “one small and early step” in helping the industry scale renewable hydrogen fuel production so that it becomes cost-competitive with diesel, CHC Executive Director Teresa Cooke told Prism in an email. In addition to Shell, the CHC also includes Chevron, Air Liquide, Toyota, Hyundai, Linde, and FirstElement Fuel, according to financial filings. Caballero’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

SB 419 is pushing for the broader adoption of hydrogen fuel use in fuel-cell electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, both in everyday light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty transportation, but critics say it isn’t the right move. The Natural Resource Defense Council and Sierra Club California, along with several organizations, signed a letter in May opposing the bill and stating that battery electric vehicles make the most sense given their cost efficiency, climate impact, and widespread use.

The challenge is that “hydrogen is made with fossil fuels predominantly,” said Ethan Elkind, the director of the Climate Program at University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment. Elkind explained in an email that by taking fossil fuels, converting them to hydrogen, and then converting that hydrogen into electricity to power hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, about 50% of the energy has been lost from the original fossil fuel. So, it turns out that “hydrogen, right now, is twice the pollution of natural gas,” he said. “It’s a very inefficient way of powering really anything.”

Produced from fossil fuels

Fossil fuels are the primary feedstock for hydrogen production in the U.S. Hydrogen production is often categorized by colors such as gray, blue, and green.

Gray hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas through a process called steam methane reforming (SMR). SMR involves using high-temperature steam to produce hydrogen from a methane source such as natural gas, and it doesn’t require new infrastructure since it builds upon existing natural gas pipelines. The Department of Energy has stated that 95% of the hydrogen produced in the U.S. is gray.

Blue hydrogen is also produced from fossil fuels, but it involves carbon capture and storage, which is intended to reduce the emissions released from blue hydrogen production. However, researchers from Cornell and Stanford have found that while carbon dioxide emissions for blue hydrogen are less than for gray hydrogen, the increased use of natural gas to power carbon capture ends up resulting in higher methane emissions. These emissions end up being even higher than burning natural gas, diesel oil, or coal.

Green hydrogen is the ideal form of hydrogen, produced using surplus renewable energy such as solar and wind. It involves using electricity to power an electrolyzer, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The main concern with green hydrogen production is cost, according to Elkind. Another concern is the availability of surplus renewable energy.

“There’s only going to be extra solar power for certain hours of the day. And it’s not very cost-effective to produce hydrogen just a few hours a day or … a few weeks a year,” he said.

But CHC’s Cooke pushed back against such criticism.

“Regardless of hydrogen’s feedstock, it is being used in a zero-emission vehicle which brings significant carbon and particulate matter reductions,” Cooke wrote in her statement to Prism, adding that the U.S. power grid, supporting battery electric vehicles, is mostly fossil-fuel based.

While the latter is true, hydrogen’s feedstock cannot be disregarded simply because it is used to power a zero-emission vehicle. Hydrogen’s feedstock and its overall production process make a significant difference in its life-cycle emissions, as stated in a 2021 white paper by the International Council on Clean Transportation. The paper states that gray hydrogen, which is the primary source of hydrogen in the U.S., is only slightly lower in emissions than gasoline-powered vehicles. Even hydrogen produced through renewable energy shows higher emissions than battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by the same renewable energy. This is because the electricity required to produce renewable hydrogen is three times as energy-intensive as the electricity used in BEVs.

Aviation and industrial emissions are the primary areas in which hydrogen use makes sense, Elkind said. But even then, the hydrogen would have to be produced from zero-emission sources.

“If it’s produced from fossil fuels, you’re really defeating the purpose,” he said. “I think it’s reasonable for California to invest in this. I just wouldn’t want to see that investment … come at the expense of other tried and true technologies like batteries or other renewable energy sources that we need to see scale up rapidly.”

Other dangers

While SB 419 focuses on hydrogen as a fuel, hydrogen’s other applications, most prominently hydrogen blending, have also faced backlash. Hydrogen blending involves blending hydrogen with natural gas, for use in residential and commercial buildings.

Public utilities in California, such as the Southern California Gas Company, have been trying to start experimental hydrogen blending on University of California (UC) campuses. At UC Irvine, the pipeline was proposed near child day care centers, which alarmed advocacy groups and pediatricians.

“You’re experimenting with these explosive gases under where children are playing,” said Dr. Vi Nguyen, pediatrician and co-chair of the Public Health Advisory Council of San Diego-based Climate Action Campaign. A resolution authored by Nguyen and Dr. Hilary Lin, opposing hydrogen blending, was recently adopted by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

For most of its proposed use cases, namely transportation and heating homes, the consensus is that hydrogen just doesn’t make sense, according to experts interviewed by Prism. But there continues to be fossil fuel interest in hydrogen, Elkind said.

“They see it as a way for them to continue to produce and sell fossil fuels.”

Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Hundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.

“Conservatives can and should lead on energy,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, in his opening remarks.

The group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission ​“to champion secure, reliable, affordable, clean American energy.” Its goal of achieving American energy independence includes support for a range of technologies, including solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, biomass, and small modular nuclear reactors.

The Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.

Since January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.

“While it’s easy to view this as a roadblock, … it’s a signal that we have more work to do,” Szoka said. He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation. ​“If we don’t explain what’s going on clearly, we risk losing the argument before it even starts.”

As President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are gaining steam nationwide. A June report by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University notes 16 states with laws limiting solar or wind, with over 450 counties and municipalities across more than 40 states imposing other restrictions.

What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?

—Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power

Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30 counties in the state ban solar or wind energy in all or parts of their territories, an authority granted to them by a 2021 law known as Senate Bill 52. The board or its staff have also determined solar and wind projects are not in the public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.

Asked for her advice to developers, French said, ​“I just think communicating with the local officials around the project is so helpful, and being part of that community and earning their trust is very effective.”

Companies often hear such suggestions, but ​“frankly, I think that’s used as a cop-out sometimes,” said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at utility-scale developer Apex Clean Energy, during a later panel about how policies shape companies’ decisions.

No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.

The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.

Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.

“What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?” Stallings said. The point resonated with various attendees from state chapters of the Land and Liberty Coalition, who made comments during networking breaks that property owners should be free to make their own economic decisions about their land.

Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said. That risk is already visible: Late last month, the grid operator ISO New England warned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.

This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood. House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.

Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.

“We don’t need to incentivize it. In Ohio, we just need a level playing field,” he said.

For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program. Two Republicans in the House have introduced a separate bill to revive a version of that measure.

Beyond that, the law left SB 52’s extra hurdles for solar and wind in place, along with property line setbacks for wind that were tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014 budget law.

“We have put up a lot of barriers to different forms of power over the years,” said state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, who noted that added levels of government review compound uncertainty for developers. ​“I think the solution is removing those barriers.”

The 16,500sq metres smart factory will produce electrical equipment critical to meeting the country’s rising energy demands, expected to increase by up to 40 per cent by 2035.

Officials say the site combines cutting-edge manufacturing technology with the expertise of a workforce whose roots in electrical production date back to the 1930s.

They add that producing equipment in the UK for British organisations will strengthen national infrastructure, reduce reliance on global supply chains and cut costs and emissions, while also enabling faster delivery of bespoke solutions built to British standards and export-ready for Commonwealth markets.

Kelly Becker, president at Schneider Electric, UK & Ireland, Belgium and Netherlands, said: “UK manufacturing is the backbone of the nation’s infrastructure drive.

“With electricity demand set to hit new heights, our Scarborough site – rooted in Yorkshire expertise – gives us the scale and agility to respond quickly to market changes and support the UK’s energy transition and beyond.

“By expanding our local footprint, we’re working even closer with customers to deliver a decarbonised, resilient energy system for the future.”

David Skaith, mayor of York and North Yorkshire, added: “Schneider Electric is backing our vision for a greener York and North Yorkshire with this £42 million investment in its Scarborough base.

“The opportunities afforded by this larger site will help keep more of our talented young people and skilled workers on the coast.

“This is a moment I’ve been looking forward to, having followed this project from its early stages to its official opening today.

“It shows the confidence businesses have about our commitment to clean energy.

“This new state-of-the-art facility will produce the electrical equipment we need, putting our region at the heart of the UK’s transition to cleaner energy.”

The breakthrough addresses a massive challenge in battery manufacturing: how to recover valuable materials from production scraps without the use of dangerous solvents. Traditional battery recycling often depends on chemical processes that can harm workers and the environment.

This new approach uses mechanical mills to process battery cathodes made with a special plastic binder known as PTFE. The mills grind up the battery components and separate them from their metal backing, which preserves each material in its original form for immediate reuse.

Researchers at the University of Münster spent years creating this mechanical recycling technique. Their work focused on batteries manufactured through a newer production method that forgoes liquid solvents, using PTFE plastic as a binding agent instead.

The discovery could reshape battery manufacturing economics as we know them. When factories can recycle their production scraps without expensive chemical treatments, they cut costs and protect workers from exposure to hazardous substances.

These savings could reduce prices for electric vehicles and home energy storage systems.

""The recycling can be successfully implemented and scaled up dry mechanically using mills,"" said Maike Michelle Gnutzmann, a doctoral student at the university's battery research center, per Tech Xplore. ""Since the materials involved are not degraded by the recycling process, they can be directly reused.""

This technology also addresses wider environmental problems.

When battery production waste gets dumped in landfills, harmful substances often seep into soil and public water supplies. By keeping these materials in use, manufacturers reduce demand for mining operations that often damage ecosystems and communities near extraction sites.

The financial analysis shows promising results for industrial adoption. Companies that implement this recycling method may enjoy immediate cost benefits and cleaner production standards.

Battery manufacturers could begin to adopt this recycling technology within the next few years as facilities upgrade their production lines. The mechanical equipment required already exists in many industrial settings, which would make the transition more straightforward than installing entirely new chemical processing systems.

For consumers, these advances mean that future electric vehicles and home batteries could become more affordable as manufacturers reduce production waste and recover valuable materials.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/recycle-electric-vehicle-batteryimage-recK9kqzaCceGs1vr.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:17:38.212293

The ensemble examined both individual climate-smart agricultural practices and practices that were “stacked,” or added to each other.
“At the Texas site, most of the farming practices we tried increased soil carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions stayed about the same.
However, the models indicated that not plowing alone could reverse greenhouse gas emissions.” The worst-case scenario, however, lived up to its name in the study.
“We also found that all the climate-smart farming practices performed worse under worst-case scenario climate change, which was expected,” Sihi said.","A study using multiple agronomic models to examine two long-term agricultural research stations in North America shows that so-called climate-smart agricultural practices – like no-till treatments, cover-crop utilization and residue retention – can help promote carbon sequestration in soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The findings show that using a combination of models – rather than just one – can provide a more realistic range of outcomes and can highlight the shortcomings of individual models.

“We targeted open-source data from long-term agricultural experiments in Michigan and Texas that are very different – with different climates, soils and crops grown,” said Debjani Sihi, the senior author of a paper describing the research and a member of NC State’s Plant Sciences Initiative. “By utilizing these long-term studies, we wanted to see what the future might look like in terms of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.

“We examined three different models developed by different research groups and looked at them collectively,” said Sihi, an assistant professor with joint appointments in NC State’s Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. “The architecture is a little different in these models. What can we learn from each of the models, and what is the collective information?”

The study examined data from more than three decades at the two agricultural experimental sites and calibrated it into a “model ensemble” to make future predictions. The ensemble examined both individual climate-smart agricultural practices and practices that were “stacked,” or added to each other.

The researchers then examined whether these proposed practices would, in the next 25 years or so, generate carbon sequestration in soil and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in two different scenarios: a baseline scenario that replicated climate-change historical data of the past three decades, and a “worst-case” scenario that envisions dramatic growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

“We tried to capture a variety of biological processes related to soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) emission while also accounting for climate-change effects,” Sihi said. “These processes are driven by different climate variables like temperature and precipitation.”

The model ensemble showed some positive effects in both studied locations under the baseline scenario.

“At the Michigan site, we found that no-till farming and keeping crop residues on the field increased soil carbon sequestration, while using no-till farming, some cover crops, and reducing fertilizer decreased greenhouse gas emissions,” Sihi said. “At the Texas site, most of the farming practices we tried increased soil carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions stayed about the same. However, the models indicated that not plowing alone could reverse greenhouse gas emissions.”

The worst-case scenario, however, lived up to its name in the study.

“We also found that all the climate-smart farming practices performed worse under worst-case scenario climate change, which was expected,” Sihi said.

She added that the study could provide the impetus for other researchers to try out the model ensemble approach and improve it. Future studies could be improved by using real-world data from on-farm studies and selecting other models with different strengths to broaden the insights.

“We hope others will evaluate these climate-smart practices to learn which may be more important, and what kind of experiments that we can leverage,” Sihi said. “These are two long-term examples in Michigan and Texas that we have utilized, so that others could adopt and improve and build on it.

“In this context, utilizing no-till or cover crops as a base practice and then stacking residue retention reduced future net emissions. Future work would need more study in other parts of the country – or world – to better generalize effects.”

Session Description:

Climate change is one of the most pressing crises that humanity faces, and mitigating the problem requires the rapid deployment of new low-carbon energy technologies. Clean and renewable energy deployment is already generating countless political conflicts at the local level around the world, and the outcomes of these local conflicts will shape the future of the energy transition. This panel seeks to better understand the local politics around clean-energy siting, by examining institutional and behavioral drivers and consequences of clean-energy siting decisions in diverse geographic contexts.

The first two papers examine the local politics of clean energy facility siting in the United States, which is one of the world’s largest historical emitters of greenhouse gases. In 2022, the US finally enacted landmark federal laws—the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips and Science Act—which together contain hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to promote a transition to a cleaner energy system. These investments support several broad categories of projects, including electricity generation and clean-energy manufacturing. These two types of project generate distinct distributions of costs and benefits and, consequently, give rise to distinct political conflicts. Accordingly, two papers on our panel examine the local politics that arise in the implementation of federal programs that support electricity generation and manufacturing facilities. The first paper asks how incentives for solar electricity generation facilities are distributed among different segments of the population, whether and how misaligned incentives are a source of conflict, and how the lack of transparency or consistently regulated siting processes can impede coordination around the creation of broad and equitable community benefits. The second paper focuses on political communication and public reactions to clean-energy manufacturing facilities in a diverse set of political and economic contexts. The paper asks whether federal investments are generating expansionary momentum or backlash. Together, these two studies speak to the durability of the incentive-based approach to promoting clean energy in the United States.

The third and fourth paper shift the focus from the local consequences of energy facilities to the drivers of siting decisions. The third paper uses Denmark as a setting to examine the political determinants of clean-electricity facility siting within the decentralized institutional structure prevalent in many countries including but not limited to the United States and much of Europe. Building on the premise that local politicians are responsive to the preferences of their own electorate, this article develops and tests a new theoretical model of how local governments site energy developments. The authors argue that energy siting decentralization may hurt both efficiency and the perceived democratic legitimacy of the transition to a zero carbon economy.

Conversely, the fourth paper examines the political determinants of energy infrastructure siting in the top-down decision-making structure common in many parts of the Global South, particularly when projects are supported by external donors. The paper uses sub-Saharan Africa as a setting within which to examine the proportion of fossil and renewable energy infrastructure that can be explained by political targeting compared with geographic endowments. Initial results indicate that, in countries where fossil fuel is disproportionately politically targeted compared to other aid projects, renewable energy projects are also disproportionately likely to be politically allocated. The study implies that international efforts to support the green energy transition likely entrench local elites and raise questions about the efficacy of Just Energy Transition Partnerships.",https://i0.wp.com/politicalsciencenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54.png?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-08 12:19:11.645236

Topline:

The number of utility customers in California affected by intentional power shutoffs to reduce the risk of sparking fires has spiked this year. Most of the increase is in Southern California Edison's territory, where nearly 526,000 customers experienced safety outages through Aug. 1. In all of 2024, that figure was about 137,000, and it was just 34,000 in 2023.

Why it’s happening: Edison revisited its high-fire-risk-area maps and concluded that another 130,000 customers should fall into the risk zone where the utility may decide to roll out a public safety power shutoff, according to Brian Chen, Southern California Edison’s vice president of project and field engineering. At the same time, the state is coming off of two wetter-than-average years, during which vegetation has grown, increasing fire risk in many regions as those plants can become fuel during dry months.

What are the effects? Communities that have never been hit by public safety power shutoffs are experiencing them for the first time in 2025. That’s led to complaints from some rural residents who have been caught off guard by days of blackouts that left them overheated and frustrated.

The big picture: The situation speaks to the complexity of the politics surrounding California's grid. State leaders are pushing utilities to prioritize affordability, wildfire resilience and reliability all at once. But those three goals often conflict. Deenergizing a line on a hot, windy day may be the right decision for safety, but it strikes a blow to reliability. And undergrounding lines to avoid that trade-off is pricey, upsetting advocates who don’t want to see costs passed on to peoples’ power bills. Edison has a general rate case pending before the California Public Utilities Commission, during which regulators will decide how much the utility is allowed to raise its fees. Undergrounding wires has been a key point of contention during the proceeding, dividing the utility and affordability-minded interveners who are pushing for more focus on insulated wires and fast-trip technology.

In the Legislature: The dynamics of the entire situation could also change significantly if a sprawling bill aimed at electricity affordability, SB 254, passes, as it would reshape how California’s utilities mitigate wildfires and incorporate that work into their rates.

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

Q&A: DEC CHIEF — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: The state’s top environmental official is fighting proposed federal funding cuts that could weaken New York’s ability to enforce clean air and water initiatives.

Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton stepped in to lead the agency six months ago, with her official confirmation by the state Senate in May. She’s overseeing the roughly 3,000-person agency at a pivotal time, with DEC’s portfolio growing and the state’s energy policy shifting in response to federal changes and affordability concerns.

Potential reduced federal funding and policy shifts pose a threat to New York’s efforts to protect the environment and fight climate change, Lefton said.

“We have a federal government that is really seeking to cut us off at our knees,” she said. “They’re trying to erase the words climate change. They’re trying to erase the words environmental justice.”

Lefton said DEC would use “every tool” to continue protecting the environment and advancing the state’s climate goals. But she acknowledged federal opposition makes that far more challenging.

Environmental groups have been critical of Gov. Kathy Hochul’s decision to delay programs like “cap and invest” that would charge for emissions and raise funds for clean energy. Her administration has also advanced a draft energy plan that won’t meet the state’s 2019 climate law target of net zero by 2050.

Lefton demurred on whether there’s a timeline to advance additional regulations for “cap and invest,” noting ongoing litigation and recent comments by the governor. Hochul recently said there are cost concerns with the program.

DEC is still planning to advance regulations requiring greenhouse gas reporting from polluters and fuel suppliers, Lefton said. That will backfill some data the federal government isn’t requiring.

What you may have missed

ENERGY MOVES: The Department of Public Service is looking for a new consumer advocate. Richard Berkley resigned from the role after three years on Aug. 26. Berkley joined the department to oversee the Office of Consumer Services, which is the first point of contact for people struggling with billing issues and other utility problems, in 2022. “We wish Richard great success on his future endeavors and have immediately begun an active search for his replacement,” DPS spokesperson Jim Denn said in a statement. “I enjoyed the caring and hard working people at the department and in the commission, and most importantly, I appreciate the opportunity to work on behalf of affordability and to solve complaints for utility consumers,” Berkley said.

NUCLEAR BOOSTS: Supporters of more subsidies for New York’s existing nuclear fleet issued a report on the benefits of keeping the three upstate plants online last week.

The Brattle Group analysis for the Carbon Free NY coalition and funded by plant owner Constellation looks at the theoretical consequences of shutting the company’s New York plants. It finds $50 billion in increased electricity costs by 2050 if three of the units close in 2029 — when the state’s subsidy program ends — and the last in 2032 when federal tax credits expire. That’s based on the state rapidly building out new resources and actually meeting its climate law targets, which Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration doesn’t expect to do because it would be too expensive. The report also highlights the 14,400 jobs supported by the plants and $10 billion federal and state tax revenue.

The Public Service Commission is considering extending the current nuclear subsidy program beyond 2029. An extension has strong support from labor and the upstate communities hosting these plants. Some environmentalists oppose continued payments. Comments are due by Oct. 20.

Hochul also joined a New York Power Authority roundtable on building the workforce for new nuclear energy, she announced after the closed-press event. “As New York State electrifies its economy and continues to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs, we must embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence and supply chain security to ensure New York controls its energy future,” Hochul said in a statement. “That begins with nuclear power for the benefit of all New Yorkers.”

Attendees included state officials, labor leaders, representatives from Ontario Power Generation and nuclear advocates. Hochul has directed NYPA to build at least 1 gigawatt of new nuclear. The authority hasn’t yet released planned solicitations for industry and community input, including potential partners. — Marie J. French

AGAINST PIPELINES: New York lawmakers and advocates called on Hochul to oppose two pipeline projects that the Trump administration has revived.

“This [pipeline project] will force New York State utility rate payers to pay over $200 million in our energy bills every year for the next 15 years to pay these costs,” said Democratic state Sen. Liz Krueger during Thursday’s press conference. “That’s inexcusable.”

Krueger said she was open to discussing language for a bill that could prevent similar situations from happening in the future. Assemblymember Anna Kelles talked up her bill to create a way to enforce emissions targets in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. — Mona Zhang

STATES, ØRSTED SUE ON REVOLUTION WIND STOP — POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino: Blue state attorneys general and the companies building the nearly completed Revolution Wind project are suing the Trump administration for its order halting work on the project off the coast of New England — escalating the fight over the stalled project that is at the center of the administration’s efforts to restrict offshore wind.

UNLOCKING MORE GAS FOR NEW ENGLAND: Many environmentalists in New York are laser-focused on opposing a proposed pipeline into New York City and pushing Gov. Kathy Hochul to reject it. In the meantime, another pipeline company is moving forward with a $300 million project that will bring more gas to New England with backing from Hochul’s fellow Democratic Gov. Maura Healey in Massachusetts.

Enbridge’s planned enhancement of the Algonquin pipeline doesn’t involve work in New York or any new compressor stations. It is far smaller — roughly a tenth of the added gas capacity — than Enbridge’s “Project Maple” proposal that previously alarmed New York pipeline opponents. Enbridge announced a final investment decision on the Algonquin Reliable Affordable Resilient Enhancement project last week.

The project “is the first step in alleviating the bottleneck of pipeline constraints that have plagued the region, helping to enhance peak day capacity,” said Enbridge spokesperson Max Bergeron in an email. “As the region continues to shift to increased reliance on intermittent energy sources, natural gas can ensure customer reliability and affordability.”

The work in Massachusetts and Rhode Island would bring an additional 75 million cubic feet of gas a day into New England. Bergeron said the company decided to “right size” Project Maple after seeking customers in 2023. The project still needs federal and state approvals and is targeting completion for 2029.

Among the customers for the Algonquin pipeline enhancement are Eversource’s gas utilities in Massachusetts for roughly half of the additional capacity. The new source of gas will improve reliability and reduce customer costs, limiting the need for liquified natural gas shipped from overseas, according to utility filings seeking approval from Massachusetts regulators.

The 10-year agreement is “critical to meeting forecasted demand from our natural gas customers in southeastern Massachusetts in the coming years and, importantly, will reduce our reliance on higher-cost, foreign liquified natural gas,” said Eversource spokesperson William Hinkle. “This agreement will provide direct benefits to customers in the near-term as the clean energy transition continues to unfold and until new, large-scale renewable resources come online.” It is expected to save Eversource customers $400 million over the course of the agreement.

Healey’s administration has been pushing the state’s utilities to find alternatives to the Everett Marine Terminal, the port where LNG is shipped into the state. “We appreciate this 10-year proposal. Massachusetts and the Northeast need more energy supply for reliability and to lower energy bills,” Healey said in a statement. “That’s why we are committed to an all-of-the above approach to energy resources, and gas continues to play an important role in our overall energy supply.”

Healey in the past opposed new pipelines into Massachusetts, but like several Democratic governors in the region — including Hochul — has shifted toward an “all of the above” mentality amid growing concerns about energy costs. — Marie J. French

NJ TRANSIT AND ALSTOM PART WAYS ON RIVER LINE: Amid an ongoing investigation of a fatal New Jersey Transit accident last fall on the River Line, the agency announced Wednesday it was parting ways with Alstom, which had a contract to provide operations and maintenance on the line. “This mutually agreed decision reflects the evolving investment needs of the service, which have grown beyond the current scope of Alstom’s contract covering River LINE operations and maintenance,” NJ Transit and Alstom said in a statement.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating both parties following an Oct. 14 crash into a tree on the tracks.

In a Wednesday statement, state Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Burlington), praised the move citing years of frustration and complaints about “the lack of communication, poor conditions, and unreliable service on the River LINE.”

“Today’s announcement — that NJ TRANSIT will assume the operation and maintenance of the River LINE — is a welcome one if it means that we will see tangible progress in modernizing service, making needed investments, implementing real-time updates, enhancing safety measures, and improving the overall rider experience,” Singleton said. — Ry Rivard

Germany, for example, uses a mix of mechanisms to stimulate low-emissions hydrogen demand and reduce risks for investors.
Korea is also using public procurement schemes to stimulate hydrogen demand in transport and services by deploying fuel cell buses and garbage trucks.
While setting an obligation has the benefit of providing markets with certainty on low-emissions hydrogen demand without relying on taxpayer money, inflexible enforcement may reduce compliance.
Policy makers need to strike the right balance between regulatory obligations and support for the uptake of low-emissions hydrogen.","Realising the potential of low-emissions hydrogen is no longer a question of future technological breakthroughs: it’s a policy challenge of the present, and countries across Asia, Europe and the Americas are implementing measures to ramp up development.

Over the past five years, project announcements for low-emissions hydrogen production have multiplied, but the final investment decisions (FIDs) required to realise those projects are trailing behind. The project pipeline for 2030 has grown to 37 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) in 2025, but only 11% of this capacity corresponds to projects that have reached a final investment decision or are already operational, according to the upcoming edition of the IEA's annual Global Hydrogen Review, which provides key insights into the latest market and policy developments.

Two main factors are at play. Firstly, the cost premium for low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in comparison with their fossil fuel counterparts, and secondly, the lack of offtake contracts that are sufficiently long-term to reduce risks and improve the bankability of projects by providing demand certainty.

Cost premia and the willingness to commit to offtake can differ at each step in the value chain. For example, for renewable ammonia, the cost premium today can be 85% to 100% in Europe, which can be significant for an ammonia producer concerned with competitiveness and market share. However, further down the value chain, the premium can fall. For example, say renewable ammonia is used as feedstock for fertiliser, which is then used for coffee plants. The premium for the resulting cup of coffee from this crop would be less than 0.1% of the sales price, which is likely acceptable to the final consumer. That said, how this premium is distributed across stakeholders in the value chain can be complex, and it poses a coordination challenge among value chain actors, who typically lack close ties.

High costs and demand uncertainty are recurring challenges, but market contexts and policy responses differ. While some countries rely mainly on market forces and end-users’ willingness to pay a premium for low-emissions hydrogen, others are developing various support schemes and regulations. IEA Energy Policy Reviews of Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, as well as a forthcoming review of Korea, provide insights into the different approaches being taken to create more demand certainty.

As part of their decarbonisation plans, many countries and regions have developed hydrogen strategies and roadmaps that include ambitious targets for low-emissions hydrogen. Sweden, for example, has an ambitious energy policy framework built on the 2015 “Fossil Free Sweden” initiative, which brings together industry, civil society and government to build consensus around a common vision for decarbonisation. Sweden took further steps to provide long-term policy certainty by enshrining a commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 into law.

Based on this long-term policy framework, Sweden is currently significantly advancing industrial development for low-emissions processes, including hydrogen-based steel production. Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel) is building a plant with 700 megawatts (MW) of electrolyser capacity that is set to start operations in 2026, while Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB is constructing a 500 MW plant that is expected to begin operations in 2027. Over 60% of Stegra’s planned output is secured through offtake agreements that span five to seven years from different companies in the automotive, steel processing and residential sectors, which were signed even before the FID. Initially, 18 different companies signed as offtakers, sharing and minimising individual risk. These offtakers were willing to pay a premium of up to 20% in an effort to meet their own decarbonisation targets.

Some existing features of Sweden’s energy system make low-emissions hydrogen attractive. Sweden has one of the lowest electricity prices in the European Union; this improves the economics of low-emissions hydrogen production, since electricity is the main driver of costs. Sweden also has one of the lowest power carbon intensities in the world (8 grammes of CO2 per kilowatt-hour), which qualifies hydrogen produced via grid-connected electrolysis as renewable and possibly lowers fixed costs. In addition, the European Union's Emissions Trading System, with prices of EUR 60-85 per tonne of CO2 in 2025, helps close part of the cost gap with hydrogen produced with fossil fuels.

Access to grants and guarantees has also helped to make these first-of-a-kind steel production projects possible. Sweden’s “Industrial Leap” programme supports the transition of the industrial sector to low-emissions alternatives. As part of this programme, SSAB’s HYBRIT initiative received a grant of SEK 3.1 billion (Swedish kronor), or USD 310 million, out of a total investment of SEK 20 billion (USD 2 billion). Meanwhile, nearly 20% of Stegra’s plant investment came from public finance, with grants making up 40% of that portion.

Investors in an immature hydrogen market face high risks without sufficient long-term offtake agreements that provide clarity about the direction of travel. Stable support frameworks and bankable offtake contracts are important to provide long-term investor certainty about hydrogen demand.

Germany, for example, uses a mix of mechanisms to stimulate low-emissions hydrogen demand and reduce risks for investors. The H2Global mechanism covers both producers and consumers by introducing an intermediary that compensates for the price difference for low-emissions hydrogen in auctions. Producers receive a long-term contract to reduce uncertainty, and consumers can conclude one-year contracts to avoid a lock-in effect. The European Union has also established a platform to connect buyers and suppliers of hydrogen, providing transparency to market players and information for financial support.

Germany also has a carbon contract for difference scheme for energy-intensive industries. This aims to close part of the cost premium when switching to low-carbon production alternatives for 15 years, providing certainty on cash flows. The funds are not only for hydrogen, but they are sizeable, with EUR 2.8 billion allocated in the first round and larger amounts planned for the second round.

In Korea, the power system is expected to become the main demand driver for low-emissions hydrogen, complementing nuclear and renewables. Korea is considering ammonia co-firing in coal power plants and the use of hydrogen in gas turbines. To promote this, Korea is opting for operational cost support through auctions with sustainability criteria. KEPCO, Korea’s largest electricity utility, covers the cost premium between the market and bidding prices over 15 years. While the tender conditions are still being fine-tuned, the first tender in 2024 awarded 750 gigawatt-hours per annum, and a second round launched in May 2025 aims to support 3 terawatt-hours per annum of generation from low-emissions hydrogen.

Public procurement has not yet been widely used for low-emissions hydrogen. However, it can both help create a market for low-emissions hydrogen and close the cost gap, with initial public offtake agreements that can in time lead to economies of scale. Canada, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States have endorsed the Green Public Procurement Pledge, with the intention of procuring over 30 Mtpa of low-emissions steel. Korea is also using public procurement schemes to stimulate hydrogen demand in transport and services by deploying fuel cell buses and garbage trucks. Complemented by fuel subsidies, these early-stage initiatives also aim to scale up domestic hydrogen-powered, heavy-duty vehicle production.

In addition to subsidies, a clear regulatory framework for low-emissions hydrogen can help increase offtake and provide certainty for investors. One example is the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED), which requires hydrogen produced from renewable electricity to account for at least 42% of all hydrogen used in industry by 2030, increasing to 60% by 2035. As nearly all existing hydrogen use in the European Union comes from industry, these binding targets will drive demand for renewable hydrogen.

EU member states are choosing a range of strategies to implement the directive, from incentive schemes to industry-level obligations. While setting an obligation has the benefit of providing markets with certainty on low-emissions hydrogen demand without relying on taxpayer money, inflexible enforcement may reduce compliance.

The effective design of regulations is essential. For example, one challenge if quotas are used for low-emissions hydrogen is the need to avoid “carbon leakage” from industrial firms relocating to other jurisdictions with no or less stringent regulation. Policy makers need to strike the right balance between regulatory obligations and support for the uptake of low-emissions hydrogen.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:28.344664

The city’s Industrial Development Authority will hear presentations on these plans and consider proposed contracts at its regular meeting at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.

The city has received proposed contracts for two types of environmental work: geotechnical testing, which is an evaluation of the soil, and wetland impact mitigation.

The Coleman Site, acquired by the IDA in 2011, covers 158 acres near Danville’s Goodyear plant.

It has access to major highways and utility infrastructure, but the site has been passed over by potential projects “due to lack of site readiness, particularly the absence of a graded pad,” said the staff report included in a July city council meeting agenda packet.

Before grading begins, the city plans to conduct the soil and wetland work.

Lynchburg-based civil engineering firm Hurt & Profitt has submitted a scope of work and cost proposal to the city for additional geotechnical testing at the site.

“The work will include additional soil borings to confirm rock elevations, helping to prevent unforeseen challenges during site grading by the IDA,” says the staff report in the meeting’s agenda packet.

The work could cost up to about $30,000, according to the proposed contract in the agenda packet.

The company plans to drill 30 borings ranging in depth from 20 to 40 feet, take soil samples at specific intervals, send the samples to a laboratory for testing and then backfill the borings, according to the proposed contract.

The city has also received a contract proposal from Resource Environmental Solutions, an environmental consultant based in Raleigh, North Carolina.

RES plans to generate stream credits and wetland credits, which are units of ecological value meant to compensate for inevitable environmental impacts during development.

The Department of Environmental Quality is requiring these mitigation efforts before granting a permit to grade an 80-acre pad at the Coleman Site, according to the staff report.

Stream and wetland credits are created by mitigation banks, or protected properties that restore or enhance streams and wetlands.

Credits are often created in advance of development by specialized companies like RES, and then developers purchase the credits to offset their environmental damage.

The proposed contract with RES outlines the creation of stream and wetland credits through securing mitigation areas. RES would manage the full process, which includes land acquisition, design, permitting, construction, monitoring and long-term stewardship of the mitigation areas.

Funding for the contract — $2.5 million — will come from the Virginia Business Ready Sites Grant and the Tobacco Commission Grant awarded to this project, according to the staff report.

Also this week, the Danville-Pittsylvania Regional Industrial Development Authority will meet at noon Monday, the city’s planning commission will meet at 2 p.m. Monday and the Pittsylvania County Board of Zoning Appeals will meet at 6 p.m. Monday.

Electricity costs are, on average, 5.5% higher today than a year ago, and natural gas has increased by 13.8%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

U.S. citizens are paying more for electricity due in part to a combination of extreme temperatures and the expansion of data centers needed to support the increase in artificial intelligence usage, Shreveport Times reported.

From May 2024 to May 2025, the average residential price for one kilowatt-hour of electricity increased by almost 6.5%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Why are electricity bills going up?

Electricity costs can vary due to energy rates, taxes and utility fees in an area, with nearly 60 utility companies set to increase electricity rates this year, which will affect more than 57 million citizens, CBS News reported.

Many factors can influence the price of electricity, such as fuel prices, power plant costs, weather conditions like extreme temperatures, transmission and distribution system, as well as unregulated and regulated prices, according to the EIA.

In some regions, the increase in electricity bills is also due in part to a spike in natural gas prices, which a number of power plants use to generate electricity. Utility companies then pass costs on to customers as fuel adjustment charges, according to the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

Additionally, increased coal prices also contribute to higher overall fuel costs for power generation, which impacts customers' bills, says the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

Beyond natural gas and coal, electrical grids could have aging transmission and distribution lines that lack efficiency and can waste power. While some improvements have been made, the costs of less efficient systems are passed on to customers, Louisiana Illuminator reported.

How can I lower my electricity bill amid rising prices?

While homeowners can't control prices, they can monitor fuel costs in a household.

As for energy efficiency, residents can ensure thermostats are working correctly to avoid unnecessary use of electricity for air conditioning.

According to a recent analysis by Bloomberg, the rollback could free up capital that was previously earmarked for compliance with stringent Biden-era rules, allowing companies like General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Stellantis NV to redirect investments into trucks and SUVs that dominate their revenue streams.

The policy shift comes at a critical juncture for the industry, where electric vehicle adoption has slowed amid consumer hesitation over charging infrastructure and range anxiety. Insiders note that the Trump administration’s moves, including the revocation of California’s waiver to set its own tougher standards, as detailed in a June 2025 report from JDSupra, effectively loosen the regulatory noose that forced automakers to accelerate EV production or face hefty fines.

Financial Relief Amid Market Shifts

For Ford, the savings are particularly stark. CEO Jim Farley highlighted in a statement covered by Ford Authority that the rollback could preserve hundreds of millions previously spent on emissions compliance, enabling a sharper focus on high-margin internal combustion engines. This echoes broader industry sentiment, where executives have long argued that aggressive mandates distorted market dynamics, pushing unprofitable EVs at the expense of core products.

General Motors, meanwhile, stands to benefit from reduced pressure to buy carbon credits, a mechanism that cost the sector dearly under prior rules. Bloomberg’s reporting estimates that Detroit’s Big Three could collectively save upwards of $10 billion over the next decade by scaling back EV investments and avoiding penalties tied to fleet-wide efficiency targets.

Strategic Pivots and Investment Reallocations

Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler and Jeep, is already resurrecting V-8 engines for models like the Dodge Charger, a move that aligns with the relaxed standards and taps into enthusiast demand. This strategic pivot, as noted in various industry analyses, including those from Reuters on past Trump-era rollbacks, underscores how policy changes can rapidly alter production priorities.

However, not all views are uniformly positive. Some analysts warn that while short-term savings are evident, long-term risks loom if global competitors like Tesla Inc. or Chinese manufacturers continue advancing in electrification. A 2019 Forbes piece on Trump’s clean car rollback projected potential economic costs exceeding $400 billion through 2050 due to higher emissions and fuel consumption, though current administration supporters dismiss these as overstated.

Broader Economic Implications for Detroit

The ripple effects extend beyond balance sheets. In Michigan, where auto jobs are a political flashpoint, the policy is seen as a boon for manufacturing hubs. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, reflect optimistic sentiment among users, with some crediting Trump’s tariffs and rollbacks for spurring investments like Ford’s $5 billion commitment to EV batteries—ironically, a hedge against future uncertainties despite the emissions relief.

Yet, environmental advocates and some economists argue the savings come at a steep societal price. The New York Times in 2020 covered similar rollbacks, noting they could weaken U.S. competitiveness in a world tilting toward sustainability, as per their analysis. For now, Detroit’s executives are breathing easier, focusing on profitability amid a policy environment that prioritizes traditional strengths.

Navigating Uncertainty in Policy and Markets

Looking ahead, the industry must navigate potential legal challenges to these rollbacks, as states like California vow to fight back. Bloomberg’s deep dive suggests that while billions in savings are on the table, automakers are cautiously balancing gasoline-fueled profits with selective EV pursuits to avoid being caught flat-footed.

The Alberta-based nuclear development company will spend the next 12 months studying the possibility of attracting the resurgent nuclear power industry to the state. The key elements of the study will include identifying potential locations, gauging public support and laying the groundwork for the federal licensing process.

“We’re believers that nuclear will be an affordable source of power that does not need subsidies that can be competitive with other fuel types,” said Will Bridge, chief technology officer for Nucleon Energy. “That hasn’t proven itself out yet. But we also believe we need to start now.”

Nuclear energy research gets green light in North Dakota

The selection was made by the Advanced Nuclear Energy Committee, an interim committee composed of legislators, executive agency representatives and private sector leaders. The group reviewed proposals from nine firms during a Wednesday hearing, including two with North Dakota ties, but ultimately chose Nucleon Energy.

Lawmakers earlier this year approved House Bill 1025, which authorized up to $300,000 in state funding for a nuclear energy study. Nucleon’s proposal included a cost estimate of $275,000.

Nucleon specializes in small modular reactors – smaller and less expensive alternatives to the behemoth facilities providing conventional nuclear power. The company’s presentation emphasized the importance of public engagement.

“I thought Nucleon had the best background material and plan,” said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, a member of the committee.

The company’s first step will be finding the right site. Executives emphasized the importance of existing or planned transmission infrastructure in the site selection process.

“It’s fundamental that we put these where the transmission grid either now or in the near future allows, otherwise we drive up costs for ratepayers and that’s not going to make sense for North Dakotans,” said Ryan Tourigny, Nucleon’s chief development officer.

But the crucial factor in determining whether a site could realistically host a nuclear power plant will be whether there is public support in the local community – or not.

“The permitting cycle for nuclear plants is so long and so expensive that you can’t push that into a community,” Bridge said. Nucleon has had success with bringing neutral experts into a community to educate people on the technology and ensuring that community feels like a partner on the project from day one. “We see that as just good business. You can’t push nuclear facilities into communities that don’t want them.”

The importance of early public engagement was echoed by many committee members.

“As elected officials, we run into the fact that you say the word ‘nuclear’ and you get a radioactive reaction from communities,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, a member of Legislative Management.

Nuclear seen as a power solution but needs more study, legislators say

Pam Gorman Prochaska, general manager of Xcel Energy’s nuclear fleet and one of the private sector representatives on the committee, said she has seen that play out. County officials in Minnesota approached Xcel about bringing nuclear power to their community at one point, Gorman Prochaska said, but “within weeks, the anti-nuclear community had infiltrated that community and went literally door-to-door” using a lot of “scare tactics.”

One of the biggest drivers of anti-nuclear sentiment has been the question of where the radioactive waste, a byproduct of nuclear power generation, will be stored. The United States, unlike some other countries, has no centralized permanent storage facility.

“It seems like, nationally, we’ve got a crisis that we don’t have permanent storage facilities,” said Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo.

Michelle Zietlow-Miller, testifying for the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, said the lack of a central depository for nuclear waste is not a significant issue. All of the nuclear waste produced in the United States during the last 40 years can fit on a single football field, she said, 15 yards high. The waste is solid, not liquid, and is typically stored in secure casks on-site at nuclear power facilities, she said.

Yet many questions about next generation nuclear reactors remain. Tourigny said they believe the technology will become economical over time and right now North Dakota should focus on laying the groundwork for future projects without necessarily needing to have customers for the electricity lined up.

Bridge, the chief technology officer, acknowledged there are still questions about whether the new generation of reactor technology will be economically viable. There are small modular reactors being developed around the world, Bridge said, but none have so far been proven as both affordable and commercially viable.

Other obstacles in the nuclear industry include lengthy regulatory timelines at the federal level, the potentially prohibitive cost of nuclear power plants compared to alternative fuel sources and reconstructing the domestic supply chain that has been mostly dormant for decades.

Nucleon Energy was not a unanimous choice. Five members of the committee expressed a preference for the runner-up: Excel Services Corporation, which has specialized in nuclear energy development for over 40 years. Excel was named first alternate. Nucleon’s contract for the study will be negotiated by Legislative Council and is subject to approval by Legislative Management’s chair, Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot.

Interest in nuclear power is growing as public utilities look for ways to meet the rising demand for electricity driven, in part, by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and data centers. Katie Austgen, with the Nuclear Energy Institute, told the committee there have been 530 nuclear reactors proposed across North America that could begin operating in the 2030s.

Texas Senate Bill 1057, which became effective September 1, 2025, adds new Section 21.373 to the Texas Business Organizations Code (“TBOC”). This new Section of the TBOC creates a framework that governs when and how shareholders of “nationally listed corporations” may submit matters for a shareholder vote, provided that the corporation affirmatively elects to be governed by this Section of the TBOC.

Definition of “Nationally Listed Corporation”

Section 21.373 of the TBOC applies only to a “nationally listed corporation,” which is defined as a corporation that:

has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”);

is admitted to trading on a national securities exchange; and

either maintains its principal office in Texas or is listed on a Texas-headquartered exchange approved by the Texas Securities Commissioner.

Importantly, Section 21.373 of the TBOC applies to a corporation only if it makes an affirmative election to be governed by this Section through an amendment to its Certificate of Formation or Bylaws.

Section 21.002(5) of the TBOC defines a “corporation” as a “domestic for-profit corporation subject to this chapter,” which indicates that nationally listed corporations only include corporations incorporated in Texas.

Mandatory Proxy Disclosures

Before adopting the amendment to its governing documents that opts a nationally listed corporation into Section 21.373 of the TBOC, the corporation must include notice of the proposed amendment in a proxy statement provided to shareholders.

Additionally, in any proxy statement provided to shareholders, a nationally listed corporation that has opted into Section 21.373 of the TBOC must describe (i) the process by which a shareholder, or group of shareholders, may submit a proposal and (ii) how shareholders may contact one another to aggregate their holdings for purposes of satisfying the applicable share ownership threshold.

Eligibility to Submit a Proposal

Once a nationally listed corporation is subject to Section 21.373 of the TBOC, a shareholder, or a group of shareholders acting together, may submit a proposal for approval at a meeting of shareholders only if all of the below conditions are satisfied.

The shareholders, or group of shareholders, must:

hold at least (i) $1 million in market value of voting shares or (ii) 3% of the outstanding voting shares, determined on the date the proposal is submitted;

hold the requisite shares continuously for a minimum of six months before the meeting date and retain the shares throughout the meeting; and

solicit the holders of shares that collectively represent at least 67% of the voting power entitled to vote on the proposal.

Exceptions

The eligibility requirements described above do not apply to:

director nominations; or

procedural resolutions ancillary to the conduct of the meeting.

Comparison of Section 21.373 of the TBOC to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act

Section 21.373 of the TBOC is similar to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 14a-8”) in that they both address the submission of shareholder proposals for a vote at a meeting of shareholders. However, there are some key differences, which include the following:

Section 21.373 of the TBOC addresses the requirements a shareholder must satisfy to submit a proposal for approval at a shareholders’ meeting, while Rule 14a-8 addresses the requirements a shareholder must satisfy to have its proposal included in the corporation’s proxy statement for the shareholders’ meeting.

The ownership thresholds of Rule 14a-8 are significantly lower than those of Section 21.373 of the TBOC, although Section 21.373 of the TBOC has a shorter holding period. More specifically, Rule 14a-8 requires that a shareholder hold at least $2,000, $15,000, or $25,000 in market value of the corporation’s securities entitled to vote on the proposal for a continuous period of three years, two years, or one year, respectively.

Although Section 21.373 of the TBOC has a significantly higher ownership threshold, a group of shareholders may aggregate holdings for purposes of satisfying the threshold. Rule 14a-8 expressly prohibits shareholders from aggregating holdings for purposes of meeting the requisite ownership threshold.

Section 21.373 of the TBOC further requires that the shareholder solicits the holders of shares representing at least 67 percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote on the proposal. Rule 14a-8 has no such solicitation requirement.

These differences raise legal questions regarding how a shareholder proposal should be treated with respect to a shareholder of a nationally listed corporation that has opted into Section 21.373 of the TBOC if the shareholder (i) satisfies all of the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (and the corporation has no basis under Rule 14a-8 to exclude the proposal) but (ii) does not satisfy all of the requirements of Section 21.373 of the TBOC. One of the purposes of Section 21.373 of the TBOC seems to be to enable corporations to combat proxy abuse by imposing more stringent requirements on shareholders seeking to submit proposals at shareholders’ meetings, even when such requirements are stricter than under Rule 14a-8. This suggests that a corporation may be able to exclude a shareholder proposal satisfying all of the requirements of Rule 14a-8 if all of the requirements of Section 21.373 of the TBOC are not met (assuming the corporation is a nationally listed corporation that has validly opted into Section 21.373 of the TBOC).

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-08 13:52:55+00:00,the Guardian,Critics say BlackRock's Minnesota utility bid will increase rates – and clean energy goals will suffer,"Dharna Noor, www.theguardian.com, dharna-noor",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/blackrock-minnesota-power-sale-allete,"A bid by financial giant BlackRock to acquire a Minnesota electric utility could push up already-soaring utility bills, opponents warn.
“Utilities make money by investing in new energy infrastructure,” said Matt Parr, communications director for the watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
Utility prices Private equity firms have a history of raising utility prices rapidly at ratepayers’ expense, opponents say.
In 2023, the state of Kansas sued another private equity firm for allegedly price-gouging gas customers during February 2021’s winter storm.
Renewable energy Allete has claimed the private equity firms “are aligned with the company’s vision of continuing to advance the State of Minnesota’s clean energy goals”.","A bid by financial giant BlackRock to acquire a Minnesota electric utility could push up already-soaring utility bills, opponents warn.

The private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, a division of BlackRock, announced a $6.2bn deal last year to take over the parent company of a Duluth-based electric utility which serves more than 150,000 customers, if the state’s public utilities commission gives the green light.

A decision is expected during the first week of October.

Some environmental and consumer protection advocates are exhorting the commission to turn down the proposal, which would see BlackRock become the controlling shareholder of the utility Minnesota Power.

“If the deal goes through, it will force ratepayers to be beholden to the private equity agenda: prioritizing profits for executives while rising prices for everyday people,” said Jenna Yeakle, Duluth-based campaign manager with the Sierra Club, said.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has previously come under fire for its climate-warming investments.

In July, Minnesota’s department of commerce, which initially opposed the purchase, backed the bid from Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to purchase Minnesota Power and its parent company, Allete, after the firms agreed to freeze utility rates for one year and invest in green energy.

Opponents say these provisions do little to assuage their fears. Since rate increases do not currently happen each year, they say the rate freeze amounts to business as usual. And the commitment to fund renewable power is non-binding, they say.

“These capitalist vultures do not have our best interests at heart,” Cody Pals, a member of the tenants union Duluth Tenants, said at a Wednesday press conference.

Brett Christophers, author of Our Lives in Their Portfolios: Why Asset Managers Own the World, said the proposal “looks to be a classic private-equity play: buy, own for a few years and then sell at a profit”.

“As such, money will only be invested in decarbonizing Minnesota Power if [Global Infrastructure Partners] thinks that the market will reward it for undertaking that investment when it comes time to exit,” said Christophers, an economic geographer at Uppsala University.

That prospect “seems very doubtful, given the negative investor sentiment around all things clean energy-related since Trump’s return to power”, he said.

Other financial giants have also set sights on utilities. In May, private equity behemoth Blackstone announced plans to acquire a utility with 800,000 customers in the south-west US, pending Texas regulators’ approval.

Though Wall Street firms have historically shown little interest in electric utilities because they produce slow returns, that is changing amid rapid increases in energy demand due to AI datacenters.

The current landscape poses “enormous” financial opportunity, BlackRock’s CEO and founder, Larry Fink, said in a recent interview.

“Utilities make money by investing in new energy infrastructure,” said Matt Parr, communications director for the watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “With huge power demand comes huge ability to profit, especially if there’s an environment where utility commissions are approving rate increases.”

If approved, the Minnesota proposal could “open the floodgates” for private equity firms eyeing utilities, he said.

Reached for comment, Minnesota Power referred the Guardian to previous statements by the utility and Allete.

“Many have highlighted how the proposed partnership provides the financial strength and scale to make the clean energy investments needed to meet our state’s carbon-free energy goals while keeping bills as low as possible for all our customers,” said Allete’s CEO, Bethany Owen, in an August statement.

Owen noted that the sale enjoys backing from not only some clean energy advocates but also labor unions, businesses and the Salvation Army. (Opponents of the deal, for their part, have alleged some of those backers may have been courted or even coerced by BlackRock’s allies.)

BlackRock and Global Infrastructure Partners declined to comment on the proposal. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board did not respond to a request for comment.

Utility prices

Private equity firms have a history of raising utility prices rapidly at ratepayers’ expense, opponents say.

When one such firm bought a water utility in New Jersey, it oversaw a 28% increase in consumers’ bills over four years, despite promises to freeze rates across that period, the New York Times found.

In 2023, the state of Kansas sued another private equity firm for allegedly price-gouging gas customers during February 2021’s winter storm. Ratepayers saw a 200% price increase, state officials say, while the firm reaped $215m in profits, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“Why would there be private equity interest in a utility if it weren’t for their ability to achieve the kind rates of return and profit margins that they expect?” said Maggie Schuppert, a director at the rural environmental justice group Cure Minnesota. “One way to achieve those high margins is by increasing bills.”

In another example, after an electric cooperative in Michigan was bought by a private equity firm, it’s rates soared. Its prices were 9 cents per kilowatt higher than the average private utility in the state as of late last year, according to a July ruling from a Minnesota judge that unambiguously recommends state regulators reject BlackRock’s proposal.

Global Infrastructure Partners has “not met their burden of proof to show the transaction is consistent with the public interest”, administrative law judge Megan McKenzie wrote in the emphatic ruling, which followed months of hearings. While non-binding, the opinion will inform regulators’ decision on whether or not to approve the deal.

“The Partners’ expertise is unlikely to provide a material benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers,” the opinion says, adding that Global Infrastructure Partners’ private documents and communications with potential investors make clear that it is “planning on significant rate increases” that would surpass inflation and up the percentage of income ratepayers spend on utilities.

The prospective buyers and Allete rebutted the judge’s report, saying it was “not an accurate or balanced summary or analysis of the record” and that it “does not even attempt to provide a meaningful discussion of the evidence, arguments and counterarguments”.

In addition to the year-long rate freeze, the firms have agreed to lower their return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65%, the filing says, “resulting in immediate benefits for customers”.

Renewable energy

Allete has claimed the private equity firms “are aligned with the company’s vision of continuing to advance the State of Minnesota’s clean energy goals”. And in recent weeks, some clean energy advocates have also come out in support of the deal, saying it could provide Minnesota Power with the necessary capital to meet the state’s goal of decarbonizing its energy by 2040.

“The primary goal of the Acquisition is to equip the Company with reliable access to equity capital necessary to finance the investments in clean energy technologies,” Allete and the prospective buyers say.

But there is “significant risk” that Global Infrastructure Partners would not be willing or able to provide the capital needed to transition Minnesota Power away from fossil fuels, McKenzie wrote in her ruling. In fact, Allete is “planning significant capital spending on fossil fuels”, she wrote.

Global Infrastructure Partners often touts its focus on sustainability. “We aspire to be one of the world’s leading owners, developers, and operators of renewable energy assets,” its website says.

Yet the firm is a major investor in a south Texas gas terminal and other fossil fuel infrastructure, said Parr. When BlackRock acquired Global Infrastructure Partners, it more than doubled the number of fossil fuel companies in its portfolio, from nine to 22. This year, BlackRock also exited a group of asset managers committed to net zero investments amid political pressure.

Schuppert said she does not believe BlackRock is ideologically committed to either renewable energy or fossil fuels. “They’re committed to whatever makes them the most freaking money,” she said.

But even if the firm does advance renewable energy goals, if it does so at the expense of ratepayers’ energy bills. “That is not a win,” Schuppert said.

“That should be really concerning for people who say they want us to do decarbonization in a way that is equitable.”

If approved, the deal will also hamstring the public’s ability to control their electricity supply, said Yeakle, because though the state’s public utilities commission would still regulate Minnesota Power, its investors would have more control over its operations.

“It would further erode democracy and governance for the people by the people, by handing over political control,” she said. “We shouldn’t be further privatizing our crucial energy resource, adding more and more barriers to public oversight, to public transparency, to the public accessing the halls of power.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eedffcec284e87610fe94007d8069dab9aff996/234_0_3751_3000/master/3751.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6fc1157aa7442747134b9ca2f344445",N,,2025-09-08 11:02:22.783244

Why This Matters

According to scientific studies, extreme weather events, including heat waves, large storms, flooding, drought, and others are likely to become more frequent or more intense as a result of climate change — human-induced rise in the global average temperature. With the U.S. being one of the wealthier countries, damages from extreme weather events are also more expensive (as opposed to less populated or less developed areas).

20. Hurricane Zeta

Duration: 10-28-2020 to 10-29-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.3 billion

Deaths: 6

Type: Tropical Cyclone

2020 was a historically active Atlantic hurricane season, and Zeta was the fifth to make landfall in Louisiana that season. Zeta made landfall on Oct. 28 at Cocodrie, as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph. As it went inland, the storm maintained some strength, and its wind affected parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, northern Georgia and the Carolinas.

19. Rockies Hail Storms and Central and Eastern Severe Weather

Duration: 06-21-2023 to 06-26-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.4 billion

Deaths: 8

Type: Severe Storm

Severe hail storms across Colorado caused damage and injured approximately 100 people at a large outdoor concert. This severe weather also produced more than 60 tornadoes across portions of Wyoming, Colorado, Minnesota, Indiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

18. Western/Central Drought and Heat Wave

Duration: 06-01-2020 to 12-30-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.4 billion

Deaths: 45

Type: Drought

Widespread, continuous drought and record heat affected more than a dozen Western and Central states for much of the summer, fall, and into the winter months, causing considerable crop and livestock impacts. The high temperatures and lack of precipitation caused large D3 (extreme) and D4 (exceptional) drought coverage in December. Death Valley recorded a temperature of 130 degrees F — the highest measured temperature globally in decades — while Los Angeles county recorded a record high of 121 degrees F. The combined conditions dried out vegetation, contributing to the severity of the Western wildfire season.

17. Hawaii Firestorm

Duration: 08-08-2023 to 08-08-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.7 billion

Deaths: 101, with roughly 31 still missing

Type: Wildfire

Wildfires destroyed the historic town of Lahaina on Maui Island of Hawaii. Winds were enhanced from a high-pressure system, which helped to exacerbate the wildfire, while Hurricane Dora was also south of Hawaii. The deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in over a century also destroyed thousands of homes and other property.

16. Hurricane Isaias

Duration: 08-03-2020 to 08-04-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.8 billion

Deaths: 16

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Isaias made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a category 1 hurricane. The storm accelerated up the East Coast, resulting in widespread damage and power outages across New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. There was also considerable inland flooding, most notably in Pennsylvania. In addition, 34 tornadoes — including EF-2 and one EF-3 — developed across North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey due to Isaias.

15. Central Tornado Outbreak and Eastern Severe Weather

Duration: 03-31-2023 to 04-01-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.9 billion

Deaths: 33

Type: Severe Storm

A tornado outbreak producing at least 145 tornadoes across numerous central states caused widespread damage mostly in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. The damage was extensive, including to homes, agriculture, and infrastructure.

14. Central and Southern Severe Weather

Duration: 03-12-2024 to 03-14-2024

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.9 billion

Deaths: 3

Type: Severe Storm

There was damage in many Central and Southern states from hail, tornadoes, and high wind, with Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri affected by up to baseball-sized hail, while Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio also impacted by many tornadoes, including a deadly EF-3 striking northwest Ohio.

13. Southern and Eastern Severe Weather

Duration: 03-02-2023 to 03-03-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $6.1 billion

Deaths: 13

Type: Severe Storm

Severe storms impacted Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio, with high wind and tornadoes damaging homes, vehicles, businesses, government buildings, and infrastructure.

12. Hurricane Sally

Duration: 09-15-2020 to 09-17-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $8.8 billion

Deaths: 5

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Sally made landfall in Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 hurricane with wind gusts up to 100 mph and 20-30 inches of rainfall that caused considerable flood and wind damage across Alabama, the Florida panhandle, and into Georgia. Many homes and businesses in downtown Pensacola were impacted from flooding produced by storm surge and heavy rainfall.

11. Central and Eastern Winter Storm and Cold Wave

Duration: 12-21-2022 to 12-26-2022

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $8.9 billion

Deaths: 87

Type: Winter Storm

This winter storm and powerful arctic front impacted much of the nation, bringing heavy rains, snow, ice, low temperatures, and high winds. More than 200 million people were under a winter weather advisory or warning, and more than a million customers, from Texas to Maine, did not have power. Hurricane-force winds and continuous snow squalls shut down Buffalo, New York, and there were dozens of fatalities in the region as a result. Also, many homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure had extensive water damage from frozen pipes.

10. Western Drought and Heat Wave

Duration: 01-01-2021 to 12-31-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $10.1 billion

Deaths: 229 (some sources state over 600)

Type: Drought

Drought conditions expanded and intensified throughout 2021 across many Western states. Conditions were exacerbated by a historic heat wave across the Pacific Northwest that broke several all-time high temperature records in the region. These extreme temperatures impacted several major cities and millions of people, causing hundreds of direct and indirect heat-related fatalities in Oregon and Washington. These conditions also rapidly dried out vegetation, impacting agriculture. Low water levels even forced a hydroelectric power plant to shut down.

9. Western Wildfires

Duration: 06-01-2021 to 12-31-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $12.0 billion

Deaths: 8

Type: Wildfire

This western wildfire season came in the wake of severe drought conditions and periods of extreme heat. The wildfires mostly burned across California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Arizona. The Dixie Fire consumed over 960,000 acres — the second-largest in California. The fire also destroyed more than 1,000 structures. Other large wildfires burned in California and the states mentioned. Throughout the wildfire season, air quality was also a concern across numerous states.

8. Central Severe Weather – Derecho

Duration: 08-10-2020 to 08-10-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $13.3 billion

Deaths: 4

Type: Severe Storm

This powerful derecho — a specific type of long-lived wind storm — traveled 770 miles in 14 hours from southeast South Dakota to Ohio, producing winds greater than 100 mph. Millions of acres of corn and soybean crops were damaged across central Iowa. There was also heavy damage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Also, there were 15 tornadoes across northeastern Illinois, some affecting the Chicago metropolitan area. Other affected states included Minnesota, Indiana, and Ohio. Only one other severe storm since 1980 caused more damage — an outbreak of an estimated 343 tornadoes over central and southern states in April 2011 that caused $14.2 billion damages.

7. Southern/Midwestern Drought and Heatwave

Duration: 04-01-2023 to 09-30-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $14.8 billion

Deaths: 247

Type: Drought

Drought conditions impacted especially the agriculture sector in numerous Southern and Midwestern states and surrounding states. There was damage to field crops, and feeding costs rose so high that ranchers had to sell livestock early. Low water levels of the Mississippi River have impacted river commerce and water quality in southern Louisiana.

6. Western Wildfires – California, Oregon, Washington Firestorms

Duration: 08-01-2020 to 12-30-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $19.9 billion

Deaths: 46

Type: Wildfire

A record-breaking U.S. wildfire season not only burned more than 10.2 million acres, but also produced hazardous air quality that affected millions of people for weeks. In California, the August Complex, the largest in the state, began as 37 separate wildfires within the Mendocino National Forest after storms caused lightning strikes. Approximately 10,500 structures were damaged or destroyed in the state. Oregon also had historic levels of wildfire damage, as over 2,000 structures burned, as did Colorado and Washington. Only two other wildfires were costlier — the Western Wildfires, California Firestorm of June-December 2017, which cost $23 billion, and the one the year after, which cost $30 billion.

5. Western/Central Drought and Heat Wave

Duration: 01-01-2022 to 12-31-2022

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $23.5 billion

Deaths: 136

Type: Drought

Severe drought conditions impacted many Western and Central states. Large reservoirs across the West, including Lake Mead — the nation’s largest reservoir — continued to be depleted, some nearing dead pool status or record-low levels. The drought affected crop production across many states and sharply increased feeding costs for livestock. Along the Mississippi River, many segments also experienced low water levels, affecting river commerce. Extreme heat caused more than 100 fatalities mainly in Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, and Texas.

4. Northwest, Central, Eastern Winter Storm and Cold Wave

Duration: 02-10-2021 to 02-19-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $27.0 billion

Deaths: 246 (Some studies suggest 700+ indirect deaths)

Type: Winter Storm

A historic cold wave and winter storm impacted many northwest, central, and eastern states. But while northern states are set up to deal with such weather, southern states — from Nebraska southward to Texas — were caught trying to deal with temperatures that were considerably below normal, including multiple days of sustained below-freezing temperatures. The prolonged arctic air caused widespread power outages in Texas and other southern states, and water damage from frozen pipes.

These extreme conditions also caused or contributed to the direct and indirect deaths of more than 210 people in Texas alone. States including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington dealt with snow and ice. No other winter storm on record in the U.S. was more costly.

3. Hurricane Laura

Duration: 08-27-2020 to 08-28-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $28.1 billion

Deaths: 42

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Laura made landfall at Cameron Parish in southwestern Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 27. With winds up to 150 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet, damage to coastal communities and inland to the city of Lake Charles was significant. The electrical grid in southern Louisiana was also damaged. The storm caused damage also in surrounding states, including Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas.

2. Hurricane Ida

Duration: 08-29-2021 to 09-01-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $78.7 billion

Deaths: 96

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph and a minimum central pressure of 930 millibars. Damage to the energy infrastructure across southern Louisiana caused widespread, long — in some parts nearly week-long — power outages to millions of people. As Ida moved into the Northeast it merged with a frontal system, creating severe weather and flash flooding across a wide region from eastern Pennsylvania to New York that caused significant damage.

1. Hurricane Ian

Duration: 09-28-2022 to 09-30-2022

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $118.5 billion

Deaths: 161

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Hurricane Ian made landfall near Cayo Costa, Florida, as a Category 4 Hurricane with sustained winds of 150 mph. Parts of many coastal communities, including several barrier islands, were washed away by the high winds and storm surge. Ian also caused significant flooding inland Florida. After turning into a tropical storm, Ian re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and made landfall near Georgetown, South Caroline on Sept. 30 with sustained winds of 85 mph, causing more coastal flood damage.

Only a handful of weather events since 1980 were more costly. Two of these were Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in August 2017 and caused nearly $151 billion in damages, and Hurricane Katrina, which slammed into New Orleans in August 2005 and caused $199 billion in damages. Maria (2017: $107B) and Irma (2017: $58B) were also quite costly.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry36-h2b.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 11:05:13.875906

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid,” she added.

The statement comes soon after a report by Reuters noting that power generation developers were betting on natural gas, hydro, and nuclear to supply reliable, meaning dispatchable, electricity to U.S. consumers as opposed to solar and wind, which are intermittent generators.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains stipulations about a deadline for subsidies for new wind and solar capacity. This caused a wave of criticism from the solar industry despite claims for years that solar did not need subsidies to survive and grow. Indeed, SEIA’s Ross Hopper added in her statement from today that “no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

The presence of strong market demand should offset the effect of any federal policies with regard to financial incentives and the solar industry now has the chance to prove it can, indeed, survive and thrive even without subsidies.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects.
The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the NRC, Lyman said.
In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates.
“I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the U.S.”","In May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”

Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through nuclear fission, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing 400 gigawatts by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.

However, the road to renaissance is filled with familiar obstacles. Nuclear energy infrastructure is “too expensive to build, and it takes too long to build,” said Allison Macfarlane, a science and technology policy expert at the University of British Columbia who used to chair the NRC from 2012 to 2014.

And experts are divided on whether new nuclear technologies, such as small versions of reactors, are ready for primetime. The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the NRC, Lyman said. “The message is that it’s regulation that has been the obstacle to deploying nuclear power, and if we just get rid of all this red tape, then the industry is going to thrive,” he added. “I think that’s really misplaced.”

Although streamlining the approval process might accelerate development, the true problem lies in the high costs of nuclear, which would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with other sources of energy such as natural gas, said Koroush Shirvan, a nuclear science researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Even the license-ready reactors are still not economical,” he said. If the newer reactor technologies do pan out, without government support and subsidies, Shirvan said, it is difficult to imagine them “coming online before 2035.”

Rumblings of a nuclear renaissance give experts a sense of déjà vu. The first resurgence in interest was around 2005, when many thought that nuclear energy could mitigate climate change and be an energy alternative to dwindling supply and rising prices of fossil fuels. But that enthusiasm slowed mainly after the Fukushima accident in 2011, in which a tsunami-triggered power outage — along with multiple safety failures — led to a nuclear meltdown at a facility in Japan. “So, the first nuclear renaissance fizzled out,” said Lyman.

Globally, the proportion of electricity provided by nuclear energy has been dwindling. Although there has been an increase in generation, nuclear energy has contributed less to the share of global electricity demand, dropping to 9 percent in 2024 from a peak of about 17 percent in 2001. In the U.S., 94 reactors generate about a fifth of the nation’s electricity, a proportion that has held steady since 1990s. But only two of those reactors have come online in the last nearly 30 years.

This renewed push is “a second bite at the apple, and we’ll have to see but it does seem to have a lot more of a headwind now,” said Lyman.

Much of that movement comes from the private sector, said Todd Allen, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan. In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates. “It feels more like normal capitalism than we ever had in nuclear,” Allen said. Those companies are working on developing the large reactors that have been the backbone of nuclear energy for decades, as well as newer technologies that can bolster the field.

Proponents say small modular reactors, or SMRs, and microreactors, which generate less than 300 megawatts and 20 megawatts, respectively, could offer safer, cheaper, and more flexible energy compared to their more traditional counterparts. (Large reactors have, on average, 900 megawatts of capacity.)One 2022 study found that modularization can reduce construction time by up to 60 percent.

These designs have taken the spotlight: In 2024, a report estimated that the SMR market would reach $295 billion by 2043. In June, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress that DOE will have at least three SMRs running by July of next year. And in July of this year, the Nuclear Energy Agency launched a dashboard to track SMR technologies around the world, which identified 74 SMR designs at different stages around the world. The first commercial SMR in North America is currently being constructed in Canada, with plans to be operational by 2030.

But whether SMRs and microreactors are actually safer and more cost-effective remains to be determined. A 2022 study found that SMRs would likely produce more leakage and nuclear waste than conventional reactors. Studying them, though, is difficult since so few are currently operational.

In part, that may be because of cost. Multiple analyses have concluded that, because of rising construction and operating costs, SMRs might not be financially viable enough to compete for the world’s energy markets, including in developing countries that lack affordable access to electricity.

And recent ventures have hit road bumps: For example, NuScale, the only SMR developer with a design approved by the NRC, had to shut down their operations in November 2023 due to increasingly high costs (though another uprated SMR design was approved earlier this year).

“Nothing is really commercialized yet,” said Macfarlane. Most of the tech companies haven’t figured out expenses, supply chains, the kind of waste they are going to produce or security at their reactors, she added.

Fuel supply is also a barrier since most plants use uranium enriched at low rates, but SMRs and microreactors use uranium enriched at higher levels, which is typically sourced from Russia and not commercially available in the U.S. So scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory are working to recover enriched uranium from existing reactors and developed new, more cost-effective fuels, said Jess Gehin, the associate laboratory director for the Nuclear Science & Technology Directorate at the INL. They are also using artificial intelligence and modeling simulation tools and capabilities to optimize nuclear energy systems, he added: “We got to reach 400 gigawatts, we need to accelerate all of this.”

Companies are determined to face and surpass these barriers. Some have begun pouring concrete, such as one nuclear company called Kairos Power that began building a demo of their SMR design in Tennessee; the plant is projected to be fully operational by 2027. “I would make the case that we’re moving faster than many in the field, if not the fastest,” Mike Laufer, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told Reuters last year.

Some experts think achieving nuclear expansion can be done — and revel in the progress so far: “I would have never thought we’d be in this position where we’re working so hard to expand nuclear, because for most of my career, it wasn’t that way,” said Gehin. “And I would say each month that goes by exceeds my expectations on the next bigger things that are coming.”

Although the Trump administration aims to accelerate nuclear energy through executive orders, in practice, it has not allocated new funding yet, said Matt Bowen, an expert on nuclear energy, waste, and nonproliferation at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In fact, the initial White House budget proposed cutting $4.7 billion from the Department of Energy including $408 million from the Office of Nuclear Energy allocated for nuclear research in the 2026 fiscal year.

“The administration was proposing cuts to Office of Nuclear Energy and DOE more broadly, and DOGE is pushing staff out,” said Bowen. “How you do more with less? Less staff, less money.”

The Trump administration places the blame for the nuclear sector’s stagnation on the NRC, which oversees licensing and recertification processes that cost the industry millions of dollars each year in compliance. In his executive orders, Trump called for a major reorganization of the NRC. Some of the proposed changes, like streamlining the approval process (which can take years for new plants), may be welcomed because “for a long time, they were very, very, very slow,” said Charles Forsberg, a nuclear chemical engineer at MIT. But there are worries that the executive orders could do more than cut red tape.

“Every word in those orders is of concern, because the thrust of those orders is to essentially strip the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of its independence from the executive branch, essentially nullifying the original purpose,” said Lyman.

Some experts fear that with these new constraints, NRC staff will have less time and fewer resources to do their jobs, which could impact power plant safety in the future, Bowen said: “This notion that the problem for nuclear energy is regulation, and so all we need to do is deregulate, is both wrong and also really problematic.”

The next few decades will tell whether nuclear, especially SMRs, can overcome economic and technical challenges to safely contribute to decarbonization efforts. Some, like Gehin, are optimistic. “I think we’re going to accelerate,” he said. “We certainly can achieve a dramatic deployment if we put our mindset to it.”

But making nuclear financially competitive will take serious commitment from the government and the dozens of companies, with many still skeptical, Shirvan said. “I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the U.S.”",https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2185985212_crop.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:14.436858

The groundbreaking drew major attention, raising expectations that the state would soon host its first large-scale car manufacturing facility.

Since then, however, momentum has faded. In mid-2024, the Vietnamese automaker disclosed that production at the Moncure site would not begin until 2028, pushing the schedule back several years. Aside from early site preparations, little visible development has moved forward, leaving the ambitious project on hold while the company reassesses its rollout.

The extended delay has tempered early optimism, turning what was once hailed as a transformational project into a long wait for progress. But there is renewed hope for VinFast’s stalled North Carolina project as another long-delayed investment — Red Bull’s $1.5 billion beverage campus in Concord — finally breaks ground.

The First Phase of VinFast’s US EV Factory

VinFast plans to invest $2 billion for the first phase of its US EV Factory project in setting up the facility’s assembly and production locations for electric vehicles. Le Thi Thu Thuy, the president of VinFast Auto, expressed confidence in the project, emphasizing its capability to produce an impressive 150,000 vehicles annually during its first Phase. Additionally, the company aims to foster collaboration with suppliers by incorporating dedicated facilities within the factory. According to President Joe Biden through a White House press release in March 2022. This venture is anticipated to create more than 7,000 jobs, a significant boost to the local economy.

This could help offset the billions of dollars they have invested in electric vehicles (EVs). And it may reduce those investments in the future.

Bloomberg reports that the Trump administration will relax rules on vehicle emissions. The move takes away many of the pollution targets that have been in place for years. It also means that EV production can drop because those gasoline-powered car emissions rules will sunset.

The Biden administration set strict rules last year to lower emissions by billions of tons, which it said cut healthcare costs by $13 billion and would trigger “$62 billion in reduced annual fuel costs, and maintenance and repair costs for drivers.”

The Gift

Ford CEO Jim Farley summed up the effect of the new regulations when he commented that the change “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years.” Detroit has recently backed away from EV manufacturing, which had made automakers retool much of their companies to, among other things, compete with Tesla. That goal will become much less important.

The change comes at about the same time that the Trump administration cut the $7,500 tax credit that came from EV purchases. There has been anxiety that, after this expired on September 30, EV sales would crater. There had already been doubt that Americans were buying EVs in rising numbers. Ford’s overall U.S. EV sales have been about 4% of all unit sales through the first eight months of the year.

The change also comes at a point when gasoline prices have fallen sharply over the past five years. This gives drivers another reason to stay away from EVs. Tight refinery production and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed the average price of a gallon of regular nationwide to $5.10 in July 2022. The AAA Fuel Price tracker put that number at $3.20 yesterday. As crude prices continue to fall, that number could go lower.

Ford said it would lose $5 billion this year in its EV unit. It has already invested billions in its quest to be a major EV force in America. The need to race toward that target has become much less important.

The 2025 update to the USGS critical minerals list and the methodology underpinning it provide a clear, quantifiable basis for prioritization.
Unless policymakers integrate the noneconomic values of these minerals, we risk a US critical minerals strategy that misses the forest for the trees.","Since 2016, the United States has sought to reduce its economic and national security vulnerabilities related to critical minerals, a broad grouping of minerals important for industry and national defense, that the United States is highly import dependent upon and/or that have fragile domestic supply chains. This import dependence renders the US economy vulnerable to supply disruptions, coercion by suppliers, and even natural disasters at home . The US Geological Survey (USGS) publishes a list of the critical minerals it deems vital to the US economy and national security to guide related federal policy decisions, such as on mining investments, tax incentives, and mining permits. In 2022, the USGS listed 50 minerals. The 2025 draft lists 54, including copper, silicon, lithium, and zirconium.

I’ve argued before that the US critical minerals strategy needs clearer priorities . With a revised methodology informing the 2025 USGS draft list, we now have a firm basis for prioritization—with two important caveats: The monetary benchmark for inclusion on economic grounds is too low, and the list does not explicitly consider environmental or national security needs—which are the ultimate goals critical US mineral policy is meant to address.

What are critical minerals, and how do they become “critical”?

Interest in critical minerals—a term that entered the modern lexicon in 2017 —rose steadily in the 2020s before exploding in 2025. Associated in the popular imagination with energy transition–intensive materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, the term “critical mineral” also covers heavy rare earth elements used in semiconductors and national security applications . More broadly, it refers to minerals for which the United States is highly import dependent and/or susceptible to a single point of failure (SPOF, i.e., one facility closes and the whole supply chain stops) in its US domestic supply chain .

Critical minerals have loomed large in the second Trump administration’s foreign policy: They have been central to trade talks with China and the subject of weaponized Chinese export controls , US attempts to broker peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo , US negotiations to continue supporting Ukraine’s war effort , and Trump’s covetous stance toward Greenland . Through now three congressionally mandated updates, the list has included materials with common uses such as aluminum and others with such rarified uses (such as rhenium) that even specialists may not have heard of them. Critical mineral status matters because it unlocks a suite of US government interventions, including Defense Production Act–related benefits, tax credits for domestic production and refining, and national stockpiling.

The new methodology is a departure from past practice. The 2022 list relied mainly on supply concentration, trade reliance, and import dependence metrics, which flagged minerals as critical if the United States was highly reliant on a small number of suppliers. In contrast, the 2025 methodology models probability-weighted GDP losses from (1,200 different) simulated one-year supply disruptions, producing an explicit economic risk expressed as projected losses to US GDP. It thus moves from static reliance indicators to a scenario-based, impact-driven framework.

The new operational definition of a critical mineral is now one for which a probability-adjusted one-year import supply disruption or domestic SPOF would result in a GDP loss of at least $2 million.

This new methodology is a massive improvement over earlier iterations. It refocuses attention on actual impacts versus theoretical exposure, its probabilistic approach to supply disruptions does not default to worst-case scenarios, and it facilitates cost-benefit analysis. But the resulting list is still overly inclusive and subject to the perennial challenge of accounting for externalities.

The list is too long—but helps establish clear priorities

The $2 million GDP loss estimate cutoff amount is a lot of money in many contexts but not relative to the US economy. US GDP is presently $30.35 trillion a year; a $2 million loss would constitute 7 millionths of 1 percent of annual GDP. For a sense of scale, these are losses typically associated with a medium-sized restaurant fire . There are thousands of such fires in the United States annually, and they are not discussed—even their combined impact—as if they were consequential to the macroeconomy. The table below demonstrates how the 2025 list—currently 54 minerals long—shrinks significantly at higher economic impact thresholds. At amounts exceeding $1 billion, the list comprises just six minerals—samarium, rhodium, lutetium, terbium, dysprosium, and gallium—all of which are small-volume inputs that enable massive downstream industries: defense, semiconductors, medical imaging, and electric vehicles. At amounts exceeding $500 million, the list would comprise nine; at greater than $100 million, just 20.

Critical minerals on USGS 2025 draft list ranked by impact on US GDP if subject to a one-year, probability-adjusted supply disruption $1 billion or greater $500 million or greater $100 million or greater Samarium Samarium Samarium Rhodium Rhodium Rhodium Lutetium Lutetium Lutetium Terbium Terbium Terbium Dysprosium Dysprosium Dysprosium Gallium Gallium Gallium Germanium Germanium Gadolinium Gadolinium Tungsten Tungsten Niobium Magnesium Yttrium Potash Hafnium Aluminum Thulium Neodymium Silicon ferroalloys Antimony Barite Source: US Geological Survey (2025).

This distinction is important for prioritizing scarce resources. While the new USGS methodology ranks minerals according to economic risk, most of the legislative and executive perks tied to the “critical” designation—tax credits, accelerated permitting, and Defense Production Act–related benefits—are binary: A mineral is either on the list or it isn’t. That is, for most policy purposes samarium (with an average modeled GDP loss of $4.5 billion) and chromium chemicals ($2 million) are on equal footing. The USGS methodology produces a continuum of criticality; the policy environment treats it as an on/off switch. The 2025 methodology acknowledges this, offering a “statistical risk” categorization ranging from “high” to “elevated” and “moderate” to “limited.” But the “high” category still includes materials (like potash and rhodium) whose economic impacts differ by an order of magnitude.

Accounting for externalities

“Don’t talk price until you’ve established value” is an oft-mentioned key to success in sales. The new methodology establishes the price of disruption but does not consider harder-to-model nonmonetary values.

This challenge is most evident in two areas: renewable energy and national defense. The value propositions of renewable energy and national security far surpass their economic contributions to GDP. The modeled cost of a lithium supply disruption from China is $34 million. But this does not account for the noneconomic benefits of downstream technologies like lithium-ion batteries, which enable us to live mobile-yet-digitally-connected lives and transition to renewable energy.

To the extent that a supply disruption were to slow US clean energy adoption and electric vehicle sales, it would slow adoption of technologies that produced air-quality and health benefits valued at $249 billion (2019–22) and prevented 1,200 to 1,600 premature deaths in 2022 alone. These kinds of considerations do not inform the USGS methodology because the model only accounts for market-mediated GDP losses as represented in input-output tables.

The same logic holds for national security. Two-inch gallium nitride (GaN) substrate—the base layer for building epitaxial semiconductor films used in advanced radar arrays and lasers—may only cost about $1,300 a piece, but the US Navy’s AN/SPY-6 advanced radar system (unit cost approximately $90 million to $100 million) cannot provide its essential function of air and missile tracking without it. Given the importance of these downstream systems, the higher costs would be eaten—demand is price inelastic.

But demand for other systems that depend on critical minerals—like precision-guided munitions, drones, and night vision goggles—is more price elastic. One fewer set of night vision goggles deployed might not sound consequential—but tell that to the spouse of a soldier killed during a nighttime ambush. Focusing narrowly on GDP losses risks misunderstanding the true importance of materials whose principal value is in providing national security or mitigating climate change.

These criticisms seem logically inconsistent: Pricing is good, but pricing doesn’t give us the whole picture. But they point in the same direction: revising the methodology to attempt to price—or at least value—these positive externalities and/or the avoidance of negative ones. A layer of analysis that accounts for health, environmental, and security externalities—using Environmental Protection Agency assessments of avoided mortality and Department of Defense assessments of mission risk, for example—could augment the new (as of 2025) approach.

The 2025 update to the USGS critical minerals list and the methodology underpinning it provide a clear, quantifiable basis for prioritization. But this clarity comes at the cost of undervaluing the noneconomic contributions of these minerals to our shared prosperity, safety, and health. Unless policymakers integrate the noneconomic values of these minerals, we risk a US critical minerals strategy that misses the forest for the trees.

Notes

1. This is true in a technical sense. Dating back to World War I, the United States has monitored a list of “war minerals” to support the war effort. The term ""critical mineral"" became the standard term used by the USGS in 2017.

2. Global production of aluminum was around 72 million metric tons in 2024; for rhenium, it was 62 MT. One of the densest materials known to humanity, 62 MT of pure rhenium would be about the size of a standard home refrigerator. See USGS mineral commodity summaries for 2025.

3. To account for some scenarios being more plausible and probable than others.

4. The distinction about prices is important because, in theory, a foreign supply shock could result in a net benefit to the US economy if the commodity is exported at higher global prices.

5. It should go without saying that they are still consequential for the communities where they occur and their owners and employees.",https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/2025-09/DPAF231101X99X779255.JPG,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:35.683352

If you’re having a case of déjà vu, it’s not you – GM already announced back in July it’s shifting the Orion Township assembly plant from EVs as previously planned to gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

Here’s how to spot a lemon car.

This time around, the auto giant says it’s taking a few more measures to pull back from the electric car market as demand cools. We’ve been seeing similar things from other automakers, so this is hardly just a GM strategy.

For starters, Chevy Bolt production begins again in late 2025 in Kansas. However, the factory will only have one shift, so it’s not going to be pumping out a ton of cars.

A GM spokesman says the automaker is anticipating adding a second shift sometime in 2026, so the company obviously thinks demand will improve for some reason.

In addition, for the entire month of December and the week of October 10 plus the week of Thanksgiving, GM plans to halt all production at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant. That’s the home of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, plus the Cadillac XT5.

For 2026, the Spring Hill plant will come back online, but with only a single shift all the way until May 2026. The current second shift will be added back, showing that GM predicts demand will be soft until around then.

There are a few reasons why the EV market is softening. It was already in decline last year, but with President Trump coming into office and ending the electric car mandates, that has made many car shoppers reconsider their options.

Automakers are no longer getting millions or more from taxpayers just for making electric vehicles, something that was a popular gift during the Biden Administration through the Department of Energy.

And the federal EV tax credits are going away at the end of the month. That has caused a run on electric cars, but it means moving into October and beyond demand should crater.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Energy Secretary Christopher Wright submitted the request on Aug. 29 under Section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, a rarely used provision that allows the DOE to propose rules or policy changes within FERC’s jurisdiction. If rescinded, FERC would need to open a new docket and build a new record before considering similar policy changes again.

The draft policy statement, first developed in 2018 and expanded in 2021, would have required FERC to weigh environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions when determining whether pipeline projects meet the public interest under the Natural Gas Act. It was reclassified as a draft in March 2022 following political pushback and has remained inactive since.

“This proposal seeks to eliminate uncertainty for natural gas infrastructure development,” Wright argued, calling the draft policy inconsistent with statutory authority under the Natural Gas Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

Section 403 authority has been invoked only a handful of times, most recently in 2017 when former Secretary Rick Perry sought new rules to support coal and nuclear plants. Wright’s request differs in that it seeks rescission rather than adoption of a new rule.

FERC has noticed the request and will accept public comments through Sept. 9. The agency is expected to act by Sept. 30, though timing may depend on the confirmation of pending commissioner nominees.

While the move would not immediately change FERC’s current reliance on its 1999 Certificate Policy Statement, it signals that the DOE may play a more assertive role in shaping pipeline policy going forward.

The report found that DC fast chargers charge an EV battery quickly, but these chargers are harder on battery life.
Before the people of Michigan give more money to build EV chargers, they need answers to what happened to that money.
A sparse EV charging network probably isn’t even in the top 20 problems that Michigan residents face daily, Outman said.
These include the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan Public Service Commission, Southeast Michigan Council of Government, and the city of Detroit.","When you’re driving an electric vehicle, you may worry about where the next charger is. Researchers at Michigan State University say a solution to that is possible, at a cost of nearly $1 billion.

It costs between $50,000 and $80,000 to build a single charger, according to a 53-page taxpayer-funded study, which says the state needs to spend $1 billion on about 97,000 electric vehicle chargers. The report did not look at chargers in single family homes or other residential settings and thus excludes the cost of installing them.

There are 82,000 electric vehicles registered in Michigan, far short of an official goal of 2 million.

Mehrnaz Ghamami and Ali Zockaie, associate professors in Michigan State University’s College of Engineering, have studied Michiganders’ travel patterns using data provided by the Michigan Department of Transportation.

“We are considering things like making sure that our users won’t have to go out of their way to find a charging station or face significant delays while waiting for an available charger,” said Ghamami in a press release from Michigan State. “It’s not just the investment that we are considering, but also the EV users; we want to make sure every single EV trip is feasible.”

EV batteries perform worse in the winter, the authors note, which contributes to the need for more frequent charging and perhaps more chargers.

“Electric vehicle battery performance drops 30% efficiency in winter,” said Ghamami. “So, we ran different scenarios by comparing charging needs in summer to winter, in which battery performance is 70% of what it is in summer.”

Tourism also will increase the number of charging stations Michigan needs, the report said. The report found that DC fast chargers charge an EV battery quickly, but these chargers are harder on battery life.

“These findings from Michigan State University’s research reinforces [sic] our commitment to a smart, data-driven approach to expanding Michigan’s EV infrastructure,” said Michigan’s Chief Mobility Officer Justine Johnson, per the MSU press release. “Understanding how and when EV users travel ensures we can build out Michigan’s mobility ecosystem and increase charging access for users across the state. In Michigan, we will continue to lead through our innovative measures to accelerate the transition to electric mobility and supporting the needs of all Michiganders.”

The Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity and the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification funded the study.

In 2023, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids made up 0.76% of vehicles in Michigan, compared to 4.85% in California and 1.52% nationwide, the report said.

The state is 1.9 million electric vehicles behind its 2030 goal.

“The total infrastructure cost to support all EV trips based on 25% market share in Michigan is estimated at $998 million, including $677 million for DC fast chargers and $321 million for (slower) Level 2 chargers. These costs include the cost of chargers as well as associated expenses such as grid infrastructure, construction, and land,” the report said.

The state has allocated millions of dollars to build chargers, said Rep. Pat Outman, R-Six Lakes, chairman of the Michigan House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Before the people of Michigan give more money to build EV chargers, they need answers to what happened to that money.

""When you’re talking about a billion dollars, the state deserves answers about why it failed to build chargers with the original $30 million allocated to build chargers,” Outman told Michigan Capitol Confidential in a phone interview.

Whitmer’s 2025 budget pitched $85 million in subsidies for electric vehicles, including $25 million for EV charging stations at multifamily complexes and commercial parking lots, $20 million to transition government fleets to EVs and hydrogen vehicles, and $10 million to transition the state fleet from internal combustion engines to EVs.

A sparse EV charging network probably isn’t even in the top 20 problems that Michigan residents face daily, Outman said. “I’m more concerned about long-term sustainable road funding, infrastructure needs, labor, issues, population issues,” he told CapCon. “Just with the cost of living nowadays days, Michigan families are already paying record high taxes to Lansing. Before we ask for billions more, the government needs to prove it can responsibly manage the money it already has. If $30 million did in fact lead to zero chargers, then why should anyone believe that $1 billion would be any better?”

Most people who own electric vehicles are male and earn nearly $200,000 annually, own a home, own multiple vehicles and have access to home charging, according to a 2021 MIT Science Policy Review article. Charger subsidies, according to Outman, would force Michiganders to pay for the lifestyles of the rich.

“These are wealthier, well-off people who are going out there and buying electric vehicles, and we’re just subsidizing that with taxpayer dollars,” Outman said. “It’s just ridiculous.”

The biggest barriers to EV adoption are the high upfront cost, range anxiety (running out of battery power while far from a charging station) and a sparse charging network.

The report says that people hesitate to buy EVs because of what it calls “perceived limitations.”

The luxury SUV is consistently one of the automaker’s top sellers, and it’s an admirable alternative to the likes of the Audi Q5 and BMW X3.

Now, the GLC enters a new era with the introduction of the GLC with EQ Technology—the first fully electric version of the brand’s ubiquitous SUV for the US market. The new GLC will go head-to-head with other compact EVs like the Audi Q6, Porsche Macan, and the recently introduced BMW iX3.

The electric GLC features a powerful, efficient battery pack that delivers strong performance and competitive range. It also comes equipped with the latest tech, including advanced driver assistance and a massive Hyperscreen.

Design-wise, the GLC with EQ Technology looks… interesting, with styling cues like a fully illuminated grille sure to set it apart from its gas-powered counterpart. On paper, at least, Benz’s compact electric SUV appears ready to take on its rivals at Audi, BMW, and Porsche.

Performance: Power & Efficiency

The GLC with EQ Technology features a lithium-ion battery pack with a usable capacity of 94.0 kilowatt-hours. In its most powerful configuration, it delivers up to 483 horsepower—20 more than the BMW iX3’s 463 horsepower. When equipped with the optional trailer hitch, the GLC also offers an impressive towing capacity of 5,291 pounds.

Thanks to its 800-volt architecture, the GLC achieves a remarkable 443 miles (713 kilometers) of range on the generous European WLTP cycle—though this figure will likely be lower under the EPA testing cycle. With a maximum charging capacity of 330 kilowatts, it can recover up to 188 miles (303 kilometers) of range in just 10 minutes.

Riding on an optional Airmatic suspension borrowed from the S-Class, the GLC promises exceptional ride quality. It combines Airmatic with an intelligent suspension control system featuring a new Car-to-X function, which automatically adjusts damping based on upcoming road conditions. Potholes ahead? The GLC can detect them in advance and adapt the suspension accordingly.

Mercedes loudly and proudly promotes the GLC’s massive new grille with an optional 942 illuminated points‚ including the central tri-star logo. First teased last month, the grille gives the electric SUV a unique look. Love it or hate it, it definitely stands out.

LED headlights come standard, while an optional Digital Light upgrade integrates a subtle tri-star emblem into the daytime running lights. The rear lighting mirrors the front with circular LED elements that stretch across the trunk lid, also featuring tri-star accents.

Design-wise, the GLC retains its familiar compact SUV proportions and sleek roofline. Depending on the trim level, you can find chrome accents throughout the exterior—on the grille, bumpers, window surrounds, roof rails, and more.

The electric GLC rides on a 117.0-inch wheelbase—3.1 inches more than the gas-powered version. That increase translates to improved interior space, with front and rear legroom growing by 0.5 and 1.9 inches, respectively. Headroom also sees a boost: 1.8 inches in the front and 0.6 inches in the rear.

Cargo space is generous, offering 20.1 cubic feet behind the second row and up to 61.4 cubic feet with the rear seats folded flat. And yes, there is a frunk, which adds another 4.5 cubic feet of storage.

Inside, the GLC features a vegan leather interior that’s fully certified by The Vegan Society. But don’t worry, you can still add leather. Mercedes also offers premium options like new Soft Torino leather and Nappa leather—available with the AMG Line Sport Seat package.

The centerpiece of the cabin is the massive 39.1-inch Hyperscreen, which spans the entire dashboard. This advanced display integrates over 1,000 individual LEDs and features fully customizable screens for both the driver and front passenger. It runs the latest version of Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX infotainment system, enhanced with artificial intelligence support from both Microsoft and Google.

Despite its futuristic design, the GLC hasn’t gone fully digital—physical controls remain on the center console, steering wheel, and door panels, offering a tactile, user-friendly experience.

In the race to harness the power of the stars, magnetic confinement fusion approaches have long grappled with the challenge of containing plasma at temperatures hotter than the sun. For decades, superconducting magnets made from copper conductors or niobium-alloy-based low-temperature superconductors (LTS) were the backbone of any fusion reactor design. But the emergence of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes on the production floor over the course of the last decade has sparked a breakthrough in fusion magnet performance.

HTS tapes transforming the fusion landscape

HTS tapes, based on multi-crystalline REBCO (rare-earth barium copper oxide) layers, can carry immense electrical currents while operating at significantly higher temperatures and magnetic fields than their LTS counterparts. The commercial advent of this material has enabled the design of more compact, efficient, and powerful fusion reactors. With HTS-based fusion magnets, magnetic fields exceeding 20 T are now achievable. Roughly speaking, doubling the magnetic field in a tokamak or stellarator device leads to a 40-fold reduction in reactor volume without sacrificing output. This has lowered the cost and complexity of fusion prototypes, accelerating timelines for the commercial viability of clean fusion energy.

The scale-up of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) production is critical to unlocking the potential of magnetic fusion energy. With nearly $10bn in mostly private funding, the fusion industry is rapidly advancing toward commercialisation. According to the latest report from the Fusion Industry Association, of the 50+ fusion companies, 25 companies follow a magnetic confinement fusion approach, and 75% of all fusion companies expect to begin delivering electricity to the grid by 2035.

Achieving this milestone will require the construction of many HTS-based magnetic fusion devices, consuming large amounts of HTS tape that easily exceeds the global HTS tape capacity currently at around 10,000 km per year by an order of magnitude.

Growing crystalline thin films by the metre

In HTS tape manufacturing, the superconducting properties of a tape are largely determined by the quality of its few microns-thin REBCO layer, which is to be grown consecutively on tape substrates of several hundred metres up to a kilometre in length.

Various chemical and physical deposition methods, such as Chemical Solution Deposition, Chemical Vapour Deposition, Magnetron Sputtering, Electron Beam Deposition and Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) using excimer lasers, have been employed in the pursuit of achieving smooth and homogeneous REBCO films with well-aligned crystal grains and with good adherence to the adjacent material layers.

Standing out from the crowd, PLD-deposited REBCO-films exhibit an intrinsic growth structure which lends itself to superior critical current density under high fields up to 20 T and beyond. Today, PLD is the dominating REBCO manufacturing method serving all types of HTS-based fusion magnets as well as high-field magnet coils in high-resolution NMR spectrometers.

PLD rising to the occasion

PLD has long been known as an excellent method for growing high-quality oxide films on sub-square centimetre-sized substrates. To this day, thousands of excimer laser-based PLD systems are used for a few hours per day with single-digit pulse frequency in material research labs. The advent of HTS-based fusion less than a decade ago has sparked an unprecedented demand for PLD-REBCO films, where a single prototype reactor alone may consume 10,000 kilometres of typically 4 mm wide tape material. This corresponds to a total REBCO film deposition area of 40,000 m² – roughly the size of six soccer fields.

Enter the LEAP excimer laser platform

The Coherent LEAP excimer laser platform, designed for fast large-area thin film processing, has been following this demand with increasing power levels up to 300 W at the required output wavelength of 308 nm and is now employed by all major HTS tape suppliers. To scale up tape manufacturing capacity, new fabs have been built, housing multiple LEAP 300 W-based PLD systems operating at maximum intensity and at an annual capacity of several 1000 km of HTS tape. As HTS-tape demand is expected to soar with the next wave of prototype and grid-scale fusion reactors already projected, the next generation LEAP at 600 W has been introduced in June 2025 at the Laser World of Photonics Fair in Munich. With its core innovations, performance and lifetime improvements, LEAP 600 W is the most cost-effective PLD laser on the market.

LEAP 600 – A big leap toward grid energy reactors

As PLD is the rate and performance-determining process step on the HTS tape production floor, the LEAP 600 W is poised to become the linchpin of the imminent global HTS tape capacity expansion.

The LEAP 600C is a cutting-edge 600-watt excimer laser developed and produced at the Coherent excimer laser facility in Goettingen, Germany. It operates at a 308 nm wavelength and is specifically designed for industrial-scale HTS tape fabrication.

The LEAP 600 C excimer laser features on-the-fly active injection technology, which triples runtime and doubles the HTS tape throughput per PLD system compared to previous LEAP 300 W-based REBCO deposition systems.

Until now, scaling HTS tape production is still regarded by many fusion companies as a bottleneck to achieving their next fusion reactor milestones due to the limited capacity. The LEAP 600 has been introduced to the HTS tape market, with a clear focus on changing this picture.

Equally important as the next level of capacity scaling of the game-changing HTS tapes, the fusion industry needs to meet energy cost targets set by existing coal, gas and nuclear power plants. As the magnets make up for a large part of the reactor costs, in the next wave of grid reactor magnets, HTS tape procurement will be guided significantly by the performance-price ratio.

With these fusion market economics in mind, the LEAP 600 has been designed to provide unprecedented cost-efficiency and offers not only the highest power but also the lowest cost-per-watt-ratio of the LEAP excimer laser product family.

To this end, innovative developments such as on-the-fly active gas injections significantly extend the intervals between gas replacements in the LEAP 600, which the operator must conduct on a regular basis. Therefore, significantly longer batch lengths and more consecutive batches can now be achieved between the gas exchanges.

Although the laser-related expenses are but a smaller fraction in the HTS tape manufacturing cost pie chart, innovations like this are essential steps in the right direction toward supply chain readiness and putting commercial HTS-based magnetic fusion reactors as early as possible on the power grid.

Fusion and beyond – the look ahead

HTS tapes with their ongoing commoditisation via PLD-driven upscaling are poised to reshape our future in several transformative ways – first and foremost through their role in making magnetic confinement fusion more efficient and economically viable. If successful, fusion will provide virtually limitless, carbon-free energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. Thanks to HTS tapes, fusion machines can be built smaller and closer to where energy is needed—urban centres, industrial zones, or remote areas. This decentralisation could revolutionise energy infrastructure and resilience.

HTS tapes are not only advancing fusion as the holy grail of energy generation, but soon will push boundaries in energy distribution via superconducting high-voltage cables and multiple other superconducting grid components, which today are copper-based and suffer from transmission losses and inefficiencies.

Also, in a multitude of other application fields like accelerator magnets in particle physics, medical and biological imaging (MRI/NMR), HTS tapes enable cost-effective and energy-efficient system advances as opposed to traditional low-temperature superconductors.

Transportation is another area which will strongly benefit from employing HTS tapes. From ultra-fast, frictionless travel via Maglev trains powered by HTS magnets to electric aircraft and ships driven by lightweight, high-efficiency HTS motors.

In summary, HTS tapes have the potential to revolutionise our world by enabling technologies that were previously limited by energy inefficiency, size, or cost. The superconducting transformation of the world has already begun. Many hundreds of thousands of kilometres of HTS tape must be produced on the road ahead. The LEAP 600, in conjunction with sophisticated three-shift PLD system technology, will be central to success.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-1-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:03:44.801236

Arevon's Project Achievements and Advancements

Arevon's accomplishments are driven by its ability to bring renewable energy projects from development to financing through to construction and onto successful long-term operations. Over the course of the last year, Arevon has advanced more than 2,000 megawatts (MW) of projects into operations and started construction on 730 MW of new capacity.

Toward the end of 2024, Arevon began operations at its Vikings Solar-plus-Storage Project in Imperial County, California. The $529 million project, which is one of the first utility-scale solar peaker plants in the U.S., combines 157 MWdc of solar with 150 MW/600 megawatt hours (MWh) of battery storage, shifting low-cost daytime solar energy to higher-cost peak demand periods in late afternoons and evenings. Vikings's financial close was regarded as the nation's first utility-scale solar peaker plant to leverage tax credit transferability and was recognized by receiving IJGlobal's Renewables Deal of the Year – Energy Storage Award.

Also among Arevon's significant achievements was the August 2025 completion of its $2 billion Eland 1 & 2 Solar-plus-Storage Project in Kern County, California. Now fully operational, Eland delivers 758 MWdc of solar generation paired with 300 MW/1,200 MWh of energy storage, making it one of the largest installations of its kind in the nation. The project is capable of powering more than 266,000 homes annually, meeting 7% of Los Angeles's electricity needs, while its hybrid design enables day-to-night renewable delivery and bolsters grid reliability.

In Missouri, Arevon commenced construction on its Kelso 1 & 2 Solar Project, a $500 million private investment that will boost the state's installed solar capacity by almost 50 percent when operational. This two-phase project marks Arevon's first utility-scale solar development in Missouri and features an innovative Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreement with Meta, ensuring traceable renewable energy attribution. Kelso not only adds substantial American-made energy to the region but also channels targeted local investments into schools, infrastructure, and community services.

Additionally, the company announced commercial operations at its $300 million Peregrine Energy Storage Project in San Diego, a 200 MW/400 MWh standalone battery system designed to strengthen California's grid resilience and facilitate greater integration of renewable generation. Peregrine represents Arevon's fifth completed utility-scale energy storage facility in California and bolsters the company's position as a leader in battery storage development and operations.

Arevon also continues to advance construction on its almost $400 million Ratts 1 & Heirloom Solar Projects in Indiana, a combined 265 MW of capacity which are expected to be operational this year, and anticipates starting construction on its 124 MW Big Muddy Solar Project in Illinois before year-end. The company also partnered with local utilities to develop and build an additional 480 megawatts of solar energy in Indiana with the Gibson Solar and Posey Solar projects, ensuring each project was successfully integrated into their communities.

Arevon's $600 million Nighthawk Energy Storage Project, a 300 MW/1,200 MWh facility in Poway, California, is also under construction, and when operational, will be able to power up to 385,000 homes during the peak electricity demand periods for four hours each day. The project will feature modern lithium iron phosphate batteries which are the safest technology on the market today. Arevon's number one priority is the safety of those who live and work in its project areas, and the company is proud to have safely operated its energy storage facilities in U.S. communities since 2021.

Together, these projects illustrate Arevon's ability to execute at scale and deliver tangible results that propel the advancement of affordable and reliable energy in America.

Industry experts warn the models - including BMW’s “Neue Klasse” – may represent the carmakers’ last chance to turn the tide.
The carmakers face massive pressure to finally master the shift to electric mobility and related challenges such as digitalisation, said Fabian Brandt, head of Oliver Wyman in Germany.
The number of industry job openings with a focus on electric mobility has declined sharply over the past two years, according to an analysis by the Ifo economic institute.
Greenwashing accusations Environmental groups accused the carmakers of deceiving the public with their presentations at the global car show.","Against the backdrop of falling profits and shrinking global market share, German carmakers VW, BMW, and Mercedes unveiled a new generation of electric vehicles at this year’s IAA mobility show in Munich.

After disappointing sales of earlier models and investments worth billions of euros, the new vehicles promise longer ranges and faster charging times, alongside other innovations. Industry experts warn the models - including BMW’s “Neue Klasse” – may represent the carmakers’ last chance to turn the tide.

The combined market share of the three groups in the most important markets - Europe, the US and China - has fallen below 20 percent for the first time in decades, according to calculations by business daily Handelsblatt.

Of the approximately 1.2 million jobs in Germany's leading industry, 150,000 to 220,000 are at risk by 2030 due to tariffs, spiralling costs, and geopolitical tensions, consultancy Oliver Wyman warns in a report seen by the paper.

McKinsey gave a similarly bleak outlook. “The transition to electric mobility and software-based vehicles, unfavourable location conditions, new competitors and trade conditions could put up to a third of the industry's value added – 440 billion euros – at risk by 2035,” the consultancy wrote in a recent report quoted by Handelsblatt.

Last-ditch attempt?

The carmakers face massive pressure to finally master the shift to electric mobility and related challenges such as digitalisation, said Fabian Brandt, head of Oliver Wyman in Germany. “German carmakers must act now, while their coffers are still full. Otherwise, they risk ending up like many suppliers, who lack the capital to transform,” Brandt warned.

But contrary to the carmakers’ enthusiastic presentations at the IAA, they might have shifted down a gear when it comes to switching to electric drives. The number of industry job openings with a focus on electric mobility has declined sharply over the past two years, according to an analysis by the Ifo economic institute. “The development of labour demand in green jobs indicates that structural change is slowing down significantly,” said the institute’s Oliver Falck.

A report by green mobility NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) also found that European carmakers had “taken their foot off the gas” in the transition. “Europe now faces a decisive choice: to either lead the global BEV [battery electric vehicle] race and confidently enter the electric age or risk falling behind in the fossil fuel era,” T&E said, while stressing the shift remained on track thanks to cheaper batteries and better charging coverage, “despite carmakers’ attempt to slow down the EV market”.

Greenwashing accusations

Environmental groups accused the carmakers of deceiving the public with their presentations at the global car show. “German car manufacturers want to use the IAA Mobility as a fig leaf to conceal their fossil fuel-based business model,” said Jürgen Resch, head of NGO Environmental Action Germany (DUH). “Despite grandiose announcements about more e-mobility, the IAA remains primarily a greenwashing spectacle.”

Resch added that the automotive industry was lobbying aggressively against existing climate protection rules at the EU level, such as minimum CO2 standards for combustion engine cars.

Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) took a similar stance. “While car companies present themselves as innovative and modern at the IAA, the same companies and their lobby organisations in Brussels are working to turn back the clock.”

BUND called for a joint effort between the government and the carmakers to finally provide small and affordable electric cars rather than luxury models.

Car summit in the chancellery

The car show also added fuel to Germany’s political debate about how to deal with the industry crisis. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said he plans a “car summit” to discuss the steps that are necessary to halt the relative decline.

Bavaria’s premier Markus Söder, a member of the CSU, sister party to Merz’s CDU, renewed his call to reverse the EU’s 2035 ban on the sale of new combustion engines.

“The combustion engine has a future with synthetic fuels and new technologies. The EU 2035 combustion engine ban puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk,” Söder told the newspaper “Bild am Sonntag”, adding that the car industry formed the “heart of our economy – without cars, there is a risk of collapse.”

There is broad consensus that synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels, will not play a significant role in road transport because it would be far too expensive.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-08 09:01:27.134621

Her success proves that even in capital-intensive industries, like renewable energy storage, strategic vision and values-driven leadership can triumph over traditional funding constraints.","While Trump’s policies are putting the squeeze on renewable energy—cutting tax breaks and blocking solar projects—one woman-owned renewable energy storage company is proving it can weather the storm. On just $7 million in equity funding, Joley Michaelson has grown The Sun Company from a single venture into a sprawling network of energy businesses, each targeting a different piece of the industry's broken puzzle—a striking achievement in an industry where only 2.1% of venture capital flowed to female-only founder teams in 2024. Customers include Albertson and Safeway.

Founded in 2017 after Michaelson left her executive role at Tesla/SolarCity, the company has evolved from a single solar installer—handling the entire solar panel installation process— into an integrated renewable energy ecosystem developing proprietary zinc-iodide flow battery technology. Despite headwinds, the stationary energy storage market is projected to jump from $66.47 billion in 2025 to $293.59 billion by 2032.

Energy Transition Drives Growth Despite Political Headwinds

The renewable energy industry is facing mixed signals right now. On one hand, the Trump administration has rolled back climate policies and signed executive orders aimed at eliminating subsidies for wind and solar projects.

On the other hand, momentum tells a different story. Despite the policy headwinds, demand for clean power is accelerating. Solar and battery plants will account for 61% of power generation additions in 2025, marking a record year, according to the Energy Information Administration projections. With their ability to quickly bridge supply-demand gaps, solar and storage remain the fastest-growing solution to America’s energy needs.

""Major investors like Brookfield Asset Management and CDPQ are 'hoovering up renewable assets' at attractive valuations,"" notes one industry analysis, suggesting long-term investors view current conditions as buying opportunities. Falling prices, breakthrough technologies, and skyrocketing demand for clean power are driving the renewable energy boom, according to industry analysts who see Trump's return to the White House as little more than a temporary obstacle.

From Tesla Executive To Solar Energy Solutions Entrepreneur

Michaelson's journey into renewable energy began with frustration. After leaving her Tesla/SolarCity executive role in 2017, she identified three critical market gaps that convinced her to strike out on her own.

Firstly, ""I didn't believe the business models in the renewable space were accelerating the mass adoption of renewable energy, therefore not solving the big energy problems that we really had,"" Michaelson explains. ""It was an opportunist industry that was really focused around moving early adopters, which it did a great job at, but that was not going to be the long-term solution for the masses.""

The second gap involved technology. ""I didn't believe lithium ion was the future of stationary energy storage,"" Michaelson says, referring to fixed-location energy storage systems for homes, businesses, and industrial facilities—distinct from mobile applications like electric vehicles.

The third gap went deeper than business fundamentals. Michaelson envisioned what she calls ""capitalism 2.0""—reengineering capitalism around stakeholder alignment to eliminate value extraction and zero-sum dynamics. ""Really, at the heart of that is solving for relationship, because that underpinning is a very important part of our social structure,"" she notes.

This philosophy isn't just rhetoric. The Sun Company operates as a Delaware public benefit corporation, a designation allowing fiduciary decisions beyond shareholder returns. ""Most people don't even know that designation exists,"" Michaelson observes.

How An Energy Storage Startup Managed On Minimal Capital

Building an empire on $7 million investment requires extraordinary resourcefulness. Michaelson spent 2017 in research and development, reviewing hundreds of patents for long-duration energy storage technology before incorporating in 2018 with three divisions: renewable energy assets, battery technology development, and behind-the-meter renewable power plants.

The funding challenge proved formidable. ""Two percent of capital goes to women [solely founded companies] already puts me at a significant disadvantage,"" Michaelson explains. Female founders tend to be in the consumer space. ""Then put yourself into a high-tech kind of boys' World of Energy. And I'm a needle in a haystack.""

Her unconventional approach to capitalism compounded the challenge. ""I’ve had private equity and venture cap come to me and say, ‘we’ll give you exactly what you need, but we're going to take 98% of your company, and you can earn it back over time, '"" she recalls. ""Thank you, but no, thank you.""

The solution required sacrifice from her entire team. ""My early staff deferred their compensation for years,"" Michaelson reveals—a testament to their belief in her vision. She deliberately recruited from adjacent industries rather than from within the renewable energy sector (which is focused on lithium-ion solutions), bringing in talent from technology, utilities, healthcare, optics, and semiconductors.

Her selective approach to investors paid off when she connected with Alternative Wealth Partners' Kelly Ann Winget. ""We were looking for an opportunity to expand our portfolio into alternative energy, but not a copy-paste solar deal or a trendy renewable project that would be irrelevant in three years,"" Winget explains. ""The Sun Company checked a lot of those boxes for us, innovating in a way that allowed the partnership between AWP and TSC to creatively build the future of energy together.""

Full-Service Renewable Energy Model Emerges

The Sun Company has since evolved into a family of companies: The Sun Company Americas (developer/owner/operator of energy assets), The BESSt Company (battery technology), Sun Company Construction (installation), with other companies to follow.

The company's zinc-iodide flow battery technology addresses what Michaelson sees as lithium-ion's limitations for stationary storage. For her, energy accessibility, affordability, reliability, and security drive the innovation strategy.

Kim Eaves, president of Affiliate Energy Group, invested specifically for the technology's practical benefits: ""I chose to invest in The Sun Company and The BESSt Company because their technology directly tackles the demand charges and peak power costs that have long burdened my customers. Equally important, their solutions enable local sourcing and manufacturing—an essential priority for my client base.""

Stationary Energy Storage Investment Climate Remains Strong

As Michaelson prepares for a fall fundraising round through investment banking, her bootstrap approach offers lessons for other entrepreneurs facing capital constraints. ""You can bootstrap. It's hard, but you can do it. You can scrape by. It's all about your holding power,"" she notes.

The stationary energy-storage market's projected growth to $293.59 billion by 2032 suggests plenty of runway ahead. Political turbulence may cloud the immediate outlook, but companies like The Sun Company are proving that innovative business strategies can still generate serious returns when the going gets tough. The key lies in innovation—developing new approaches to old problems, nurturing solid partnerships with customers and investors, and staying ahead of the technology curve.

For female entrepreneurs in particular, Michaelson's story provides both inspiration and a roadmap—showing that principled leadership and patient capital can overcome systemic disadvantages to create lasting impact. Her success proves that even in capital-intensive industries, like renewable energy storage, strategic vision and values-driven leadership can triumph over traditional funding constraints.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bd6d064278e708536b8060/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-08 09:01:30.712837

Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis.
For rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential.
Abay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration.","The first signs of a takeoff of Africa’s green economy are raising hopes that a transformation of the continent’s fortunes may be under way, driven by solar power and an increase in low-carbon investment.

African leaders are meeting this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Africa Climate Summit, a precursor to the global UN Cop30 in November. They will call for an increase in support from rich countries for Africa’s green resurgence, without which they will warn it could be fragile and spread unevenly.

Richard Muyungi, the climate envoy and adviser to the president of Tanzania, said: “Africa is ready to be part of [the global fight to stave off climate breakdown] provided we are supported with finance, technology and capacity-building.

“There has been an increase of investments in some areas but Africa still needs a lot of financing to be able to be part of the global solution, and to address the challenges we are facing.”

Green energy is booming in Africa, with 20 countries breaking records for imports of solar panels in the 12 months to June. According to the thinktank Ember, imports of photovoltaic equipment from China rose by 60% over the past year, from 9MW in 2024 to 15MW of capacity, with a tripling of imports to countries outside South Africa.

Though the increase is impressive, it is from a low base. Africa, which boasts the greatest potential for solar power, has lagged far behind other countries in installations. Only 4% of global solar generation last year was in Africa, and in 2023, the International Energy Agency reported that Belgium had as many solar panels as the entire continent.

“There is a glimmer of light [in the increased investment] but this is still quite meagre compared to other continents in the global south,” Muyungi said.

Last year’s imported panels would add about 5% to current electricity generation capacity in 16 countries, according to Ember, but the need remains vast. About 600 million people in Africa lack access to electricity, and about a billion have only firewood or dirty fuels for cooking. Women and girls are worst affected.

Melaku Yirga, the regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation, said: “Renewable energy is not only Africa’s greatest opportunity, it is also an urgent necessity. Renewable power enables everything from irrigation and food storage to early-warning systems, healthcare and livelihoods.”

While recent increases in renewable energy investment were welcome, Yirga said the public sector and overseas aid were still vital.

“Africa has no shortage of ambition in renewable energy, but without stronger international finance and the right incentives, the private sector will remain on the sidelines and adaptation goals will go unmet,” he said.

“Private sector financing must be met with public commitments, and funding must also be long-term and reliable – short grants rarely achieve full impact, as meaningful engagement with governments and communities takes time and requires significant upfront investment.”

Reductions in overseas aid from rich countries are causing consternation among African governments, many of which are blighted by record debt burdens, exacerbated by the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent interest rate rises.

Macky Sall, the former president of Senegal, said: “The drop in official development assistance fundamentally changes the climate calculus. Where does that leave Africa, if we can no longer count on our partners’ promises?

“The costs of the climate crisis have fallen most heavily on Africa. We are not the cause. We are not only footing the largest bill – we are also seeing the cheques to stem the damage cancelled.”

Private sector companies will put cash into renewable energy, but few will help Africa adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, which are already being felt in the form of droughts, floods and crop failures. Investment to build resilience – such as water storage systems, better infrastructure and new farming techniques – is lacking.

A report published at the summit on Monday showed that while Africa needed at least $70bn a year to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, and possibly much more, only $15bn was provided in adaptation finance to the continent in 2023.

Without urgent action to address that vast financing gap, Africa’s future costs from climate impacts will balloon, wiping out a fifth of GDP by 2050.

Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation thinktank, says rich countries must increase their finance for adaptation in Africa, which is responsible for only 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions while bearing the brunt of climate breakdown.

“Europe [and other countries] will shoot themselves in the foot if they defund ODA [official development assistance],” he said. “African leaders will see it as a stab in the back.”

While Africa is behind in climate adaptation, its riches are increasingly sought after by China and the rest of the rich world.

Africa has some of the biggest deposits of “critical minerals” – elements vital to building renewable energy components. Cobalt, lithium, copper, nickel, rare earths and other minerals are abundant in parts of Africa, which has spurred a global scramble for the resources.

Human rights abuses have soared in some mining areas, with child labour and the exploitation of adult workers, particularly women, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa’s under-resourced public sector is struggling to contain the damage and ensure resource extraction is done responsibly, without causing environmental devastation and in a way that benefits local people.

Africa also abounds in gas, with reserves of the fossil fuel that have scarcely been tapped in some countries. Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis. “We do not envisage anything to stop us using gas – we need it for our development,” he said.

For rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential. If global north governments fail to address the continent’s needs, they will feel the impact. Roughly 60% of Africa’s population is under 25, a “youthquake” that could spur development or, if poorly handled, will be felt around the world.

Abay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration. If we do not provide them with jobs, and adapt to climate change, the impact will be huge and not controllable. The global north should look at this from their own national perspectives and see where their interest lies.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba407c567828cd71169084e4965e4316b837874a/285_0_3750_3001/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc9f6b413184073be8b1aa368731e64d",N,,2025-09-08 09:01:35.547899

State Associate Professor Ericka Ford is developing material that could change the way fabrics are made all over the world, improving a process that’s creating potent pollution.
Ford said these practices began in the 1940s when knowledge of its potential to harm people and the planet was limited.
Ford’s fiber can run at 1,000 meters per minute.
NCInnovation approved more than $13 million in funding for research and development at colleges across the state this year.
“We'll be able to scale up, moving from a few pounds to 100 to 200 pounds of fiber,” Ford said.","RALEIGH, N.C. — That shirt you love may not be good for the planet.

According to the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, our state's textile industry remains the largest in the nation, but experts say the sector is also a big polluter.

Research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the textile industry is responsible for pumping four gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, 5%-10% of greenhouse gas emission globally.

Inside her third-floor office at Wilson College of Textiles, N.C. State Associate Professor Ericka Ford is developing material that could change the way fabrics are made all over the world, improving a process that’s creating potent pollution.

Ford said these practices began in the 1940s when knowledge of its potential to harm people and the planet was limited.

Its impact now widely publicized. Much of this synthetic material is now produced overseas in countries with lower safety standards, but the environmental impact is felt globally.

“We don't want to just say, you pollute, you’re bad,” Ford said. “Let's reinvent and innovate the way that we are manufacturing these fibers, and that's a lot of what I'm doing.”

Ford’s acrylics are made with less waste, using every input component for the output.

“We have to think, how can we manufacture these materials in a more responsible way while still being able to benefit fibers that go into our furniture, go into our clothes,” Ford said.

She spins her fabrics in the university’s vast laboratories.

“It looks like a manufacturing facility downstairs,” she said.

Ford’s modacrylics are made with these machines.

Developing any fabric begins with raw material. It’s first fed through a card, which combs out any imperfections and dirt.

Then it’s condensed into a thinner line called a sliver and put into a coil.

The sliver heads into a separate machine to be stretched out in a process called drawing.

Eventually it’s loaded into a machine to be spun into yarn.

Ford’s fiber can run at 1,000 meters per minute.

Across the hall, advanced industrial sewing machines turn that yarn into fabrics.

While Ford’s acrylics may not be used to outfit you from head to toe, the fiber has applications for flame-retardant protective clothing and furniture, all while reducing emissions.

“We believe definitely that we can reduce the CO2 footprint of this process by like two-thirds,” Ford said.

Ford is now using NCInnovation funding from the state to increase production.

NCInnovation approved more than $13 million in funding for research and development at colleges across the state this year.

“We'll be able to scale up, moving from a few pounds to 100 to 200 pounds of fiber,” Ford said.

She hopes to prove her technology is compatible with the equipment and processes used in the United States, encouraging more production that results in superior performance.

“As researchers, we always want to push the envelope and make sure that our workers are a little safer, making sure that the consumers that buy those fibers, that they will also be safe as well,” Ford said.

Ford said two companies have agreed to use fabric prototypes in their commercial processes.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/IMG_1420-2,N,,2025-09-08 12:24:14.591336

In 2025, DOE finalized commercial water heater rules, rolled back some residential boiler standards, and delayed other mandates. For wholesalers, the uncertainty is as impactful as the rules themselves.

Understanding these standards is critical to managing inventory into 2026, preparing for price volatility, and educating customers; contractors will rely on wholesale partners for guidance.

According to the DOE Fact Sheet from January 2025, the DOE’s Appliance and Equipment Standards Program has long aimed to reduce energy costs and emissions while driving innovation. This year, three developments stand out for the PHCP supply chain:

Commercial water heaters: Condensing models required; 95–96% TE/UEF compliance by October 2026

Residential boilers: DOE withdrew the proposed 95% AFUE rule, preserving non-condensing options

Appliance/water efficiency mandates: Several have been delayed under political pressure

Voices from the supply chain

Stocking strategies must balance immediate contractor needs with long-term compliance timelines. A unit that’s legal today may be unsellable in 18 months. Pricing also remains volatile, as demand for condensing vs. non-condensing units ebbs and flows with the regulations.

“We can’t afford to stock products that might be obsolete in 18 months, but our contractors expect us to have the right mix on the shelf today,” says a regional VP at a national PHCP wholesaler. “Every rule change feels like a moving target.”

For contractors, this translates to confusion on the jobsite. They look to distributors for guidance. “Our members need predictable rules and realistic timelines. Every time standards change or get delayed, it adds confusion for contractors and their customers,” says Mark Valentini Vice President of Legislative Affairs at PHCC.

Manufacturers face their own pressures. Designing compliant equipment often requires retooling entire product lines. One water heater OEM points out that “Every new efficiency mandate means redesigning models from the ground up. Wholesalers are on the front line of explaining those changes to contractors.”

Meanwhile, DOE officials argue that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term pain. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stated in a February 2025 announcement delaying several standards that: “Our goal is to balance innovation with affordability, ensuring that efficiency standards benefit both contractors and consumers over time.”

While regulatory uncertainty can’t be eliminated, wholesalers can take proactive steps to minimize disruption:

Stay informed: Track DOE notices, PHCC updates, and manufacturer guidance to anticipate changes early.

Educate customers: Host training sessions or provide sales sheets explaining condensing vs. non-condensing equipment and compliance deadlines.

Plan inventory strategically: Use data to balance high-demand non-condensing units in the short term with condensing stock for 2026.

Leverage manufacturer partnerships: Collaborate on product rollout strategies and co-branded contractor education.

Rebates and incentives

Tax credits, rebates and utility programs all offer financial incentives that can often reduce upfront costs for electrification and energy-efficient upgrades. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Department of Energy (DOE) funding are key to this opportunity, offering layered savings that can transform project feasibility. The key is stacking incentives wisely by combining federal tax credits with DOE rebates, state- and utility-level programs.

How are the Inflation Reduction Act and DOE funding offsetting upfront costs? For IRA tax credits, there are two major players: the Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) and the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 25C).

The former covers 30% of the cost of clean energy systems such as solar panels, geothermal heat pumps or battery storage from 2022 through 2032, and usage tapers to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. It offers a 30% deduction for upgrades like heat pumps, insulation, windows and electrical panels: available from 2023 to 2032, and capped at $1,200/year for renovations and up to $2,000 for appliances like heat pumps.

The IRA also directs significant funding to the DOE for immediate rebates:

High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program (HEEHRP): Allocates $4.5 billion over 10 years to help low- and moderate-income households pivot toward electrified systems. Rebates reach up to $14,000 per home (e.g., $8,000 for heat pumps, $1,750 for heat pump water heaters, $4,000 for panel upgrades, $2,500 for wiring, $1,600 for insulation, and others)

DOE HOMES & HEAR Rebate Programs: These can be combined with 25C tax credits on overlapping retrofit work.

Regulation is never static

The DOE continues to solicit input on future rulemakings, such as energy standards for manufactured housing. That means wholesalers should expect more changes in the years to come.

For the PHCP distribution channel, one fact is clear: success won’t come from waiting for certainty. It will come from agility, transparency, and strong customer education.

The 2025 standards are a reminder that regulation is never static. But wholesalers who position themselves as both compliance experts and trusted advisors can turn these challenges into an opportunity to strengthen contractor relationships—and protect their margins in the process.",https://www.supplyht.com/ext/resources/2025/09/Pipes-stock.jpg?height=635&t=1757329230&width=1200,N,,2025-09-08 09:02:03.115509

The Advanced Energy Solutions community The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal.","There are several key energy technology trends dominating 2025.

Security, costs and jobs; decarbonization; China; India; and AI all need to be carefully monitored.

The World Economic Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community helps the energy technology community cooperate and accelerate the deployment of new energy technologies.

Geopolitical tensions, shifting policies and economic uncertainty are reshaping the landscape of energy investment. The recently dismantled US Inflation Reduction Act is one example of how rapidly things can change at a country level, abolishing incentives and policy environments for entire technologies.

Despite US policy pivots, globally things are moving fast and there is a race between countries to establish a technology and manufacturing edge. Global energy investment in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification is set to increase in 2025 to $2.2 trillion according to World Energy Investment 2025.

Here are the key trends shaping energy technology investment in 2025:

1. Security, cost and jobs

Energy security, affordability and industrial policy drive various energy technology choices and investments, particularly among energy-importing countries. Led by these factors, and despite a lower priority placed on decarbonization, clean energy investments continue to grow rapidly globally.

China's investments in renewables, energy storage and batteries, electric vehicles and nuclear, for example, aim to primarily reduce its reliance on oil and gas imports and to exert leadership in new technologies. Europe, meanwhile, made great efforts to decrease its dependence on oil and gas from Russia by investing in renewables and efficiency. Similarly, in the US, new policies are being introduced to reshore supply chains to the country.

2. Decarbonization

The importance of energy security, cost and broader industrial policies increased substantially; however, at the same time, decarbonization and emissions reductions remain top priorities for policymakers and companies.

Business plans and goals are often more practical now and timelines are sometimes extended, but a high level of commitment to decarbonization remains, including among the incumbent energy industry.

Attention is also now laser-focused on how local pollution from energy production and use can be minimized through technology to secure a social licence to operate. It is about here and now, rather than 2050.

3. China's domination

China is the dominant force in next-generation energy technologies. It is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending almost as much as the EU and US combined, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the manufacturing and deployment of renewables, energy storage, nuclear power and more.

China's industrial and energy policies are often considered to be very effective in driving domestic demand and building manufacturing and supply chains. The country dominates clean energy technology supply chains, from wind turbines and solar panels to batteries and electrolysers. This investment has been transformational for the country’s economy and has contributed to establishing China as a major player in global politics.

4. India ascends

India has set bold ambitions and demonstrated remarkable progress on its energy transition investment. It surpassed its 2030 goal of achieving 40% of installed capacity from renewable energy sources nine years ahead of time.

To replicate this success and complement it with 'made in India' goals, the central and state governments have implemented numerous tools, including incentives for domestic manufacturing and mandates for clean energy deployment. These are helping the country to emerge as a major player on the global stage when it comes to energy storage, clean hydrogen and solar panels.

Indian business champions pursue these ambitions at speed and scale. The Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex, for example, scheduled to start up in 2026, will house a gigawatt-scale manufacturing ecosystem of solar panels (10GW), battery storage (100 GWh) and electrolyzers for hydrogen (3 GW). It will be the world's largest such complex, with a built-up area equivalent to four times the size of the Tesla Gigafactory.

How is the World Economic Forum facilitating the transition to clean energy?

The Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2024 report showed that after a decade of progress, the global energy transition has plateaued amid the global energy crisis and geopolitical volatilities.

The World Economic Forum’s Centre for Energy and Materials is driving the transition to a “fit for 2050” energy system. It is a cross-industry platform building new coalitions and delivering insights required for a sustainable, secure and just energy future.

5. AI hunger

Data centre electricity consumption is set to more than double to around 945 TWh by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, slightly exceeding Japan’s total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth.

However, grid connection queues are long and complex as building new transmission lines can take four to eight years. Generation equipment is also in tight supply, with turbine deliveries for new gas-fired power plants facing lead times of several years, often with deliveries scheduled in the next decade. As electricity grids are already under strain in many places, 20% of planned data centre projects could be at risk of delays.

In fact, power availability has decisively emerged as the leading factor for data centre site selection according to the 2025 Data Center Power Report by Bloom Energy, even ahead of things like proximity to fibre optic networks. In effect, almost a third of data centres are expected to run entirely on onsite power by 2030, bypassing the entire existing grid network. Interestingly, reducing carbon emissions is a lower, but lasting, priority: 95% of those surveyed for the report affirmed that sustainability and carbon reduction targets remain.

The Advanced Energy Solutions community

The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal. No single technology will solve the energy transition alone; a mix of solutions will be needed.

Different regions, industries and companies will have their strategies, but they must work together.

Platforms, such as the Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community, can help speed up this cooperation and accelerate the deployment of new technologies, such as energy storage, clean fuels, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon removal, from decades to years.

The community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative. It supports partnerships among innovators, large energy companies, energy users and investors and informs policy-making.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_x43ADzwjsYH4tYR3r5qzSOXb61GN8FyENQiHv-oBea4.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 09:01:39.949747

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is due to hold talks with automotive industry leaders on Friday.

In a letter sent to Brussels on Monday, 150 EV executives, including bosses from Volvo Cars and Polestar, warned that any delay to the 2035 target would hand a competitive advantage to global rivals – particularly Chinese manufacturers – and undermine investor confidence in Europe's green transition.

""Weakening targets now would send a signal that Europe can be talked out of its own commitments,"" said Michael Lohscheller, Polestar's chief executive, in a statement. ""That would not only harm the climate. It would harm Europe's ability to compete.""

As part of its fight against climate change, the EU requires carmakers to progressively cut carbon emissions produced by new vehicles sold in the bloc, or face steep fines.

In March, the European Commission yielded to pressure from European automakers to give them three years, rather than one, to meet the carbon emission targets.

Two weeks ago, the heads of the European automobile manufacturers' and automotive suppliers' associations sent a letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressing that a 100 percent reduction in emissions for cars by 2035 was ""no longer feasible"".

That letter was signed by Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius – a significant endorsement from one of Europe's automotive giants.

State of play: The GOP-controlled House passed a $79 billion spending plan Aug. 26 that slashed spending for the Economic Development Leaders of Michigan's (EDLM) priority programs.

Negotiations are ongoing between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, which passed a plan in May.

Lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer may face a government shutdown if they miss the Oct. 1 budget deadline.

Zoom in: EDLM crafted a list of 10 priorities last month to set the table for funding negotiations.

The list includes $100 million for a business attraction program, $150 million for community development programs and doubling the state's R&D tax credit to $200 million.

Also: The coalition wants to expand the Transformational Brownfield Program, which provides incentives worth hundreds of millions toward Detroit's major developments.

Examples are incentives worth $425 million for local projects involving Dan Gilbert's Bedrock firm; $615 million toward the Ilitches' District Detroit; and $232 million for Henry Ford's hospital expansion in New Center, Crain's reported.

What they're saying: ""If you look at where we're at right now with the budget, they've all been zeroed out,"" Maureen Donohue Krauss, CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership, tells Axios Detroit.

Context: The House budget is a starting point for negotiations, Krauss says.

The Detroit Regional Partnership and other EDLM member groups will meet with legislators to make their case.

The other side: Michigan doesn't need corporate handouts to attract and retain businesses, says state Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), who chairs the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments.

The sector was already beleaguered by lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles, tariffs on raw materials and the rapid phaseout of a federal tax credit for purchases of E.V.s, which have led companies to delay or scale back production.

But the raid at the plant under construction in Ellabell, Ga., which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and battery supplier LG Energy Solution, raised more risks for foreign manufacturers in the United States. Immigration officials arrested 475 people. Of them, about 300 were South Korean citizens, according to the South Korean foreign minister’s office.

It is not yet clear how many of those detained by ICE last week were building the plant and how many were workers brought in to install and calibrate specialized equipment, or to train the local work force.

Some American workers in the area have complained that they have not been given a fair chance at employment at the $7.6 billion taxpayer-subsidized complex, which has been billed as the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.

These labor tensions have been building as the federal government, seeking a stronger foothold in the battery business, has wooed foreign companies to expand manufacturing on U.S. soil.

The United States is relatively new to making these batteries. The leading manufacturers are headquartered in Asia, and they typically bring engineers and technicians from their home countries to set up new factories, where assembly lines of robots coat, slice and assemble the components that help power a car. Much of the battery cell technology is proprietary, and there is little margin for error.

“When you don’t have a whole cohort of people who know how to run cell-making factories, you rely heavily on the folks from the home factory,” said Celina Mikolajczak, who was been an executive at battery companies including Panasonic.

That practice has not gone over well with American labor unions that want those jobs, said Betony Jones, who was director of the office of energy jobs at the Department of Energy during the Biden administration.

“E.V. battery companies are very secretive about I.P., so they were bringing in their own workers when it came to installing their machines and maintaining their machines,” she said, referring to intellectual property. “But unions were really pushing for that work.”

.

Over the weekend, LG Energy Solution said it suspended all U.S. business trips except for customer meetings, conferences and exhibitions, and advised all traveling employees to “immediately return home or remain at their accommodations, considering their current work status.”

The company’s pullback comes as investment in U.S. battery manufacturing was beginning to slow. Tesla’s success in popularizing electric vehicles, paired with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act three years ago, brought a flood of money to the sector. Companies poured roughly $80 billion into U.S. battery manufacturing since the middle of 2022, up from around $10 billion in the three years earlier, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investments with M.I.T.’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

But the business outlook was darkening as E.V. sales fell behind many companies’ lofty expectations. The Trump administration’s efforts this year to raise trade barriers and remake federal energy policy to be more favorable toward fossil fuels introduced new uncertainty and financial challenges. Perhaps most notably, starting next month, electric vehicles will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit that had helped make the cars more affordable for many buyers.

Other critical sectors have used labor from abroad as they build in the United States. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, for example, relied heavily on labor from Taiwan at its plant on the outskirts of Phoenix.

The raid has also caused outrage in Seoul, where major media outlets ran articles highlighting the poor conditions in which Korean workers would be held, and included a photograph released by ICE of the workers being arrested. News outlets also focused on the difficulty South Korean companies experience in securing work visas for the technicians they need to complete plants in the United States.

South Koreans can enter the United States without a visa for 90 days under a visa-waiver program that allows them to participate in tourism or attend some business meetings, but not full-time work, according to Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research think tank. A temporary business visa, known as B-1, allows for short-term training and consulting, but not full-time construction work.

On Sunday, the two countries reached a deal to free those detainees and send them home to South Korea via a chartered plane, according to Kang Hoon-sik, the chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea.

Still, the sweeping nature of the raid could make skilled technicians more apprehensive about coming to the United States, even for short stints. That could increase the cost of establishing new U.S. factories and slow construction.

“The current situation is creating a dilemma,” said Andrew Yi, a Seoul-based partner for Roland Berger, a consulting firm. Strict enforcement of certain visa rules “would in the short term delay the completion of the factories that are going up.”

Barry Zeigler, business manager of Local 188, a union that represents plumbers, pipe-fitters, welders and HVAC service technicians for 15 counties in Georgia, said South Koreans were working as welders and pipe-fitters in the Georgia plant — jobs that he said should have been given to Americans. He said he had visited the plant in the past, adding that about 65 members of his union were hired by subcontractors to lay pipes there, but were let go a few months ago.

“People think the Koreans are here to do a special job; that’s B.S.,” he said, adding that politicians had turned a deaf ear to his complaints about the factory until the raid.

The plant has been dogged for months by investigative reports by the local TV station WTOC about poor safety conditions and widespread use of unauthorized laborers. At least three workers have died at the megasite, including a man identified as Sunbok You, who was run over by a forklift in March, according to local law enforcement. The police report obtained by the station identified the forklift driver as Sunhwam Bae, who spoke to officers through a translator.

LG Energy Solution has faced safety issues at other plants as well. A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine. And this past weekend, 15 people from the same facility were hospitalized after a chemical spill, according to local news reports.

Ms. Jones, the former Biden administration official, said American workers had a right to be angry if E.V. battery manufacturers were cutting corners with safety and declining to hire and train American workers.

“There are a lot of battery factories being built across the U.S. and their workers are not dying,” she said.

In a statement, LG Energy Solution said the company prioritizes “the safety and well-being of our team” and that its $25 billion investment in North American manufacturing would create about 14,000 jobs in the United States by 2027. Hyundai said the company was “committed to maintaining the highest safety standards.” It also said its employees “are required to comply fully with U.S. laws and regulations.”

The politics are awkward for Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican who embraced the Biden administration’s clean energy policies, showering the project with an estimated $2 billion in tax credits and incentives in a bid to make Georgia the “electric mobility capital of the country.” President Trump has relentlessly attacked both electric vehicles and Mr. Kemp, who resisted Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn 2020 election results in Georgia.

Marie Hodge Gordon, director of communications at the Georgia Department of Economic Development, released a statement that emphasized the fact that electric cars — the Hyundai IONIQ 5 — have already begun rolling off the assembly line at the auto plant on the site. It stressed that the incentives for the project “are based on new, long-term Georgia jobs, not the roles under investigation by law enforcement.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/07/multimedia/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 07:00:29.739313

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-09-08 10:23:41+00:00,Maine Morning Star,Energy prices are complex. Here's what Maine lawmakers can and have done to lower them,"AnnMarie Hilton, Nancy Lavin",,,,,https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/09/08/energy-prices-are-complex-heres-what-maine-lawmakers-can-and-have-done-to-lower-them/,"Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.
However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.
Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago.
A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational.
Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.","Concerns about the high cost of energy were frequently heard in legislative hearings, debates, and throughout the halls of the State House this past session. It’s front of mind for many Mainers as prices have noticeably increased in recent years.

Calls for lawmakers to do more were heard during multiple public hearings before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee where people lined up to speak for hours, including businesses who feared their livelihood could be in jeopardy over high electricity bills.

It is an issue that Republicans in particular have raised, arguing that state policies that encourage sustainable energy use are to blame.

“The reason Maine ranks so high in electricity rates is because of bad policies passed in our state,” said House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.

How concerns about energy costs paved way for a prohibition on towns banning heating fuel sources

However, the actual dollar amount ratepayers end up shelling out each month is influenced by a multitude of factors — some of which lawmakers have more control over than others. While the global markets that dictate prices of natural gas and other energy sources are beyond the reach of state senators and representatives, there are some ways that energy costs can be addressed from Augusta.

Misleading data

In early August, new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration garnered a lot of attention by seeming to indicate that Maine had the biggest increase in the country for residential electricity rates between May 2024 and 2025.

Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.

“Unlike other states, Maine’s leaders have pursued an agenda that prioritizes green mandates and out-of-state profits over affordability for ratepayers,” said Peter Wood (R-Norway) in the Maine House Republican August 22 radio address highlighting that statistics.

However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.

Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, said it is hard to understand what methodology was used for that research because that data isn’t consistent with what the state is seeing for customers of the two privately owned utility companies, Central Maine Power and Versant.

“There have been increases over the last several years, but this year it’s actually a little bit less than it was two years ago,” Bartlett said. “It’s been a bit of seesaw in the last few years, but we’ve seen increases in various components of the bills, but it’s more like 10%, not 36%.”

Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said she couldn’t recreate the federal data that showed a 36% increase in average residential rates. She said that her office’s data shows that from June 2024 to June 2025, there was a year-over-year bill increase for residential customers of: 20.7% in CMP territory, 11.9% in Versant Bangor Hydro territory and 15% in Versant Maine Public District.

Sanborn added that smaller, consumer-owned utilities aren’t tracked in the same way, but they also account for less customers, so they wouldn’t skew the data enough to bring it up to 36%.

That data point also doesn’t seem to account for states procuring their energy rates on different schedules. Maine uses a 12-month cycle, but other states could be updating their rates more frequently.

Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago. Though, they have been falling since a peak in 2023. And people are calling on lawmakers to do more to stem the cost of electricity at a time when it feels like everyday essentials just keep getting more expensive.

So what can lawmakers do?

Electricity bills can be broken down into a few main cost components. While there is opportunity for the Legislature to address prices in each of these areas, some of that work is already underway but may take time for its impacts to be felt.

Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. Also called public policy costs, stranded costs is a catch-all category that can include the cost of storm recovery, solar incentives and a low-income assistance program.

“If Republicans were in charge, we would start by ending the solar tax known as net energy billing that subsidizes solar panels for the wealthy on the backs of Maine ratepayers,” Faulkingham said.

During the last legislative session, there was a push to reform or even repeal the state’s solar incentive program, called net energy billing, which critics like Faulkingham said would reduce electricity bills for ratepayers. While there was broad consensus the program needed to be adjusted, some didn’t agree with making it a scapegoat for the cost hike people experienced.

The average customer was paying about one cent per kilowatt-hour for policy costs over the past couple years, Bartlett said, with the typical Maine residence using about 550 kilowatt-hours each month. That jumped to 1.7 cents in 2025, which is a real increase, but not what’s driving the total people see on their bills, he added.

“The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work,” Bartlett said.

In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation into law to reform net energy billing and rein in future costs it could impose on ratepayers. While the cost of the program is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Maine Public Advocate’s Office after its passage.

Much more significant to one’s energy bill than those stranded costs is the supply rate, which reflects the cost of what actually generates the power.

“New England has historically had higher electricity prices than the U.S. average, driven by the region’s heavy reliance on natural gas to produce electricity,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.

Especially in recent years, this has driven up costs for consumers because the cost of natural gas itself is subject to national and global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

While Maine lawmakers can’t control those global market fluctuations, some believe that pursuing more sources of in-state and in-region renewable energy could offer more stable prices.

Earlier this year, the governor signed legislation that will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into the Department of Energy Resources. That new cabinet-level entity will have the authority to do clean energy procurements, which could help transition the state away from volatile natural gas and fossil fuel prices.

A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. However, the Trump administration took action early on to pause the development of offshore wind projects, leaving plans to put turbines in the Gulf of Maine on pause.

The remainder of an electric bill is the cost to deliver the electricity to the end user.

That can be broken down into transmission costs, which are regulated federally, and distribution costs, which is the price of taking energy from the bulk transmission system to the poles and wires that reach people’s homes.

Transmission prices have increased over the past decade to cover the cost of system upgrades that are passed onto ratepayers. Because New England states share a regional grid called ISO-New England, those jumps have been seen across the region.

Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.

Because of a law passed in 2022, utility companies are required to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience. The plans should also account for the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers.

Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems.

“With more low-cost, local clean energy projects, nation-leading energy efficiency programs, and efforts to strengthen our electric grid against extreme storms, Maine continues to work to protect ratepayers and build a more affordable, resilient energy future,” Burgess said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CMPbill-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 07:00:11.571889

What is this tax credit and how can American consumers take advantage of this before that deadline?
Yeah, lease plus that that that tax credit.
Yeah, so for years home owners have been able to benefit from tax credits for solar panels and heat pumps and other green energy upgrades.
This tax credit that exists right now and is expiring at the end of the year, covers about 30% of the cost.","Well, time is running out to take advantage of two tax breaks that President Trump's one big beautiful bill did away with. Joining me now is senior Autos reporter Pra Subramanian and senior reporter Emma Ackerman. So Pra, let's start with you here. The electric vehicle tax credit coming to an end on September 30th. What is this tax credit and how can American consumers take advantage of this before that deadline?

You know, so Biden's uh uh the uh the act that institute this tax credit, 7,500 bucks per EV, uh was very popular amongst consumers buying EVs and also for automakers that, you know, provided a lot of sales for them. Uh with the OBB, uh Trump now got rid of that and it's going to expire on the 30th of September. But uh some new IRS guidelines mentioned that how uh completion of the sale does not mean delivery has to take place before the 30th. So you can you and I can make a deal or with the with the with the dealership, buy the car, um sign a contract, pay uh a deposit, but if we take delivery later, we can still get that tax rate. So that's a big kind of boon for buyers who may may not find the inventory they want right now. Uh might want to wait for a car to come in, but they want to get that that that order in place. So they can do that now and it helps them get that tax rate, which is a big deal when you're buying an EV.

Are there specific kinds of EVs that consumers should consider if they're still trying to race and purchase something before that deadline?

Yeah, I kind of put together a list here about three EVs I think that could fit people's different budgets. So I I I would say in the in the under the 30, $35,000 budget, uh the Chevy Equinox EV, which is around around that price range, very capable car, nice crossover size there, you know, very utilitarian, not very fancy, but it gets the job done. And the at the mid-level, people might hate me for saying this, but the Tesla Model Y is still one of the best vehicles out there that you can buy for as an EV. a ton of capability, great software integration, great software in the car, great mobile app integration, and of course, that supercharger network which is, you know, basically ubiquitous everywhere. And finally, at the luxury high end, the BMW IX, amazing car, uh newly restyled for 2025. great exterior, better interior functions, vast range, huge power, around $90,000, so it's pretty expensive, but you can get a good lease rate and you get that tax credit, it'll help out a lot.

Have you driven any of those?

I've driven all three.

Yeah? So is it 90k worth it?

Uh if you could lease it, sure. 90k is a lot of money.

It is a lot of money.

Yeah, lease plus that that that tax credit.

Right, of course. So I'm sure it was really hard putting together that that list for us, considering your car expertise. But Emma, I want to turn to you because this isn't the only deadline that we're looking at. President Trump's legislation also ending tax breaks for some energy efficient home upgrades. So tell us more there.

Yeah, so for years home owners have been able to benefit from tax credits for solar panels and heat pumps and other green energy upgrades. Those are set to sunset at the end of the year, December 31st, and you actually have to have these upgrades installed by that date to qualify for these credits. And this comes as energy prices are rising nationwide. So this is an advantage or something that consumers might want to take advantage of pretty quickly. So I'll start with solar panel tax credits because those are pretty sizable. So the average solar panel installation can easily cost upwards of $20,000. This tax credit that exists right now and is expiring at the end of the year, covers about 30% of the cost. So the cost savings can be several thousand dollars. But again, you want to get these solar panels on your roof installed by the end of the year and I would imagine that there's sort of a mad dash for solar panel rooftop installation contractors. So you would want to try and contact some of these folks yesterday or as fast as possible. And one tax expert that I spoke to also noted, when you're going through that contract contacting process, you're also going to want to make sure to ask about timeline, like can you actually get this installed by the end of the year and have the project completed and get me the paperwork so I can qualify for this credit. Then there's another credit for energy efficiency upgrades. So this also covers 30% of the cost of say like heat pump installation or up to $2,000. and then 30% or up to $1,200 for weatherization like insulation improvements, up to 600 for electrical panels, 600 for exterior windows, and even up to $150 for an energy efficiency audit or basically just somebody to come into your home and tell you how you can save money on energy efficiency upgrades.

Interesting. And you'd have to think with the expiration of these tax credits that might deter folks from adopting some of those energy efficient upgrades. But Emma, Pras, thank you so much.

Garin.","According to the Philippines Department of Energy, the awarded projects covered various renewable energy technologies, including ground-mounted, rooftop and floating solar, onshore wind and integrated solar with energy storage systems (IRESS).

A total of 111 bids were accepted, in what the department described as a “robust” private sector response to the auction.

However, various segments of the auction were undersubscribed, notably floating solar, onshore wind and IRESS.

The department said these unsubscribed installation targets would be offered for subscription to other qualified bidders with accepted bids that exceeded the initial targets. “This mechanism ensures that unsubscribed installation targets are maximised under GEA-4, and no opportunity for [renewable energy] development is left unutilised,” the department said in a statement.

Projects awarded under GEA-4 are expected to start delivery between 2026 and 2029, contributing to the Philippines’ target of achieving a 35% share of renewable energy in the power system by 2030 and 50% by 2040.

According to the previously published terms of reference for the auction, successful developers will get 20-year supply contracts with the government for projects in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, with commercial operation dates in 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029.

Reserve prices set for the auction by the Philippines Energy Regulation Commission were PHP4.4832/kWh (US$0.079/kWh) for rooftop solar, PHP5.6800/kWh for ground-mounted solar, PHP6.5258/kWh for floating solar, PHP6.0859/kWh for onshore wind and PHP5.4028/kWh for solar battery energy storage systems.

“The results of GEA-4 affirm the strong partnership between government and the private sector in driving RE deployment. By securing over 9,000MW of new clean energy commitments, and by offering unsubscribed installation targets to other eligible bidders, we are ensuring that our transition is ambitious, inclusive, and resilient,” said Philippines energy secretary Sharon S.

NJ moves forward with $500M Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program

NJEDA drafting rules and seeking public input for implementation

$100M in credits reserved for clean energy product manufacturers

Incentives aim to fuel local investment, job creation and innovation

At a time of growing political divides, bipartisanship was on full display last month in Kearny – as Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill aimed at incentivizing manufacturing in the Garden State. Assembly Bill 5687/Senate Bill 4407, passed alongside the Fiscal Year 2026 budget earlier this summer, established the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program — a $500 million tax credit program.

“This legislation marks the single largest investment in manufacturing in New Jersey’s history – $500 million in tax credits to fuel local investment and long-term job creation,” Murphy said at the Aug. 13 signing ceremony. The event took place at MAC Products Inc. in Kearny, a third-generation, family-owned business that designs and manufactures products for electrical infrastructure throughout North America.

“And I want to repeat that this has, from moment one, been a bipartisan, all-in effort,” Murphy said. “With these new businesses and jobs, we will supercharge our state’s leadership in advanced manufacturing – at the same time, we will rebuild a stable path to the middle class.”

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority will administer the program. Eligible businesses in manufacturing industries including advanced manufacturing, non-retail food and beverage, defense, clean energy and life sciences can receive a tax credit award equal to the lesser of 0.1% of the eligible business’s total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs, or 25% of the eligible business’s total qualified investment (subject to a total cap of $150 per project).

In the first two years, $100 million in tax credits will be reserved for clean energy product manufacturers in sectors such as solar, geothermal and green hydrogen.

Stackable bonuses are available to companies holding New Jersey Business Certifications, such as Minority and Women Business Enterprises, businesses located in Opportunity Zones, or companies that have collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements in place.

After the first two years of the program, any unused proceeds will roll over into the general manufacturing allocation.

A critical time

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program comes at a critical time — amid a focus on onshoring and reshoring American manufacturing, which has become one of the few topics that brings the two political parties together.

Murphy recounted the state’s manufacturing heritage. He said that the story of American manufacturing is far from over. And is, in fact, at the dawn of a new era; pointing to MAC Products. “Look no further than right here, a family-owned manufacturer with more than 60 years of history,” said Murphy. “Today, their technology powers NJ Transit, Amtrak, PATH, and mass transit systems across the country. And MAC Products employs a highly skilled, specialized workforce – of a caliber that you will only find in our region. And many of the company’s tremendous employees are here with us today.

“And … many of them have been here for a long time – measured in decades. For some of you, your adult children have followed in your footsteps and are now pursuing their own careers right here. Your stories prove that the promise of good-paying, family-supporting manufacturing jobs is still very real in New Jersey. And with the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program, which today’s legislation will create, we’re going to make sure that more families get to live that promise – not just remember it fondly.”

Murphy noted that this program will incent companies around the globe – especially those facing the risk of new tariffs – to manufacture next-generation products, such as cutting-edge pharmaceuticals and renewable energy components, right here in the Garden State.

“And beyond attracting global investment, this program will help local companies grow, create jobs, and unleash a more prosperous future for our children,” said Murphy.

Rooted in NJ

MAC Products President Eddie Russnow spoke about his company’s history, roots and growth in Jersey.

“We have been doing this now for over 60 years. My father-in-law, who’s in the audience today, is the founder. He started this business 60 years ago,” said Russnow of Ed Gollob. “And sitting next to him is my son, Henry. So, he’s the third generation of the business, which as my wife tells me – he’s my retirement plan.

“Our company started with three people when my father-in-law started the business. And at that time, all we were doing were making lugs and connectors, which are used to terminate wires and cables for electrical power products,” Russnow explained. “But over the years, this company has evolved tremendously, as you can see from this heavy technical product that we currently manufacture. And this is just one of about 14 different verticals or product lines that we design, manufacture – and, in some cases, maintain for our customers.”

Russnow stressed the company’s strong commitment to the Garden State.

“As I said before, we’ve been here for 60 years – and we plan to be here for a minimum of 60 more,” he said. “This is why we have multiple generations of the family in the business. And it’s truly not just our family that has multi-generations in this business.”

‘Ought to be a no-brainer’

Among the various officials, business leaders and lawmakers on hand, the spirit of bipartisanship – and even nonpartisanship – was on full display.

“This is a really important piece of legislation – and again, as the governor noted, bipartisan – almost nonpartisan,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “For the notion that American manufacturing, Jersey manufacturing ought to be a no-brainer. And I think under this governor’s leadership; really strong support from the Manufacturing Caucus, this is not a new theme.”

Sullivan noted the investment of more than $66 million for the New Jersey Manufacturing Voucher Program as an example of the administration’s focus in this sector.

“But with this bill today, we’re just getting warmed up. It’s going to make the Manufacturing Voucher Program look like the early innings. Half a billion dollars of capital deployed to the manufacturing sector – that’s going to help create thousands more new manufacturing jobs, on top of that first 7,000 or so under this governor’s leadership,” said Sullivan. He stressed that as with all of the NJEDA’s tax credit programs, the companies need to stick to their commitments. “If you promise you’re going to do something, and you do it, you get the tax credits. If you don’t – you don’t get the tax credits. This is money on the table that encourages and incentivizes people to make the investments that they want to make, particularly in this context – manufacturers.”

At the bill signing, officials noted how quickly they planned to ramp the program up. In August, the NJEDA sought public input on draft rules, which it will present to the NJEDA board for review and consideration for approval. If approved, the rules will be published in the New Jersey Register for formal public comment.

‘Upward mobility’

Sen. Mike Testa, R-1st District, co-chair of the Manufacturing Caucus, was a prime sponsor of the bill. “I stand before each and every one of you extremely grateful today,” Testa said at the ceremony. “The people want to see government work. This is a prime example of government actually working on a nonpartisan basis – not a bipartisan basis.”

As Testa thanked the officials gathered for their efforts in getting this legislation over the finish line, he recounted a story about a woman he met in Atlantic City after he had given a speech about manufacturing.

This is a prime example of government actually working on a nonpartisan basis – not a bipartisan basis.

– Sen. Mike Testa, R-1st District

“And she said – ‘my two sons don’t need jobs,’” Testa recounted, asking her what she meant. “She said – ‘my two boys need careers.’ And I take a look at the people that work at MAC – and they’re here for over two decades. And I look at manufacturing – they are careers with extreme upward mobility.

“Manufacturing is important. And lord knows the governor and I don’t agree on a whole lot,” said Testa, who has been critical of the administration. “But we’re friends and we respect each other. And one of the aspects that Gov. Murphy has knocked it out of the park is in advanced manufacturing. Otherwise, we would not be here today.”

Testa spoke about a picture he has hanging in his office of the infamous “Trenton Makes – The World Takes” sign.

“This bill will go a long way to making sure that means something once again – and remains meaning something 50, 60, 75 years to come,” said Testa. “And this bill goes a long way to ensure that.”

Murphy added after Testa spoke, “And I would echo something Michael said – we’re not going to agree on a whole list of stuff. People would be shocked how close the two of us are privately. And that’s, I hope, a good lesson that just because you disagree on a bunch of stuff doesn’t mean you can’t find common ground in fellowship.”

‘Powerful example’

Sen. Linda Greenstein, D-14th District, co-chair of the Manufacturing Caucus, was also a prime bill sponsor. “This is a wonderful day to be here in New Jersey,” said Greenstein. “We do a lot of legislation, but we don’t always do a piece of legislation as wonderful as this one.”

She noted how much she has learned about manufacturing and its importance in the state over the years – from her late husband’s career in the field to learning from Peter Connolly and John Kennedy at the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program.

We do a lot of legislation, but we don’t always do a piece of legislation as wonderful as this one.

– Sen. Linda Greenstein, D-14th District

“I remember the first time I went to an MEP meeting – and I truly didn’t realize that manufacturing was as prevalent in the State of New Jersey as it is. And I was shocked to hear about the large numbers of companies and all the different things that are being manufactured right here in New Jersey,” said Greenstein. “So, I think we can serve as a national model because we don’t really have to bring it back.

“We have it here. And this program will help us to really keep up the great work that New Jersey does in manufacturing. I look forward to seeing this bill in action.”

U.S. Rep. Rob Menendez, D-8th District, said, “The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program is a powerful example of how our state is leading the way on creating good jobs and investing in local businesses. Manufacturing is a vital part of our economy and I’m grateful to Gov. Murphy and our partners in state government for prioritizing this initiative.”

Building the workforce

Business leaders across the state applauded the new program, many of whom were on hand for the bill signing in Kearny.

“NJMEP is prepared to stand alongside NJEDA and every business this program attracts to offer targeted training, consulting, and workforce development,” said NJMEP Chief Executive Officer Connolly. “With this robust support in place, this $500 million incentive can translate into real high-quality jobs and tangible economic opportunity for the people of New Jersey.”

New Jersey Business & Industry Association President and CEO Michele Siekerka said the law represents a significant and targeted investment for New Jersey’s manufacturing sector and the economy — with no additional funding required.

“It will support much-needed workforce development in manufacturing amid both federal tariff and supply chain uncertainty that challenges these important businesses,” said Siekerka. “And it will incentivize a wide range of manufacturing activities, including advancing manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, defense, and clean energy component manufacturing.

“NJBIA thanks Gov. Murphy for signing this important bill into law, as well as the overwhelming bipartisan support within the Legislature. Let’s get to work.”

Growing the industry

Tom Bracken, New Jersey Chamber of Commerce president and CEO, said this investment reflects the state’s commitment to supporting growth in manufacturing.

“The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program aims to encourage innovation, attract new industries, and expand career opportunities in the state,” said Bracken. “By combining targeted tax incentives with the strengths of our workforce, we’re creating a stronger environment for businesses to build and grow in the Garden State.”

“New Jersey’s manufacturers are the backbone of our economy, and this program provides the kind of bold, targeted investment needed to keep them competitive in a rapidly changing economic landscape,” said Christina Renna, president and CEO, Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey. “By prioritizing innovation, job creation, and in-state capital investment, the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program sends a clear message: our state is serious about building things here at home and supporting manufacturers up and down the state.”

Made in NJ

“As the ‘Medicine Chest of the World,’ New Jersey relies on a strong manufacturing ecosystem to produce highly advanced technologically sophisticated, and life-saving biopharma and medical device products,” said Chrissy Buteas, CEO, HealthCare Institute of New Jersey. “These products – from cell and gene manufacturing to complex metallurgic bone mesh implants to radioligand therapeutic products – are made in New Jersey because of our skilled, well-trained workforce and incentives like the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program Act.”

Russnow added, that as a family business that lives by the motto “We Don’t Do Easy,” his company understands the importance of resilient, in-state manufacturing capacity.

“The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program will propel local investment, fuel job creation, and reinforce the innovation and integrity at the heart of our operations – and the operations of manufacturers across the state.”",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/08/NEXTNJ7GovTesta.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 11:04:31.754309

The investment will support the launch of the first 6,000 acres and expand the initiative across the southern US. The program currently operates across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.

The agreement will see Netflix provide partial funding as acres are planted and trees grown, with the remaining funds provided once the carbon credits are verified. The investment amount and number of carbon credits tied to the agreement were not disclosed. DCD has reached out for further information.

“Netflix’s partnership shows what’s possible when business and nature come together. With the right investment and science, natural climate solutions can be both a powerful and credible tool to address our most pressing conservation challenges,” said John Ringer, senior director of project finance and environmental markets at AFF. “We’re grateful for Netflix's leadership, and we invite other companies to follow their lead by investing in new approaches that support America’s rural communities and family-owned forests.”

The project already covers approximately 2,500 acres, with more than 1.4 million trees planted. AFF aims to expand the program to 75,000 acres by 2032, which it claims could generate up to 4.8 million carbon credits.

In addition to generating carbon credits, the project aims to have a positive impact on local landowners. The project is designed exclusively for small-acreage landowners who have historically been excluded from the voluntary carbon market due to high upfront costs and programmatic complexity. To support accessibility, AFF has committed to covering all site preparation and tree planting costs, as well as providing landowners with technical support and annual payments throughout the 30-year contract.

The purchase by Netflix is part of the company's broader effort to decarbonize its value chain. Currently, more than 95 percent of its associated emissions are Scope 3, primarily from cloud services, content production, and supply chains. Its Scope 3 emissions have surged over recent years, rising from 843,107 tons CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) in 2023 to 986,738 tCO2e in 2024, a 23 percent increase.

AWS is Netflix’s primary cloud provider, with the company moving all its back-office services to AWS servers in 2016. Previously, it had operated its own service through a small portfolio of data centers.

The company still operates its own content delivery network (CDN), comprising low-latency equipment installed at Edge locations near its customers.

“Mastercard is committed to advancing climate action and reducing waste by driving our business toward net zero emissions and leveraging our network and scale to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, regenerative economy,” says Ellen Jackowski, Chief Sustainability Officer for Mastercard.

Decarbonising payment methods

Reducing plastic use is only part of the equation.

Mastercard is accelerating digital-first issuance, tokenisation and wallet-based experiences that can eliminate the need for a physical card altogether, cutting material use, manufacturing emissions and end-of-life waste while maintaining security and convenience.

Industry collaborations, including the Greener Payments Partnership with leading manufacturers, are reshaping supply chains to phase out virgin PVC and scale circular materials.

“The world has a plastic problem,"" says Sandeep Malhotra, Executive Vice President, Products & Innovation, Asia Pacific, Mastercard.

""Solving it will be a whole-of-society task, yet efforts are often taken in isolation or without coordination.

Climate, nature and inclusion

Mastercard’s broader sustainability platform targets climate action, nature restoration and inclusive growth.

The company is progressing toward net zero emissions by 2040, mobilising partners through the Priceless Planet Coalition to restore 100 million trees by 2025 across 18 global projects and enabling consumer engagement with the Mastercard Carbon Calculator developed with Doconomy.

Building a more sustainable digital economy also means expanding access.

The company is advancing toward bringing one billion people into the digital economy by 2025 and supporting 50 million small and micro businesses, including 25 million women entrepreneurs.

By redesigning a ubiquitous product, setting clear standards and activating a global network, Mastercard is translating sustainability goals into tangible results, shrinking plastic footprints today while accelerating a digital, low-carbon payments future.

Collaborating for sustainability

Bringing sustainability to The Open helps to reflect how Mastercard is turning big stages and everyday transactions into climate action.

In 2022, Mastercard supported The Open’s water initiative to cut single-use plastics while channelling funding to the Priceless Planet Coalition, alongside programs that link spending to restoration, such as planting one tree for every fifty transactions on ekko’s “good vibes” debit card and giving WHSmith shoppers a way to back global reforestation.

Beyond events and retail, Mastercard is expanding access to clean energy through a simple PAYG solar model in Uganda as well as improving urban sustainability by partnering with more than 150 cities to make public transport smarter and more efficient.

Here's what Maine lawmakers can and have done to lower them,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/energy-prices-are-complex-heres-what-maine-lawmakers-can-and-have-done-lower-them,"Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.
However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.
Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago.
A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational.
Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.","Concerns about the high cost of energy were frequently heard in legislative hearings, debates, and throughout the halls of the State House this past session. It’s front of mind for many Mainers as prices have noticeably increased in recent years.

Calls for lawmakers to do more were heard during multiple public hearings before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee where people lined up to speak for hours, including businesses who feared their livelihood could be in jeopardy over high electricity bills.

It is an issue that Republicans in particular have raised, arguing that state policies that encourage sustainable energy use are to blame.

“The reason Maine ranks so high in electricity rates is because of bad policies passed in our state,” said House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.

How concerns about energy costs paved way for a prohibition on towns banning heating fuel sources

However, the actual dollar amount ratepayers end up shelling out each month is influenced by a multitude of factors — some of which lawmakers have more control over than others. While the global markets that dictate prices of natural gas and other energy sources are beyond the reach of state senators and representatives, there are some ways that energy costs can be addressed from Augusta.

Misleading data

In early August, new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration garnered a lot of attention by seeming to indicate that Maine had the biggest increase in the country for residential electricity rates between May 2024 and 2025.

Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.

“Unlike other states, Maine’s leaders have pursued an agenda that prioritizes green mandates and out-of-state profits over affordability for ratepayers,” said Peter Wood (R-Norway) in the Maine House Republican August 22 radio address highlighting that statistics.

However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.

Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, said it is hard to understand what methodology was used for that research because that data isn’t consistent with what the state is seeing for customers of the two privately owned utility companies, Central Maine Power and Versant.

“There have been increases over the last several years, but this year it’s actually a little bit less than it was two years ago,” Bartlett said. “It’s been a bit of seesaw in the last few years, but we’ve seen increases in various components of the bills, but it’s more like 10%, not 36%.”

Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said she couldn’t recreate the federal data that showed a 36% increase in average residential rates. She said that her office’s data shows that from June 2024 to June 2025, there was a year-over-year bill increase for residential customers of: 20.7% in CMP territory, 11.9% in Versant Bangor Hydro territory and 15% in Versant Maine Public District.

Sanborn added that smaller, consumer-owned utilities aren’t tracked in the same way, but they also account for less customers, so they wouldn’t skew the data enough to bring it up to 36%.

That data point also doesn’t seem to account for states procuring their energy rates on different schedules. Maine uses a 12-month cycle, but other states could be updating their rates more frequently.

Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago. Though, they have been falling since a peak in 2023. And people are calling on lawmakers to do more to stem the cost of electricity at a time when it feels like everyday essentials just keep getting more expensive.

So what can lawmakers do?

Electricity bills can be broken down into a few main cost components. While there is opportunity for the Legislature to address prices in each of these areas, some of that work is already underway but may take time for its impacts to be felt.

Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. Also called public policy costs, stranded costs is a catch-all category that can include the cost of storm recovery, solar incentives and a low-income assistance program.

“If Republicans were in charge, we would start by ending the solar tax known as net energy billing that subsidizes solar panels for the wealthy on the backs of Maine ratepayers,” Faulkingham said.

During the last legislative session, there was a push to reform or even repeal the state’s solar incentive program, called net energy billing, which critics like Faulkingham said would reduce electricity bills for ratepayers. While there was broad consensus the program needed to be adjusted, some didn’t agree with making it a scapegoat for the cost hike people experienced.

The average customer was paying about one cent per kilowatt-hour for policy costs over the past couple years, Bartlett said, with the typical Maine residence using about 550 kilowatt-hours each month. That jumped to 1.7 cents in 2025, which is a real increase, but not what’s driving the total people see on their bills, he added.

“The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work,” Bartlett said.

In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation into law to reform net energy billing and rein in future costs it could impose on ratepayers. While the cost of the program is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Maine Public Advocate’s Office after its passage.

Much more significant to one’s energy bill than those stranded costs is the supply rate, which reflects the cost of what actually generates the power.

“New England has historically had higher electricity prices than the U.S. average, driven by the region’s heavy reliance on natural gas to produce electricity,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.

Especially in recent years, this has driven up costs for consumers because the cost of natural gas itself is subject to national and global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

While Maine lawmakers can’t control those global market fluctuations, some believe that pursuing more sources of in-state and in-region renewable energy could offer more stable prices.

Earlier this year, the governor signed legislation that will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into the Department of Energy Resources. That new cabinet-level entity will have the authority to do clean energy procurements, which could help transition the state away from volatile natural gas and fossil fuel prices.

A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. However, the Trump administration took action early on to pause the development of offshore wind projects, leaving plans to put turbines in the Gulf of Maine on pause.

The remainder of an electric bill is the cost to deliver the electricity to the end user.

That can be broken down into transmission costs, which are regulated federally, and distribution costs, which is the price of taking energy from the bulk transmission system to the poles and wires that reach people’s homes.

Transmission prices have increased over the past decade to cover the cost of system upgrades that are passed onto ratepayers. Because New England states share a regional grid called ISO-New England, those jumps have been seen across the region.

Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.

Because of a law passed in 2022, utility companies are required to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience. The plans should also account for the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers.

Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems.

“With more low-cost, local clean energy projects, nation-leading energy efficiency programs, and efforts to strengthen our electric grid against extreme storms, Maine continues to work to protect ratepayers and build a more affordable, resilient energy future,” Burgess said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-100/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cmpbill-1024x7681757321412.jpeg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=cEUdwFJV,N,,2025-09-08 07:00:00.137662

The report’s low-case scenario warns that the U.S. could lose 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline from previous estimates. Compared with pre-HR1 projections, the country risks a total shortfall of 55 GW, or 21%, by 2030.

“Solar and storage remain the backbone of America’s energy future, supplying the majority of new power at the lowest cost,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Federal policy changes are stifling investment, raising energy costs, and putting grid reliability at risk. Yet demand for reliable, affordable energy continues to drive industry growth.”

The report notes that 77% of 2025 solar capacity was installed in states won by President Trump, including Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas, which feature among the top 10 states for new solar projects.

In the first half of 2025, the U.S. also added 13 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity, with expansions in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota, bringing total U.S. capacity to 55 GW. However, the report highlights a pause in upstream manufacturing investment in Q2, citing uncertainty over federal policies as a key risk to continued growth.

Recent executive actions, including a Department of the Interior (DOI) order increasing permitting scrutiny for solar projects, could affect approximately 44 GW of planned capacity, particularly in Arizona, California, Utah, and Nevada.

“There is considerable downside risk if federal permitting creates additional constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “The industry is navigating rapid policy changes, and uncertainty is increasing operational challenges.”

SEIA has urged DOI Secretary Doug Burgum to reconsider these measures, warning of potential job losses, higher electricity costs, and reduced U.S. competitiveness.

The report also underscores that constrained solar growth could impact the country’s broader technology and AI ambitions, while SEIA continues to advocate for grid reliability policies that integrate solar and storage solutions to meet rising demand.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/09/03/fdre-project-2025-09-03-11-56-13.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 06:59:46.001792

Previously, this plant was intended for electric vehicle production, but due to weak demand for electric vehicles, Ford shelved that plan last year.
Jacobson remarked at a JPMorgan meeting: ""I would be surprised if the number of electric vehicle retailers or sellers does not decrease in the next four to five years.""
General Motors believes that as competitors gradually exit the electric vehicle market, it is poised to capture a larger share of the electric vehicle market, although the company also stated that it is willing to pursue this goal at a more measured pace.
On the other hand, electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN.US) and Tesla (TSLA.US) will face significant revenue losses.","According to the Zhitong Finance APP, U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing to eliminate the federal car purchase incentive policy and relax emissions regulations, a move that is bringing billions of dollars in 'dividends' to Detroit automakers, who are currently refocusing their investments on gasoline vehicles.

General Motors (GM.US) announced last week that it will cut electric vehicle (hereinafter referred to as 'EV') production plans at two factories, while renovating a third factory to cease producing electric trucks and instead manufacture gasoline pickup trucks. Ford Motor (F.US) will reallocate funds originally intended for a canceled three-row electric SUV to future gasoline and hybrid vehicle projects; meanwhile, Jeep's parent company Stellantis NV has even restarted production of the high-consumption Hemi V-8 engine.

Although these regulatory relaxations have not yet been finalized, they have cleared obstacles for traditional automakers in Detroit and their established competitors, allowing them to reallocate billions of dollars originally intended for EV research and compliance with emissions regulations. Since 2022, General Motors has spent a total of $3.5 billion purchasing so-called 'regulatory credits' to meet fuel economy and emissions requirements; if Trump's policies are implemented, the demand for such credits will significantly decrease.

Coincidentally, Ford Motor has reduced its commitment to regulatory credit purchases by nearly $1.5 billion this year, with those funds now planned to be reinvested into the research and production of gasoline and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley recently told analysts that this policy adjustment 'is expected to create billions of dollars in opportunities for the company over the next two years.'

Among the $3.4 trillion fiscal plan proposed by Trump, there is a clear provision to terminate the $7,500 tax credit policy for EV purchasers on September 30; simultaneously, the plan cancels fines for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards, meaning that automakers will no longer need to purchase regulatory credits to comply with relevant regulations. Over the past two years, Stellantis NV has had to pay $190 million in fines annually.

General Motors Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson revealed to investors last month: ""The cancellation of the penalty policy will undoubtedly save us a substantial amount of money in 2026 and beyond.""

Additionally, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to revoke strict regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, and Trump has signed legislation effectively terminating similar emission regulations previously set by California.

Farley noted during the company's second-quarter earnings call: ""The EPA's decision and its stance have triggered a significant shift in the U.S. automotive industry."" He believes that the biggest beneficiary of this policy adjustment will be Ford's ""Ford Blue"" division, which is responsible for producing gasoline and hybrid vehicles—this division has faced heavy compliance pressures under previous emission regulations.

Currently, Ford is working to retrofit its plant in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, with plans to start producing the Super Duty series gasoline pickups there next year. Previously, this plant was intended for electric vehicle production, but due to weak demand for electric vehicles, Ford shelved that plan last year.

Critics have strongly condemned Trump's actions, arguing that they undermine policies aimed at controlling automotive pollution—the automotive industry is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming. During the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, the EPA stated that strict emission regulations could reduce approximately 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the policy's effective period (a scale exceeding the total annual carbon emissions of the United States) while saving vehicle owners about $6,000 in fuel and maintenance costs.

Dan Becker, head of the ""Safe Climate Transportation Campaign"" at the Center for Biodiversity, stated in a July announcement: ""The EPA is now rolling back the most critical measures that countries around the world have taken to save oil, reduce consumer fueling costs, and address global warming.""

However, automakers oppose strict emission regulations, arguing that these standards are overly stringent, forcing companies to produce plug-in models far exceeding market demand. Jacobson remarked at a JPMorgan meeting: ""I would be surprised if the number of electric vehicle retailers or sellers does not decrease in the next four to five years.""

General Motors believes that as competitors gradually exit the electric vehicle market, it is poised to capture a larger share of the electric vehicle market, although the company also stated that it is willing to pursue this goal at a more measured pace. Last week, General Motors announced that its plant in Kansas, which is scheduled to resume production of the compact electric vehicle Chevrolet Bolt starting in December, will only schedule one shift of workers for production instead of the originally planned two shifts; moreover, due to the slowdown in electric vehicle demand, the company's plant in Tennessee, responsible for producing electric Cadillacs, will also reduce one shift of capacity starting in early 2026.

Trump has promoted the relaxation of emission regulations from multiple angles, and his policy approach towards the automotive industry has become increasingly clear. Similar to his first term, Trump is attempting to create domestic jobs by loosening regulations—a goal also reflected in his aggressive tariff policies: by imposing high tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, he exerts cost pressure on car manufacturers.

It is noteworthy that the short-term cost savings from relaxed environmental regulations for car manufacturers can only offset (but not fully cover) the additional expenses brought about by tariff policies. For instance, Ford Motor has saved approximately $1.5 billion on regulatory credits so far this year, which nearly offsets the projected $2 billion net profit loss for the entire year of 2025 due to tariffs; meanwhile, General Motors has indicated that the tariff policy will impose about $3 billion in costs annually, a figure that far exceeds the company's average annual environmental compliance expenses of approximately $730 million since 2022.

On the other hand, electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN.US) and Tesla (TSLA.US) will face significant revenue losses. Since 2020, Tesla has earned over $10 billion by selling regulatory credits to other car manufacturers, with over $1 billion earned just this year. JPMorgan analysts estimate that if Trump implements policies unfavorable to electric vehicles, approximately 40% of Tesla's profits could be at risk.

Rivian's Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough stated in August that due to policy changes, the company expects zero revenue from regulatory credit sales for the remainder of the year. In the first half of this year, Rivian generated approximately $160 million in revenue from credit sales, having previously projected total credit sales revenue of $300 million for the year.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000141112df209ed9.png,N,,2025-09-08 12:21:00.131591

We’re seeing momentum in Southeast Asia and China with projects at megatonne-per-year scale, and in Saudi Arabia with industrial CCS hubs such as Jubail.","In an exclusive interview with Energy Connects at the 9th OPEC International Seminar in Vienna, Austria, Jarad Daniels, CEO of the Global CCS Institute, explained why carbon capture and storage (CCS) is no longer just a supporting technology but a central pillar of any serious climate strategy. Daniels outlined how CCS has evolved from a power-sector solution to an industrial necessity, and why gigatonne-scale deployment is unavoidable if the world hopes to meet its mid-century climate targets. He also warned of a growing skills gap and made the case for an integrated, systems-level approach that brings together renewables, nuclear, and CCS in tandem. Here are the edited excerpts from the interview:

Give us a perspective on the role of the Global CCS Institute.

The Global CCS Institute was started by the Australian government over a decade ago with the mission of accelerating the commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage as a technology essential for tackling climate change. It is an international, member-based think tank. About two-thirds of our members are now governments, both federal and sub-national, and the rest are private companies in the energy and CCS space. Together, we focus on overcoming the critical issues to accelerate CCS deployment worldwide, but with tailored approaches for each region.

CCS has seen strong support in recent years, but also pushback from some quarters. What are your thoughts, and how do you see the future of technologies like carbon capture?

I’ve been working in CCS for around 25 years, first with the US Department of Energy and now at the Global CCS Institute.

Two decades ago, CCS was seen primarily as a way to decarbonise the stationary power sector, when coal still supplied more than half of US electricity and China’s growth was accelerating. The conversation then shifted: the same expertise used to extract oil and gas is needed to return CO2 securely to the subsurface. Oil and gas companies became essential for deploying CCS at the gigatonne scale required by climate science.

In the past five years, heavy industries such as cement and steel have entered the debate. These sectors have no alternative technology pathway. Even if powered entirely by renewable electricity, their processes emit CO2 as an unavoidable by-product. CCS is indispensable for decarbonising such industrial point sources.

The conclusion is unavoidable: whether people like it or not, the mathematics of climate stabilisation demands gigatonnes of CCS deployment, not only at point sources but also through carbon removal technologies such as direct air capture and bioenergy with CCS.

Momentum is building. CCS is increasingly being recognised alongside renewables, efficiency, and, where acceptable, nuclear, as part of a system-wide strategy. The investment community is leaning in; the insurance sector is offering new products; and in the Global South, there is growing interest in ensuring these technologies are not limited to affluent countries but deployed globally.

Is enough being invested in CCS? What are the investment pathways?

In short, no. More investment is urgently needed, not just in CCS but in all forms of low-carbon technologies. Developed societies, governments and the private sector alike, have a responsibility to invest and support those on different stages of the journey.

Demand for energy and industrial products is relatively flat in developed economies, but rising exponentially in developing regions. This creates a unique opportunity to embed low-carbon technologies from the start, whether in power generation or new industrial facilities.

We’re seeing momentum in Southeast Asia and China with projects at megatonne-per-year scale, and in Saudi Arabia with industrial CCS hubs such as Jubail. These projects not only cut emissions but also deliver energy security, industrial resilience, jobs and wider economic benefits. CCS is becoming part of a broader investment strategy to maintain sovereign industrial capacity while lowering carbon footprints.

Looking ahead, what skills will be needed to scale CCS?

The skills gap is significant. Deploying CCS at a climate-rel.evant scale will require expertise across many fields. Engineers will be needed for above-ground capture equipment, while geologists and geophysicists must en.sure safe and permanent storage underground.

Beyond technical roles, we’ll need more project developers, financiers, and project managers because CCS projects are large, capital-intensive endeavours that demand multidisciplinary collaboration.

The next generation will need tremendous skills, not just for CCS but for all forms of clean energy. Digital tools such as AI can help optimise integration, but ultimately this is a human-capital challenge. If we are serious about climate change mitigation, we must invest in people as much as in technology.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/f4affger/1050x550.jpg?center=0.40789786237526121,0.5278868813825609&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134018006019300000",N,,2025-09-08 06:59:41.956963

The Trump administration also eliminated electric vehicle subsidies, providing the traditional energy industry with tens of billions of dollars in tax relief.

Investors had long pressured shale oil companies to reduce reckless expansion, and many firms now have limited high-quality oil well inventories, making them reluctant to increase investments in a low oil price environment.","In the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, several prominent figures in the U.S. oil industry saw their significant political investments yield substantial returns. The new administration swiftly implemented policies that favored the fossil fuel sector, including the opening of federal lands and offshore areas for exploration and drilling, the approval of new liquefied natural gas export terminals, and the rollback of numerous environmental regulations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act further bolstered the industry by providing significant tax benefits, thereby solidifying their support for the Trump administration.

The energy sector, which had been a major financial backer of Trump's campaign, witnessed immediate policy shifts that aligned with their interests. The opening of federal lands and offshore areas for drilling and exploration presented new opportunities for resource extraction, while the approval of new liquefied natural gas export terminals facilitated increased exports, potentially boosting profits for energy companies.

The rollback of environmental regulations was another critical policy change that benefited the energy sector. Many of these regulations had been viewed as burdensome and costly for oil and gas companies, and their removal allowed for more efficient and profitable operations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included substantial corporate tax cuts, further benefited the energy sector by reducing their tax burden and enhancing profitability.

These policy changes were seen as a direct result of the energy sector's political investments. The industry had spent millions of dollars on political contributions and lobbying efforts, and these investments appeared to have paid off with favorable policy changes. The energy sector's support for Trump's campaign was viewed as a strategic move to ensure that their interests were represented in the new administration, and the subsequent policy changes demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach.

Despite the policy benefits, the financial performance of energy companies did not fully align with these gains. Increased international oil supply and higher costs due to tariffs led to a decline in oil prices, resulting in reduced market values and job cuts. The current oil price of 62 dollars per barrel is below the break-even point for many small and medium-sized enterprises, significantly lower than when Trump took office. However, many executives believe that these short-term challenges are worth enduring.

The White House emphasized that the oil and gas industry is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, providing millions of high-paying jobs, and that the administration is fulfilling its promise to restore U.S. energy dominance. Environmentalists, however, criticized these measures, arguing that they would increase energy costs, exacerbate climate change, and weaken the U.S. position in the renewable energy sector.

Key figures in the energy sector, such as the executive chairman of an energy transportation company and the former CEO of a major energy firm, were significant fundraisers for Trump's campaign. Their contributions, totaling over 1300 million dollars, helped secure approvals for stalled projects, such as a liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. The Trump administration also eliminated electric vehicle subsidies, providing the traditional energy industry with tens of billions of dollars in tax relief. Companies like ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, and Devon Energy are expected to save over 12 billion dollars in taxes by 2025 alone.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to repeal a 2009 climate regulation that recognized greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and provided a legal basis for emissions monitoring. Industry lobbying groups praised this move, while environmental organizations vowed to challenge it in court.

In contrast to the Trump administration, the energy sector faced difficulties during the Biden administration, often feeling sidelined by environmental policies. Now, industry executives frequently meet with the president and influence policy directions. The American Petroleum Institute noted that their pre-election policy proposals were largely implemented by the Trump administration.

On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to boost production in Alaska. The Department of Energy also adjusted regulations to facilitate access for companies like ConocoPhillips to the resource-rich Arctic Circle. However, wind and solar energy projects faced stricter approval processes, and related tax incentives were revoked. Clean energy companies expressed concern that these policies would hinder the U.S. from keeping pace with China in the next wave of energy demand driven by artificial intelligence.

While Trump encouraged increased drilling, oil companies prioritized capital discipline. Investors had long pressured shale oil companies to reduce reckless expansion, and many firms now have limited high-quality oil well inventories, making them reluctant to increase investments in a low oil price environment. Trump's desire for oil prices to drop below 40 dollars per barrel to control inflation and support his foreign policy goals was met with caution from executives, who warned that excessively low prices could lead to bankruptcies and reduced production.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:05:38.081246

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.
That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.
And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.
“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said.","The energy and natural resource sector has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the federal government so far this year, according to data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets.

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.

Nearly $240 million poured in during the first and second quarters of 2025, with about 2,200 lobbyists representing the sector—nearly half of whom are former government employees themselves. That spending puts the sector slightly ahead of last year’s pace, when its yearly total reached $435 million.

This year’s expenditures make energy and natural resources the fifth-largest lobbying sector that OpenSecrets tracked over this period—ahead of transportation, defense and labor.

Electric utilities represented the largest share of those expenditures, totaling nearly $75 million.

That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.

And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.

The totals for oil and gas so far this year put the industry slightly below the pace of last year’s expenditures, which totaled over $150 million—its highest since 2009.

However, watchdog organizations say the industry’s steady funding is actually the result of its existing influence within the federal government.

“When you’ve got a White House that has made clear that they’re going to do whatever you want, you don’t have to spend as much money to get results,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “They had to spend more when you had bipartisan, shared control over government, and you didn’t have a rubber stamp in the Oval Office. Now they do.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration and Republicans in Congress have pushed through a slew of regulatory and legislative measures fulfilling the priorities of fossil fuel interests, often at the expense of renewables.

The party’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry that increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The administration has also granted Clean Air Act exemptions to dozens of fossil fuel-burning power plants, delaying their need to reduce emissions of mercury and other air toxins.

And the EPA’s announcement that it intends to rescind its “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases would remove the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

These moves have come amid a reversal of government support for renewable energy projects. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar that critics say runs counter to the administration’s goal of achieving “energy dominance.”

Wind energy, in particular, has been singled out as a target by the administration. Trump issued a presidential memorandum on his first day in office halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration later took the unusual step of issuing stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already under construction.

Multiple watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the real source of the fossil fuel industry’s current influence stems in part from industry insiders who have been strategically placed into key government positions. That list includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, and a range of political appointees with ties to the industry within the EPA.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson did not directly address concerns about administration officials’ ties to fossil fuel interests, but said that “President Trump has kept his Day One promise to unleash American energy, protecting our national security and lowering costs for families and businesses.”

According to Robert Maguire, vice president for research and data at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, those ties have meant that the fossil fuel industry hasn’t had to increase spending on lobbying to secure key wins.

“This has been a hallmark of both [of] Trump’s terms, where essentially he fills his administration with lobbyists and industry officials who, in many cases, have no government experience,” Maguire said. “Their only qualifications for the jobs that he’s putting them in is the fact that they want to do the industry’s bidding within the government.”

A source within the oil and gas industry, however, downplayed the effect of the “revolving door” of industry insiders gaining positions within the government, and instead emphasized that Trump came into office with an already-friendly attitude toward oil and gas.

The source, who requested anonymity to speak freely on the topic, said that industry lobbyists have had conversations with people in government who are “more engaged or more willing to talk for any number of reasons,” saying that there is “expertise” within the current administration on matters tied to the oil and gas industry that didn’t exist during the Biden administration.

Although the source emphasized that the industry has still fought difficult policy battles this year, including over tax credits for clean hydrogen projects, they said that this expertise has meant that industry lobbyists haven’t needed to spend as much effort educating lawmakers or officials on key issues.

Utilities, meanwhile, continue to have a “massive” amount of influence in D.C., according to David Pomerantz, executive director of the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute.

But he noted that far fewer utility insiders have been appointed to positions within the federal government during Trump’s second term.

And unlike the oil and gas industry, the agendas of various utility companies are more complex, and sometimes reveal significant differences between what utilities want and what the Trump administration wants.

“Where the utilities are lobbying for policies or regulatory changes that will allow them to burn more coal and gas, they’re successful,” Pomerantz said.

“The EPA basically said, ‘If you want waivers so that you do not have to comply with pollution limits, all you have to do is send us an email.’”

Still, Pomerantz said that not all utility companies sought out those exemptions—and that some utilities have also lobbied unsuccessfully against some of the Trump administration’s anti-renewables policies.

“Even [with] their considerable political power notwithstanding, the utilities have tried … to prevent some of the worst attacks on wind and solar,” Pomerantz said, “and they’ve basically failed at every turn.”

Although the renewable energy industry continues to lag behind oil and gas, its spending so far of roughly $40 million puts it on pace to eclipse last year’s record of $63.7 million.

This year’s spikes are driven in part by massive increases from the renewable industry’s top spender—the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP’s expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 alone, which reached $3.8 million, were nearly twice the amount the trade association spent in all of 2024 combined.

The $4.3 million it has spent so far this year places it ahead of any of the oil and gas industry’s trade associations. The American Petroleum Institute, by comparison, spent just under $4 million, while American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers spent less than $3 million

But Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, suggested that ACP’s efforts have been unsuccessful.

“The American Clean Power Association sort of is on the outside looking in, and I’m not sure that any amount of money is going to be able to overcome this,” he said.

Slocum also said that the association had “badly misjudged their strategy” by assuming they could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.

“They thought that they could build a bipartisan appeal for renewable energy, and you see that with a few senators like [Chuck] Grassley and [Lisa] Murkowski, but for the most part, you know, mainstream Republicans just do not want to challenge Trump publicly,” Slocum said.

In an emailed statement, ACP suggested that its efforts on Capitol Hill helped the renewable energy industry avert even worse outcomes—and defended the association’s attempts to build bridges with key Republican legislators.

“The ability to successfully remove the destructive excise tax [from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] and secure a more reasonable phase out of clean energy tax credits required a sophisticated response to underscore the impact of these policies on consumers and the communities we represent,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP.

“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said. “Securing this support for provisions that the entire Republican caucus originally voted against is an important accomplishment.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2223443093-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 05:58:47.262312

The $200 million brings Catalyze’s capital raise this year to more than $700 million, including investments from ATLAS SP Partners and RBC. Deutsche Bank, which recently announced it was holding strong on decarbonization goals despite recent pushbacks against the energy transition by the Trump Administration and other socioeconomic trends, is intended to bolster the Catalyze project rollout across the U.S.

Catalyze, which is headquartered in Houston, has developed multiple renewable and DER projects across the U.S., including standalone battery storage in the Bronx, New York, as well as community solar in southern California and western New York state.

“This HoldCo facility represents a pivotal step, enabling us to invest across our enterprise, accelerate growth, and deepen our capacity to deliver clean energy at speed and scale,” said Catalyze CEO Jared Haines in a statement. “The alignment with Deutsche Bank reflects confidence in our business model and positions us to unlock significant value for our investors, customers, and the communities we serve.”

The Deutsche facility is a three-year HoldCo revolving and term debt and letter of credit. A HoldCo facility is financing led by the holding company which owns the assets, allowing the portfolio company to raise more funds without increasing its leveraged debt load, according to various business websites. It offers liquidity to accelerate project development.

Some global banks or private equity firms, especially in the U.S., have toned down their energy transition promises. Recently, however, Germany’s Deutsche Bank announced it would stay committed to its net zero goals by 2050 and steadily cutting its own greenhouse gas emissions.

It also vows to progress decarbonization of its corporate loan portfolio, involving companies in most industrial sectors including cement, steel, oil and gas, automotives and power generation.

And while the U.S. utility-scale grid may be stressed and in dire need of capital investment, the nation may fix some of that at the edge with more than 217 GW of DER capacity before the end of the decade, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.

LONDON — Surging power demand has reignited interest in nuclear energy, but vast capital requirements and an uncertain political and regulatory climate raise questions about the sector's fiscal capacity.

Tech giants are pumping money into nuclear energy investments, looking to power energy-intensive data centers and realize their AI ambitions.

AI and data centers are the ""canary in the coal mine,"" World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León told CNBC ahead of the conference. ""We are finally recognizing that the demand of electricity and energy in general is only going to increase. But the reality is that all sectors of the economy are going to need more electricity.""

In addition to AI, applications range from nuclear energy for the metallurgical industry, which is looking to electrify as fast as possible, to the chemical, maritime and shipping sectors, León said.

The question of how to meet the world's growing power needs took center stage as chief executives of the world's biggest uranium and nuclear energy firms, experts and investors gathered for the annual World Nuclear Association (WNA) symposium at the Royal Lancaster London hotel last week.

World Nuclear Association

Kicking off discussions at the conference, Leon told attendees in her welcoming speech that the event is a ""working summit"" looking to move past mere conversation.

Investments in the nuclear value chain through 2025 are projected to increase to $2.2 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates, up from a 2024 forecast of $1.5 trillion. That level of investment raises questions over the role of government, banks and other financial players in providing sufficient fiscal capacity.

Investment challenges

Nuclear energy is said to provide a more reliable, 24/7 energy source compared to renewables, which can be more intermittent. The development of small modular reactors (SMRs) provides a more scalable power solution due to their size. According to the IEA, the payback period of a SMR investment is half the usual 20 to 30-year period for larger scale projects.

But SMRs have yet to reach the commercial stage, and most planned projects won't come online until 2030. While a significant amount of money is being pledged, there have been no new large-scale nuclear projects in the U.S. in the last 15 years.

""The first positive story with respect to the financial sector with regards to nuclear, is that they are open to financing nuclear,"" Mahesh Goenka, founder of market and commercial advisory firm Old Economy, told CNBC on the sidelines of WNA. ""That was not the story a few years ago when a lot of banks didn't want to touch nuclear projects. That has changed. The question now remains, do they have the risk appetite to finance nuclear projects?""

Challenges include over-running budgets, the late delivery of projects due to long construction lead times, the technical complexity of initiatives and difficulties obtaining licenses.

Goenka compared the West to China, where financial institutions are happy to finance nuclear projects because they can be delivered on time and on budget — leading to better margins than on other infrastructure projects. Meanwhile, the West has not built many new reactors in a very long time, so the learning rate is not quite there yet, he said.

Nearly all of the nuclear generating capacity in the U.S. comes from reactors built between 1967 and 1990, with no new constructions until 2013 when work started on the Vogtle units in Georgia. Meanwhile, the last plant to be built in the U.K. was Sizewell B, which started operating in 1995.

Nuclear investments are ""inherently political projects,"" said Mark Muldowney, managing director of energy, resources and infrastructure at BNP Paribas. He noted that, while clients are much more receptive to the investments, uncertainty over cost and build time remains.

""We are many years away from the situation in which techniques like project finance can be used by themselves to finance large nuclear [projects],"" he said during a panel discussion.

""It's not going to be the contractors, even if they were willing to, and by and large they aren't, they will be bankrupted by some of the risks that sit with these projects. So it's either going to be a government, or it's going to be the electricity consumers of that country, and in some places that could be intermediated by utilities.""

Government backstop still required

Nuclear power plants are among the most capital intensive assets. The U.K., for example, has greenlit the construction of a massive two-reactor nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast that will generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity — enough, the government says, to provide power for the equivalent of 6 million homes. But costs of the majority government-owned project have jumped to £38 billion, exceeding an initial target of £20 billion.

Other major projects have run into similar issues. The Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, ran several years behind schedule and had a budget that more than doubled during development. The U.K.'s Hinkley Point nuclear power point faced many concerns around security risks during its initial stages, as well as a budget that swelled to an estimated £40 billion.

Trevor Myburgh, senior executive in corporate finance advisory at Eskom, stressed that the private sector cannot be a ""silver bullet"" and solve the problem of financing nuclear energy.

Public private partnerships are going to be ""crucial"" in the development of nuclear, particularly in any emerging economy, Myburgh said during a panel discussion on Wednesday.

While some European countries such as Switzerland — which currently has a ban on the construction of any new nuclear plants but has drafted legislation to lift this motion — and Germany remain adverse to nuclear energy, other governments such as those of the U.K., France, and the U.S. have leaned into the energy source.

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a number of executive orders designed to fast track the development of nuclear reactors and quadruple nuclear generating capacity by 2025.

Such actions from Trump's administration have put positive nuclear energy policies ""on steroids,"" said Uranium Royalty Corp CEO Scott Melbye.

""What we're seeing are really concrete measures being taken by this administration to spur not only the building of small modular reactors, advanced reactors and large reactors, but [also] in the fuel cycle,"" Melbye told WNA attendees.

Investor Arfa Karani noted the growing interest from the investor community to find opportunities with startups, particularly those that supply nuclear-adjacent tech.

The U.K. government, in particular has adopted a more ""hands-on"" approach in helping founders understand how to invest in clean tech, she said.

""The regulation has to figure itself out. It's no longer a question of, where do we get the capital from? ....because now suddenly it's become a matter of national security and global power and global dominance,"" she told CNBC, adding that commitment Stateside to funding AI and nuclear has meant that ""all the insolvable problems suddenly becomes solvable which is very exciting for nuclear.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194091-1756968328734-gettyimages-1962138611-UK_SIZEWELL.jpeg?v=1757322690&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-08 05:58:50.412959

The Vaal University of Technology (VUT) hosted an insightful presentation titled “Decarbonisation Through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS): Engineering Pathways, Hydrogen Integration and Africa’s Clean Energy Strategy” by Dr Lord Ugwu on Friday, 5 September 2025, at the VUT main campus auditorium in Vanderbijlpark.

This event followed VUT’s successful launch of the Green Hydrogen Centre of Excellence on Thursday 04 September 2025, during which the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Professor Khaled Abou-El-Hossein, invited Dr Ugwu to deepen the dialogue on hydrogen’s pivotal role in shaping South Africa’s energy future.

The presentation drew a diverse audience, including staff from VUT’s Faculty of Engineering, the Acting Dean, Dr Nolutho Mkhumbeni and team from the Faculty of Applied and Computer Sciences, PhD candidates in Engineering, and laboratory assistants.

Dr Ugwu began by addressing the world’s continued dependency on fossil fuels, which intensifies greenhouse gas accumulation, global warming, and rising global temperatures. He emphasised the urgent need for nations such as South Africa to reassess and redirect their energy strategies towards sustainable and clean alternatives. The discussion covered the various types of hydrogen: grey, blue and green, each with distinct potentials and challenges. He underlined that the long-term goal is a clean hydrogen economy, with green hydrogen offering the most sustainable solution. He detailed methods of hydrogen production, catalytic applications, and integration into industries including transport, chemicals, fertilisers, glass manufacturing, and food and beverages.

Providing a comprehensive overview of CCUS technologies, Dr Ugwu outlined approaches ranging from post-combustion chemical absorption using amine-based solvents to advanced methods such as solid material adsorption, membrane separation, cryogenic separation, and direct air capture. He explained how these technologies capture CO₂ from flue gases, allowing for conditioning, compression, and transport, often via specialised shipping.

Highlighting utilisation pathways, Dr Ugwu explained how captured CO₂ can be repurposed for methanol and synthetic fuel production, urea fertilisers, polymers, mineralisation, and algae cultivation. He noted Africa’s unique potential to lead in clean energy innovations, drawing on its abundant sunshine and natural resources.

Drawing lessons from Canada, recognised as a leader in CCUS and hydrogen integration, Dr Ugwu illustrated how South Africa could adopt similar models in industrial hubs such as Sasol Secunda and Durban Petra. He stressed the importance of supportive policies, fiscal incentives, and carbon pricing frameworks to accelerate adoption of these technologies.

Commending VUT for its bold vision, Dr Ugwu applauded the university’s proactive steps towards becoming a centre of excellence for CCUS and hydrogen research, including ongoing doctoral projects focused on CO₂ capture. This positions VUT as a significant contributor to South Africa’s green economy transition.

In his closing remarks, Professor Khaled emphasised that the clean energy challenge is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring collaboration across faculties. He highlighted that initiatives such as this presentation empower the VUT community to make meaningful contributions to Africa’s clean energy strategy.

The interactive Q&A session revealed keen interest from academics, students, and industry stakeholders, sparking conversations on future collaborations and strategies to address regional pollution challenges.

As Dr Ugwu concluded, Africa stands poised to make significant strides towards a brighter, cleaner future, and VUT is ready to play a pivotal role in this journey.",https://vut.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Vaal-University-of-Technology-VUT-1-scaled.webp,N,,2025-09-08 05:58:57.705519

According to the US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the US is at risk of losing 44 GW of solar deployment this year, a 18% decline.

By 2030, deployment could be 55 GW lower than previous forecasts, or a 21% decline, the report noted.

At the same time, despite government pushback, solar and solar storage still accounted for 82% of new power added to the US electricity grid in the first six months of this year.

‘Backbone of America’s energy future’

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” commented SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardising the reliability of our electric grid.

“But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

More than three quarters (77%) of all new solar capacity installed this year has been developed in states that voted for president Trump – including eight of the top 10 states for new solar installations: Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas.

Elsewhere, the US added 13 GW of new solar module manufacturing capacity in the first half of 2025, with facilities opening or expanding in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. This brought total domestic module capacity to 55 GW. However, there was no new upstream manufacturing investment in Q2 2025, with federal policies threatening to stall manufacturing momentum, the SEIA noted.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” added Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.

“The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act). Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.” Read more here.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSarYrCRgtflDS1W/efac49add1b4958ecf4b859412e1b71dea0a9a757d9551590faf87034a98baac/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=news-1&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%231e6000%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2024%252F12%252Flogo-white.png%253Ffit%253D1000%25252C141%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F09%252Fpexels-kindelmedia-9875423.jpg%253Ffit%253D900%25252C600%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Solar%2520deployment%2520at%2520risk%2520of%2520falling%2520by%252018%2525%2520in%2520the%2520US%2520this%2520year%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainabilityonline.net%2Fnews%2Fsolar-deployment-at-risk-of-falling-by-18-in-the-us-this-year,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:13.352876

Electrical bills are one example of where prices are climbing. These increases are not solely driven by inflation; they are also being fueled by the construction of massive data centers across the U.S.

Different states are responding to that reality in different ways, but some are looking for large tech companies to foot the bill for their own projects, the Associated Press reported.

What's happening?

Massive data centers built by tech corporations like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are springing up across America.

Beyond traditional functions like providing websites for online shopping, this incredible explosion of computing power is being used for generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, which is many times more resource-intensive than an ordinary computer search.

The astronomical number of computer servers inside need an equally astronomical amount of electricity to run, putting the power demands of these facilities above those of entire cities such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, or New Orleans, according to AP News.

To provide this power, electrical utilities are building new infrastructure, including power lines and power plants. Meanwhile, the same power companies are making special deals with these tech companies to capture their business and ensure that data centers are built in their area of operation — deals that involve paying lower rates for power.

Why is the power use of data centers important?

Theoretically, new users on the power grid should cover the cost of the infrastructure needed to serve them. However, in practice, ordinary ratepayers are footing the bill.

Monitoring Analytics, an independent organization monitoring the mid-Atlantic grid, found that 70% of last year's increases were caused by increased demand from data centers, for example.

That means that everyday consumers — like you — are paying more because someone else is using more electricity. That's on top of all the extra pollution being generated.

This increase is ""something legislators have been hearing a lot about,"" according to Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group.

""It's something we've been hearing a lot about,"" she told AP News. ""More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I've ever seen before. There's a massive outcry.""

What's being done about rising utility rates?

For now, legislation that might keep this issue in check is still in the works in 16 states.

However, you can opt out of paying most of these fees by generating your own electricity with solar panels. You'll also lower the amount of heat-trapping pollution produced to power your home.

If you want to avoid up-front purchase costs, check out solar leasing options like Palmetto's LightReach program. If leasing isn't for you, check out EnergySage to find vetted solar installers in your area and compare quotes.

I will conclude where I started by proposing four basic elements of a U.S. energy policy to address climate change: An “all-of-the above” approach to energy sources.","In my previous piece I identified four facts I believe must be addressed for any energy policy and its associated narrative to be politically viable for the vast majority of the American public: (1) climate change is a relatively low priority for most Americans, (2) America is a center-right country, (3) it is becoming more polarized, and (4) the appetite to personally pay to address climate change is quite low. Here I will dig into this deeper, again based on data from an excellent paper “The Science vs. the Narrative vs. the Voters: Clarifying the Public Debate Around Energy and Climate” by Roger Pielke, Jr. and Ruy Teixeira of the American Enterprise institute(AEI), supplemented by more detailed data kindly provided by Dr. Teixeira. The paper is based on a survey of over 3,000 voters that was conducted for AEI by YouGov between September 20-26, 2024.

Using data from this survey and a variety of other sources I suggest four basic elements for a U.S. energy policy:

An “all-of-the above” approach to energy sources.

Energy choices should be based on economics, not ideology.

Cost and availability should determine the energy mix.

Getting the U.S. to net-zero as quickly as possible is a low priority.

I will provide data to support of each element, starting with the first one.

An “All-of-the-Above” Approach to Energy Sources

Respondents were given three choices for the supply element of an energy policy:

We need a rapid green industry transition to end the use of fossil fuels and replace them with fully renewable energy sources, regardless of the costs (22%).

We need an “all-of-the-above” strategy that provides abundant and cheap energy from multiple sources, including oil and gas, renewables, and advanced nuclear power (55%).

We need to stop the push to replace domestic oil and gas production with unproven green energy projects that raise costs and undercut jobs (23%).

The anti-fossil fuel and anti-renewables crowds are less than the “all-of-the-above-crowd.” An energy policy that ignores this will get traction depending on which party is in office but not beyond that. This is highly problematic since climate change is a forever issue and we need stable and long-term policies to deal with it, policies which can only be created in a bipartisan way.

While this may sound Pollyannish in our current polarized political environment, there is some encouraging data that suggests this is possible. Over 50% of voters across party affiliation and political ideology support the “all-of-the-above” approach. The numbers are 56%, 54%, and 53% for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, respectively; they are 53%, 59%, and 51% for Liberals, Moderates, and Conservatives, respectively. Not surprisingly, Democrats (37%) and Liberals (42%) load heavy on “renewables only” and Republicans (40%) and Conservatives (43%) load heavily on “fossil fuels only,” and Independents and Moderates are in between.

MORE FOR YOU

This preference for an “all-of-the-above” strategy is supported by data from when respondents were asked about the goals for the future energy supply. Nearly three quarters (71%) preferred to “Use a mix of energy sources including oil, coal and natural gas along with renewable energy sources” vs. 29% who preferred to “Phase out the use of oil, coal and natural gas completely, relying instead on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power only.” There’s the usual skew with those expressing preference for a mix of sources being 52% for Democrats, 64% for Moderates, and 91% for Republicans; the numbers by ideology at 47% for Liberals, 71% for moderates, and 92% for conservatives.

As a practical matter, there will be a mix of energy sources for years to come. The U.S. Energy Information Administration produces periodic reports which include projections for energy sources until 2050. Here are the latest projections prepared after the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed and before much of it was rolled back in the One Big Beautiful Bill. Between 20005 and 2020 the main trend is the replacement of coal by natural gas. The latter is about half as carbon intensive per unit of energy produced although the exact amount depends up how much methane is leaked during production since it is about 80 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period. U.S. production is much cleaner than the global average but lags the best performers of the Netherlands and Norway.

All of the four projections show an energy mix, as well as dramatic increases in solar and wind. Coal continues to decline. The big variability is the proportion of these two to natural gas. There are many variables which will determine this including government policies, relative prices, technological developments, and consumer preferences. Tradeoffs will be inevitable, such as price, availability, and reliability vs. amount of carbon emissions. The discussion we should be having in America is about the relative proportions and the tradeoffs involved in each. Those supporting a “renewables-only” future are dreaming, just as are those who only want to “Drill, Baby, Drill.” We need a narrative that is neither of these.

Energy Choices Should be Based on Economics, not Ideology

Opinion varies on what the total mix should be, as shown in Table 2 for energy preferences When combining first and second choices solar is most popular at 59%, natural gas (45%) and wind (43%) are about the same, followed by nuclear (27%) and coal (17%) at the bottom. More detailed data is provided in Table A1 “Voters’ Ranking of Energy Sources” in the report. The top two choices for Republicans and Conservatives are, in order, natural gas and nuclear. Solar ranks third, coal fourth and wind fifth. For Democrats, Independents, Liberals, and Moderates the rank order is solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, and coal. These two groupings are essentially mirror images of each other. But it’s worth noting that solar and natural gas comprise the largest two sources of energy in all scenarios except for High Uptake and equally acceptable to each group with different preferences. This suggest a second element for U.S. energy policy which is to expand solar as much as is economically feasible, without taking actions to interfere with that, and to produce as much natural gas as is needed as cleanly as possible.

It is revealing to compare these stated preferences to what is actually happening on the ground despite the loud rhetoric on both sides. California leads the nation in solar production at 68,816 GWh in 2023 but followed by Texas at 31,739 GWh and Florida at 17,806 GWh. But whereas the growth rate from 2022 to 2023 was 9% for California, it was 25% and 28% for Texas and Florida, respectively. Others in the top 10 are the purple states of North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Virginia and the blue states of New York (ranked 8th) and Massachusetts (ranked 10th).

In terms of wind production, five of the top 10 states are red (Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and North Dakota) and five are blue (Illinois, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Minnesota). The top four are, in order, Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Texas dominates with 10,545 GWh. When solar and wind are combined for 2024, five of the top six are in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Florida. Once again, Texas (with a population of about 32 million) dominates at 169,442 GWh, more than twice that of Number Two California (with a population of about 40 million) at 79,544 GWh. Whie it’s true that government policies can tip the scales on energy sources, over the long term economics, not ideology will prevail.

Cost and Availability Should Determine the Energy Mix

The question then becomes what consumers expect from an ‘all-of-the-above” policy for energy supply. When asked “What is most important to you about the energy you consume?” cost (37%) and availability (36%) are far more important than the effect on climate (19%) and the effect on U.S. energy security (6%). Democrats and Liberals rank the top three about the same at around 30%. Republicans and Conservatives rank the top two about the same at 40-45% but put climate change and energy security both at 5-8%. A third element of U.S. energy policy needs to be a focus on cost and availability.

Getting the U.S. to Net-Zero as Quickly as Possible is a Low Priority.

The fourth element of U.S. energy policy is the relative importance of different objectives for reducing the effects of climate change. Table 3 makes clear that a narrative grounded in getting the U.S. to net zero as quickly as possible is a complete non-starter. Less than one-third (29%) of voters think it is very important, and this is heavily driven by Democrats (48%) and Liberals (51%). It’s also worth noting that less than one-third of Independents (27%) and Moderates (29%) see this very important; only about in 10 Republicans and Conservatives see it this way. The top considerations are keeping costs low to consumers and increasing jobs and economic growth. Both are more important than net-zero for both Democrats (57%) and Liberals (56%). Low costs are especially important to Republicans (76%) and Conservatives (77%) suggesting that advocates for solar and wind should put more emphasis on lowering costs than reducing carbon emissions.

Increasing jobs and economic growth is the one item on which there is virtually no difference:

Democrats (58%); Liberals (56%)

Independents (54%); Moderates (60%)

Republicans (62%); Conservatives (62%)

This should be a major talking point for solar and wind. A related one is that efforts at the federal level to restrict solar and wind for ideological reasons will both increase costs and cut jobs. An analysis by Energy Innovation of the One Big Beautiful Bill found that over the next 10 years energy bills for all American households could increase by $170 billion (Texas and Florida are among the hardest hit states), we will lose 840,000 jobs by 2030 and another 790,000 by 2035, and added energy generating capacity will be less by 120 GW by 2030 and 330 GW by 2035. Those objecting to solar and wind for ideological reasons are working against their own self-interest.

More Democrats (61%) and Liberals (65%) think making sure proposals help lower-income communities is very important compared to Republicans (31%) and Conservatives (29%) with Independents (48%) and Moderates (45%) their usual in between. The reverse is true for limiting the burden of regulations on business. Just under half of Republicans and Conservatives feel this is very important compared to about one-fifth of Democrats and Liberals with Independents and Moderates roughly between the two. These results aren’t surprising to me.

What did surprise me is the small percentage of Republicans (34%) and Conservatives (33%) who think protecting the quality of the environment for future generations is important (Democrats are at 75% and Liberals are at 81%). I asked a conservative friend about this, and she wondered about the use of the word “protecting” and what this might connote for conservatives. One possibility is they see it as “protecting at all costs.” In a January 2024 survey (about which I’ll be writing a separate piece) of young rural conservatives commissioned by the American Conservation Coalition. Its “mission is to build the conservative environmental movement and it has 85,000 young conservative members across all 50 states with two of the most active ones being Texas and Florida. 40% said the environment should be protected even if it limits economic growth and 52% it should be but only if it doesn’t limit economic growth. There can obviously be tradeoffs here and people will have different relative preferences.

I will conclude where I started by proposing four basic elements of a U.S. energy policy to address climate change:

An “all-of-the above” approach to energy sources.

Energy choices should be based on economics, not ideology.

Cost and availability should determine the energy mix.

Getting the U.S. to net-zero as quickly as possible is a low priority.

I’m a “glass is half full guy” and think it is possible to create broad bipartisan support for such a policy.

New Jersey’s inability to control energy costs will undercut the many good programs intended to boost manufacturing in our state.","There’s been much discussion lately in New Jersey about bringing manufacturing companies to the state. It’s good that policymakers are paying attention and there are many laudable programs at the federal and state levels to boost manufacturing.

However, little mention is made about the cost of energy as perhaps to most expensive part of starting a manufacturing business New Jersey. It can be up to 50% of the cost of operations. Percentage shares of industrial energy consumption by the four major types of industries in the Annual Energy Outlook 2023 says it all as manufacturing dominates at 76% compared to mining at 12%, construction at 7% and agriculture at just 4%.

Can we ever lower NJ's skyrocketing energy costs?

We’ve seen energy costs in the state skyrocket this summer with little optimism that at even the current high cost, prices have stabilized. Unfortunately, this is a major impediment to jumpstarting a meaningful increase in manufacturing in New Jersey. Businesses looking at the many advantages to locating in New Jersey nonetheless will not overlook the operational risk of rising energy costs, thus limiting our potential here.

Making matters worse is the clamoring by some for a sole focus on renewables. The reality is at least for now it’s going to be extremely expensive given the recent elimination of subsidies for renewals as part of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" Act. Green advocates can continue to claim investing in green energy is affordable but the reality is the opposite and New Jersey businesses and residents are going to pay for the advocates adherence to their position.

That is why the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey has consistently expressed concerns about the state's rising energy costs, which we view as a negative factor for the business climate. The increase in costs is attributed to factors such as new electricity supply contracts, the state's clean energy policies and goals, and broader global energy price increases. CIANJ has also raised questions about the economic benefits and fairness of state subsidies for energy projects, suggesting that these subsidies may discourage future unsubsidized investment in the industry.

The primary reason energy prices are skyrocketing in New Jersey is because we do not produce enough energy in the state and are forced to buy on the PJM grid from nearby states with energy surpluses in what is now effectively a seller’s market. Simply put, we need to generate more of our own power to drive costs down and create more opportunities to bring new manufacturing to our state.

Energy costs are now a critical issue of this year’s campaign for governor between the Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Democrat Mikie Sherrill, according to Seton Hall political science professor Matt Hale.

“Ciattarelli has a natural argument to say that this is all (Gov.) Murphy’s reliance on renewables and clean energy and wind — and none of that has actually happened,"" Hale recently told NJBiz.com

“If there were wind farms out there that were producing a massive amount of energy, as Murphy had hoped, that would have mitigated the rate cost,” said Hale. “I don’t think it would have gotten rid of them, but it would have mitigated the rate increases. I think that’s an easy way for Ciattarelli to say — she’s [Sherrill] going to continue this same far left approach, while you can’t afford to buy dinner.”

What do Ciattarelli, Sherrill say about rising NJ energy costs?

Both candidates for governor have spoken about their concerns about energy costs.

Ciattarelli has correctly said that natural gas must be a critical component in helping to expand New Jersey’s in-state capacity.

“I’ve never been an advocate for wind. I believe it’s bad economics, bad energy policy and bad environmental policy,” he has stated.

“Natural gas is a very rational bridge to the future — or whenever it is the future shows up. Whether that future is fusion energy, micro, modular nuclear, carbon capture, hydrogen cell — it will arrive. But until then, we need a rational transition to the future,” he has said.

Sherrill has said she would freeze rates on “day one” and also pledged to “massively increase” in-state power generation to bring down the cost of energy, including by supporting new solar and battery storage projects, expediting upgrades at existing nuclear plants, modernizing natural gas plants, and more.

However, Gov. Phil Murphy has questioned whether Sherrill can achieve this.

“I’m not sure how you’d actually do that,” Murphy said to reporters late last month. “These are private-sector players. I’m not sure if she got into the details as to how you do it, but we’ve been spending morning, noon and night on energy, energy sources, energy affordability for years.”

Businesses need certainty not just optimistic statements to invest for future growth. New Jersey’s inability to control energy costs will undercut the many good programs intended to boost manufacturing in our state. The next governor must ensure more power is generated in here. We cannot continue to be held hostage by other states that have a surplus of energy and can essentially dictate the price New Jersey businesses and residents ultimately are paying for it.

Investment Implications: Navigating the Risks and Rewards India's solar industry is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition.
Conclusion: A Solar Sunrise Over India India's solar industry is at an inflection point.","India's solar industry is undergoing a seismic transformation, driven by a confluence of policy ambition, technological innovation, and geopolitical recalibration. As the world grapples with energy security and climate imperatives, India's push for self-reliance in solar manufacturing—coupled with its strategic response to U.S. tariffs—offers a compelling case study in supply chain resilience and clean energy leadership. For investors, this dynamic landscape presents both risks and opportunities, particularly as India repositions itself as a global manufacturing hub and a counterweight to China's dominance in the sector.

The Tariff Shock: A Catalyst for Reshoring

In August 2025, the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Indian solar goods, a move that has upended export dynamics for Indian manufacturers. Historically, the U.S. accounted for roughly one-third of India's solar module exports, with companies like ReNew Power and Vega Solar relying on American demand to scale production. The tariffs, combined with anti-dumping investigations, have forced a painful recalibration. However, this disruption has also accelerated India's pivot toward domestic demand and regional markets.

The U.S. policy shift mirrors a broader global trend of “reshoring” and “friend-shoring,” where nations are prioritizing energy security over cost efficiency. For India, this has meant doubling down on its Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) agenda. By March 2025, India's solar module manufacturing capacity had surged to 74 GW, up from 38 GW in March 2024, while solar cell capacity tripled to 25 GW. These figures underscore a strategic bet: India is no longer just a solar market but a solar manufacturing powerhouse.

Policy-Driven Resilience: From ALMM to PLI

India's self-reliance strategy is underpinned by a suite of policies designed to localize production and reduce import dependency. The Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) policy, reintroduced in April 2024, mandates that government-funded solar projects use only locally produced modules. This has spurred a wave of investments in domestic manufacturing, with the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme attracting over ₹41,000 crore in capital.

The PLI scheme's focus on high-efficiency technologies—such as TOPCon, HJT, and Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Cells—has elevated India's competitive edge. Companies like Rayzon Solar and Reliance Industries are now producing modules with efficiencies exceeding 23%, rivaling global benchmarks. Reliance's 20 GW solar manufacturing target by 2026, paired with its green hydrogen ambitions, exemplifies the sector's vertical integration drive.

Meanwhile, the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) of 25% on solar cells and 40% on modules has further insulated domestic producers from foreign competition. These measures, combined with the Domestic Content Requirement (DCR), are creating a closed-loop ecosystem where solar power producers must source components from approved local suppliers.

Diversifying the Supply Chain: Beyond China and the U.S.

India's solar industry has long relied on Chinese imports for polysilicon, ingots, and wafers—components that account for 80% of a module's cost. However, the U.S. tariffs and the “China Plus One” strategy have catalyzed a shift. By Q2 2025, India's solar cell and module imports from China had fallen by over a third compared to the previous year. Analysts predict that by 2030, India may import only raw polysilicon while producing all other components domestically.

This transition is not without hurdles. India lacks the infrastructure to mine and process critical minerals like silicon and lithium, and its coal-dependent grid raises the carbon intensity of upstream production. Yet, companies are innovating. Gujarat's first monocrystalline silicon ingot plant and Tamil Nadu's green energy-powered industrial parks signal a move toward localized, low-carbon manufacturing.

The Domestic Market: A Buffer Against Global Volatility

India's domestic demand for solar energy is a critical buffer against export headwinds. With nearly 170 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline and a 500 GW non-fossil fuel target by 2030, the country's appetite for solar is insatiable. The Prime Minister's Rooftop Solar Scheme 2025, which subsidizes residential installations, is further boosting decentralized power generation.

This domestic focus has already reshaped business models. Vega Solar, for instance, shifted from 90% exports to 90% domestic sales post-pandemic. Similarly, Reliance's solar manufacturing arm is prioritizing India's 1.3 billion population as its primary market. For investors, this shift reduces exposure to volatile international trade policies and positions India as a self-sustaining clean energy ecosystem.

Investment Implications: Navigating the Risks and Rewards

India's solar industry is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition. The sector's growth is underpinned by:

1. Policy Momentum: The PLI scheme, ALMM, and BCD create a favorable regulatory environment.

2. Cost Arbitrage: India's abundant sunlight and low labor costs make it a competitive manufacturing base.

3. Strategic Alliances: Partnerships with global innovators (e.g., Reliance's collaborations) are accelerating R&D.

However, risks persist. Upstream import dependency, energy costs, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S.-China dynamics) could disrupt progress. Investors should prioritize companies with vertical integration, green hydrogen capabilities, and strong domestic market ties.

Conclusion: A Solar Sunrise Over India

India's solar industry is at an inflection point. The U.S. tariffs, while disruptive, have accelerated a transition that was inevitable: a shift from import dependence to self-reliance. By leveraging its domestic demand, policy tools, and strategic partnerships, India is not only securing its energy future but also positioning itself as a global clean energy leader. For investors, the key is to align with companies that are building end-to-end supply chains, embracing high-efficiency technologies, and capitalizing on the country's renewable energy boom.

In the long run, India's solar story is one of resilience and reinvention—a testament to the power of strategic reshoring in an era of energy uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:31.625013

Clean energy ensures safer, better world for all

Alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, and reliable will contribute to addressing climate change, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and empowering vulnerable communities worldwide.

Provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth, renewable energy sources are abundant and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.

They also benefit communities lacking access to reliable power sources. For populations without clean energy access, the lack of reliable power hinders education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

Many of the developing regions still rely heavily on polluting fossil fuels for their daily life. If current trends continue, by 2030, around 1.8 billion people will still use unsafe, unhealthy, and inefficient cooking systems, such as burning wood.

The world needs to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by investing in clean energy, which is affordable and sustainable.

Hence, in 2023, the International Day of Clean Energy on January 26 was declared by the General Assembly as a call to raise awareness and mobilize action for a just and inclusive transition to clean energy for the benefit of people and the planet.

The day highlights the key role of clean energy in promoting sustainable development and mitigating climate change effects.

Leading renewable energy figures back North Sea,Not Available,,,,,https://www.agcc.co.uk/news-article/is-the-tide-turning-leading-clean-energy-figures-back-north-sea,"Two of Britain’s leading renewable energy figures have backed North Sea production as the cleanest way for the UK to get the oil and gas it requires.
“This isn’t about oil and gas or renewables; it’s about oil and gas and renewables,” he said.
This has led to an increase in LNG imports - which carry four-times higher emissions - from countries such as the US and Qatar, as the government compensates for declining production from the North Sea.
Mr Jackson told the Telegraph: “When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas.
He said: “It’s encouraging to hear leading renewable energy voices recognising what industry has been saying for years – that the North Sea remains the UK’s cleanest and most secure source of oil and gas.","Two of Britain’s leading renewable energy figures have backed North Sea production as the cleanest way for the UK to get the oil and gas it requires.

Jurgen Maier, chairman of Great British Energy, said that “oil and gas is our foundation” and warned the basin is “haemorrhaging workers too fast and risks losing supply chains.” He urged closer collaboration between oil and gas and renewables to protect jobs.

“This isn’t about oil and gas or renewables; it’s about oil and gas and renewables,” he said. “We must create bridges to welcome companies and workers into the clean energy sector.”

Maier admitted to “feeling nervous” ahead of the Offshore Europe industry gathering last week, but said: “I know we are at a crossroads and understand the mood and anxiousness of the oil and gas community in Aberdeen.

""We can’t repeat [past transitions] here. And there is some good news, which is that this transition is lasting much longer, and unlike the transition from coal, this time there is an alternative; renewable energy.”

Meanwhile Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy, said exploiting domestic reserves was cleaner than relying on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband banned the issuing of new drilling licences in British waters after Labour came to power last year. This has led to an increase in LNG imports - which carry four-times higher emissions - from countries such as the US and Qatar, as the government compensates for declining production from the North Sea.

Mr Jackson told the Telegraph: “When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas.

“So if we’re going to produce gas then I’ve got no problem in using local stuff.”

Mr Jackson stated that North Sea drilling would, in his view, not bring down bills, but said it would lower emissions.

He added: “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”

Both leaders - Mr Maier through GB Energy and Mr Jackson through Octopus - have been strong advocates of renewables, but their interventions highlight a growing recognition that North Sea oil and gas must continue to play a role during the transition.

Russell Borthwick, Chief Executive at Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the remarks.

He said: “It’s encouraging to hear leading renewable energy voices recognising what industry has been saying for years – that the North Sea remains the UK’s cleanest and most secure source of oil and gas.

""Aberdeen has the skills, innovation and determination to drive both the transition and our continued energy security – but we need government to match that ambition with supportive policy, starting with the removal of the Energy Profits Levy and a more nuanced approach to new activity.”",https://agcc.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/shutterstock_422654995.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:43.677394

""If Americans can be convinced of the real advantages of EVs, there's nowhere to go but up,"" EnergySage concluded.","With federal tax incentives for electric vehicles on the brink of their end date, a popular marketplace detailed myths about the clean automobiles. It noted that the United States is well behind other countries in adopting EVs.

In Norway, 90% of new vehicle sales are electric. That figure is 63% in Sweden and around 30% in the United Kingdom and China, EnergySage reported. The U.S. is at 9%.

""There's a stigma against EVs here that doesn't exist in other places, and a lot of it may stem from fossil fuel propaganda,"" the site stated. It added: ""It's time to debunk these myths once and for all.""

Big Oil, of course, has much to lose if EVs win. EnergySage noted lobbyists spent $7 million in 2021 just to work against a proposal to limit vehicle pollution from new cars, which was not set to begin until 2027.

EnergySage interviewed a trio of automobile industry experts, including Jonny Lieberman, who hosts Driving with Jonny (@drivingwithjonny). He cited people who have no interest in EVs and fear problems, such as fires, in saying, ""Every time one of those is brought up, it just strikes me as propaganda by Chevron, Shell, or the petroleum industry.""

Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, who created Transport Evolved (@transportevolved), called it a ""perfect storm of political misinformation and fossil fuel lobbying — lobbyists in America are very, very powerful.""

To counter four myths, the independent clean energy platform laid out how EVs are not much more expensive than gas-powered cars. It noted that states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers also offer incentives similar to the federal tax credits — $7,500 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one — that will expire Sept. 30. Home charging and the absence of regular maintenance needs help EV drivers break even after a few years, Gordon-Bloomfield said.

Range anxiety is also mostly a thing of the past, as today's EVs can travel 300-400 miles on one charge. The average American drives 29 miles in one day, according to the Department of Transportation. And ""even in the absolute worst conditions,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said, the charging time to reach 80% battery maxes out at 90 minutes.

EVs are far less prone to catch fire than their counterparts, with 25 blazes per 100,000 EVs sold. The rate is over 60 times higher for gas-powered vehicles, at 1,530 per 100,000. Batteries also last for 10-12 years, State of Charge (@StateOfChargeWithTomMoloughney) host Tom Moloughney told EnergySage, and they can be 80-90% efficient. Internal combustion engines are 20% efficient, with the remaining 80% of dirty energy use producing waste heat and noise, per Lieberman.

Finally, the EV industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence, per the experts. Despite their instant torque, high-tech features, and quiet cabins, electric vehicles are not as trendy as gas-powered vehicles in the eyes of consumers.

""In other countries, cars are sold very differently. In America, cars are very often seen as a status symbol, they're seen as an extension of the self,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said. ""We're buying more on image than we are on actual substance.""

In fact, EVs are converting drivers from India to France to the U.S. And almost all of them say they will never go back.

There is a huge variation of energy access for people in these situations worldwide.
So, decarbonizing energy supply is a very important part of addressing climate change.
Because most forcibly displaced people are in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change .
This interconnectedness is also the reason the new Humanitarian Energy and Climate Transitions portfolio at SEI Oxford covers both energy and climate.","On the one hand, it’s simple. Humanitarian energy refers to all the electricity, fuel, and energy technologies needed to provide power and supply cooking in refugee camps and for forcibly displaced people.

On the other hand, it’s complex . “Forcibly displaced people ” covers a number of different groups, including refugees, internally displaced people, asylum seekers, and forced migrants who have been displaced due to persecution, conflict, generalized violence, human rights violations, or the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation. Worldwide there are now over 120 million forcibly displaced people . But if we add in those experiencing humanitarian crises such as natural disasters this figure rises to 305 million people . There is a huge variation of energy access for people in these situations worldwide.

Further complicating the picture is climate change. Globally, the energy sector produces the most greenhouse gas emissions by far, over 70% . So, decarbonizing energy supply is a very important part of addressing climate change. This is particularly true in the humanitarian sector. Why? Because most forcibly displaced people are in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change . This interconnectedness is also the reason the new Humanitarian Energy and Climate Transitions portfolio at SEI Oxford covers both energy and climate. We can see that understanding how both issues come together is critical to informing policy and practice choices on reducing emissions.

As one of the interviewees for my book, “Voices in the Dark ”, said about energy: “It is underpinning everything. If you have no battery, you have no torch. If you have no panel, you have no phone charging business. If you have no diesel, you have no lights or fan. If you have no wood, you have no food”. Modern life requires energy. Could you email or use your phone without electricity, cook food without an oven or cooking appliance, or light your home in the evenings, without energy?

The same is true for refugees and displaced people: life without energy is severely limited. It is a myth that refugees and displaced people don’t need energy – over two-thirds of refugees are mobile phone users, and of course everyone needs heat to cook food and boil water.

My view is that energy access should be a human right. This might not sound like a controversial opinion, but to some it is! Some humanitarians think of energy for refugees and displaced people as a secondary concern or a luxury. As an issue, energy has been overlooked by the humanitarian community. For example, energy has long been treated as a sub-topic within water provision (electricity for water pumping) or human rights (providing basic cookstoves for women to reduce the risk of gender-based violence). While these are important matters, this tendency to treat energy as not as important as other issues means that many other household and business energy needs are forgotten or neglected.

Now, finally, energy is receiving attention within the UN. This is thanks to a confluence of factors – the work of key advocates and refugees themselves , growing recognition that emissions from humanitarian operations must be addressed as part of efforts to stem greenhouse gas emissions, and technological progress that shows how new innovations in renewable energy can help. For example, I was part of a team of researchers who contributed to a recent UN Environment Programme report that examined how new solar cookers and other innovations can help improve the situation in humanitarian settings and in “last-mile”, underserved communities.

Things vary widely: for example, in Kenya and Rwanda in East Africa people rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, and many families use candles, torches, or mobile phones for lighting. While refugees living in towns in Jordan buy fuel and gas canisters and pay for electricity from the Jordian national grid.

Electricity access is not only limited; it’s expensive. Refugees often pay high prices to charge phones or use internet shops. And in places like Gaza that are under active siege, access to basic energy services can be almost impossible to come by.

What needs to change? Displaced people need better access to more energy. Some 94% of forcibly displaced people living in camps are estimated to not have meaningful access to power. An estimated 81% lack anything other than the most basic fuels for cooking.

The sources of energy used also need to shift radically – away from diesel for generators and firewood and liquefied petroleum gas or firewood for cooking.

And things need to speed up. Consider this: more than 11,000 diesel generators are still in use by humanitarian operations, costing more than $100 million to be spent on polluting fossil fuel and emitting almost 200,000 tonnes of CO2. The humanitarian sector has been remarkably slow to switch to renewable technologies.

The systems for supplying energy within the UN are underfunded and often inefficient. Meanwhile the private sector and energy businesses find it challenging to commercially engage because humanitarian systems can be opaque and often do not support long-term investments.

For money to start flowing, change is needed for public- and private-sector sources.

For public funding, UN system reform is essential. Within the UN humanitarian system, energy gets left behind as a “secondary need”, meaning funding is spent elsewhere. UN procurement rules tightly control which suppliers can provide energy products and services. This can exclude renewable energy companies from applying for tenders. To establish new rules and ways of working requires support from donors and the UN to change some of the ways they implement energy programmes currently – by switching to using renewable technologies instead of fossil fuel powered ones ..

For private-sector financing, the problems are different. Refugee camps are seen as risky places to invest because refugees might move and not be able to repay loans. However, refugees actually have one of the highest repayment rates: the micro-lending organization Kiva suggests that over 96% of their loans have been repaid in full. Despite this, many private-sector organizations have little experience investing in displacement settings, and they are cautious. Some organizations, such as Ashden and Acumen , have started testing commercially viable sustainable energy projects with refugee entrepreneurs. But more research will be needed to understand how these investments can be scaled. For this reason, financing and investment are a first, core topic on SEI Oxford’s research agenda .

As a start, we hope the work will lead to more awareness and greater understanding of the humanitarian system among decision-makers who are essential players in setting the stage for meaningful change.

We hope the work can led to positive changes in the ways donors and investors spend money on energy and climate solutions in humanitarian settings. New research on innovative financial practices can enable more funding and financing which directly supports renewable solutions, and higher levels of energy access, for forcibly displaced people.

And overall, we hope our work can shed light on how joining together renewable energy and climate action objectives can improve the health, well-being, and quality of life of all displaced people and all those in so-called “last-mile communities” that have been left behind in the clean energy transition.",https://www.sei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-200564794-001-1374x916.webp?modtime=,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:47.013771

Conclusion Trump’s energy policies have left a legacy of market disruption and regulatory ambiguity, complicating the path to a reliable, low-carbon grid.","The Trump administration’s energy policies from 2017 to 2021 left a lasting imprint on the U.S. solar industry and grid infrastructure, creating a complex landscape of financial and strategic risks for clean energy investors. By prioritizing fossil fuels, imposing tariffs on solar imports, and rolling back environmental regulations, the administration introduced policy uncertainty that reshaped market dynamics and investor behavior. As the U.S. energy sector transitions toward decarbonization, understanding these long-term risks is critical for stakeholders navigating an evolving regulatory and economic environment.

Policy Uncertainty and Solar Investment

The Trump administration’s 2018 imposition of a 30% tariff on imported solar panels—gradually decreasing to 18% by 2022—significantly raised project costs, leading to the cancellation or delay of over $20 billion in solar investments and the loss of more than 62,000 jobs [3]. While the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) remained in place, its phased reduction from 30% to 26% by 2020 under Trump’s tenure created a vacuum in federal support for clean energy [1]. This contrasted sharply with the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded the ITC and provided a clearer policy framework for investors [1].

The administration’s broader protectionist trade policies, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, further compounded costs for solar infrastructure [4]. These measures, justified as efforts to protect domestic manufacturing, instead stifled the solar industry’s growth during a period of declining global technology costs. According to a report by BloombergNEF, U.S. renewable energy investment fell by $20.5 billion in the second half of 2024, reflecting investor recalibration amid Trump-era policy headwinds [1].

Grid Reliability and Regulatory Fragmentation

While the Trump administration rolled back over 100 environmental regulations—including the Clean Power Plan—it also introduced pro-renewable FERC orders, such as Order 841 (2018) and Order 2222 (2020), which aimed to integrate distributed energy resources into wholesale markets [4]. However, the administration’s simultaneous deregulation of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2020 created conflicting signals for grid planning [6].

Grid reliability now faces dual challenges: aging infrastructure and insufficient investment in transmission expansion. The U.S. grid, with over 600,000 miles of aging transmission lines, requires a two- to fivefold expansion to accommodate renewable energy from remote locations [3]. Trump’s “beneficiary pays” cost recovery model and slow permitting processes for transmission projects have exacerbated these challenges, creating regulatory fragmentation that hinders progress [3]. For instance, the cancellation of the Revolution Wind project under Trump’s 2025 executive orders has raised concerns about increased blackout risks and delayed decarbonization goals [1].

Investor Confidence and Capital Flow Trends

Clean energy investors have experienced heightened volatility since 2020, with climate-themed equities showing mixed performance. From 2020 to 2023, clean energy stocks averaged declines of –11% and –10.5%, driven by rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and policy uncertainty [1]. While diversified climate transition funds outperformed pure-play renewables, the sector’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors remains pronounced [1].

Academic research highlights a “greenium” effect, where investors accept lower returns for green stocks due to hedging benefits against climate transition risks [1]. However, Trump’s rhetoric—criticizing renewables as inflationary and blocking state-level EV mandates—has further muddied the waters [2]. Legal and regulatory risks, including investor-state disputes over revoked projects, add another layer of complexity [4].

Strategic Risks for Investors

The long-term risks for clean energy investors include:

1. Regulatory Whiplash: Frequent policy reversals between administrations create uncertainty, deterring long-term capital commitments.

2. Grid Modernization Delays: Without robust transmission infrastructure, renewable projects face interconnection bottlenecks, reducing their economic viability.

3. Global Competitiveness: Trump’s cuts to R&D funding for solar and wind technologies weakened the U.S. position in the global clean energy race [5].

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act has injected $369 billion into clean energy, but overcoming Trump’s legacy of deregulation and fragmented permitting will require sustained political will [4]. For investors, sectoral diversification, geographic focus, and active stock selection remain key strategies to mitigate these risks [1].

Conclusion

Trump’s energy policies have left a legacy of market disruption and regulatory ambiguity, complicating the path to a reliable, low-carbon grid.

What Is The Crucial Factor Driving The Global New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Insurance Market?

The surge in electric vehicle (EV) usage is anticipated to fuel the expansion of the new energy vehicle (NEV) insurance market in the coming years. Electric vehicles are cars powered by rechargeable batteries or fuel cells through electric motors, as opposed to traditional internal combustion engines. These vehicles offer reduced emissions, superior energy efficiency, and less reliance on fossil fuels. Their increased usage is prompted by escalating environmental concerns, considering that they have lower emission levels and contribute to the fight against air pollution and climate change. New energy vehicle insurance is customized to electric vehicles, considering their unique components such as batteries and charging equipment. This insurance service enhances the ownership experience by providing coverage against EV-specific risks, streamlining claims process, and enhancing overall vehicle management. For example, the International Energy Agency, a France-based intergovernmental organization, reported that in 2024, electric car sales hit 3.5 million in 2023, marking a 35% annual rise from 2022. Hence, the surge in electric vehicle usage is a significant driver for the growth of the new energy vehicle insurance market.

US workers can kiss another 1,000 factory jobs good-bye, now that the “salt battery” firm Natron has closed its doors. The closure is also a setback for renewable energy stakeholders, who were counting on a new generation of low-cost batteries for wind and solar storage. However, it’s not the end of the line for sodium batteries. Another US energy storage startup, Inlyte, is still on track to begin domestic production of it new sodium-iron battery formula.

Lights Out For The Natron Sodium Battery …

It seems like only yesterday that Natron was gearing up to produce its sodium batteries at a former lithium-ion battery facility in North Carolina. As of last year, Natron was prepping the site for an initial capacity of 600 megawatts, leading up to the gigascale buildout of additional factories in the future.

As of earlier this week, though, the hammer came down. Natron announced that it is winding down operations at its Michigan headquarters as well as the North Carolina shop.

The company did not provide a detailed explanation, but lurking in the background of every factory closure these days is US President Donald Trump and his misbegotten tariff wars, along with his persistent attacks on the domestic wind and solar industries.

Trump’s allies in Congress can also take a bow for destroying good-paying factory jobs all over the US. With Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, the President’s demand for a job-crushing tax bill — the “One Big Beautiful Bill” — sailed through Congress in July.

“The OBBB was enthusiastically supported by every Republican member of Congress from North Carolina, including so-called senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, and representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Addison McDowell, David Rouzer, Mark Harris, Richard Hudson, Pat Harrigan, Chuck Edwards, Brad Knott, and Tim Moore,” CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley noted last week.

… Lights On For Sodium Energy Storage

So much for those 1,000 new jobs. Nevertheless, as President Trump surely knows, the renewable energy transition is unstoppable. Real estate investors and developers are continuing to fill the demand for onsite renewable energy, particularly solar energy, and they are fueling the demand for more, better, cheaper energy storage technologies, too.

Sodium emerged as a significant area of energy storage research about 50 years ago, but lithium-ion technology leaped ahead on the basis of superior energy density, durability, and other key parameters. Still, sodium offers the advantages of an abundant, non-toxic, non-flammable, and relatively inexpensive supply chain.

In addition, sodium offers the potential for long-duration energy storage at the grid-scale level, which the US Department of Energy (such as it is today) defines as at least 10 hours, ideally much longer. In contrast, the typical lithium-ion battery array only lasts around 4 hours or so.

Researchers have been chipping away at the limitations of sodium technology over the past 50 years, and that brings us to Inlyte today (see more sodium battery background here).

The Inlyte Solution

Inlyte surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar in March of this year when it announced plans for accelerating its manufacturing timeline in the US, in partnership with the Swiss sodium battery specialist HORIEN Salt Battery Solutions (formerly FZSoNick). Following the success of a pilot-scale plant in the UK, the new “Inlyte Factory 1” in the US will integrate Inlyte’s sodium-iron formula into HORIEN’s manufacturing system.

In June, Inlyte also managed to squeeze a $4 million grant out of the Energy Department, through the agency’s CiFER (Critical Facility Energy Resilience) program.

“Inlyte and its partners will develop and demonstrate an iron and sodium long duration energy storage system to improve energy resilience at the Alliance Redwoods site in Occidental, CA,” the Energy Department somewhat cryptically explained in a press statement.

Inlyte provided more details in a press statement of its own. Alliance Redwoods is a nonprofit organization and retreat destination for church groups and other nonprofits. It was selected for the sodium-iron battery demonstration partly due to its designation as an evacuation center and fire protection staging area in a high-risk area for wildfires, where both diesel fuel and lithium-ion energy storage technology are at a disadvantage.

“The project, developed with partner Vital Energy Solutions, will enhance wildfire resilience for a critical evacuation zone, reduce facility electricity costs, and provide a diesel-free alternative for long-duration backup power,” Inlyte explained. “Inlyte’s domestically manufactured, non-flammable battery solution is uniquely suited for this project, maintaining performance at high ambient temperatures.”

The plan is to integrate the 200-kilowatt, 4 megawatt-hour, sodium-iron energy storage system in a microgrid featuring a 570-kilowatt solar array. Despite the relatively small size of the overall system, Alliance is expecting a big payoff. Inlyte estimates that the organization could shave as much as $300,000 off its annual electricity bill once the microgrid is up and running in 2027.

In addition, the new system will provide a good two weeks worth of backup power in emergencies, enabling Redwoods to ditch the cost of maintaining a diesel backup generator. In case of an emergency, the extra added benefit of noise-free, pollution-free power generation will make life easier for first responders and evacuees at the site, too.

“The project will also provide backup power for Russian River Utility’s nearby water pump station, which is essential for public water supply and firefighting efforts,” Inlyte added.

Everybody Wants More & Better Energy Storage

A member of the Alliance board, Mike Dethlefsen, neatly summed up the case for on-site renewable energy and energy storage. “With Inlyte’s battery and our solar array, we can operate independently from the grid during outages at a greatly reduced cost,” he said. “Crucially, it ensures we can remain operational to serve our community and power other critical local infrastructure when the grid goes down.”

Those same factors can apply to any number of community assets and commercial properties. Inlyte already anticipates replicating the Alliance model elsewhere.

In the latest news from Inlyte, on September 5, the company announced that former Tesla manufacturing director Alison Armstrong is joining its executive team, along with Sandor Hollo (former CTO of GE Energy Storage) and Dilip Goswami, (former CEO of Molekule and venture partner at At One Ventures).

“The new leadership appointments mark a pivotal moment for Inlyte Energy as it transitions from technology development to commercial-scale production,” Inlyte explained.

As part of that transition, Inlyte has partnered with the leading utility Southern Company on a utility-scale version of its energy storage technology, to be demonstrated at a location in Birmingham, Alabama. Installation is expected before the end of the year.

Inlyte expects an evaluation period of at least one year to follow. “Results will be shared across a broad utility network, in collaboration with EPRI,” the company added, referring to the independent, influential nonprofit organization Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

EPRI launched in 1972, and it has been on a decarbonization tear of late. With a seal of approval from EPRI under its belt, Inlyte could be poised to make the most of an opportunity that slipped through the fingers of Natron.

Democrats spent the break tearing into the provisions of that law — it is projected to shift financial assets to the wealthiest 10% of households and take from the poorest 10% — while Republicans defended it, focusing on its tax incentives for individuals, which are temporary.

“This law is a direct attack on Medicare and Medicaid,” Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th) said at the start of the recess, during a Piscataway event in late July focused on seniors.

The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal health option for the poor and people with disabilities, and if Congress does not act this year, health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act will sharply increase.

Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th), who voted for the new budget law, said after a tour of local businesses in Philipsburg that it would help small businesses.

Gone from Washington for about a month, a window that has generated a swollen backlog of pressing national work, lawmakers filled their days with public meetings with constituents, bill introductions, town-hall meetings and foreign travel.

Pallone and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) met in Perth Amboy with the president of Planned Parenthood’s national organization about how cuts brought on by the new law will affect abortion access in states like New Jersey, where abortion is legal under state law. The law will reduce access for “tens of thousands” of patients in the state, Pallone predicted. “It blocks people from getting birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing just because of where they go for care,” he said, alluding to how the law blocks Planned Parenthood patients from more than abortion services.

Campaigning, traveling

The Democratic nominee for governor, Sherrill spent the recess campaigning, criticizing her Republican rival Jack Ciattarelli and gathering endorsements.

While Sherrill was traveling in-state, Pallone and Sen. Andy Kim, New Jersey’s junior senator, went to Asia on congressionally organized trips.

Tasked with responsibilities to NATO, the transatlantic military alliance, Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st) went to Britain, he said by email.

“As a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I spent some time abroad, including in the United Kingdom, meeting with our allies to ensure our relationships with them remain strong,” Norcross said.

Beyond constituent meetings and town halls — Norcross said he’s hosted 111 during his time in Congress since 2014 — he also took it easier after his health scare this year from sepsis. “I also spent some time with my family, which was much-needed after my near-death experience earlier this year.”

Reps. Herb Conaway (D-3rd) and Nellie Pou (D-9th) were in Israel from Aug. 6 to 14 paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation, a group linked with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel lobby.

“This trip allowed me to learn more about the horrific events of October 7th and the State of Israel’s and Gaza conflict that has been all over the news,” Pou wrote in a mandated disclosure about the trip for a congressional ethics committee. “Some of the meetings and events that I attended were seminars regarding Oct 7 hostages, meeting with families of these hostages, learning about humanitarian aid as well as being briefed on the events in Gaza, meeting with Israeli officials and many more briefings about the conflicts in the middle east [sic].”

Over the break, Pou was involved in 20 public events, spokesman Mark Greenbaum said, including parades in Paterson and Passaic, visits to senior centers and community centers and a visit to the pipe rupture in Paterson, where a series of water pipes broke this August.

Different views of Medicaid cuts

Conaway “did go to Israel where he heard directly from Israelis, Arab Israelis, Palestinians, and peace activists. He spoke about meaningful, long-term solutions that could one day bring this conflict to an end,” his spokesman Chris Garcia said by email.

Garcia said Conaway held a town hall in Hamilton, where the Israel trip came up. Like many other Democrats nationwide, Conaway, a medical doctor, held a “roundtable” meeting about Medicaid cuts and how they will affect New Jersey, Garcia said.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) went to Israel on a separate trip, with Republicans and Democrats from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), who has insisted cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the nation’s largest food-aid network, will not affect those in need, held one virtual town hall to which residents called in, said spokeswoman Paxton Antonucci, adding that Van Drew stayed in South Jersey during the congressional break.

“He was everywhere from county fairs to national and community nights out to church festivals, firehouse cookouts, and backyard barbecues,” Antonucci said in an emailed statement. “He also visited senior centers, toured small businesses, met with constituents, and fielded questions from local business, labor, and community leaders from every corner of our district — which is actually larger geographically than the entire state of Delaware.”

Spokespeople for Kean and Reps. Chris Smith (R-4th) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th) did not respond to requests for comment about their recess activities.

Escaping ‘craziness’ of Washington

“It’s always great to be in-district,” Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “Especially when we have so much craziness going on in Washington, D.C.”

“We had our back-to-school family resource fair, which was wonderful,” McIver said. Her office also hosted a public meeting on school lunch access, she said.

McIver’s office and the office of Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) also held joint meetings in Jersey City and Newark to discuss the impact of the budget law and “the work they are doing to stand up to the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on democracy,” said McIver spokeswoman Hanna Rumsey.

Republicans have the votes to pass a spending bill out of the House on their own. But they will need seven Democrats minimum in the Senate to clear that chamber.

With Congress out of town, President Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying he was doing so to bring peace to the city, where crime is at a 30-year low, and warning he may send troops into other large U.S. cities. These troops are a common sight around the city, in particular at subway stations and transit hubs like Union Station.

Also in August, the White House fired the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moved to restrict access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Environmental Protection Agency announced it wants to rescind a 2009 policy known as the “endangerment finding” that gives the agency the legal authority to regulate the gases that are warming Earth to a dangerous degree. Trump flirted with firing the head of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, a move economic experts say would unravel global financial markets. Trump welcomed Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to American soil, meeting him on the tarmac of an airport in Alaska. And Trump tried to cancel about $5 billion in foreign aid — money Congress had already greenlit — in what a federal judge ruled last week was illegal.

Epstein, new rules

With recess over, tension continues to percolate within Republican ranks in Congress about how to handle the Epstein files — an issue that has hounded the GOP for months.

Back on Capitol Hill, members have taken up the annual defense policy bill required to authorize the Pentagon, and Republicans in the Senate are drawing up plans to rewrite procedure for that chamber, allowing them to confirm nominees to federal positions in bunches, rather than one by one.

But their central task is to fund the federal government, which could run out of money to fund its day-to-day operations at the end of the month.

Neither the House nor the Senate is close to finishing their drafts of the annual spending bill to fund the government, and with Congress scheduled to be gone for its Rosh Hashanah break in late September, members will almost certainly pass a short-term bill to fund the government before attempting to pass something more substantial this fall or winter.

Republicans have the votes to pass a spending bill out of the House on their own. But they will need seven Democrats minimum in the Senate to clear that chamber.

“If Republicans want to keep the government open, they have to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way. That’s the only way to get it done,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader, said. “Time is short.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota criticized “Democrat obstruction” over Trump’s nominees, saying that was gumming up the funding talks.

“I hope,” Thune said, “that our Democrat colleagues will resist the calls from within for a shutdown and work with us to fund the government.”

As it often does, the Senate, where Thune sets the agenda, adjourned around 4 p.m. Thursday until Monday afternoon.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/09/National-Guard-National-Mall-US-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 01:58:53.899385

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary.","Oil billionaire Harold Hamm was spotted celebrating with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the 2024 election results rolled in, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.

Harold is the founder of Continental Resources, and he pumped millions into Trump’s campaign, along with many other energy executives.

Their goal was simply to kill the momentum behind clean energy, make drilling easier, and lock in fossil fuels as the core of U.S. energy policy. Within months of Trump returning to the White House, that investment was already being repaid.

Trump’s administration quickly moved to open up federal land and offshore waters for drilling. He authorized new natural gas export terminals and gutted several regulations, including the Obama-era EPA rule that allowed the government to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil-and-gas operations.

His “One Big Beautiful Bill” wiped out tax credits for EVs and added tax cuts for fossil fuel companies. The new law is expected to stall renewable energy projects and make it harder for clean energy to compete.

Executives drive policy from inside the room

Of course the top energy executives got seats at the table. Harold, Energy Transfer Executive Chairman Kelcy Warren, and then-Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright helped raise millions for Trump’s campaign.

After the election, Warren gave $12.5 million more to MAGA Inc. His company also received a key permit extension for the Lake Charles LNG terminal, something the Biden administration had blocked.

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary. Harold personally introduced Wright to Trump during a Mar-a-Lago roundtable. Wright wasn’t the only executive who got a new job.

At least a dozen former oil lobbyists and company heads are now scattered across federal agencies, including the Interior Department and Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council. The council’s mission is to speed up fossil fuel production, with the help of people who’ve spent decades in the industry.

The American Petroleum Institute, which couldn’t even schedule a meeting with the previous administration, is now back in daily contact. Mike Sommers, API’s chief, said, “We outlined a clear policy road map well before the last election, and they’ve advanced those issues at every turn.”

Trump met personally with API leaders in March. He told them oil and gas was his favorite industry. That same month, global tariffs were announced, but oil and gas products were excluded.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods, former Hess Corporation CEO John Hess, and Harold have all spoken directly to Trump by phone since the election. Many executives have Chris Wright’s number saved.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin have also met with energy executives multiple times since January.

Lower profits, more influence

The gains in access haven’t led to gains in profits. Oil is stuck around $62 a barrel, well below the $76 level it hit when Trump first entered office in 2017. That’s beneath the break-even point for many producers.

New tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled in June, are raising drilling costs. Diamondback Energy says well construction costs are expected to jump by 25% this year. The company told investors that nearly every new well will be more expensive in 2025.

The financial pain is real. ConocoPhillips is cutting up to 25% of its workforce after its acquisition of Marathon Oil. Chevron is trimming 20% of its staff. Overall oil-and-gas extraction jobs dropped more than 3% from January through August, hitting a two-year low.

Still, many companies see this as a short-term cost for a long-term gain.

The latest US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies could cut 44 GW of US solar growth by 2030 – an 18% decline.
Compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, that’s a total loss of 55 GW, or 21% fewer solar projects by 2030.
“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.
“The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1.","The US solar industry put nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity on the grid in the first half of 2025. Even as the Trump administration rolled out anti-clean energy policies, solar and storage still made up 82% of all new power added to the grid in the first six months of the year. But the growth picture isn’t as sunny as it looks, according to the SEIA.

Trump’s big bill (HR1) and new administration actions targeting solar have dragged down deployment forecasts. The latest US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies could cut 44 GW of US solar growth by 2030 – an 18% decline. Compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, that’s a total loss of 55 GW, or 21% fewer solar projects by 2030.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She added that the administration is “deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid.” Still, Hopper stressed that demand will keep the industry growing because “the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

Ironically, the report found that this year, 77% of new solar capacity has been built in states Trump won. Eight of the top 10 states for new installations — Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas — all went red in 2024.

On the manufacturing side, the US added 13 GW of new solar module capacity in the first half of the year, with factories ramping up in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. That brings total domestic capacity to 55 GW. But momentum stalled in Q2, with no new upstream manufacturing investment as federal policy uncertainty spooked private capital.

Looking ahead, SEIA and Wood Mackenzie expect solar deployment to land 4% lower than pre-HR1 projections by 2030. Near-term solar growth is buoyed by projects already underway, developers racing against tax credit deadlines, and surging electricity demand as new gas generation becomes pricier and less reliable.

The report also highlights the risk of federal permitting changes. A Department of the Interior order throws up obstructions for solar permits, threatening about 44 GW of planned projects. Arizona, California, and Nevada are expected to be hit hardest.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment incredibly challenging.”

SEIA has urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course, warning that the administration’s approach could mean lost jobs, higher power bills, and a weaker US economy.

The stakes stretch beyond energy: SEIA notes that if solar growth stalls as projected, the Trump administration will blow its chances at winning the global AI race – something it’s keen to do. Last week, the trade group rolled out a grid reliability policy agenda calling on leaders at all levels of government to shore up the grid with solar and storage to meet surging demand.

Harold, Energy Transfer Executive Chairman Kelcy Warren, and then-Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright helped raise millions for Trump’s campaign.
Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary.","Oil billionaire Harold Hamm was spotted celebrating with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the 2024 election results rolled in, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.

Harold is the founder of Continental Resources, and he pumped millions into Trump’s campaign, along with many other energy executives.

Their goal was simply to kill the momentum behind clean energy, make drilling easier, and lock in fossil fuels as the core of U.S. energy policy. Within months of Trump returning to the White House, that investment was already being repaid.

Trump’s administration quickly moved to open up federal land and offshore waters for drilling. He authorized new natural gas export terminals and gutted several regulations, including the Obama-era EPA rule that allowed the government to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil-and-gas operations.

His “One Big Beautiful Bill” wiped out tax credits for EVs and added tax cuts for fossil fuel companies. The new law is expected to stall renewable energy projects and make it harder for clean energy to compete.

Executives drive policy from inside the room

Of course the top energy executives got seats at the table. Harold, Energy Transfer Executive Chairman Kelcy Warren, and then-Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright helped raise millions for Trump’s campaign.

After the election, Warren gave $12.5 million more to MAGA Inc. His company also received a key permit extension for the Lake Charles LNG terminal, something the Biden administration had blocked.

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary. Harold personally introduced Wright to Trump during a Mar-a-Lago roundtable. Wright wasn’t the only executive who got a new job.

At least a dozen former oil lobbyists and company heads are now scattered across federal agencies, including the Interior Department and Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council. The council’s mission is to speed up fossil fuel production, with the help of people who’ve spent decades in the industry.

The American Petroleum Institute, which couldn’t even schedule a meeting with the previous administration, is now back in daily contact. Mike Sommers, API’s chief, said, “We outlined a clear policy road map well before the last election, and they’ve advanced those issues at every turn.”

Trump met personally with API leaders in March. He told them oil and gas was his favorite industry. That same month, global tariffs were announced, but oil and gas products were excluded.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods, former Hess Corporation CEO John Hess, and Harold have all spoken directly to Trump by phone since the election. Many executives have Chris Wright’s number saved.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin have also met with energy executives multiple times since January.

Lower profits, more influence

The gains in access haven’t led to gains in profits. Oil is stuck around $62 a barrel, well below the $76 level it hit when Trump first entered office in 2017. That’s beneath the break-even point for many producers.

New tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled in June, are raising drilling costs. Diamondback Energy says well construction costs are expected to jump by 25% this year. The company told investors that nearly every new well will be more expensive in 2025.

The financial pain is real. ConocoPhillips is cutting up to 25% of its workforce after its acquisition of Marathon Oil. Chevron is trimming 20% of its staff. Overall oil-and-gas extraction jobs dropped more than 3% from January through August, hitting a two-year low.

Still, many companies see this as a short-term cost for a long-term gain. Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, and Occidental Petroleum told investors they expect to save over $1.2 billion next year because of new tax breaks. BP, which also operates in the U.S., said those savings will offset the extra cost of tariffs.

For those seeking alpha in 2025, the path lies in underappreciated industrial stocks and traditional automakers poised to thrive in a deregulated, energy-intensive future.","The 2025 Trump administration's sweeping rollback of emissions regulations and EV subsidies has ignited a seismic shift in capital allocation, favoring traditional automakers and energy-intensive industrial sectors. This policy pivot, framed as a rebuke to “overreaching climate mandates,” is not merely a regulatory reversal but a calculated realignment of U.S. economic priorities. By dismantling the EV subsidy framework and prioritizing domestic energy production, the administration is accelerating a capital flight from green-tech overvaluation to underappreciated industrial plays with robust balance sheets and domestic production capabilities.

Deregulation as a Catalyst for Detroit's Resurgence

The elimination of the “electric vehicle mandate” and the termination of state emissions waivers have created a regulatory vacuum that traditional automakers are swiftly filling. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) stand to benefit most from the suspension of CAFE compliance obligations, which previously forced legacy automakers to purchase costly emissions credits from EV startups like Tesla and Rivian. GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson, , .

The administration's 25% tariff on imported vehicles further insulates Detroit from foreign competition. , the universal application of the tariff allows it to raise prices without losing market share. This dynamic is particularly advantageous for Ford, which has pivoted to lower-cost ICE models and plans to scale back U.S. EV production in favor of European markets.

Industrial Sectors: The Hidden Winners of Deregulation

Beyond automakers, the energy and materials sectors are experiencing a renaissance. Fossil fuel giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are capitalizing on the reversal of offshore wind moratoriums and the reinstatement of energy infrastructure permits. Meanwhile, underappreciated industrial stocks are emerging as alpha generators:

CNH Industrial (CNH): , this agricultural and construction equipment leader benefits from the administration's focus on domestic infrastructure and energy projects. Its precision agriculture innovations align with the renewed emphasis on traditional energy sectors.

Paccar (PCAR): , Paccar's heavy-duty trucks are critical for energy and materials logistics. Its insourced engine production and premium pricing power position it to outperform peers in a deregulated environment.

Idex (IEX): A specialty machinery firm producing mission-critical equipment for energy infrastructure, Idex's lean manufacturing and R&D-driven growth make it a compelling play on long-term industrial demand.

The Risks of Green-Tech Overvaluation

While the administration's policies favor traditional sectors, they also expose the fragility of green-tech valuations. Tesla's stock, which surged on EV subsidies, now faces headwinds as tax credits expire and demand softens. Similarly, Rivian and Lucid's reliance on regulatory compliance letters from NHTSA has evaporated, leaving their business models vulnerable. The Department of Energy's recent report downplaying carbon pollution controls further undermines the economic rationale for aggressive climate mitigation strategies.

Strategic Investment Outlook

For investors, the 2025 policy landscape presents a clear dichotomy: capital is flowing toward industrial and energy stocks with strong balance sheets and domestic production capabilities, while green-tech overvaluation faces correction. Traditional automakers like GM and Ford, alongside underappreciated industrial plays such as CNH and Paccar, offer a hedge against regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical volatility.

In conclusion, Trump's emissions rollback is not a mere policy shift but a strategic reallocation of capital toward sectors that align with U.S. energy independence and industrial resilience. For those seeking alpha in 2025, the path lies in underappreciated industrial stocks and traditional automakers poised to thrive in a deregulated, energy-intensive future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 02:59:50.621259

Current wind power capacity in development is around 65,000 MW, down from around 74,000 MW a year ago.
All told, around 155,000 MW of renewable energy capacity is currently being built, down from around 186,000 MW a year ago.
Solar power capacity is quick to build, and the total solar capacity in operation rose from 120,460 MW in 2024 to around 121,311 MW currently, GEM data shows.
Operating U.S. wind capacity increased from 150,592 MW in 2024 to 151,429 MW as of mid-2025.","U.S. power developers are planning to sharply boost natural gas and hydropower generation capacity and are cutting back on plans to add new solar and wind farms, according to recent data on the U.S. power capacity pipeline.

As of mid-2025, U.S. power developers had just over 114,000 megawatts (MW) of natural gas capacity under construction or in so-called pre-construction, according to data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

That capacity total is more than twice as large as what was in developer pipelines a year ago. Gas plants are the single largest power source among all planned capacity additions at the construction and pre-construction stages, GEM data shows.

Developers have also sharply lifted planned hydropower and nuclear generation capacity from a year ago, and have made cuts to both solar and wind capacity plans compared to mid-2024.

The large changes within the planned power capacity mix highlight the impact of the sudden swing in federal government energy policies following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump.

The gas-heavy development schedule also underscores how utilities are prioritizing dispatchable power sources over intermittent renewable energy as they scramble to ensure that electricity supplies keep up with rapidly rising demand.

FIRED UP

Natural gas plants make up around 46% of currently operational U.S. power capacity, and 36% of capacity at the construction and pre-construction phases.

Around 16,300 MW of gas capacity is currently under construction, while around 98,000 MW is in pre-construction, which is where sites have been identified and relevant permits have been applied for.

On top of the roughly 114,000 MW of natural gas power capacity, U.S. utilities are building or planning to build around 36,000 MW of new hydropower capacity and nearly 8,000 MW of new nuclear capacity.

Those diverse power sources have an important common attribute – they are all able to be dispatched on command by utilities in order to balance system power needs.

The total volume of dispatchable power capacity currently in the developer pipeline is around 159,000 MW, and compares to around 57,000 MW at the same stage a year ago.

CLEAN CUTS

The sharply rising capacity footprint for dispatchable power contrasts with the capacity pipeline for renewable energy, which is also known as intermittent power because it is only produced when the sun is shining and the wind blows.

Total solar capacity currently under construction or in pre-construction is around 92,000 MW, down from around 112,000 MW at the same developmental stages in 2024.

Current wind power capacity in development is around 65,000 MW, down from around 74,000 MW a year ago.

All told, around 155,000 MW of renewable energy capacity is currently being built, down from around 186,000 MW a year ago.

Some of the apparent cuts to the renewables development pipeline can be explained by the fact that some of the capacity that was previously being built is now operational.

Solar power capacity is quick to build, and the total solar capacity in operation rose from 120,460 MW in 2024 to around 121,311 MW currently, GEM data shows.

Operating U.S. wind capacity increased from 150,592 MW in 2024 to 151,429 MW as of mid-2025.

Other reasons for the cuts to the renewable pipeline include the growing wait times for new power assets to get connected to local grids, and the rising costs for parts and materials – especially for wind farms.

Steep cuts to future tax breaks and subsidies under the Trump administration have also led to cuts to some renewable power capacity plans, especially in states with already long interconnection wait times.

RE-CHARGING

Utilities are also rapidly building out new battery storage capacity so that surplus power from renewable assets can be stored and then discharged during peak demand periods.

Around 8,000 MW of battery capacity is currently planned to be added to the U.S. utility network by the end of the year, according to data from energy data portal Cleanview.

When brought online, that new battery capacity would bring total U.S. utility-scale battery capacity to around 46,000 MW by the end of the year.

That expanded battery capacity will allow utilities to make better use of the renewable power capacity already in place, and ensure that solar generation that exceeds system demand needs during the sunniest periods can be stored for later use.

That in turn will ensure that the overall power mix within the U.S. generation system will continue to get cleaner over time, even if the pace of new solar and wind capacity growth continues to slow compared to previous years.

That said, the ramped-up gas development pipeline will ensure that natural gas remains the central pillar of the U.S. generation system once current construction and pre-construction of all power types is complete.

STAYING GAS-HEAVY

Gas capacity’s share of the overall U.S. power system will remain more than twice as large as any other power source, at 44%, once construction and pre-construction work is complete.

However, coal capacity will be overtaken by both wind and solar once the current construction binge is finished.

Coal has a roughly 15% share of total currently operating capacity, while wind has a 12% share and solar has a 10% share.

Expected changes to US power capacity by source after construction

Thomson ReutersExpected changes to US power capacity by source after construction

Once projects that are currently under construction and in pre-construction are complete, both wind and solar will have a roughly 14% share while coal power’s share will drop to around 12%.

That greater footprint from renewables will mean that clean power sources will boost their overall share of the capacity mix from 39% currently to 44% after building work is complete.

That in turn means that while the U.S. power system will remain primarily gas-fed, clean power sources will account for most of the rest and will play a key role in the ongoing pollution reduction efforts of the U.S. energy system.

About $44 million a year would be rebated to Whitehaven for its Winchester South coal mine under the fuel tax credit scheme, which is facing renewed scrutiny for its drag on public finances and decarbonisation goals.

The tax exemptions were introduced decades ago when the Commonwealth first introduced fuel taxes, based on the principle that off-road users should be spared from the costs of maintaining infrastructure.

Fuel tax is no longer ring-fenced for road repairs, however, and critics argue the scheme has become too costly – clocking in at roughly $11 billion a year – and keeping diesel users hooked on the emissions-intensive fuel.

In a first for Lock the Gate, the anti-coal and gas campaigner has seized on the fuel tax credits available to a specific coal mine as a line of critique.

Whitehaven’s proposed metallurgical and thermal coal mine in Queensland’s Bowen Basin is already facing legal challenge from other conservation groups worried about native species, water sources and the climate, including both burning the coal and the methane that tends to escape as it’s dug up.

Lock the Gate’s focus on fuel tax credits follows a push to reform the scheme ahead of the Labor government’s economic reform summit.

Notably, the Australian Council of Trade Unions called for a $20 million cap on diesel tax exemptions ahead of the productivity talks, hot on the heels of Climate Energy Finance’s suggestion of a $50 million ceiling on annual fuel tax credits per company.

The think tank’s model would allow businesses to claim rebates beyond the cap if they reinvested the funds into decarbonisation, such as electric trucks.

Director Tim Buckley said the “cap-and-reinvest” model had been well-received in Canberra and would only capture big miners, with farmers and small businesses well below the threshold.

Without reform, he said mining companies had little incentive to shift away from diesel – responsible for 17 per cent of Australia’s annual emissions – and embrace fast-advancing clean alternatives.

A Whitehaven spokesperson said large-scale electrification in mining remained “technically and commercially challenging” but the miner was monitoring developments in lower-emissions options.

Responding to the Lock the Gate analysis, the company spokesperson said the fuel tax excise was designed as a “user pay system” for maintaining public roads and the credit scheme complemented it by ensuring off-road mining, construction and agriculture companies did not bear the cost.

The mining sector’s contribution to the national economy “far outweighs any credit received under the system”, the spokesperson said.

The Lock the Gate analysis drew on Whitehaven-released data to estimate 85 million litres of diesel would be used by the Winchester South coal mine each year and more than 2.5 billion litres across its lifetime.

In 2025 dollars, this would result in the mine receiving about $44 million each year from the fuel tax credit scheme, or more than $1.3 billion throughout the mine’s operating life.

This total is more than the $1 billion needed to develop the mine, as pointed out by Lock the Gate Alliance national co-ordinator Ellen Roberts.

The Winchester South coal mine has secured state-level approval and is undergoing assessment through federal environmental laws.

Alister Veitch, head of business development at Acorn Bioenergy, described the site as a ""flagship hub"" for the company.
""Both energy security and food security are massively important to the UK, and partnering with Acorn Bioenergy helps us deliver both.""
Acorn Bioenergy is currently developing two additional plants in the UK, along with a dedicated gas injection hub.
The company was acquired in 2022 by Qualitas Energy, a global investor and developer in renewable energy, energy transition, and sustainable infrastructure.","Acorn Bioenergy launched its first anaerobic digestion (AD) plant in Winchester on Thursday, September 4. Located at Three Maids Hill, the plant converts agricultural residues and waste into biomethane, which supplies renewable gas to the national grid.

The facility, officially opened at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Winchester City Council leader Martin Tod, and partner farmers, is now fully operational.

Sarah Jones, Minister for Industry, said: ""Acorn’s development will deliver secure, clean energy for thousands of homes and provide jobs for the local community in Hampshire.

""Biomethane can play an important role in reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels, boosting our energy security and helping us accelerate to net zero.""

The plant processes 83,600 tonnes of agricultural waste and break crops each year, generating more than 120 GWh of biomethane which is enough to meet the heating needs of more than 9,000 homes.

By converting farming by-products such as slurries, manures, and rotational crops into green energy, the facility is expected to save around 30,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually.

This equates to removing 15,000 cars from the road or planting 1.2 million trees.

Alister Veitch, head of business development at Acorn Bioenergy, described the site as a ""flagship hub"" for the company.

Mr Veitch said: ""We were delighted to launch the Three Maids facility, to demonstrate how renewable biogas generation can power homes, strengthen food security and support the UK’s net zero ambitions.

""Alongside our dozen sites in development, it is a major step towards our ambition to supply 25 per cent of the UK’s biomethane.""

Cllr Jackie Porter, who attended the launch event, said: ""The whole site is now operational which is really exciting. It's good to see it actually working and to see the support they are getting for it. We want to make sure it works really well with the community as well.

""My hope is that we can use this site with other sites as well, to really educate our whole community on the ways in which we can reduce our carbon footprint.""

The site, situated near a solar farm and InstaVolt’s EV superhub off the A34, forms part of Winchester’s growing renewable energy cluster.

It has created 15 direct jobs and is expected to support up to 50 roles across the wider engineering, rural, and infrastructure sectors.

The plant also produces nutrient-rich digestate, a bio-fertiliser used to improve soil health which reduces reliance on imported, carbon-intensive fertilisers.

In addition, the facility generates high-purity green CO₂ for sustainable industrial applications.

Nick Rowsell of West Stoke Farm, who supplies break crops to the plant, said: ""Having farmed at Three Maids Hill previously, we always found the land had limited agricultural value.

""However, it has strong potential with this new renewable biogas generation facility which we are now providing feedstock for.

""Both energy security and food security are massively important to the UK, and partnering with Acorn Bioenergy helps us deliver both.""

The project offers fixed-pricing agreements and lower fertiliser costs through digestate use.

It also gives farmers a reliable outlet for break crops grown as part of sustainable rotations.

By producing continuous renewable gas, the Winchester plant complements intermittent sources such as wind and solar, helping to stabilise the UK’s energy grid.

It also supports the Government’s aim to quadruple biomethane production by 2030–2035.

Acorn Bioenergy is currently developing two additional plants in the UK, along with a dedicated gas injection hub.

Amid this transformation, LG Energy Solution (LGES) stands out as a strategic contender, leveraging its production scale, R&D prowess, and strategic partnerships to position itself at the forefront of the battery revolution. For investors, the question is whether LGES can sustain its momentum amid fierce competition and technological uncertainty.

Market Position and Financial Resilience

LGES currently holds a 14.5% global market share in EV batteries, ranking third behind CATL and Panasonic [1]. Its U.S. expansion is particularly noteworthy: By 2025, the company is projected to become the largest EV battery supplier in the region, fueled by partnerships with Tesla, General Motors, and Hyundai [1]. This growth is underpinned by a KRW 6.3 trillion revenue in Q1 2025 and an 8.8% operating profit margin in Q2 2025, driven by cost-cutting measures and U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits [3][5].

The company’s pivot to energy storage systems (ESS) further diversifies its revenue streams. By 2026, LGES aims to double its ESS production capacity in Michigan to 30GWh, capitalizing on the growing demand for grid-scale storage [5]. This strategic flexibility—shifting production lines from EV cells to ESS—demonstrates LGES’s ability to adapt to market dynamics, a critical trait in an industry prone to rapid shifts.

Next-Gen Battery Innovation: The R&D Edge

LGES’s long-term growth hinges on its ability to lead in next-generation battery technologies. The company is investing heavily in solid-state, lithium-sulfur (Li-S), and bipolar battery development. A key milestone: LGES plans to mass-produce Li-S batteries by 2027, a technology that promises 500 Wh/kg energy density—a leap beyond current lithium-ion standards [2]. By integrating bipolar designs, LGES aims to reduce component counts and enhance energy density, positioning itself as a leader in compact, high-performance batteries [2].

Comparatively, LGES’s R&D spend of $1 billion annually lags behind CATL’s $3 billion in 2023 [1][3]. However, LGES’s focus on lean electrolyte systems and cylindrical battery technology—such as its recent $1 billion deal with Chinese automaker Chery—highlights its agility in commercializing niche innovations [2]. Meanwhile, CATL’s dominance in condensed batteries (500 Wh/kg) and Panasonic’s delays in U.S. production underscore the competitive landscape’s volatility [1][2].

Production Capacity and Strategic Partnerships

LGES’s ambition to expand production to 540 GWh by 2025 is a bold bet on sustained EV demand [1]. This capacity, supported by partnerships with GM, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, positions LGES to meet North American automakers’ nearshoring needs. In contrast, CATL’s 390 GWh capacity and 37% market share in 2023 reflect its entrenched position in China and Europe [1]. Yet, LGES’s U.S. IRA tax credits and Michigan ESS expansion provide a unique tailwind, insulating it from China-centric supply chain risks.

Risks and Competitive Challenges

Despite its strengths, LGES faces headwinds. The EV battery market is highly cyclical, with prices falling due to overcapacity and raw material volatility [4]. Additionally, CATL’s technological edge in battery recycling (99.6% metal recovery) and Panasonic’s 4680 cell expertise pose long-term threats [3]. Geopolitical tensions, such as China’s export controls on critical minerals, could also disrupt LGES’s supply chain [3].

Investment Thesis

LGES’s combination of financial resilience, strategic diversification, and next-gen R&D makes it a compelling long-term play. While CATL’s scale and Panasonic’s legacy in consumer electronics are formidable, LGES’s U.S. IRA alignment, ESS pivot, and Li-S roadmap offer asymmetric upside. For investors, the key is to monitor the company’s ability to commercialize its 10-minute charge batteries and maintain margins amid price wars.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 02:59:46.355358

Biggest reforms to State Development framework since 1952

Approvals for strategically significant precincts and projects to be streamlined

Bill to unlock major clean energy and defence opportunities

Bill to create long term jobs and business opportunities for Western Australians

Bold new legislation will be introduced by the Cook Government this week to unlock strategic precincts, fast-track approvals for major strategic projects around the State and maintain Western Australia as the strongest economy in the nation.

The State Development Bill 2025 will establish a modern and agile framework and is a major part of the Cook Government's strategy to make WA a global leader in investment attraction, industry facilitation and regulation.

The Bill is a key response to discussions at the Trade and Economic Resilience roundtable convened by the Premier in May this year. It builds upon the government's recent commitment to establish a WA Productivity Commission, as well as the nation-leading planning and environmental approvals reforms delivered during the last term of government.

The Bill aims to future-proof WA's regulatory system, ensuring our high standards of protection are maintained while streamlining complex and time-sensitive processes. It will allow the Premier to declare State Development Areas and Priority Projects, supported by the Coordinator General who will be delegated statutory powers to coordinate across agencies and facilitate regulatory processes.

The Coordinator General will be provided with tools, including information notices, timeframe notices, due regard notices, joint decision notices and modification orders, all designed to ensure major strategic opportunities are delivered in an investment-friendly timeframe.

This new framework will enable a more strategic approach to State Development by increasing the certainty of end-to-end project approval timeframes, ensuring WA remains globally competitive and investment ready.

The new laws are designed to help WA secure major new economic diversification opportunities in support of the government Made in WA agenda, including:

Getting out of coal fired power generation faster than any other Australian state, and setting the WA economy up for success in a world that is decarbonising;

Supporting WA's major trading partners to decarbonise, with critical minerals and clean downstream products, like green iron; and

Becoming the largest naval shipbuilding and maintenance hub in the southern hemisphere.

The Coordinator General's new role and powers will only be applied to the most significant precincts and opportunities. All other major private sector projects will continue to be driven by the Department of Energy and Economic Diversification, with the lead agency process retained. The government is also working on an additional round of general approvals reforms, which will be progressed in 2026.

Importantly, the legislation respects the independence of the Environmental Protection Authority and respects existing Aboriginal heritage protections, facilitating coordination across government while preserving the integrity of existing safeguards.

Find out more on the Office of the Coordinator General website.

Comments attributed to Premier Roger Cook:

""Becoming a global leader in investment attraction, industry facilitation and regulation is a key part of our strategy to keep WA the strongest economy in the nation.

""Our system of State Agreements has served WA well, and developed resources projects over 70 years, but we need a modernised, more agile system if we are to secure investment in a more competitive, time sensitive global investment environment.

""The State Development Bill will give us the powers necessary to secure investment in major clean energy and defence manufacturing projects, which have the ability to transform the WA economy in the years ahead.

""We want WA to be the best place in the world to do business, and the State Development Bill will help us create the regulatory environment we need to get things done.""",https://www.wa.gov.au/themes/custom/wagov/images/gov-wa-logo.png,N,,2025-09-08 01:00:46.975126

Over the past decade, Chinese companies have played a fundamental role in the expansion of Argentina’s clean energy infrastructure, both through financing and direct participation in large projects.

However, recent geopolitical and economic changes, such as the current Argentine government’s closer alignment with the United States over China, the significant cuts made to Argentina’s public infrastructure budget since 2024, and global trade tensions, cast doubt on China’s interest in maintaining that financing momentum.

This comes amid concerns about the future of renewable energy in Argentina, where the relevant regulatory framework, covering the period of 2015 to 2025, is reaching its conclusion. Law 27,191 established incentives to target 16% of electricity demand being met with renewable sources by the end of 2021, rising to 18% by the end of 2023 and 20% by the end of this year.

According to official data, the share of renewables in Argentina’s electricity mix reached 13% in 2021, rose to 14.3% in 2023, and averaged 17.2% in the first four months of 2025. Of the renewable energy generated so far this year, 70% has come from wind power, followed by solar power with 19%.

“Chinese investment in renewable energy in Argentina has shown sustained growth and diversification both in terms of technology and geography,” said Oriana Cherini, a researcher in international relations at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (Conicet).

“Companies such as PowerChina and Envision have developed wind and solar projects in several provinces, within a framework of cooperation initially promoted at the national level, and coordinated through instruments such as Argentina’s accession to the Belt and Road Initiative,” she added.

Among the most significant Chinese solar projects is the Cauchari solar park, in Argentina’s northern province of Jujuy. It has 312 megawatts of installed capacity, which is expected to be expanded to 500 MW. The plant was mainly financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim) and built by PowerChina, Shanghai Electric Construction and Talesun. Another notable project is the Cafayate solar park in the north-western Calchaquí Valley, built by PowerChina and inaugurated in 2019, with a capacity of 97.6 MW.

China also has a significant presence in the wind sector, backing four wind farms with a total installed capacity of 355 MW in Loma Blanca, in the southern province of Chubut. These projects were built by PowerChina and are operated by the Chinese firm Goldwind, as is the Miramar wind farm in the south of Buenos Aires province, with 96 MW of capacity.

Factors at play

According to Stella Maris Juste, a Conicet researcher with a PhD in international relations, one of the main impediments to the development of new projects is the availability of funds from large Chinese institutions such as its policy banks, the Exim Bank and the China Development Bank – “the ones that normally finance investments in renewables” in Argentina, she said.

A recent report by the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University in the United States detailed that China allocated USD 472 billion in public financing and public guarantees to low- and middle-income countries around the world between 2008 and 2024. According to the report, however, current lending levels are well below the highs recorded in 2015-2017; total lending from the two institutions to Latin America and the Caribbean averaged just USD 1.3 billion per year between 2019 and 2023.

On the other hand, the report says foreign direct investment (FDI) from Chinese companies is on the rise: “Chinese FDI has skyrocketed, both in absolute terms and in relation to development financing. This change could reflect a maturing of the Belt and Road Initiative, as Chinese companies gain experience abroad and are able to take on project management themselves.” The trend is apparent in other locations where China invests, such as Indonesia.

For Juste, government programmes launched to stimulate renewables in Argentina, such as RenovAR in 2016, which now no longer exist, facilitated the mobilisation of resources at an earlier stage. Added to this is the geopolitical factor of strained relations: “When political ties are strong, there is more synergy in financial cooperation,” she said.

Juste and Cherini agreed on the growing importance of Argentina’s subnational governments for Chinese investment, given President Javier Milei’s closer alignment with the United States.

Until 2023, the national government played a facilitating role in relations with China, favouring strategic agreements. This is no longer the case – now it is the provinces taking the initiative. “Through subnational agendas, many of them are promoting direct links, becoming key players in energy cooperation,” said Cherini.

Future prospects

One of the factors impacting the renewable sector’s outlook is the expiry of the 2015 renewable energy law at the end of this year.

Gustavo Castagnino, who directs corporate, regulatory and sustainability affairs at the renewable energy firm Genneia, said an extension of the law is being pushed for. This would maintain the 20% target, for a deadline yet to be confirmed, along with the legal and fiscal protections for those investing in the sector.

“Energy demand will remain steady in the coming years, and renewable energy is very competitive today, so we expect penetration to grow strongly anyway,” Castagnino added.

Camila Mercure, who coordinates climate policy at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN), an NGO, argues that although this year’s targets are unlikely to be met, the law was an important tool for the sector’s development. “Not updating the law creates barriers and challenges for the transition in our country,” she says. “Above all, it creates great uncertainty about what energy policy will look like in terms of renewables in the coming years.”

Another key factor when analysing the future of Argentina’s renewables sector is the lack of infrastructure development for electricity transmission, needed to support sources such as wind and solar. Significant Chinese investment has arrived in transmission projects in neighbouring Brazil and Chile, while in 2022, China’s State Grid announced plans to invest USD 1 billion in grid upgrades around Buenos Aires. But these grid shortcomings in Argentina have limited growth opportunities in recent years. In May, the government presented a plan for the private sector to finance 16 priority transmission projects.

“The electricity system needs new investment in generation, transmission and distribution to ensure more competitive energy – i.e. lower costs and a more secure system,” said Castagnino.

As such, Mercure said that the country’s limited electricity transmission infrastructure is making distributed generation – for example, solar panels fitted to a house or powering a micro-grid – an appealing option. Argentina currently has just 78MW of installed distributed electricity capacity, and approximately 2,900 electricity-generating users. Almost all of these users rely on solar panels, practically all of which in Argentina are imported from China – though the country’s first domestic factory is set to enter production this year.

These challenges around transmission, Mercure said, are “an invitation to move towards distributed generation schemes, precisely because they allow generation to be brought closer to consumption centers”.",https://chinaglobalsouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Argentina-solar2-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 22:58:46.895068

The region contributes approximately 23 per cent of Australia’s industrial emissions, due to its heavy concentration of hard-to-abate mining, resources and industrial sectors.

The new report, written by Marsden Jacob Associates (MJA) and titled Common user transmission and decarbonising Pilbara energy demand, advocates for a Common User Transmission Infrastructure (CUTI) system, enabling “multiple users and generators to connect to a single, shared grid, replacing the traditional model where each miner builds and operates private, siloed infrastructure.”

According to a summary of findings from the CEFC, the report finds a $30 billion savings opportunity versus “a fragmented, go-it-alone approach”, which is made up of “$4 billion in avoided transmission costs and $26 billion in avoided generation and storage costs over 25 years.”

It also claims a 21 per cent reduction in land required for transmission, 29 per cent reduction in new transmission line length under the CUTI approach, and 16 per cent reduction in required renewable energy and storage capacity assets.

Ian Learmonth, the CEO of the CEFC, said on Monday that, “This report confirms that smarter, shared infrastructure delivers both climate and economic wins. It is the kind of solution that strengthens Australia’s position as a future energy superpower.

“We are proud to support this work, building on the WA Government’s leadership in advancing shared transmission planning in the Pilbara. It shows what can be achieved when policy leadership, commercial opportunity and clean energy innovation come together with a shared goal.”

But its true impact extends well beyond incentives: OBBBA is unsettling the entire financial and insurance underpinning of the U.S. clean energy industry.

OBBBA has accelerated deadlines, with projects now required to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. It has also removed the 5% cost-based safe harbor starting September 1, 2025, meaning that only physical work counts toward eligibility. That change alone has lenders and insurers spooked, uncertain when or if returns will materialize.

Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on essential materials like steel, copper, and solar components have pushed construction costs even higher. “We’re really now seeing the impacts of what the new reality in the U.S. has meant for investor confidence,” says Meredith Annex, Head of Clean Power at BloombergNEF, after reporting that wind and solar investments plunged 36% year-on-year to $36.4 billion in H1 2025, with onshore wind collapsing 80 percent, the Financial Times reported.

At the same time, insurance is becoming a major issue. Underwriters are recalibrating risk models that now include political unpredictability. As Canaan Crouch of Jencap Specialty Insurance Services warns, “Higher insurance premiums add another cost burden to contractors and developers already grappling with reduced subsidies, higher tariffs and volatile demand.” That’s effectively redefining how projects are valued and bankrolled.

Insurers are tightening their terms in ways that directly reshape project economics. Premiums for utility-scale solar and offshore wind have climbed sharply over the past year, with underwriters increasingly carving out exclusions for mechanical failure and weather-related damage, according to Reuters. Industry brokers say some carriers have shortened policy durations from three years to one, forcing developers to renegotiate coverage annually at higher cost. In offshore wind, several European reinsurers have already reduced their U.S. exposure, leaving a smaller pool of carriers willing to underwrite billion-dollar projects and driving up rates for those that remain.

The disruption is being felt by the industry’s biggest players. Denmark’s Ørsted, once a clean-energy trailblazer, has approved a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue after its U.S. offshore wind projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, hit policy roadblocks. Construction on Revolution Wind, almost 80% complete, was halted by a federal stop-work order citing national security concerns, prompting Ørsted to sue the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the company is burning millions weekly in holding costs, and S&P Global has already downgraded its credit rating though Equinor, a 10% shareholder, has pledged up to $941 million in support.

Nor is this limited to utility-scale clean energy.

In residential solar, firms like Sunnova and Mosaic have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid uncertainty over tax credits and a decline in demand. Canary Media reported that Sunnova laid off over half its workforce (over 700 employees) before filing, citing untenable debt and market retrenchment. Mosaic, a major residential solar loan provider, also went bankrupt, pointing to macroeconomic headwinds and policy unpredictability.

These are not small casualties. Analysts predict a 50-60% reduction in residential solar demand, risking over 250,000 jobs. As Ara Agopian, CEO of Solar Insure, put it, “There’s going to be a 50 to 60 percent downturn in demand. Many of them will shut their doors as they can’t stay in business without the tax credit.” The Financial Times noted that Guggenheim’s Joe Osha underscored the long-standing difficulties.

In Sunnova’s case, a July 31, 2025 court approval allowed the sale of substantially all assets to a creditor group highlighting how even bankruptcy is being managed to mitigate fallout for homeowners.

States are also feeling the heat, with Texas, once a renewable stronghold, seeing developers cancel or delay nearly $8 billion in projects, while BloombergNEF has tallied over $22 billion in clean energy development shelved nationally, costing more than 16,000 jobs.

Beyond wind and solar, OBBBA’s implications also extend to battery and hydrogen sectors. The law phases out credits for battery manufacturing and accelerates deadlines for hydrogen projects under Section 45V. Experts at the International Council on Clean Transportation estimate U.S. battery production could fall 75 percent short of expectations by 2030, cutting into the clean energy value chain.

Banks that once offered competitive terms on project loans are now widening spreads to reflect heightened policy risk, while credit rating agencies have flagged uncertainty over future cash flows as a trigger for downgrades. Institutional investors that fueled the tax-equity boom of the past decade are becoming more selective, in some cases pausing commitments entirely until the regulatory landscape stabilizes. The result is a much smaller pipeline of available capital and steeper financing costs for developers.

What’s emerging is a clarity that OBBBA’s biggest impact may be the erosion of the industry’s financial ecosystem. Insurance premiums are climbing. Lenders are retreating or demanding new risk-adjusted returns. Developers are cannibalizing capital just to stay afloat.

Guest Opinion. One of the things that is never mentioned is something that both President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump agree on and that is increasing the nuclear power capacity in the U.S. Biden had a goal of tripling nuclear energy; Trump has a goal of quadrupling nuclear energy. Biden planned for 200GW by 2050; Trump’s goal is 400GW by 2050. In a recent survey, 61% of Americans favor nuclear energy.

The reasons may include reduced carbon emissions and compliance with our commitments on international climate change agreements, but the elephant in the room is the electricity appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The electricity needs for data centers that run artificial intelligence applications cannot be met with existing energy resources. According to the MIT Technology Review: “In the US, estimates from industry and academia suggest energy demand for data centers could be as high as 400 terawatt-hours by 2030—up from fewer than 100 terawatt-hours in 2020 and higher than the total electricity demand from the entire country of Mexico.

One of the ways both presidents planned/plan to meet their goals is by building new nuclear reactor capacity, but also by recommissioning nuclear power plants that may have been decommissioned.

Remembering the 1970s and the context for the creation of these nuclear power plants: The commercial nuclear energy industry started in the U.S. with the first nuclear reactor going online in 1969 (Nine Mile Island), followed by others in 1971(Palisades) and 1974 (Three Mile Island). The first nuclear power plant to start operating in December 1969, the same month that one of the most sweeping environmental statutes in the world was passed, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. In July 1970, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through his reorganization plan. Yet nuclear power was not embraced as a clean alternative but as far too dangerous to humans and the environment.

Then in 1979, Three Mile Island had its infamous nuclear plant accident. Through a series of human errors, Unit 2 suffered a meltdown that produced radiation and caused the need to evacuate people within a five mile radius of the plant. Fortunately, there were no injuries and no deaths as a result of the accident. However, Unit 2 was permanently closed, and Unit 1 continued to produce energy until 2019.

The Palisades has been closed since 2022 and going into decommission status; while Three Mile Island stopped its last nuclear reactor Unit 1 in 2019.

Nuclear Energy Status

The United States now has 94 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states. The average age of these nuclear reactors is about 42 years old.

The oldest operating reactor, Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in New York, began commercial operation in December 1969. The newest reactor to enter commercial service is Unit 3 at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, which began commercial operation on July 31, 2023, and is the first reactor to come online since Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016.

Of the 54 operating nuclear power plants, 19 have one reactor, 31 have two reactors, four have three reactors and one has four reactors. The U.S. nuclear energy industry has supplied about 20% of total annual U.S. electricity since 1990.

How do you decommission a nuclear power plant?

We have never decommissioned a nuclear power plant, so the first one will be a precedent setting regulatory process. It looks like the Palisades Nuclear Energy plant located in Covert Township, Michigan on the Lake Michigan shore, will be the first. The beginning of Palisades was nearly six decades ago. Construction started in 1967 and the plant began operation in 1971. The nuclear power plant was owned originally by Consumers Energy and purchased by Entergy in 2006. The following year it was granted renewal of its license to operate which would be current until 2031. But Entergy said the nuclear energy market was no longer viable, stopped operation and sold it for scrap to Holtec in 2022. Holtec then changed from decommissioning to restarting — something that had never been done.

There are two new legal authorities for decommissioning and bringing back into operation these nuclear power plants. The ADVANCE Act of 2024, intended to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and its processes; and Trump’s Executive Order 14302 Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base (May 23, 2025). Both support more efficient processes to approve licensing. The executive order specifically addresses “restarts” as important.

In the case of Palisades, they moved from decommissioned status to an operating license. NRC notes in their press release that “while these NRC approvals will allow Holtec to load fuel, there are still several licensing actions under NRC review and additional requirements that need to be met before the plant can start up under the original operating license, which would expire March 24, 2031.”

NRC approved the transfer of all licenses from the previous owner, Entergy to Holtec Decommissioning International LLC to Palisades Energy LLC.

Actions that make a restart viable is the acceptance of previous documents and programs by NRC, including “technical specifications, emergency plan, emergency action levels, and physical security plan, as well as programs for quality assurance, maintenance, and inservice inspections.” They are also using an Environmental Assessment from May 2025 where they made a finding of no significant impact on the environment (FONSI) which means no Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

So Palisades can now receive uranium for its nuclear reactor and begin the process of testing for their operating license. As NRC said, the plan will not open until it is safe and however long that is, is how long it will take. Palisades anticipates to begin operation in 2027 after spending $1.5 billion in renovations (government funded).

What of Three Mile Island?

Meanwhile Three Mile Island is watching the Palisades precedent. Three Mile Island, while decommissioned in 2019, was bought by Constellation to bring it back into operating status. They also expect to spend $1.5 billion to bring it back to operating condition. The renamed Three Mile Island, the Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center, has contracted with Microsoft to produce energy exclusively for their data center needs to fuel their artificial intelligence needs for 20 years. They will be selling it for $115-120 per MW, which is above market price of about $110 per GM. The Crane Center anticipates opening in 2028.

From here?

We’ve only just begun (also the title of a hit song released in 1970) to build our nuclear energy capacity with an ambitious goal of quadrupling that capacity. Ensuring these first projects are done safely and without incident is critical. Given we have had almost half a century to improve on safety and efficiency, we are more accepting of the known risks than we were with the unknown risks of the 1970s, with 61% of Americans now favoring nuclear energy. New types of reactors are under development and the new micro-reactor is in the proof of concept stage, but promising.

If we restart these two old and infamous nuclear energy plants built almost half a century ago, we will have achieved a pathway to our carbon free, high volume, consistent production of electricity resource. It seems our love affair with nuclear energy is heating up again for America, ‘cause “breakin up is hard to do” (another song from the 1970s) when it comes to nuclear energy.

The US doesn’t know what it is missing…or just doesn’t realize it.

Chinese automotive giant BYD has established a significant foothold in Europe’s commercial vehicle market, leveraging its electric bus expertise while expanding into freight transport as the continent accelerates its transition to zero-emission transportation.

BYD is in America through purpose-built vehicles, mostly school buses and special application vehicles which are built by the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation (SMART) Workers Union, Local 105. The number of BYD-platform vehicles produced in the US is relevant to targets under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which created the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus (CSB) Program to fund electric school buses.

Compare the numbers to what is going in Europe, and there is so much room to grow.

Operating In Most Of Europe

The company’s most visible success has been in electric buses, with BYD vehicles now operating in major European cities, including Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Budapest, and Milan. This urban presence represents part of BYD’s global deployment of 70,000 electric buses worldwide, though Europe accounts for just 2.5% of that total volume as of early 2022.

BYD faces substantial competition in the European electric bus market, where domestic manufacturers maintain strong positions. In the first half of 2023, Poland’s Solaris, Germany’s MAN, and the BYD-ADL partnership held the top three market positions. However, the overall market is expanding rapidly, with battery-electric bus registrations reaching 5,315 units in the first half of 2025 alone.

The growth trajectory appears sustainable, with Europe’s electric bus market projected to reach $9.44 billion by 2034, driven by environmental regulations and the transition to sustainable public transport. France, the UK, Poland, the Netherlands, and Germany collectively account for more than half of Europe’s current electric bus fleet.

In The Logistics Space

Beyond buses, BYD has developed a comprehensive electric truck lineup for European logistics. The ETM6, a 7.5-ton truck with 200-kilometer range, targets urban delivery operations with payload options of 3,810kg or 3,740kg. Its 255 kWh battery charges from 20% to 100% in two hours, being designed for frequent urban cycles.

The company also offers the ETP3 compact panel van for tight urban spaces, and the EYT 2.0, a heavy-duty port and airport cargo truck capable of handling combined gross weights up to 75 tons for large containers and trailers.

All BYD commercial vehicles use the company’s iron-phosphate Blade Battery technology, which BYD positions as offering superior safety and reliability compared to other lithium-ion chemistries. The vehicles include advanced driver assistance systems such as lane departure warning, forward collision warning, 360-degree vision, and adaptive cruise control.

BYD’s European expansion strategy focuses on establishing local partnerships and adapting to regional logistics needs. The company has recently entered markets like Hungary and maintains an active presence at major industry events such as Germany’s IAA Transportation trade show.

This targeted approach reflects the fragmented nature of global commercial vehicle markets, where regulatory frameworks, infrastructure capabilities, and operational patterns vary significantly between regions. BYD’s European success stems from adapting its electric vehicle expertise to local requirements rather than applying a universal product strategy.

What BYD is doing in Europe contrasts with its strategy in other markets. While the company produces pickup trucks like the Shark for markets in Asia and Latin America, it has not introduced such vehicles in Europe, focusing instead on urban logistics solutions that align with European cities’ emphasis on dense, efficient freight movement.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sweden-bus-img.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 22:00:30.713302

It wasn’t so long ago that automobile makers moaned about the state’s stringent anti-smog rules – rules that compelled Detroit to produce cars for California and a more polluting car for the other 49 states. In time, technology and the power of the marketplace led to the production and sale of cars that were less polluting in all 50 states.

Now the state means to take the lead again with regulations to reduce tailpipe emissions by requiring improved fuel economy.

Predictably, the auto industry is howling, which means lawsuits will follow.

Too bad. Even if improved mileage standards made no impact on the environment, Americans are coming to understand all the reasons that fuel efficiency is only common sense.

Among them: Gasoline costs more than $2.25 a gallon. High energy costs and the foreign trade deficit (fueled by U.S. dependence on foreign oil) are dragging down the growth of the U.S. economy. American troops are living in harm’s way in an effort to maintain some stability in what happens to be the most petroleum-rich region in the world. Besides, energy conservation is good for the environment.

And so the state Air Resources Board last week published rule changes designed to curb energy waste and global warming.

The plan would require manufacturers to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by almost 30 percent by the year 2014.

The proposal responds to the majority of scientists who have concluded that the increased burning of fossil fuels is accelerating global climate change and all the associated unhappy consequences.

The new rules can be read online at www.arb.ca.gov./cc/cc.htm. Public comments are being accepted through July 6.

Congress and the Bush administration, populated by former oil company executives, have resisted efforts to make vehicles more efficient, and they can be expected to join the auto industry in opposing California’s effort to protect the planet.

Along the way, they will line up a minority of scientists who claim that it is still to be proved that global warming is caused by fossil fuel emissions.

But here’s their problem: Even if that were true, consumers and the families of American servicemen and women can still identify several other reasons that fuel efficiency serves the national interest.",https://www.pressdemocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/press-democrat.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 07:58:39.743157

In the United Kingdom, the government has put nuclear power back on the agenda, after decades with no new nuclear developments; however, managing nuclear waste continues to be a major barrier to development.

While some believe they have found sustainable solutions to dispose of nuclear waste, there is still widespread debate around how safe these methods are and the potential long-term impact of waste disposal and storage. In the United Kingdom, the government has put nuclear power back on the agenda, after decades with no new nuclear developments; however, managing nuclear waste continues to be a major barrier to development.

Nuclear waste remains radioactive for around 10,000 years, meaning it is vital that governments dispose of all waste effectively to ensure people and the environment are kept safe in the long term. As more governments welcome a new nuclear era, they must address nuclear waste concerns and establish clear guidelines and regulations on disposal to ensure that all nuclear power companies adhere to strong safety standards and practices.

There are three types of nuclear waste: low-, intermediate-, and high-level radioactive waste. Most of the waste produced at nuclear facilities is lightly contaminated, including items such as tools and work clothing, with a level of around 1 percent radioactivity. Meanwhile, spent fuel is an example of high-level waste, which contributes around 3 percent of the total volume of waste from nuclear energy production. However, this contains around 95 percent of the radioactivity, making adequate waste management of these products extremely important.

In the U.K., the government continues to battle with how best to dispose of its nuclear waste, as it looks to expand the industry over the coming decades. The U.K. has 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste from its previous nuclear power activities, a figure that will grow as more nuclear projects come online. The government is now considering the development of a massive underground nuclear dump, known as a geological deposit facility (GDF), to safely dispose of the waste. While no site has been confirmed for development, it is expected to be developed in one of two potential sites in Cumbria, in the north of England.

A U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson stated, “Constructing the UK’s first geological disposal facility will provide an internationally recognised safe and permanent disposal of the most hazardous radioactive waste.” They added, “Progress continues to be made in areas taking part in the siting process for this multibillion-pound facility, which would bring thousands of skilled jobs and economic growth to the local area.”

However, the U.K. Treasury believes the government’s plan for the waste dump is “unachievable”, rating the project as “red”, or not possible, in a recent assessment. This means that, “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable. The project may need rescoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.” In addition, there are concerns over the projected project cost, which is expected to be anywhere up to $73 billion.

Richard Outram, the secretary of Nuclear Free Local Authorities, explained, “The Nista red rating is hardly surprising. The GDF process is fraught with uncertainties, and the GDF ‘solution’ remains unproven and costly.”

At present, the U.K. stores most of its nuclear waste at its Sellafield facility in Cumbria, which is viewed as one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites worldwide. However, with the planned decommissioning of several power plants and the development of new nuclear facilities, the government must address its imminent waste issue. This is a long-term problem, with it expected to take until 2150 to dispose of the country’s existing waste into a GDF, if one is developed, before disposing of new waste.

In June, Lincolnshire County Council withdrew from being a potential site for the GDF after engaging with communities about the proposal. This is a common problem with developing nuclear waste sites, as the pushback in proposed waste regions often prevents development due to a not-in-my-backyard perspective from residents in the area. It is still unclear whether communities in Cumbria will hold a similar opinion. Corhyn Parr, the CEO of Nuclear Waste Services, said, “A GDF requires a suitable site and a willing community and will only be developed when both are in place.”

Several countries around the globe are battling with how best to dispose of old and new nuclear waste, as a nuclear renaissance is starting to be seen, in line with global aims for a green transition. While nuclear power is now viewed as extremely safe and clean, there are pressing concerns around the adequate disposal of waste, which can be extremely harmful to human health and the environment if improperly managed, that must be rapidly addressed.

,EPA,2025-09-07 22:18:48+00:00,Green Building Law Update,When Less Regulation Means Better Outcomes: EPA's Poultry Effluent Rule Withdrawal Explained,Stuart Kaplow,,,,,https://www.greenbuildinglawupdate.com/2025/09/articles/codes-and-regulations/when-less-regulation-means-better-outcomes-epas-poultry-effluent-rule-withdrawal-explained/,"As environmental attorneys, we are often asked to assist clients in the balance between environmental protection, regulatory authority, and the broader socio economic impacts of government decisions.
This alignment of environmental discretion with economic policy is both lawful and pragmatic.
By choosing the “no rule” option, EPA avoided these unintended consequences, a reminder that environmental protection is not always achieved through additional regulation.

The Agency’s action is not a retreat from environmental protection; it is a recognition that the best way to safeguard both people and the planet is through careful, evidence based prioritization.","As environmental attorneys, we are often asked to assist clients in the balance between environmental protection, regulatory authority, and the broader socio economic impacts of government decisions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s September 3, 2025 withdrawal of its proposed rule revising “effluent limitations guidelines” for the Meat and Poultry Products point source category, in support of the National Pollution and Discharge Elimination System permits program, is a prime example of the Agency exercising its statutory discretion under the Clean Water Act in a way that supports both environmental law and urgent national policy priorities.

Legal Authority and Discretion under the Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act empowers EPA to establish technology based effluent limitations that reflect the “best available” pollution control technologies for industries that discharge into waters of the U.S. However, the statute also provides the Administrator with discretion to determine whether such revisions are “appropriate,” a critical word in CWA § 304(b). The law expressly requires EPA to consider not only technological feasibility and cost, but also “such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.”

Here, EPA reviewed over 5,000 public comments,4,369 mailed submissions and 810 posted electronically, including comments we assisted poultry industry clients in preparing, before determining that revisions to existing regulatory effluent limitations guidelines were not warranted. The decision reflects both statutory compliance and sound administrative judgment. Courts have consistently affirmed that when Congress uses discretionary terms like “appropriate,” agencies have leeway to weigh competing policy concerns, including economic stability, food security, making Americans’ diet healthy again, and unintended environmental tradeoffs.

Why the Withdrawal Matters

The agricultural and farm sector, and in particular the poultry sector on the Delmarva Peninsula, plays an indispensable role in the nation’s food supply. From a legal and policy perspective, EPA’s withdrawal is significant for several reasons:

Protecting the Food Supply: The poultry and meat industries are essential to national food security. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing avian flu outbreaks, and supply chain disruptions, EPA recognized that layering new effluent regulations onto this already stressed sector could destabilize production at a time when MAHA has federal agencies working with farmers to ensure the U.S. food supply is healthy, abundant, and affordable, while addressing concerns about pesticides and farming practices.

Inflation and Consumer Prices: Between 2020 and 2024, the nation endured sustained inflation, with food prices among the most sensitive indicators. EPA’s decision explicitly acknowledges that additional regulatory costs would translate into higher prices for consumers at a time when federal policy is prioritizing affordability. This alignment of environmental discretion with economic policy is both lawful and pragmatic.

Avoiding Negative Environmental Tradeoffs: EPA’s analysis revealed that several of the proposed regulatory options would actually worsen environmental and public health outcomes. Tighter water discharge standards would have forced facilities to switch to alternative waste management techniques, such as increased landfilling (e.g., the spread of PFAS through the spreading of sewerage sludge [biosolids] as fertilizer) or incineration, leading to higher air emissions (e.g., where the buildup of nutrients on land releases ammonia into the air) and solid waste burdens. By choosing the “no rule” option, EPA avoided these unintended consequences, a reminder that environmental protection is not always achieved through additional regulation.

Efficient Use of Resources: Agencies must continually prioritize limited resources. Here, EPA made a judgment that its time, staff, and funding should be directed toward initiatives with clearer environmental and human health benefits as well as to Make America Healthy Again. This decision underscores the principle of regulatory triage: focusing on areas where rules will have the greatest positive impact.

Implications for the Delmarva Poultry Industry

For the Delmarva region, home to one of the largest concentrations of poultry production in the country, this withdrawal is a major development. The industry not only supplies Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia, but much of the East Coast with affordable protein but also supports tens of thousands of jobs across farming, processing, transportation, and retail. Had EPA finalized stricter effluent limits, facilities would have faced significant compliance costs at a time when margins are already under pressure from avian flu losses, rising input prices, and labor shortages.

The Agency’s recognition that new standards could compromise the sector’s viability reflects a sophisticated understanding of the interplay between environmental regulation and regional economic health. In effect, EPA is acknowledging that environmental stewardship must coexist with food security, Make America Healthy Again, and rural economic stability.

A Responsible Exercise of Discretion

Critics may argue that this withdrawal represents a step back from water quality protection. But that view ignores two crucial facts:

First, existing effluent limits for the industry remain in place, meaning facilities must continue to comply with established wastewater discharge limits. This is not deregulation; it is a decision not to impose additional Biden era new requirements that the Agency deemed inappropriate at this time.

Second, EPA’s analysis demonstrated that the proposed revisions risked creating greater net harm through secondary pollution impacts. By choosing not to finalize the rule, EPA prevented these negative tradeoffs, a result fully consistent with its statutory mandate to protect human health and the environment.

Conclusion

The EPA’s withdrawal of the proposed Meat and Poultry Products Effluent Limit Revisions is a textbook example of an agency exercising its discretion under the Clean Water Act responsibly and with due consideration of the national interest. The decision reflects a nuanced balancing of environmental protection, food security, making Americans’ diet healthy again, inflationary pressures, and the potential for unintended harms.

For stakeholders, including those in the Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia poultry industry, this action provides much needed regulatory certainty and relief at a time of profound external pressures. More broadly, it demonstrates that environmental law is not static or one dimensional; it must be applied with judgment, humility, and an eye toward the interconnected challenges of our time.

By choosing the “no rule” option here, EPA has honored both the letter and spirit of the Clean Water Act. The Agency’s action is not a retreat from environmental protection; it is a recognition that the best way to safeguard both people and the planet is through careful, evidence based prioritization.

,EVs,2025-09-07 22:16:11+00:00,Forbes,"Lucid Motors Bolsters Post-EV Tax Credit Strategy, Launches SUV Abroad - Forbes",Ed Garsten,,,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2025/09/07/lucid-motors-bolsters-post-ev-tax-credit-strategy-launches-suv-abroad/,"“Our demand is very strong for the Gravity, and is actually outpacing right now, what we can produce,” Winterhoff explained.
He expects the Gravity to dominate Lucid sales the rest of the year outpacing those of its Air sedan and the company is on track to achieve another record quarter.
On August 14 the company announced the Lucid Gravity Advantage Credit program.
In addition, Lucid launched a new ad campaign last week featuring popular actor Timothee’ Chalamet titled “Driven” to promote the Gravity.
Under the deal, robotaxis will be built by Lucid on the Gravity architecture and operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.","As luxury electric vehicle company Lucid Motors prepares to launch its Gravity SUV in Europe, interim CEO Marc Winterhoff is bracing for a fast-approaching deadline in the United States and laying out his strategy for dealing with its after-effects.

That deadline is September 30, when $7,500 federal tax credits on the purchase of qualified EVs disappear.

“We definitely will see an impact, but we have already started to mitigate that,” Winterhoff told reporters during an online briefing last Thursday in advance of this week’s IAA Mobility in Munich, Germany.

The impending evaporation of the tax credit created a rush to showrooms sending EV sales into heady territory, moving just over 130,000 units in July—a 19.7% spike over July, 2024 and 26.4% over June, according to Cox Automotive’s July 2025 EV Market Monitor.

Shoppers grabbed used EVs in big numbers as well, snapping up 36,670 pre-owned vehicles in July, a 40% year-over-year increase.

But the party is likely to be over once the tax incentives go away and dealers are already feeling pessimistic, according to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke who noted, “The outlook for future EV sales really comes as no surprise: Dealers have calendars too; they see the end of government-backed incentives fast approaching and are expecting a slowdown as the market adjusts to a new reality in Q4.”

For Lucid’s deep-pocketed luxury customers $7,500 might not represent a compelling reason to make a quick purchase, but sales for its Gravity SUV have been so strong the company is boosting production through what Winterhoff described as a “steep ramp up” that will continue to the end of the year.

“Our demand is very strong for the Gravity, and is actually outpacing right now, what we can produce,” Winterhoff explained. The top of the line Dream Edition is actually sold out, he revealed.

He expects the Gravity to dominate Lucid sales the rest of the year outpacing those of its Air sedan and the company is on track to achieve another record quarter.

Even with the increase Gravity output, Lucid reduced its 2025 production outlook from 20,000 to 18,000 units, the company said in its second quarter financial report.

That report revealed increasing financial strain on Lucid, showing a Q2 net loss of $855.3 million compared with a $790 million loss during the same three-month period a year ago.

Lucid is planning to create three new “tophats” or variations built on its midsize vehicle platform starting the end of next year, Winterhoff revealed while withholding any details.

He did admit, however, financing the line will eventually need bolstering, reporting, “our funding is enough to get us into the second half of next year. We plan to do the SOP (start of production) of the midsize platform end of next year and then we're ramping up from there. So that tells you that, and everybody actually would know that, that there will be additional funds needed in order to get there. But right now we are until the second half of 2026, well funded.”

On the job about six months after serving as chief operating officer for a year, Winterhoff already installed an aggressive strategy to both cool stress among customers who may feel pressure to buy before September 30 and defend against an expected slowdown in EV sales after that date.

On August 14 the company announced the Lucid Gravity Advantage Credit program. Under the program qualifying lessees who place an order for a Gravity by September 30 and lease between October 1 and December 31 will be eligible to receive a $7,500 Lucid Advantage Credit. Existing qualifying customers are covered as well.

“On top of that, we think that we are well positioned in Q4 and going forward we will obviously provide some incentives in Q4 to make it also for customers a little bit less harsh-- the difference between the with and without the credit,” said Winterhoff.

In addition, Lucid launched a new ad campaign last week featuring popular actor Timothee’ Chalamet titled “Driven” to promote the Gravity.

Looking ahead at the competitive landscape in the U.S. among EV companies, Winterhoff expressed confidence Lucid would maintain its strong position in the luxury segment, saying “right now with the Air, you know, we are in a pretty good spot. I mean, obviously we are planning to stay there. We are planning to do exactly the same with the Gravity as well. We think that we are very competitive with our products.”

Now Lucid is making its biggest move in Europe, announcing at IAA Munich it’s ready to take orders on the Gravity on the Continent.

“We will add additional markets, more than double in the next year, where we go into other European markets,” said Winterhoff. “We're not only going there with the current direct to consumer model that we have. Selected markets we will enter with importers and even in other markets we will add, let's say, dealerships that work as agents for us.”

Beyond retail, Lucid is covering its bets, having just closed a $300 million investment deal with ride hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc. Under the deal, robotaxis will be built by Lucid on the Gravity architecture and operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.

The first of those robotaxis is scheduled to go into service late in 2026 in a “major U.S. city,” according to the companies in a September 4 announcement.

Winterhoff is all too aware there are plenty of skeptics about the expected conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles to all- electric, admitting while sales are increasing, it’s at a slower pace than the industry had hoped.

But as he views moves by other automakers such as Ford Motor Co. that just announced it will produce lower cost EVs and upstart Slate, which promises a zero-frills EV in order to boost EV adoption, Winterhoff says Lucid will, in turn, adjust pricing down from its original $100,000-plus price point, but never go down market from its luxury perch.

“Now we are starting at 70, with the mid-size,” he explained. “The plan is to start at around 50 or slightly, slightly below. So that's the area where we where we want to play in but still in the in the premium sector. We’re fully aware that there is strong competition. There always will be but we think that we have a fantastic product and that we are able to compete in that area.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bdd3625fa3a8c6d1814db0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:11.237964

Energy Development Corporation activated its 22-megawatt facility in Sorsogon City on Friday. The Tanawon Geothermal Power Plant took 27 months to build and will produce 159,000 megawatt-hours yearly.

This development is another step forward for the Philippines, which ranks third globally in geothermal power production, per Inquirer.net. The country gets about 56% of its geothermal electricity from EDC's facilities alone.

Geothermal plants tap into Earth's natural heat to create electricity without burning anything. Hot water and steam from underground reservoirs spin turbines that produce power around the clock, regardless of weather conditions.

This technology offers stable electricity prices because it doesn't rely on imported fuels. Cities and businesses can budget more effectively when their power comes from consistent sources rather than fluctuating dirty fuel markets.

The Tanawon plant joins a growing network of renewable facilities helping the Philippines reach its goal of getting 35% of electricity from clean sources by 2030. Currently, renewables provide 22% of the nation's power. Coal still supplies most electricity needs.

Every megawatt of clean energy that replaces coal-fired power means fewer harmful particles in the air. Research has demonstrated that slashing air pollution leads to fewer respiratory problems, heart conditions, and other health issues in surrounding areas.

The new facility strengthens the country's energy independence while creating local jobs. EDC worked with First Balfour Inc. in the Philippines and Japan's Toshiba during construction, bringing technical expertise to the region.

Four additional renewable projects are scheduled to become operational this year, including three battery storage systems and another geothermal plant in Leyte.

These facilities will add more clean capacity to the grid while providing backup power during peak demand.

Jerome Cainglet, EDC's president and chief operating officer, called the plant's launch ""a win for the country's energy security and climate resilience journey,"" per Inquirer.net.

In New York, according to data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, it already employs 180,000 people, with buildings and transportation adding the most recent jobs.
More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy.
While federal policies may do their best to place stumbling blocks in the way, this is New York’s energy future.
Such a bill was passed by the New York State Legislature this year and Gov.","New York’s ambitious climate goals are facing a blizzard of political headwinds. Federal tax credits and funding for green energy projects are disappearing. Fossil fuel companies have spent millions on lobbying efforts to slow down legislation that would forward the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s electrification policy. Those efforts seem to be bearing fruit.

This opposition should not deter New York from striving to meet its goals – whether a few years late or not. In the grand scheme of things, the pushback against clean energy is a sadly misinformed blip.

In a recent editorial, the Buffalo News urged the state’s leadership to redouble its efforts in addressing climate change, fully implementing …

Despite a seeming powerhouse of opposition, much of it coming directly from the White House, the clean energy business continues to make strides. Why? It’s simple. The industry makes strong economic sense. In New York, according to data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, it already employs 180,000 people, with buildings and transportation adding the most recent jobs.

The Buffalo News editorial board recently accused New York of “lagging” in its climate goals, urging state leaders not to “lose their will.” B…

NYSERDA further states that large-scale renewable projects now in the pipeline will add thousands more jobs, as well as spur more than $4.7 billion in private investment. Utility-scale solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuels, with other technologies quickly becoming more cost competitive. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy.

While federal policies may do their best to place stumbling blocks in the way, this is New York’s energy future. State leaders must do their best to mitigate funding losses, fight fear-mongering misinformation and continue to steer the ship. Other states – including Colorado, California and Massachusetts – are facing the same headwinds and are still making progress.

In a recent Editorial Board meeting with NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris and staff members, Harris made it clear that her organization was mission-driven toward that clean energy future.

In an Aug. 17 op-ed for The News, Harris – with Rory Christian, chair of the New York State Public Service Commission – wrote, “New York remains a national leader in renewable energy. The state is home to the country’s only operational utility-scale offshore wind farm, with two more projects moving forward. We reached our 2025 distributed solar goal a full year ahead of schedule, and for two years running we’ve led the nation in community solar deployment.”

These are encouraging words. But it is not encouraging, as stated in New York’s 2025 draft energy plan, that redeploying fossil fuel systems is part of a revised strategy.

Weaning the state off fossil fuels, not adding them back, was the original idea and it still makes sense. New York’s extensive natural gas system releases methane – a potent greenhouse gas – and other harmful chemicals through leaks, especially within low-income neighborhoods, disproportionately affecting Black, Indigenous and people of color. This is especially true in cities like Buffalo, which, like all of New York’s urban centers, is dominated by older housing stock.

Organizations like PUSH Buffalo are working toward state policies that will bring clean energy into the neighborhoods that suffer the most from pollution – both indoors and out. One such policy, eliminating the “100 foot rule” that requires ratepayers to subsidize new gas hookups would help eliminate a financial burden as well as ease the way to a clean energy transition. Such a bill was passed by the New York State Legislature this year and Gov. Kathy Hochul should sign it.

The state should also continue on a path of neighborhood-focused action, like the installation of thermal energy networks and making older buildings more energy-efficient. This work, which helps ordinary people take advantage of healthier energy technology, is just as important as building wind farms and adding more gigawatts to New York’s solar arsenal.

Finally, though preliminary work has advanced the possible implementation of a Cap-and-Invest program that would allow emitters to purchase allowances, this timeline needs to be speeded up. It’s an essential part of funding New York’s transition.

He also discusses the company’s transformational partnership with Denison Mines, which brings technical, financial, and strategic backing from a C$2.9 billion uranium leader with a 19.13% equity stake in Foremost. With nuclear energy gaining momentum as a critical clean power source – and global pledges to triple capacity by 2050 – Foremost is uniquely positioned to benefit from structural supply deficits and surging demand. Barnard highlights the company’s fully funded 2025 exploration program, robust institutional backing, and dual exposure to uranium and lithium as key drivers of long-term shareholder value.

Jeff Lamothe, Senior Vice President and COO of Aptevo, will appear on the RedChip Small Stocks Big Money™ show on Bloomberg TV to discuss the company’s clinical momentum, pipeline expansion and vision for future growth. Lamothe will also share a more in-depth perspective of Aptevo’s recent clinical and strategic advances, including the strong performance of its lead asset, mipletamig, in combination therapy for frontline acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the expansion of its CD3 bispecific pipeline with the addition of APVO455, a Nectin-4 x CD3 candidate targeting solid tumors. With three differentiated CD3-engaging molecules now in development, Aptevo continues to build momentum in its mission to deliver safe, effective, and targeted immunotherapies for patients with limited treatment options.

The Vice President recently spent time in Scotland, reportedly using part of his holiday to hold behind closed doors meetings with senior executives from some of the US' largest nuclear energy firms, including Westinghouse, GE Hitachi, X-energy, Holtec International, and TerraPower, the Bill Gates-backed startup.

Though the discussions were officially described as exploratory, sources close to the matter say they lasted nearly twice as long as planned and centered on real-world opportunities for US firms to help meet Britain’s growing energy needs, particularly those driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and data centre expansion. With Trump soon expected to land in the UK for his second state visit taking place from 17 to 19 September, the White House is said to be pushing hard to secure UK government backing for major nuclear infrastructure projects.

Among the headline proposals are a large-scale plant on the island of Anglesey in North Wales, led by Westinghouse, and a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) planned by X-energy, which aims to deploy them in industrial areas across the UK, The Telegraph reported.

Days before Trump's visit to the UK, Lord Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US, called for a ""generational evolution"" of the transatlantic alliance, underpinned by new partnerships in energy, AI, and defence.

Speaking at the Ditchley Annual Lecture on September 6, he said: ""President Trump’s second state visit will showcase the best of British traditions and ceremony, but at its core will be new agreements that write the next chapter of transatlantic success; to create jobs, drive innovation, and ensure that British and American ingenuity continues to lead the world.""

He added: ""The Atlantic alliance has prevailed in every great contest of the modern era. Today’s technological competition will be no different, but we must act with the urgency and unity this moment demands.""

Typically, US presidents serving a second term are not invited for full state visits, but this visit comes following a personal invitation from King Charles III, delivered by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer during trade discussions at the White House earlier this year.

Trump, who previously visited in 2019 at the invitation of the late Queen Elizabeth II, described the renewed invitation as a ""great, great honour.""

He will be joined by First Lady Melania Trump and hosted at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace remains under renovation.

The UK government itself has begun streamlining nuclear development. In early 2025, reforms were announced to allow small modular reactors more widely across England and Wales by reducing red tape.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said back in February: ""This country hasn’t built a nuclear power station in decades. We’ve been let down, and left behind. Our energy security has been hostage to Putin for too long, with British prices skyrocketing at his whims.

""I’m putting an end to it – changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long.""",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/1200x630/6410747.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:21.919147

General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis are shifting investments from EVs to internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids. The deregulation clears the way for Detroit's legacy automakers to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and pollution rules. The shift in policy has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years.

Detroit's major automakers, including General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Company, and Stellantis NV, are set to save billions of dollars as President Trump's rollback of emissions standards and federal incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) benefit gas-guzzling cars. The deregulatory push is clearing the way for these legacy automakers to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and pollution rules, unlocking a significant financial opportunity over the next two years.

GM, for instance, has cut its electric-vehicle production plans at two factories and is overhauling a third plant to make gas-fueled pickups instead of battery-powered trucks. Similarly, Ford is moving funds from a canceled three-row electric SUV to future internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids. Stellantis NV is reviving the thirsty Hemi V-8 engine [2].

The shift in policy is expected to save Ford billions in regulatory credits, which it plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids. Ford's Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley recently told analysts that the policy change has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years [2].

GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing regulatory credits to meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements. With the rollback, these credits may become less needed, saving GM money. GM's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson expects the company to save money in 2026 and beyond due to the elimination of fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates [2].

The US Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rescinding of stringent tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions rules further supports this shift. The EPA's decision and the president's signature on legislation terminating similar regulations set by California are expected to benefit Detroit's automakers significantly [2].

However, the rollback is not without criticism. Environmental advocates argue that the policy change is detrimental to efforts to curb pollution from automobiles, one of the largest contributors to planet-warming emissions. Under President Biden, the EPA's rules were expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 7 billion metric tons over the life of the program and save drivers about $6,000 in fuel and maintenance costs [2].

Despite the criticism, automakers like GM believe they can capture a bigger slice of the EV market as rivals pull out, but they are happy to do so at a slower rate. GM is operating on just one shift of workers at some factories to build electric vehicles, reflecting the slower demand for EVs [2].

The deregulatory push also includes an aggressive tariff policy that penalizes imported vehicles and parts, imposing steep costs on carmakers. Ford's $1.5 billion savings on credits so far this year nearly offsets the $2 billion net hit to profits it expects to take from tariffs for all of 2025. GM expects about $3 billion in annual costs from tariffs, far more than the roughly $730 million average it has spent on compliance each year since 2022 [2].

In contrast, EV makers like Rivian Automotive Inc. and Tesla Inc. stand to lose significant revenue from the policy changes. Tesla has raked more than $10 billion by selling credits to other automakers since 2020, including more than $1 billion so far this year. Rivian CFO Claire McDonough expects zero revenue from credit sales for the rest of the year as a result of the policy changes [2].

Although not yet finalized, the deregulatory push is clearing the way for Detroit’s legacy automakers and their traditional rivals to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and other costs linked to pollution rules. GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing so-called regulatory credits to help the company meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements – a less-needed currency if Trump’s policies stick.

Ford has similarly cut its own credit-purchase commitments by nearly $1.5 billion this year alone, money it now plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids.

The shift in policy “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley recently told analysts.

Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package sunsets the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers on Sept. 30. It also zeroed out fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates, negating the need to buy credits under those rules. Stellantis paid $190 million in penalties in each of the last two years.

Eliminating the fines “will save us money in 2026 and beyond for sure,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors last month.

Separately, the US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding stringent rules limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from cars and the president signed legislation effectively terminating similar regulations set by California.

Conclusion The Trump-era emissions rollback provided Detroit’s legacy automakers with a strategic reprieve, enabling them to prioritize ICE profitability and reallocate capital away from costly electrification initiatives.","The Trump administration’s sweeping emissions rollback (2017–2021) reshaped the U.S. auto industry’s strategic calculus, enabling Detroit’s legacy automakers to prioritize internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles over costly electrification initiatives. By freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through model year 2026 and weakening greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, the administration created a regulatory environment that directly incentivized capital reallocation toward ICE production. This shift, while controversial, has yielded measurable financial gains for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, offering critical insights for investors navigating the sector’s evolving landscape.

Regulatory Reprieve and Strategic Reorientation

The Trump-era policy framework, epitomized by the 2018 “Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule,” effectively suspended the Obama-era mandate for annual improvements in fuel efficiency. By pegging standards to 2020 levels, the administration reduced compliance costs for automakers, particularly for large SUVs and trucks—vehicles that historically generate the highest profit margins. According to a report by the Harvard Environmental Law Program, this move “freed automakers from the need to invest in costly technologies to meet stricter targets,” allowing them to redirect capital toward ICE platforms [1].

For Detroit’s Big Three, this regulatory flexibility translated into a strategic reorientation. General Motors, for instance, scaled back its EV R&D budget in 2019, shifting focus to mid-size trucks and SUVs, which accounted for over 60% of its U.S. sales by 2020 [2]. Similarly, Ford’s decision to discontinue the low-selling Fusion sedan in 2021—replacing it with a new Bronco SUV—was framed as a response to “consumer demand and regulatory clarity” under the Trump rules [3]. Stellantis, then Fiat-Chrysler, similarly prioritized ICE models, with CEO Jim Ackerman noting in 2020 that the company’s “profitability hinges on large, fuel-efficient ICE vehicles in a less regulated environment” [4].

ICE Profitability Metrics and Capital Reallocation

The financial impact of this shift is evident in the automakers’ earnings reports. Ford’s F-150 pickup, a gas-powered model, generated a 20% operating margin in 2020—nearly double the industry average for EVs [5]. GM’s Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, both ICE-based, contributed $3.2 billion in pre-tax profits in 2019, a 15% increase from 2017 [6]. These figures underscore the profitability of ICE vehicles under relaxed regulations, even as automakers publicly committed to electrification goals.

Capital reallocation further amplified these gains. Between 2017 and 2021, Detroit’s Big Three reduced combined EV R&D spending by 18%, reallocating $4.3 billion to ICE production lines and plant upgrades [7]. For example, Ford’s $7.2 billion investment in its Blue Oval City plant in Tennessee (announced in 2021) was initially earmarked for EVs but was partially redirected to expand F-150 production capacity [8]. Stellantis similarly repurposed a $1.5 billion facility in Michigan to focus on Ram trucks, citing “regulatory certainty and consumer preference for ICE vehicles” as key drivers [9].

Risks and Long-Term Considerations

While the Trump-era policies bolstered short-term ICE profitability, they also delayed critical investments in electrification. A 2021 analysis by BloombergNEF noted that Detroit’s Big Three lagged behind Tesla and European rivals in EV battery production capacity, a gap that widened during the Trump years [10]. Additionally, the administration’s 2025 auto tariffs—imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act—introduced new headwinds, with the Detroit Three facing an estimated $108 billion in combined costs by 2025 [11]. These tariffs, coupled with the Biden administration’s subsequent reversal of Trump-era emissions rules, have created regulatory volatility that complicates long-term planning.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the interplay between regulatory shifts and capital allocation highlights the importance of hedging against policy uncertainty. Detroit’s legacy automakers have demonstrated resilience by leveraging ICE profitability to fund future electrification efforts, but their reliance on a deregulated environment remains a double-edged sword. As the Biden administration tightens emissions standards and states like California enforce zero-emission vehicle mandates, the window for ICE dominance may narrow.

Conclusion

The Trump-era emissions rollback provided Detroit’s legacy automakers with a strategic reprieve, enabling them to prioritize ICE profitability and reallocate capital away from costly electrification initiatives. While this approach delivered short-term gains, it also exposed the industry to regulatory and market risks. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: the auto sector’s future hinges on balancing ICE resilience with agile adaptation to evolving policy landscapes.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:02:01.004918

Advantages of Electric Cars

Electric vehicles offer significant benefits for drivers beyond just lower prices. The advantages range from saving money over time to helping reduce pollution in our communities.

Cost Efficiency

Electric cars tend to be more budget-friendly for day-to-day driving compared to gas vehicles. This is primarily due to their superior efficiency and lower energy costs.

While the purchase price of EVs is typically higher than similar conventional vehicles, this gap is narrowing. Many manufacturers have been cutting EV prices in recent years, making them more accessible.

The long-term savings are substantial. EVs have:

Lower fuel costs (electricity vs. gasoline)

Reduced maintenance expenses (fewer moving parts)

No oil changes required

Less brake wear due to regenerative braking

In most cases, an EV will cost less over its lifetime despite the higher upfront cost. Federal tax incentives and rebates further improve the financial equation for many buyers.

Environmental Benefits

Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, which helps improve local air quality. This direct reduction in pollution is especially important in urban areas where traffic congestion contributes to smog and health issues.

The overall environmental impact depends on how electricity is generated in a region. Areas with cleaner power grids (more renewables, less coal) see greater benefits from EV adoption.

EVs are becoming increasingly cleaner as:

Power grids add more renewable energy sources

Battery production becomes more efficient

Battery recycling improves

The reduced noise pollution is another advantage. Electric motors operate much more quietly than internal combustion engines, creating less noise in neighborhoods and cities.

Even when considering manufacturing impacts and electricity sources, most EVs have a lower lifetime carbon footprint than comparable gas vehicles.

Key Features to Consider

When shopping for a budget-friendly electric vehicle, certain features can make a big difference in your ownership experience. Understanding what matters most will help you find an EV that fits your needs without breaking the bank.

Battery Life and Range

Range anxiety remains one of the top concerns for potential EV buyers. Most affordable electric cars now offer between 100-250 miles of range per charge, which is sufficient for daily commuting and occasional longer trips.

The Niro EV offers decent range while maintaining a relatively lower price point compared to premium models. When evaluating battery performance, look beyond just the maximum range number.

Consider these important battery factors:

Degradation rate – how quickly the battery loses capacity over time

Temperature performance – how extreme cold or heat affects range

Warranty coverage – most manufacturers offer 8-10 year battery warranties

Battery chemistry – newer LFP batteries often last longer than older technologies

Real-world range often differs from EPA estimates. Cold weather, highway speeds, and using climate control can reduce range by 20-40%.

Safety Features

Even budget EVs should include essential safety systems. Many affordable electric vehicles come with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that were once found only in luxury models.

Basic features like A/C and GPS are expected, but safety should be prioritized when selecting budget-friendly electric cars. Look for these key safety elements:

Automatic emergency braking

Lane keeping assistance

Blind spot monitoring

Multiple airbags

High crash test ratings

Many EVs have inherent safety advantages due to their design. The low center of gravity from floor-mounted batteries improves stability, while the absence of a traditional engine creates larger crumple zones.

Charging Infrastructure

Access to convenient charging is crucial for daily EV use. Before purchasing, evaluate your charging options at home and on regular travel routes.

Home charging provides significant cost benefits, allowing you to power up overnight when electricity rates are often lower. Consider these charging considerations:

Home charging options:

Level 1 (120V): 3-5 miles of range per hour

Level 2 (240V): 15-35 miles of range per hour

Public charging access:

DC Fast Chargers: 80% charge in 30-60 minutes

Network compatibility with your vehicle

Charging speeds your vehicle supports

Most affordable EVs now offer fast-charging capability, but charging speeds vary significantly between models. Check if your vehicle includes a heat pump, which improves efficiency in cold weather.

Why Is An EV Road User Charge Being Pursued?
An option that seems to have significant support, even among some EV advocacy organisations, is a universal road user charge based on vehicle mass1 × distance travelled.
For example, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) is supportive of a road user charge.
AEVA National President Dr Chris Jones said that even under a universal road user charge, Australia’s fuel excise2 should remain in place.","Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers met with his state/territory counterparts on Friday to discuss (among other things) a potential road user charge (RUC) for electric vehicles.

What Was The Outcome Of The Meeting?

An options paper was put together for the meeting, a goal of which was for state and territory treasurers to “agree or to discuss some principles behind this policy design”.

What was in that paper isn’t clear. But the treasurers were in general agreement about the need for reforms to road user charging arrangements for electric vehicles, and that those reforms should be designed not to impede EV uptake.

“The reforms to the treatment of electric vehicles will ensure more equitable treatment across vehicle types and provide certainty to support investment,” says a (brief) joint statement from the meeting. “The design of reforms should be as simple as possible and minimise administration and compliance burden. We will ensure any changes are phased to enable the productivity, climate and consumer benefits of increasing electric vehicle uptake over the coming years.”

In a separate summary of the meeting, which also identified the need for reduction or removal of regulations that disadvantage electric heavy vehicles, Treasurer Chalmers said:

“The Commonwealth will progress work with the states and territories and take the time to get the policy development right.”

So, it appears this will still be a ‘Pantene’ process – it won’t happen overnight, but it will happen.

Why Is An EV Road User Charge Being Pursued?

EV owners avoid paying fuel excise and plug-in hybrid owners only pay it when they top-up at the pump. Fuel excise helps pay for road projects and maintenance — sort of. Collected by the federal government, fuel excise goes into general/consolidated revenue; where it can be spent on just about anything.

“Universal” RUC Missing In Action

The seismic shift that will be brought about by electric vehicles also means a seismic shift is needed in how we fund roads. An option that seems to have significant support, even among some EV advocacy organisations, is a universal road user charge based on vehicle mass1 × distance travelled.

For example, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) is supportive of a road user charge.

“… but only if it’s part of a wider reform of road-related revenue collection which applies to all vehicles regardless of their fuel source. This is particularly relevant as conventional hybrids are primarily responsible for the decline in fuel excise collected form [sic] petrol sales, yet such vehicles would not be captured under an EV-specific RUC.”

However, based on the Friday meeting statement, it doesn’t appear a universal RUC approach is being considered (yet).

What About The Fuel Excise’s Future?

AEVA National President Dr Chris Jones said that even under a universal road user charge, Australia’s fuel excise2 should remain in place.

“An EV and a diesel vehicle of identical weight and annual mileage should pay the same sum for use of the roads,” he said. “But the diesel vehicle should pay something extra for the noise, harmful pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, fuel excise captures that perfectly already.”

And the AEVA says while the RUC should be set by the federal government, state and territory transport departments should administer the scheme and retain all revenue for road maintenance.

The Federal Treasurer reportedly isn’t keen on a universal road user charge *and* fuel excise existing side-by-side as he considers this a double-tap tax for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle owners. But that’s the point: a “polluter pays” approach would make ICE ownership less desirable; although there are significant social and other implications to consider.",https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chalmers-ev-ruc.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 17:00:33.381209

Although initially meant for cars, Mathai said it could be adapted for larger vehicles. He said, ""It is not just any noise; it is of a particular frequency and amplitude. However, we cannot force anyone to buy our technology. One area we are seriously looking into is EV two-wheelers. At present, we are conducting a study with the industry to improve safety.""

""I will study the plan and decide accordingly in this week,"" he said. Currently, PMPML operates a fleet of 490 electric buses. However, concerns are rising — not just over silent operations, but also mechanical reliability. ""The buses are risky,"" said commuter Ashwin Lande. ""They just zoom past without warning. Many new EV models include some form of audible alert now. PMPML should consider something similar."" Another commuter, Pankaj Khot of Kondhwa, echoed the concerns. ""These buses often speed in heavy traffic and even break signals at night. If there's a system to alert people, it should be implemented immediately,"" he said. PMPML spokesperson Kishore Chauhan said drivers have been instructed to honk frequently, especially while overtaking. ""The buses are operated by private contractors. We'll investigate the complaints,"" he added. (With inputs from Shashank Didmishe)

Audi moves forward by looking back

The Audi Concept C previews what a future electric sports car from the automaker could look like, but its design is firmly rooted in the past. Audi claims inspiration from throughout its history, ranging from the 1936 Auto Union Type C race car that served as a Nazi propaganda tool, to the third-generation 2004 Audi A6 sedan that has served as the brand’s styling template for the past 20 years.

The Concept C’s long hood and hunchback rear give it a similar silhouette to the Type C. The 1930s race car had its engine behind the driver, but it’s unclear what this all-electric concept car is hiding under that vented rear cowl. The Millennial influence is also apparent in the minimalist, unadorned surfaces. Like a mid-2000s Apple product, the Concept C looks like it was hewn from a solid chunk of metal. The minimalist theme continues inside, where a 10.4-inch display screen folds away when not in use so as not to ruin the clean lines of the dashboard. Physical controls are well integrated and made from anodized aluminum for a quality feel, while indirect ambient lighting “enhances the interior design’s evident solidity,” according to Audi.

This concept’s main purpose is to show off the next evolution of Audi design, so technical details weren’t disclosed. Audi did say that the Concept C previews a future production model, which could be paired with the expected EV replacements for the Porsche 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman sports cars.

BMW goes back to school

BMW unveiled the first of its next-generation “Neue Klasse” EVs at its hometown show, and SUV called the iX3 that’s close in size to the automaker’s current bestseller — the gasoline X3. Named after a family of models that helped save the company in the 1960s and 1970s, the Neue Klasse (German for “new class”) is a complete EV rethink for BMW.

In iX3 50 xDrive launch guise, this electric SUV will have a pair of motors generating 463 horsepower and 476 pound-feet of torque, getting it from zero to 60 mph in a BMW-estimated 4.7 seconds. For this dual-motor powertrain, BMW opted for a front asynchronous motor and rear electrically exited synchronous motor for what the automaker claims is improved efficiency. The battery pack is made up of cylindrical cells assembled without modules (known as cell-to-pack), while the pack itself is more closely integrated with the vehicle structure.

The new cells improve energy density by 20%, crucial for hitting BMW’s targeted 400 miles of range. BMW also claims a 30% improvement in charging speed compared to its current-generation EVs, allowing the iX3 to recover 230 miles of range in 10 minutes when DC fast charging at its full 400-kilowatt capacity. The iX3 marks BMW’s switch to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), but a free Combined Charging Standard (CCS) adapter will be provided.

The Neue Klasse models also have a streamlined electrical architecture based around four “superbrain” computers, which reduces the weight of these components by 30% and eliminates 2,000 feet of wiring, BMW claims. One of the four computers, called the “Heart of Joy” will integrate powertrain and chassis functions for better driving dynamics, while another will handle driver aids, including a “symbiotic” mode that blends manual and automated control inputs.

The iX3 itself features fresh styling, with a thin vertical grille that harkens back to this EV’s Neue Klasse namesakes from the 1960s. Inside, a dashboard-spanning display, next-generation head-up display, and voice assistant are included. The iX3 is scheduled to reach the United States in summer 2026, with prices starting around $60,000.

Mercedes’ star shines even brighter

In contrast to BMW, Mercedes-Benz is moving away from dedicated EVs and focusing on electric versions of combustion models. That strategy has already rolled out with the electric G-Class SUV and CLA-Class compact, and continues with an electric version of the GLC-Class SUV that could be one of the BMW iX3’s closest rivals.

Officially the GLC with EQ Technology, the EV looks a lot like a gasoline GLC, but with bigger, illuminated grille and the Mercedes-star headlights from the CLA. However, the electric version also has a 3.3-inch longer wheelbase that increases headroom and legroom in both rows of seats, plus a 4.5-cubic-foot frunk.

Full specs will be released closer to the electric GLC’s arrival in the U.S. late next year, but Mercedes estimates up to 483 hp and 443 miles of range from a 94-kilowatt-hour battery pack using new cell chemistry. An 800-volt electrical architecture allows for even faster DC fast charging, with the ability to recover up to 188 miles of range in 10 minutes, according to Mercedes. A “One-Box” braking system integrates the friction and regenerative braking for better feel, while available rear-axle steering and air suspension should improve agility and comfort, respectively.

Inside, you’ll find a panoramic glass roof with switchable electrochromic glass to block out excessive rays, and a 39.1-inch dashboard display comprised of a 10.25-inch instrument cluster, 14-inch central touchscreen, and 14-inch front-passenger touchscreen. It runs the new Mercedes-Benz Operating System (MB.OS) and Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment software that debuted in the CLA, with a cacophony of voice assistants. ChatGPT4o with Bing search and Google Cloud’s Automotive AI Agent are both onboard, along with Mercedes’ own virtual assistant.

Porsche lets you charge a car like a smartphone

Porsche’s biggest announcement was a new generation of 911 Turbo that adds a hybrid powertrain to the legendary sports car. But Porsche also had some news for those who disdain cars without plugs, announcing that the upcoming Cayenne Electric will be available with wireless charging — a much-discussed EV feature that’s failed to gain traction with automakers until now.

Instead of having to drag cables around, drivers will be able to simply park the Cayenne Electric over a wireless charging pad, which will transmit electricity to a receiver mounted on the underside of the vehicle between the front wheels. Porsche claims this system will be able to transmit power at 11 kW — about the same as many conventional onboard AC chargers — over a gap of four to six inches. Charging will start automatically once the car is in position, and a special camera view will help drivers to do that. Porsche also promises similar features to conventional charging, including cabin preconditioning, departure scheduling, and integration with the My Porsche app.

Several aftermarket companies offer wireless-charging hardware that can be retrofitted to EVs, but that doesn’t offer the seamless integration of a system available from the factory. But aside from some Chinese-market vehicles and South Korean-market versions of the Genesis GV60, such integration isn’t available. Porsche could be the first automaker to offer wireless charging at scale, across multiple markets. It plans to launch the system in Europe in 2026, followed by “other markets around the world.”",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pre-media_25c0192_101.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:54.721590

It already has 25 different world records under its belt, but the feat it just achieved might be the most impressive so far: The GT XX can accomplish 1 megawatt charging with just a single cable. At a prototype charging station, the concept vehicle achieved over 1,000 kilowatts (that equals 1 megawatt) of charging power thanks to its axial flux motors and direct-cooled battery. These two pieces of tech aren't just some far-off idea, either — they're expected to reach series production with the production version of the GT XX that will debut next year riding on the AMG.EA high-performance EV architecture.

The car was able to achieve a maximum charging speed of 1,041 kW during megawatt charging. Mercedes says the power was available just 0.5 seconds after charging started, and it was able to maintain at least 1,000 kW for about two and a half minutes. Up to 1,176 amps of current was able to flow through a specially designed CCS charging cable, transmitting 17.3 kWh of juice in just one minute. That's the equivalent of 78 miles of range in the WLTP cycle. In EPA terms, that's at least 55 to 60 miles, which is pretty incredible.

Mercedes says a lot of what makes these sorts of ludicrous charging speeds possible is the design of the 3,000 battery cells inside the AMG GT XX that were developed in-house in Affalterbach and inspired by Formula 1 tech. They make use of cylindrical NCMA cells that have a tall, slim design that allows for efficient cooling and high energy density. Their laser-welded aluminum cell housing also improves conductivity when it comes to both current and heat, meaning they can charge faster for longer.

The company put a lot of thought into the AMG GT XX's cooling system and its ability to dissipate heat quickly enough to support these sorts of nutty charging speeds (let alone support the kind of power the car produces). Intelligent thermal management is pinpoint accurate when it comes to controlling the pack's temperature to make sure everything is performing at tip-top shape — even during intensive use.

Of course, you can't pop over to your run-of-the-mill Tesla Supercharger or Electrify America hub and get these sorts of numbers. You need something equally as wild as the AMG GT XX to flow a whole ass megawatt of power into a car. That's why Mercedes teamed up with European charging company Alpitronic to come up with something more extreme. The station used for this test was apparently originally designed for commercial trucks, but it was converted into a system that worked with smaller CCS cables.

Don't worry, that isn't some one-off experiment, either. Mercedes and Alpitronic say their findings will relate directly to the development of new high-performance chargers in both Europe and North America. Folks, we're getting dangerously close to the moment when EVs can fill up just as fast as gas-powered cars. What will electric vehicle doomers say then?

“In February, I visited communities in Asheville to witness firsthand the crucial role drinking water utilities have in responding to natural disasters,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “This funding to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality will help secure the infrastructure of these systems to ensure EPA can fulfill its core mission to protect human health and the environment.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/67edb19c6632d5.97741037.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:45.650944

The good news is that the $7,500 federal credit isn't the only available incentive.","You've probably read by now that the $7,500 tax credits for buying an EV are going away at the end of September. To be clear, this isn't a restructuring of the EV credits, they're not just changing which cars are eligible for the full amount. President Trump is simply taking the federal EV credits off the table entirely.

We were able to get some insight on the matter from John Vincent, Senior Editor/Vehicle Testing for U.S. News & World Report, who had the following to say: “Automakers are steadily building their lineups of EVs and will still have electric cars to sell after September 30. I’d look for them to substantially drop prices or offer incentives, though they might not make up for the entire loss of the federal tax credit. I think the best bet if you’re a shopper: Buy now to ensure your access to the savings. So there you have it, if you were waiting for an excuse to buy an EV, this is one of the best you're ever going to get, and here's why we think the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is the right choice.

Why The Hyundai Ioniq 5?

In our latest roundup of new 2025 EVs, we put the Hyundai Ioniq 5 right at the top of the list, above some stellar vehicles like the BMW iX, the Audi Q8 e-Tron, and even the Porsche Taycan.

To take a quick look at the specs...

These numbers are all over the place, because Hyundai really does have an Ioniq 5 for every price range. The Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range is a 168-horse rear-wheel drive model that will start you out at $42,600, or just $35,100 if you qualify for the full $7,500 EV credit. Move your way up the ladder, and you've got the 225-hp $49,600 SEL, with 318 miles of all-electric range in the rear-wheel drive model, and the $54,300 320-hp all-wheel drive Limited, with an electric range of 269 miles.

A Surprisingly Potent Family SUV

Whatever you're after, there's an Ioniq 5 to suit your needs at a price you can live with. But, we wouldn't be recommending it if we didn't actually like it. The all-wheel drive models are capable of 0-60 times in the five-second range, and the athletic powertrain and responsive handling make for a family car that's actually fun to drive.

If you were to ask us to nitpick the Ioniq 5: the steering feedback is definitely a bit numb, and the suspension is cushy to the point of being almost floaty. It's not the most driver-oriented car, but that's not really what you're after in a mid-range family SUV.

The EV Credits Don't Just Apply To Leased Models

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 has been on and off the list of cars eligible for the EV credit. Right now, Hyundai lists the following Ioniq models as qualifying for the full $7,500.

2025 Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range with model code 1402REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 SE All-Wheel Drive with model code 51412AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 SE Rear-Wheel Drive with model code 51412REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 Limited All-Wheel Drive with model code 51462AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 Limited Rear-Wheel Drive with model code 51462REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 XRT with model code 51452AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 XRT All-Wheel Drive with tow hitch with model code 514C2AEZ

2026 Ioniq 9 (all trims, powertrains and model codes)

At present, Hyundai lists these models as being eligible for the full $7,500 EV credit for purchase. To quote the website directly...

Eligible customers who purchase a new 2026 IONIQ 9 or a select new 2025 IONIQ 5 vehicle from a participating, IRS-registered dealer may qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. The tax credit may be applied at point of sale or applied against customer’s annual income tax liability.

The 2026 Ioniq 9 is currently the only 2026 model eligible for the EV credit, and the list doesn't include a single 2024 model. So if you want an Ioniq 5, you're looking for a 2025 model in particular. The good news is that almost every configuration is covered, so you should be able to claim the credit no matter what you're after.

Supplies Are Limited

You'll want to move fast, not just because the credits are disappearing, but because EVs are flying off the lots right now. Checking in with U.S. News & World Report's John Vincent once more, the Senior Editor told us:

“Demand for new cars has been artificially boosted for the last several months, first with shoppers trying to beat the Trump import taxes, and now by the expiring federal EV tax credit. Unless automakers juice the market with generous incentives, the fourth quarter could see significant weakness.”

Time Is Literally Running Out

Let's say you're waiting for that Christmas bonus from work before you decide to take the plunge on an EV, or you'd rather drive a 2026 model. Whatever the case, you're not buying until October, at the earliest, which means that you're going to miss out on the $7,500 credit... What then?

State-Level Incentives Remain, But Are Unlikely To Match The Federal EV Credit Dollar-For-Dollar

The bad news is that this is it for the full $7,500 federal EV credit. If it's ever coming back, it's unlikely to be anytime in the next three and a half years. The good news is that the $7,500 federal credit isn't the only available incentive. In fact, California has promised to match the $7,500 amount at a state-level to make up the difference. Drivers in other states, though, might have to settle for what they can get. According to John Vincent...

Many states already have incentive programs for EV buyers, but $7,500 per vehicle is a lot for a state to offer. The high-tax economic powerhouse of California may be able to fund such a program, but I doubt many other states can. Oregon, for example, a state politically similar to California, offers up to a $5,000 rebate toward the purchase of an EV. However, Oregon’s EV rebate funding consistently runs out early in the year, and even it can’t muster the political will to extend the program.”

There are simply too many obstacles in the way of state-level EV credits matching the outgoing federal credit. States that have the political support might not have the money for such incentives, and states that have the money might not have the political support.

Between state-level EV incentives and dealer mark-downs to make up for sales lost to the expiring EV credits, it's not impossible to think that you might wind up cobbling together a total discount roughly equal to the $7,500 federal credit. But you can't count on it. If you want a guaranteed, federal-government-backed $7,500 discount off the price of purchase, you've got about a month left to sign on the dotted line, and that's it.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-xrt.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:16.520148

But overall, the GLC EV isn't that much bigger than the gas While the outside of the GLC EV is evolutionary, its inside could very well be considered revolutionary.","The Mercedes-Benz GLC has been the German automaker's best-selling model for years at this point, and that trend is only going to continue as compact luxury crossovers get more popular, but the GLC has been missing something: an electric powertrain. Thus far, we've only gotten internal-combustion-powered GLCs, as the EQC never made it to our shores, but that all changes with the new GLC with EQ Technology (which I'll be calling the GLC EV from here on out). Not only is it a reinvention of Mercedes' most important model, it's also a North Star for where the automaker is headed in the future.

The GLC EV brings with it a slew of new technologies and features we're sure to see on other Mercedes-Benz vehicles, especially as it's the first car on the all-new MB.EA electric vehicle architecture. It also has an AI-driven MB.OS supercomputer to run everything, a totally redesigned cabin with a massive 39.1-inch seamless screen, even better driver-assist systems, and an exterior that blends forward-thinking design elements with nods to past iconic Mercedes-Benz models. There's a lot to like here. Let's dig in.

Underneath the skin of the GLC EV is the all-new 800-volt MB.EA architecture that Mercedes first started telling us about a few years ago. In the U.S. we're going to get two drivetrain options at launch: the rear-wheel-drive GLC300+ and the all-wheel-drive GLC400 4Matic. Mercedes says the GLC300+ will put out 369 horsepower and 372 pound-feet of torque from its single motor. That's good enough for a 5.9-second 0-to-60-mph run. The dual-motor GLC400 bests both those numbers by quite a lot, coming in at 483 hp and 596 lb-ft and dropping the claimed 0-60 time to just 4.4 seconds. Either way you get a 130-mph top speed.

Both models have a 94-kWh battery pack and can DC fast charge at up to 330 kW, and there's an integrated DC converter so they can charge at both 800-volt and 400-volt stations. Mercedes says it can charge from 10% to 80% in about 24 minutes, and about 150 miles of range can be added in just 10 minutes. On the European WLTP cycle, Mercedes says the GLC EV can travel up to 443 miles on a full charge. WLTP is more optimistic than the EPA's test, so I'd hazard that our range will be somewhere around the 390-400 mile mark.

It also comes as standard with selectable one-pedal driving. Mercedes knows this is going to be a lot of buyers' first EV, so it wants to ease everyone into it slowly. Up to 300 kW of regeneration is possible, and Mercedes says the GLC recuperates during ""over 99%"" of braking.

Like with the Porsche Taycan, Mercedes went with the two-speed transmission in an effort to optimize both performance and efficiency. First gear has a short ratio of 11:1, which gives the GLC EV quick acceleration, high towing capacity (up to 5,291 pounds) and more efficiency around town. Second gear (5:1) is designed for power delivery at higher speeds — like accelerating from an on ramp all the way up to its 130 mph top speed on the autobahn — and efficiency in highway driving. Air suspension is optional, as is rear-wheel steering that turns up to 4.5 degrees.

When you're on the highway, you'll be able to enjoy Mercedes' standard suite of driver-assist technologies that will only get better with time as they are improved with over-the-air updates. The GLC has up to ten cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors and five radar sensors.

When it comes to the outside of the GLC EV, the first thing you're going to notice is the biggest thing, that eye-catching grille up front that Mercedes says both ""marks an important milestone and redefines the face of the brand."" The ""grille"" has a wide chrome frame, a smoked-glass-look mesh structure and integrated contour lighting. Of course, there's an illuminated version available that you simply must get, which comes with 942 polycarbonate backlit dots, as well as an illuminated three-pointed star.

Other than the grille, the GLC EV isn't that wild-looking. That isn't to say it's not a handsome crossover — it definitely is, but it's fairly conservative by modern EV standards. For the most part, the GLC EV looks like a pretty conventional Mercedes-Benz crossover, though it's not nearly as blob-like as the EQE SUV. It's a nice mix between gas-powered crossovers like the existing GLC and the EQ models.

As will become standard new Mercedes-Benz fare, the headlights have three-pointed-star-shaped running lights, and the taillight bar contains small encircled star LEDs like on the recent GT XX concept. The car also comes with plenty of chrome to keep even the most traditional Mercedes fan happy, and there's a small roof spoiler at the top of the trunk to help with aerodynamics and disguise the GLC EV's sloping roofline. Mercedes says the GLC has a drag coefficient of 0.26, which is pretty good but slightly off the mark of the newly released BMW iX3, which will be the GLC's biggest competitor. You can get up to 21-inch wheels if you aren't too worried about the car's range, but 20s come as standard.

The GLC EV's 117-inch wheelbase is 3.9 inches longer than the gas-powered GLC, and because of other clever EV packaging, interior room grows for everyone. Front and rear occupants get an extra 0.5 inches and 1.9 inches of legroom, respectively, and rear headroom is up 0.6 inches, thanks in part to the standard panoramic roof.

Mercedes says the GLC EV will have 20.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which isn't bad but is a bit less than the gas GLC. If that's not enough, electrically drop the 40:20:40-split second row and the space grows to a healthy 61.4 cubic feet, more than the ICE model, and the cargo floor can be lowered by 3.1 inches. If you need just a bit more space, there's a standard frunk with an extra 4.5 cubic feet of room. But overall, the GLC EV isn't that much bigger than the gas

While the outside of the GLC EV is evolutionary, its inside could very well be considered revolutionary. The big news here is the available 39.1-inch MBUX Hyperscreen, the largest display fitted to a Mercedes to date. Made up of over 1,000 individual LEDs, it combines gauge cluster, central infotainment screen and passenger display into one seamless screen that spans the whole dashboard. Intelligent dimming technology will allow for simultaneous adjustment of different sections, like if the passenger wants their side to be darker.

Mercedes says the screen can show ""high-resolution ambient styles"" as background motifs that are meant to offer a wide range of moods to the folks in the car, ""from calm to intense, cool to warm, and technical to emotional."" In addition to changing the graphics and colors across the screen, these moods also change the ambient lighting.

Mercedes-Benz

The infotainment system is an evolution of the new MBUX that debuted on the CLA, with simpler menus and better graphics than the old cars. It even has an AI virtual assistant thing with ChatGPT4o and Microsoft Bing Search that'll be your friend if you don't have one, but I really think you should try to find one.

The GLC EV's interior is about more than a big screen, though. Mercedes made it a point of emphasis to bring back buttons and knobs on both the steering wheel and center console (they live right by a pair of wireless phone chargers), replacing the haptic buttons that were previously there. It's also putting a bigger emphasis on trim and materials — the floating wood piece that follows the dash and center console is huge, the air vents are more intricate, and the door panels have more complex designs.

Of course, like all modern Mercedes-Benz models, the GLC EV's interior is festooned with all of the ambient lighting you could ever want that can be changed to 11 trillion different colors and even pulse and change along with the music. That ambient lighting can also show up on the panoramic roof, which, as an option, is covered in 162 three-pointed stars, a very neat trick.

Mercedes says the GLC EV is going to be offered with a whole slew of sustainable materials meant to create a high-quality feel in the car's interior, including the first interior certified by The Vegan Society, if that's the sort of thing you're into. If you're not, you can also choose from black, beige or brown leather options that can be paired with all sorts of lovely trim options from anthracite or metallic-blended fabric to AMG carbon fiber and birch wood. It's a Mercedes. You've got lots of options.

If you're not feeling that massive screen, you can also go for the MBUX Superscreen that separates the three zones into separate screens like on the CLA: a 10.25-inch driver display, a 14-inch infotainment screen and a 14-inch passenger display. The base GLC EV doesn't have the passenger display; instead it gets a panel with more illuminated stars.

The AMG version of the GLC EV isn't getting revealed yet, but that hasn't stopped Mercedes from offering several different AMG appearance packages on the car. You can option the GLC EV with the AMG Line, which gives it AMG exterior styling, unique AMG wheels, a sports steering wheel in Nappa leather, AMG floor mats and sports pedals. You can also opt for the AMG Line Sport Seat Package that gets you more snug seats with integrated headrests, AMG-specific stitching for the door panels and interior, cherry red leather and different graphics for the screen.

If that's not quite enough AMG for you, there's also the AMG Line Plus with Night Package, which adds all the AMG Line features plus 21-inch wheels with a black tint, a black rear spoiler, illuminated black door sills and Manufaktur seatbelts in red.

Mercedes-Benz

I hear you, AMG isn't your thing. Don't worry, there are plenty of other GLC EVs to choose from, like the Executive Line. It packages the illuminated grille with the illuminated panoramic roof and the Superscreen with the 14-inch passenger display, ambient interior lighting and illuminated door sills. You can also go for the Pinnacle Line, which gives you the Executive features plus active ambient lighting, a Burmester sound system and an air purifier.

If you're someone who wants, no needs, the best, go for the Pinnacle Plus Line. That upgrades your lights on the outside, gets you the 39.1-inch Hyperscreen, as well as an even better Burmester sound system, heated and ventilated front seats that'll massage you, and the Winter package.

We can expect to see the GLC400 4Matic hitting showroom floors in late 2026, with the GLC300+ following in early 2027. The price has yet to be announced, but with BMW's iX3 said to start at around $55,000, Mercedes probably wants to be close to that mark.

It's hard to think of a car in the past few decades that has been as important for Mercedes-Benz as the GLC with EQ Technology. Putting aside its silly name, it's a car that carries an enormous weight on its shoulders. Despite America's best efforts, the rest of the world is moving away from gas-powered vehicles and toward EVs.

For luxury brands like Mercedes, the compact crossover is the most important segment, bar none. It's been a rocky road for Mercedes trying to introduce a model in this segment in the U.S., but the GLC EV looks ready to take the world by storm, all while setting the tone for what a Mercedes-Benz is going to look like for years to come.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/2026-mercedes-benz-glc-ev-paves-the-way-for-every-upcoming-mercedes/l-intro-1757119893.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:57.273926

Still, India’s clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures.
Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.
India has also been importing solar modules from China.
Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance.","On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country’s push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.

India, the world’s most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.

In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew’s sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce four gigawatts of power each year — enough electricity for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The two-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry’s momentum. India’s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.

“When I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,” said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.

The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.

India’s solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Trump’s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump’s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.

Still, India’s clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India’s domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.

While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.

“This is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,” said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

India’s domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.

“Before the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,” he said.

Government policies, demand push growth

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power — now half that of new coal-powered plants — and India’s many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India’s demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.

Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump’s tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump’s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline — most of which are solar — and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.

Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew’s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.

“We are in a good phase right now,” he said. “We are highly dependent on policy support, but we expect that momentum to be maintained.”

Indian manufacturing will likely grow

India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.

Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.

According to India’s renewable energy ministry, the country’s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from nine gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.

India still needs Chinese raw materials because it lacks infrastructure to mine and process them, but government initiatives to produce critical minerals are slowly addressing the problem, experts said.

Shubhang Parekh of the National Solar Energy Federation of India said the supply chains needed to process the raw materials are still a work in progress, but he’s confident the challenges can be overcome.

“The next few years will be critical in determining how far we can go,” Parekh said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee2f5d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4536+0+612/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F1b%2Fe4a4c6a64e6797c8a74aff1f0b20%2F1f38257170c14ee9a07738f8a1141ab0.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:31.074209

Many other Redditors were thrilled to see a new EV owner enjoying their car.","A giddy new electric car owner showed off their vehicle on Reddit, asking other EV owners for helpful tips.

The Redditor shared a photo of their sleek new Volkswagen ID.3 electric model in a cool gray color.

""Been a VW owner for 11 years and I just upgraded to an ID.3 this weekend!"" the photo's caption read. ""I'm absolutely in love with it so far. Anyone got any tips and tricks to save battery or anything I should know?""

The ID.3 is one of Volkswagen's most popular EVs, with a combined electric range between 240 and 369 miles and battery capacity options ranging from 52kWh to 79kWh. The modern design and zippy driving style make it a dream EV for plenty of people, including the OP.

While this EV is fun and stylish, it's also practical. People who switch from a traditional gas-powered vehicle to an EV can enjoy fuel and maintenance savings. EVs don't require as much routine maintenance, as they don't need oil or fluid changes.

A 2020 Consumer Reports study found that EV owners saved about 60% on fuel costs compared to traditional car drivers. Additionally, a 2018 Forbes report cited a study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, which found that fueling an electric car costs approximately $485 per year, while a gas vehicle costs over $1,100.

You can save even more on fueling if you add solar panels to your home, making charging your car substantially cheaper. Use EnergySage's free tools to compare local installation quotes and save as much as $10,000 on new solar panels. If the upfront costs are prohibitive, consider leasing solar panels instead. Palmetto's LightReach program will install solar panels on your home for no money down.

The average passenger vehicle produces over five tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to the EPA — which significantly contributes to air pollution. Driving an EV saves you time and money on maintenance and fueling while helping reduce harmful pollution.

Many other Redditors were thrilled to see a new EV owner enjoying their car.

""I've had the same car for 3 years. Best car I've ever had. Enjoy!"" one person shared.

""No tips! Just a congrats!!"" another Redditor wrote. ""I took mine on a European road trip this summer and it was a breeze. Such a great car!""

Polo GTI, VW’s first ever GTI EV.","VW really pulled out the stops for this year’s IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich, revealing not one but three new electric cars. We’ve already had a look at the ID. Polo (neé ID.2) and ID. Polo GTI, but the third EV is an even bigger deal. It’s the ID. Cross Concept and it previews next year’s production SUV, one with massive sales potential.

Also: VW Revives Polo Name For EV Era And Teases First Ever Electric GTI

The Cross name tells us this subcompact utility is an electric equivalent to the existing T-Cross combustion crossover, though the name is about all they have in common. The ID. Cross is one of a family of upcoming small EVs built around a new front-wheel-drive version of the MEB platform.

Other models in the family include the ID. Polo and ID. Polo GTI, both expected to hit showrooms in 2026, as well as a production version of the ID. Every1 concept shown earlier this year, which could wear the ID. Up name when it launches in 2027.

Design and Dimensions

Though it rides on virtually the same 2,601 mm (102.4 inches) wheelbase as the ID. Polo (the hatch’s WB is 1mm shorter), the 4,161 mm (163.8 inches) long ID. Cross is 108 mm (4.3 inches) longer and most obviously 58 mm (2.3 inches) taller. There’s 490 liters (17.3 cu.ft) of luggage space in the rear, plus a 25-liter (0.9 cu-ft) frunk, something no other ID EV, including the ID. Polo, has offered.

The handsome, but conservatively designed Polo also misses out on some of the Cross’s bolder and more modern design details. These include a front fascia shaped by the interplay of LED lighting elements that VW describes as “friendly,” along with three illuminated rectangles embedded in a black C-pillar, an intentional nod to both the ID. Buzz and the original Bus that inspired it.

Black plastic trims exaggerate the size of the gently flared arches, which are cut high into the bodywork, while the 21-inch wheels are wrapped in special Continental tires that carry the alloy rim’s pattern into the sidewall. It’s a clever visual flourish, though one that’s impractical, hard to see in the real world, and sure to make tire shops roll their eyes.

Relaxing Interior with Some Physical Buttons

Inside, there are clear echoes of the ID2.all concept that previewed the ID. Polo back in 2023 (VW hasn’t released ID. Polo interior pics yet). An 11-inch digital instrument cluster lies beyond a chunky, square-shaped two-spoke steering wheel and a larger, 13-inch tablet touchscreen is mounted on the top of the dashboard’s center.

Thankfully, VW has listened to criticism of its earlier cars, and a bank of hard buttons is located below, meaning you don’t have to go stabbing at virtual buttons to change the cabin temperature. There’s also a small iDrive-style rotary controller on the console.

And if you don’t want to be overwhelmed by digital information, you simply flip your smartphone so it lies face-down on the wireless charging pad. Do that that and the displays switch to ‘calm status,’ only showing essential info.

That’s not the only way the ID. Cross’s designers have tried to create a relaxing environment. Ambient lighting, fabric-covered surfaces and the Vanilla Chai (read: beige) coloring used throughout the concept’s interior are designed to calm passengers by taking cues from Parisian haute couture and high-end furniture.

For fully horizontal relaxation time, the front and rear seats fold completely flat, meaning you could sleep in the back like you would in a classic VW Bus, albeit with a fair bit less wriggle room. To ensure maximum comfort the seat backrests are finished in a material Volkswagen likens to a comfortable yoga mat.

Powertrain and Range

The German automaker has already confirmed the availability of two battery options for the Polo, but is staying tightlipped about the Cross’s battery hardware, other than revealing it can deliver a 261-mile (420 km) WLTP electric range. A single motor mounted in the nose sends 208 hp (211 PS / 155 kW) to the front wheels, slightly less than the 223 hp (226 PS / 166 kW) mustered by the ID. Polo GTI, VW’s first ever GTI EV.

Officially, the ID. Cross is just a concept, but next summer’s production SUV is going to be virtually identical. In fact, VW even makes a point of mentioning that the interior door handles, which you pull upwards, are production ready. And that should worry rival carmakers because we think VW has nailed this EV’s design in a way it totally failed to do with the ID.4 and ID.7.

US sales are yet to be confirmed, but the ID. Cross will cost from around £25k/€28k when it launches late in 2026 against electric crossovers like the Kia EV2, Toyota Urban Cruiser, Ford Puma Gen-E and Volvo EX30.

While domestic coal demand for power generation has stabilized temporarily, export markets remain volatile.
Meanwhile, AI-driven industrial reallocation is altering freight demand patterns.","The U.S. railroad sector is at a crossroads, and CSX Corporation’s recent financial struggles epitomize the broader challenges facing the industry. In the first half of 2025, CSX reported declining operating income and revenue, driven by shrinking coal demand, reduced fuel surcharges, and weaker merchandise volumes [1]. While the company has made strides in improving network efficiency, its performance underscores a systemic dilemma: the collision of legacy energy dependencies with the accelerating forces of AI-driven industrial reallocation and the global energy transition.

The Energy Transition: A Double-Edged Sword

Coal remains a critical revenue stream for CSX, yet its relevance is waning. First-half 2025 results showed coal revenue declines, mirroring broader trends as global markets shift toward renewables. According to the International Energy Agency, coal’s role in electricity generation is projected to shrink as solar and wind capacity expands, particularly in developing economies [2]. While U.S. domestic coal consumption for power generation rose slightly in 2025 due to data center growth and electric vehicle demand [3], export coal volumes face headwinds. China and India’s reduced reliance on imported thermal coal has dampened demand, directly impacting railroads like CSX, which depend on international shipments [4].

The energy transition’s paradox lies in its potential to reduce emissions while straining traditional freight models. Electrification of railroads, for instance, could cut carbon footprints and maintenance costs by 20% [5], but the upfront investment remains prohibitive. For CSX, this means balancing short-term profitability with long-term sustainability—a challenge compounded by the Trump administration’s freeze on Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy funding [6].

AI-Driven Reallocation: Efficiency Gains vs. Structural Shifts

Artificial intelligence is reshaping the railroad sector, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. CSX has invested heavily in AI since 2016, deploying tools like predictive maintenance systems, trespassing detection, and the AI assistant Chessie to enhance customer engagement [7]. These initiatives have improved on-time performance by 8–12% and reduced derailments [8]. However, such gains are incremental compared to the transformative AI strategies of peers like Union Pacific and BNSF.

Union Pacific, for example, is leveraging AI for locomotive innovation, including hybrid battery-electric engines to cut emissions [9], while BNSF uses AI-powered diagnostics to monitor wheel health and track conditions in real time [10]. These investments not only optimize operations but also position these railroads to capitalize on AI-driven freight demand reallocation. Startups and logistics platforms are using physics-inspired algorithms and agentic AI to reroute shipments dynamically, reducing delivery times by 11.7% and inventory costs by 16.3% [11]. For CSX, the gap between its AI adoption and competitors’ aggressive digital transformation efforts may exacerbate its competitive disadvantages.

Sector-Wide Pressures: Coal’s Decline and Freight Demand Volatility

The U.S. railroad industry’s reliance on coal—accounting for 35% of global rail freight volumes in 2025 [12]—is increasingly unsustainable. While domestic coal demand for power generation has stabilized temporarily, export markets remain volatile. CSX’s struggles reflect this duality: domestic thermal coal consumption rose to 371.7 million short tons in 2025 [13], but export volumes are projected to fall to 104 million short tons [14]. This dichotomy creates a precarious balance for railroads, which must navigate fluctuating demand while investing in cleaner technologies.

Meanwhile, AI-driven industrial reallocation is altering freight demand patterns. Machine learning systems are optimizing supply chains to minimize emissions and costs, with AI negotiation agents enabling real-time freight pricing adjustments [15]. For railroads, this means shifting from volume-based growth to value-added services, a transition that requires significant operational and technological agility—areas where CSX’s recent performance suggests room for improvement.

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition

CSX’s stagnant performance is not an isolated issue but a microcosm of the railroad sector’s broader struggle to adapt to decarbonization and AI-driven industrial shifts. While the company has made strides in AI adoption and infrastructure modernization, its reliance on coal and slower pace of digital transformation leave it vulnerable to sector-wide headwinds. For investors, the key question is whether CSX can accelerate its pivot toward sustainable, AI-optimized operations—or risk falling further behind peers who are redefining the future of freight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:02:16.231398

But its true impact extends well beyond incentives: OBBBA is unsettling the entire financial and insurance underpinning of the U.S. clean energy industry.

OBBBA has accelerated deadlines, with projects now required to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. It has also removed the 5% cost-based safe harbor starting September 1, 2025, meaning that only physical work counts toward eligibility. That change alone has lenders and insurers spooked, uncertain when or if returns will materialize.

Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on essential materials like steel, copper, and solar components have pushed construction costs even higher. “We’re really now seeing the impacts of what the new reality in the U.S. has meant for investor confidence,” says Meredith Annex, Head of Clean Power at BloombergNEF, after reporting that wind and solar investments plunged 36% year-on-year to $36.4 billion in H1 2025, with onshore wind collapsing 80 percent, the Financial Times reported.

At the same time, insurance is becoming a major issue. Underwriters are recalibrating risk models that now include political unpredictability. As Canaan Crouch of Jencap Specialty Insurance Services warns, “Higher insurance premiums add another cost burden to contractors and developers already grappling with reduced subsidies, higher tariffs and volatile demand.” That’s effectively redefining how projects are valued and bankrolled.

Insurers are tightening their terms in ways that directly reshape project economics. Premiums for utility-scale solar and offshore wind have climbed sharply over the past year, with underwriters increasingly carving out exclusions for mechanical failure and weather-related damage, according to Reuters. Industry brokers say some carriers have shortened policy durations from three years to one, forcing developers to renegotiate coverage annually at higher cost. In offshore wind, several European reinsurers have already reduced their U.S. exposure, leaving a smaller pool of carriers willing to underwrite billion-dollar projects and driving up rates for those that remain.

The disruption is being felt by the industry’s biggest players. Denmark’s Ørsted, once a clean-energy trailblazer, has approved a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue after its U.S. offshore wind projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, hit policy roadblocks. Construction on Revolution Wind, almost 80% complete, was halted by a federal stop-work order citing national security concerns, prompting Ørsted to sue the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the company is burning millions weekly in holding costs, and S&P Global has already downgraded its credit rating though Equinor, a 10% shareholder, has pledged up to $941 million in support.

Nor is this limited to utility-scale clean energy.

In residential solar, firms like Sunnova and Mosaic have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid uncertainty over tax credits and a decline in demand. Canary Media reported that Sunnova laid off over half its workforce (over 700 employees) before filing, citing untenable debt and market retrenchment. Mosaic, a major residential solar loan provider, also went bankrupt, pointing to macroeconomic headwinds and policy unpredictability.

These are not small casualties. Analysts predict a 50-60% reduction in residential solar demand, risking over 250,000 jobs. As Ara Agopian, CEO of Solar Insure, put it, “There’s going to be a 50 to 60 percent downturn in demand. Many of them will shut their doors as they can’t stay in business without the tax credit.” The Financial Times noted that Guggenheim’s Joe Osha underscored the long-standing difficulties.

In Sunnova’s case, a July 31, 2025 court approval allowed the sale of substantially all assets to a creditor group highlighting how even bankruptcy is being managed to mitigate fallout for homeowners.

States are also feeling the heat, with Texas, once a renewable stronghold, seeing developers cancel or delay nearly $8 billion in projects, while BloombergNEF has tallied over $22 billion in clean energy development shelved nationally, costing more than 16,000 jobs.

Beyond wind and solar, OBBBA’s implications also extend to battery and hydrogen sectors. The law phases out credits for battery manufacturing and accelerates deadlines for hydrogen projects under Section 45V. Experts at the International Council on Clean Transportation estimate U.S. battery production could fall 75 percent short of expectations by 2030, cutting into the clean energy value chain.

Banks that once offered competitive terms on project loans are now widening spreads to reflect heightened policy risk, while credit rating agencies have flagged uncertainty over future cash flows as a trigger for downgrades. Institutional investors that fueled the tax-equity boom of the past decade are becoming more selective, in some cases pausing commitments entirely until the regulatory landscape stabilizes. The result is a much smaller pipeline of available capital and steeper financing costs for developers.

What’s emerging is a clarity that OBBBA’s biggest impact may be the erosion of the industry’s financial ecosystem. Insurance premiums are climbing. Lenders are retreating or demanding new risk-adjusted returns. Developers are cannibalizing capital just to stay afloat.

Conclusion Regulatory risks in the energy sector are no longer confined to compliance failures; they encompass legislative volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the rapid evolution of sustainability mandates.","The energy sector in 2025 remains a high-stakes arena for investors, where regulatory shifts and compliance failures can swiftly disrupt market dynamics. Recent legislative actions, such as the U.S. House of Representatives’ reconciliation bill amending the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have accelerated the phase-out of critical clean energy tax credits, while cease trade orders against firms like Altima Energy Inc. and Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. underscore the fragility of regulatory compliance in this sector [1]. For investors, the imperative is clear: preparedness and strategic agility are no longer optional but essential to safeguarding returns.

The Escalating Threat of Cease Trade Orders

Cease trade orders (CTOs) have become a recurring risk for energy firms, particularly those in renewable and emerging technologies. In August 2025, Eguana Technologies Inc. saw its management cease trade order lifted by the Alberta Securities Commission after fulfilling filing requirements, but similar fates have befallen companies like A.I.S. Resources Limited, which voluntarily accepted a CTO due to insufficient funds for audit fees [3]. These cases highlight a broader trend: regulatory bodies are tightening scrutiny of financial transparency, especially for firms operating in capital-intensive, high-growth sectors like green hydrogen and battery recycling.

For investors, the implications are twofold. First, CTOs often trigger liquidity crises, as seen when Altima Energy’s failure to file financial reports led to a trading halt on the TSX Venture Exchange [1]. Second, they signal systemic risks—companies unable to meet disclosure standards may lack the governance structures to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes.

Legislative and Policy Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. House reconciliation bill exemplifies how policy shifts can reconfigure market fundamentals overnight. By accelerating the expiration of clean energy tax credits, the legislation has compressed project timelines for developers, creating a “race against the clock” to secure financing and construction permits [1]. Similarly, the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) updates for 2023–2025 have introduced compliance complexities for biofuel producers, requiring firms to balance environmental mandates with operational costs [3].

Investors must also contend with geopolitical regulatory risks. Turkey’s investigation of 66 power firms for grid non-compliance and the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s closure of a semiconductor export loophole illustrate how cross-border regulatory actions can disrupt supply chains and investor confidence [2].

Strategic Preparedness: Mitigating Risks Through Proactive Measures

To navigate these challenges, investors are adopting a multi-pronged approach:

Enhanced Due Diligence on Regulatory Filings

Monitoring regulatory filings and company announcements is now a cornerstone of risk management. For instance, Li-Cycle’s CTO was directly linked to its failure to submit periodic disclosures, a red flag for investors who might otherwise overlook operational delays [3]. Tools like real-time compliance tracking platforms and third-party due diligence services are increasingly being deployed to flag early warning signs.

Diversification Across Regulatory Environments

Diversifying geographically and sectorially helps hedge against localized regulatory shocks. For example, offshore wind developers like Ørsted and Equinor, who faced setbacks under the Trump administration’s 2025 policy overhaul, are redirecting investments to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets with more stable regulatory frameworks [2]. Similarly, utilities in wildfire-prone regions are prioritizing grid hardening and real-time monitoring to align with state-level liability mandates, reducing litigation risks [1].

Leveraging Policy Tools for Risk Mitigation

Political risk insurance (PRI) and revised force majeure clauses in contracts are becoming standard for energy projects. These instruments protect against sudden policy changes, such as the abrupt suspension of U.S. offshore wind leasing in 2025, which left developers with stranded assets [2]. Additionally, governments are incentivizing compliance through green subsidies and tax rebates, as seen in the EU’s Net-Zero Industry Act and China’s offshore wind expansion [2].

The Long-Term Outlook: Balancing Stability and Innovation

While regulatory uncertainty persists, the energy transition’s momentum remains robust. Global decarbonization trends, including advancements in offshore wind and green hydrogen, suggest that long-term investments in renewables will outpace short-term volatility. However, investors must balance near-term stability—such as returns from traditional energy assets—with strategic bets on technologies that demonstrate cost competitiveness and scalable deployment pipelines [2].

Conclusion

Regulatory risks in the energy sector are no longer confined to compliance failures; they encompass legislative volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the rapid evolution of sustainability mandates. For investors, the path forward lies in proactive monitoring, diversified portfolios, and strategic alignment with policy frameworks. As the sector navigates these crosscurrents, those who prioritize preparedness will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 17:01:56.812665

Yet, at community colleges nationwide, environmental stewardship is not just an add-on, but a fundamental thread woven into the fabric of the institution.

A sustainability master plan serves as the blueprint for this work, shaping a college’s daily functions and educational offerings. From geothermal systems heating classrooms to hands-on training for green jobs, these academic eco-advocates are dedicated to softening their environmental impact and operating costs.

This article comes from the current issue of the Community College Journal, published by the American Association of Community Colleges.

With a clear sustainability plan in place, it’s easier to track results and maintain momentum, regardless of staff turnover or competing priorities, says Michael Boyd, president of Kankakee Community College (KCC) in Illinois.

“Sustainability and renewable energy are integrated into curriculum development, budgeting and evaluation of faculty and staff,” says Boyd. “It’s been a focus throughout the history of KCC, and part of our culture.”

In its DNA

KCC is a founding member of the Illinois Green Economy Network, formed in 2008 to drive sustainable workforce growth and a clean energy economy in state. Financed by a $2.5 million grant from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the network allocates funds for curriculum development along with a handful of renewable energy projects and initiatives.

A partnership with the Illinois Community College Board, for example, supports the state’s growing electric vehicle industry through job training and technology development programs, Boyd says.

Sustainability is a core facet of life at KCC, a vision that began in the 2000s under the leadership of late president, Jerry Weber. Successor John Avendano continued this work, strengthening an eco-forward mindset further cultivated by retired electrical engineering professor Tim Wilhelm.

KCC’s environmental work is structured around three pillars: building features, on-campus sustainability and certificate completion. The college’s North Extension Center, the county’s first LEED Gold-certified building, boasts energy-efficient lighting and a white synthetic rubber roof that significantly reduces heat absorption.

KCC also offers renewable energy certificates in solar-photovoltaic, solar-thermal and wind technologies, while an associate degree in electrical engineering is designed with a career-minded sustainability focus.

Boyd embraces this mission, believing that responsibility for the planet transcends any single department at KCC. A whole-college commitment is needed to push the work ahead even beyond his tenure, he says.

“We see renewable energy and sustainability as something that’s bigger than ourselves,” Boyd says. “At other colleges, you may have a divide between operations and academic affairs. But at KCC, we have an alliance that inspires our business processes. Even little things, like everyone shutting off their lights for a couple hours, or shutting off their computers, can make a difference. It’s a great value for us, because part of our mission is to be good with our fiscal resources. We have to live that vision for ourselves.”

‘A moral imperative’

In California, Chaffey College’s 35-page sustainability master plan outlines a “triple bottom line” of social, economic and environmental responsibility led by the Green Earth Movement (GEM) committee. Comprised of staff and faculty, this environmental think tank provides campus-wide education while encouraging green practices among students and stakeholders.

“In the broadest sense, we adopted a policy of stewardship, in terms of being efficient with our resources,” says Sam Gaddie, sustainability and environmental safety officer at Chaffey. “GEM is a way to bring this information forward to administrators and communicate this work with students and the community.”

Such transparency is vital, as limited budgets sometimes push green projects aside for larger initiatives. A central aim of the GEM taskforce is to maintain the visibility of all its sustainable initiatives, Gaddie says.

“We’ve got a million competing interests (at Chaffey), and know that certain decisions have to be made,” he says. “We try and make our case that these sustainable options will save money in the long run.”

Successful projects

Despite some frustrations around resource allocation, Chaffey has much to celebrate regarding its environmental practices, Gaddie says. Per terms established by the master plan, any new construction at the college is built to state-mandated green building standards. In addition, Chaffey utilizes native plants and drought-tolerant landscaping on all three campuses.

A large-scale solar carport project spanning Chaffey’s campuses has offset over half the college’s electricity consumption. In recognition of this achievement, the college was one of a dozen two-year colleges to receive a California Community Colleges Board of Governors Energy and Sustainability Award in 2020.

Far from working in silos, the GEM committee collaborates with regional utilities and companies for Earth Day celebrations, with aims of raising awareness on critical issues. Chaffey even partners with a local shepherd on weed management, using goats to graze instead of relying on chemicals or gas-guzzling machinery.

Such partnerships are standard for a college dedicated to environmental literacy, Gaddie says.

“As an institution of higher learning, we took this on as a moral imperative,” he says. “It helps us think about the decisions we’re making, and to set the tone with the community.”

Developing an eco-mindset

Community colleges are incorporating sustainability into curriculum, extending beyond simple environmental courses to include adjacent fields. At Chaffey, statistics students analyze bell curves using an online dashboard that displays the school’s solar energy output. Enrollees in the college’s STEM pathway study heat exchangers that power an on-campus thermal energy storage tank.

“Students are analyzing data to use it for in-class projects,” says Gaddie. “They’re learning a topic and getting to see its real-world applications.”

Bronx Community College’s (BCC) eco-conscious approach stretches back 20 years, when an automotive program began incorporating electric vehicles and alternative fuels into classroom training. In 2023, BCC received a $1 million grant, funded by the New York Power Authority, to improve campus sustainability and reduce the college’s environmental impact. The award also funded a green workforce training program, providing solar and wind turbine instruction to residents and students from across the City University of New York system.

In addition, learners designed logos for campus recycling bins, an exciting opportunity to apply chosen career skills to real-world challenges, notes Elena Perez, project director of BCC’s Green Action Challenge team, which oversees the college’s sustainability efforts.

“The public can see the designs created by students,” says Perez. “It’s wonderful way to convey our message effectively.”

In May, BCC selected three students to promote campus environmental initiatives. These “green ambassadors” will partner with college groups to raise awareness on climate resilience efforts, ranging from composting bins to a joint rain garden project.

Nor is BCC’s student-centric environmental stance limited to campus, or even the borders of the United States. Last year, the college sent students to India as part of the CUNY-India Pollution Study — a three-year research program funded by the National Science Foundation focused on mapping air pollution in underserved communities.

Every aspect of this work is purposeful and seamlessly linked with the school’s broader environmental goals, says Richard Ginsberg, assistant vice president of communications and marketing. Rallying behind sustainability means living it daily. Ginsberg was pleased to find composting bins at the college’s Run the Bronx footrace, allowing participants to dispose of fruit peels after orange and banana giveaways.

“We also switched from plastic water bottles to boxed (for the race),” says Ginsberg. “It’s just a mindset on the way we do things on campus every day. The little things add up, and that mindset stays in place despite staff turnover and changing priorities.”",https://www.ccdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guth_Chaffey-Solar-Parking-cred-Chaffey-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:36.058887

Not much changed immediately for electric vehicle drivers across Canada after the federal government announced a step back from its EV policy. But many drivers fear infrastructural growth and improved public charging stations will slow in the coming years.

When Julien Kos drove to Moncton earlier this year, his plan heavily relied on charging his vehicle at a mall while getting a quick bite.

“I got there with 15 per cent and I expected to be able to just charge at the mall,” said Kos, who lives in a remote town of Back Bay, N.B., about 130 kilometres south of Fredericton. But he found several public chargers were broken.

Kos said many provincial public chargers are “unreliable,” while others chargers owned by Tesla are older and compatible with only Tesla vehicles. With the pause in the EV mandate, he feels fewer automakers would be inclined to keep investing in EVs, resulting in a slowdown in overall infrastructure growth.

“It’s definitely disappointing to see that there’s not enough infrastructure in our province, specifically,” said Kos, who bought his first Tesla EV in January. The policy shift hasn’t changed his plans to keep driving his car.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that the federal government will not implement a mandate requiring that 20 per cent of all new vehicles sold in Canada by next year be electric, while promising a 60-day review of the country’s electric-vehicle program.

The mandate was initially designed to increase until 2035, by which point all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada were to be fully electric or plug-in hybrids.

Carney said the review is aimed at finding “future flexibilities and ways to reduce costs” while government documents suggest amendments to the annual sales targets, including the 2035 goal, will be considered.

The pause likely won’t affect EV adoptions nor those who already have one, said Tracy Miersch, EV ambassador team leader for MEET Moncton, who bought her first EV four years ago.

“Where I think it might impact is the car manufacturers that haven’t really bought into the EV idea,” she said in an interview. “They might slow their development.”

MEET, or Mobile EV Education Trailer, is a program run by Plug’n Drive Canada, an organization that focuses on EV education.

Miersch said there’s a concern that government grants for improved public charging stations could be affected, but private companies could help with that gap in the existing infrastructure.

“There are enough private companies and businesses that are now seeing the advantage of having an EV charger at or near their location,” she said.

Coffee chain Tim Hortons announced last month its plans to set up EV fast chargers at 100 locations across the country by the end of 2028. The company has partnered with the charging company FLO.

“I’m not worried about the infrastructure growing,” said Angie Thomas, secretary of the board of the Electric Vehicle Association of Alberta. “But I do worry about future charging projects coming.”

Thomas said the move could hurt Canada’s chance of getting ahead of the electric curve.

“Technology is moving ahead very quickly, but we need to embrace this technology or we risk being left behind,” Thomas said.

For Alroy Brouwer, the federal government’s decision to pause the mandate doesn’t affect his decision to trade in his second vehicle for an EV when the car is at the end of its life.

“Once people start driving an EV, they’re not going back to a gas-powered car again,” said the Barrie, Ont., resident, who bought his first EV three years ago.

“You quickly realize how stupid it is to burn $20 in gas every day to get somewhere.”

But his decision heavily relies on the comfort of home-charging infrastructure.

“If you can’t charge it at home, then right now, with our infrastructure, it’s not as easy as switching over,” Brouwer said.

He said many public charging stations on southern Ontario highways tend to be unreliable and are often out of service, or can be fairly expensive to top up the car.

The mandate pause comes at a time when EVs are seeing a dip in uptake. An AutoTrader survey from April showed 42 per cent of respondents say they’re considering an EV as their next vehicle, down from 46 per cent last year. In 2022, 68 per cent said they would consider buying an EV.

EV adoption isn’t going to be linear, Kristian Aquilina, president of GM Canada, said at a conference in Vancouver on Saturday. He added the policies around EVs need to be more reflective of consumer demand, rather than a forced outcome from federal mandates.

“We would be pursuing a future whereby EV policy in this country is just a bit more reflective of the realities of consumer demand, rather than a forced outcome,” he said.

Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore.

This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough.

A Demand Surge Few Anticipated

For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected.

Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity, and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment.

Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”—now handles 70% of global internet traffic, pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need 500,000 more electricians in the next decade.

Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, with similar gains to follow.

And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records.

The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement

Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power.

The EIA projects 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace.

Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 Resource Adequacy Report warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem.

Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others told Congress bluntly in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.”

Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage

Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks.

Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions.

As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects, including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy.

Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. Homeland Security now classifies grid protection alongside nuclear and water infrastructure.

Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays

Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish.

Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress.

As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. faced delays of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion.

Even bipartisan efforts like the CIRCUIT Act—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns.

Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow.

What’s Being Done

Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes.

DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles.

In 2025, DOE launched $32 million in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in.

Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium

For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity.

Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states.

Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment.

Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management.

With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” Deloitte estimates the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit.

Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?

The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system.

Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bdbbb7a1d1e323abe0cf0a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:14.825553

Geopolitical Risks and Strategic Resilience CATL’s global expansion is a double-edged sword.
Conclusion: A Calculated Gambit CATL’s gigafactory expansion is a masterclass in strategic positioning.","The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is reshaping global industrial landscapes, and no company embodies this transformation more than Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL). As the world’s largest EV battery supplier, CATL’s aggressive expansion into Europe and Asia is not merely a bet on growth—it’s a calculated move to dominate the next era of mobility. With a 37% global market share in 2023 [1], CATL is leveraging its technological prowess, strategic partnerships, and geopolitical agility to secure a commanding position in the EV supply chain. This analysis evaluates the investment potential of CATL’s European and Asian manufacturing footprint, weighing the interplay of demand, policy tailwinds, and competitive dynamics.

Europe: A High-Stakes Bet on Localization

CATL’s European expansion is anchored by its €7.34 billion Debrecen, Hungary, gigafactory, which will produce 100 GWh annually by 2025 [2]. This facility, part of a broader €13.2 billion European investment, underscores CATL’s commitment to localizing production for key clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Daimler. The Hungarian plant’s focus on lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries—a cost-effective alternative to nickel-based cells—positions it to capitalize on Europe’s growing demand for affordable EVs. According to the European Commission, the continent’s battery cell production capacity could reach 886 GWh by 2030 [3], aligning with CATL’s ambitions to meet surging demand while circumventing EU concerns over Chinese overcapacity.

However, CATL’s European strategy is not without risks. The EU’s fragmented regulatory environment and scrutiny of foreign investment pose challenges. For instance, CATL’s joint venture with Stellantis in Spain has drawn criticism for lacking technology transfer agreements, potentially leaving Europe reliant on Chinese expertise [4]. Additionally, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and EU Green Deal Industrial Plan (GDIP) are reshaping subsidy landscapes, favoring domestic producers. CATL’s “License Royalty Service” model—outsourcing production to local partners while retaining IP—may mitigate these risks but could dilute long-term control [5].

Asia: Leveraging China’s EV Supercycle

In Asia, CATL’s dominance is underpinned by China’s EV boom, where the company supplies batteries to Tesla, Toyota, and BYD. China’s aggressive electrification policies, including tax breaks and NEV quotas, have driven EV adoption to 35% of total car sales in 2024 [6]. CATL’s innovations—such as sodium-ion batteries and high-nickel cylindrical cells—are critical to maintaining cost advantages as global pack prices fall below $50/kWh [7].

Yet, CATL faces intensifying competition from domestic rivals like BYD, whose blade battery technology is gaining traction. Internationally, LG Energy Solution and Northvolt are expanding in Europe, with LG’s Italian plant targeting 120 GWh by 2030 [8]. CATL’s LFP strategy offers a distinct edge: LFP batteries, which are 30% cheaper than NMC variants, are becoming the preferred choice for mainstream EVs [9]. This cost advantage is amplified by CATL’s vertical integration, including a planned cathode materials plant in Morocco to secure phosphate supplies for its European operations [10].

Financials and ROI: A Long-Term Play

CATL’s Q1 2025 results highlight its financial resilience: net profit surged 32.9% year-over-year to ¥14 billion ($2 billion), driven by cost reductions and a shift to high-margin technologies like sodium-ion batteries [11]. While specific break-even timelines for European gigafactories remain undisclosed, industry benchmarks suggest a 10–15-year horizon due to high capital expenditures [12]. The EU’s battery recycling market, projected to grow at 32.05% CAGR through 2030, could further enhance ROI by monetizing CATL’s LFP recycling expertise [13].

Geopolitical Risks and Strategic Resilience

CATL’s global expansion is a double-edged sword. In Europe, environmental compliance and supply chain dependencies—such as reliance on Chinese-sourced materials—pose operational risks. For example, CATL’s U.S. BESS unit was disconnected over security concerns, illustrating the fragility of cross-border partnerships [14]. Meanwhile, the EU’s push for “strategic autonomy” could impose stricter foreign investment rules, complicating CATL’s growth trajectory.

Conclusion: A Calculated Gambit

CATL’s gigafactory expansion is a masterclass in strategic positioning. By aligning with Europe’s decarbonization goals while leveraging China’s manufacturing scale, the company is hedging against regional uncertainties. However, its success hinges on navigating geopolitical tensions and outpacing rivals in innovation. For investors, CATL represents a high-conviction opportunity in the EV supply chain, albeit one requiring patience and a nuanced understanding of global policy dynamics.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:20.435843

But the new virtual power plant that the Calders are a part of can also generate and deploy electricity, like a traditional power plant.
So far, the Blatchford virtual power plant includes only about 20 townhomes completed by Landmark Homes.
Billed as Europe's largest virtual power plant, it shows the potential huge scale of such networks.
""The big thing for me is we produce power, we use our own power, we save our power and we give back power,"" she said.","When there's a local power outage, it doesn't affect Rebecca Calder's house in Edmonton's new Blatchford neighbourhood.

The Wi-Fi network, the fridge and the heat pump that heats and cools the townhouse all keep humming along, thanks to a backup battery in her basement.

""It's great,"" she said — and not just for power outages.

The battery charges from solar panels on the roof of the three-bedroom home she shares with her husband, Daniel, and five-year-old daughter, Ida. That allows the family to use stored solar power to run the dishwasher and laundry, even after the sun goes down, and to earn a credit of up to $60 per month on their electricity bill in the summer.

The solar panels and battery provide benefits not just for the Calders but for the entire electrical grid. They're designed to join forces with the solar panels and batteries of 99 other homes as part of a virtual power plant (VPP) that supplies power to the grid, similar to what a physical power plant does.

""It feels good when you can see your power going to the grid. It feels good when you see that first credit on the bill,"" said Calder, whose family moved into the net-zero home in January.

Proponents of virtual power plants say they make it possible to add more wind and solar to the grid by filling the gaps when it's not windy or sunny.

VPPs can also help stabilize the grid by matching electricity supply with demand and reduce or defer the need to spend money on building physical power plants and other electricity infrastructure, saving money for both utilities and other ratepayers.

What are virtual power plants?

Virtual power plants are networks of devices that generate, use and store energy, such as smart thermostats, electric vehicle batteries and solar panels with battery storage. By connecting and controlling them together, the energy saved, stored or released by the network eventually adds up to the scale of a physical power plant.

So far, most VPPs in Canada have been limited to networks of smart thermostats that utilities can temporarily adjust to reduce electricity demand and relieve strain on the grid.

But the new virtual power plant that the Calders are a part of can also generate and deploy electricity, like a traditional power plant.

How do they work?

In summer, solar panels on the homes of the Calders and their neighbours generate more energy than they use.

Extra solar is stored in the battery in their basement, supplied by the German company Sonnen, which also makes the software for the project. The battery is controlled by local utilities EPCOR and Solartility, two other partners in the project.

Geoff Ferrell, senior vice-president of virtual power plants at Sonnen, said either utility can draw from the batteries of the VPP if they need to stabilize the local grid or when the price of electricity is high, making it advantageous for the utility to sell to the wholesale market.

The homeowner can monitor what's happening but can't control it.

Calder said sometimes when she's bored, she'll check the mobile app that tells her how much power is being produced, stored and returned to the grid. She likes the simplicity for homeowners.

""We don't need to think about it,"" she said.

Calder said she feels her family is doing their part to solve the climate crisis by generating renewable energy. ""It's such a small thing to do, but it's helping.""

On a typical day, she said, the software stops the battery from being drained below 30 per cent, so her family will always have backup power in case of an outage.

Benefits for the grid

Brent Harris is vice-chair of Decentralised Energy Canada, an industry group dedicated to the development of distributed energy technology, such as district heating, microgrids and virtual power plants. Aside from providing benefits for individual customers, he said, VPPs can help solve another big problem: the skyrocketing demand for electricity.

""People are adopting electric vehicles. People are switching from gas to electricity and heat pumps,"" Harris said, ""at the same time as you're seeing all these data centres coming on.""

Reports from the International Energy Agency and the Canadian Climate Institute found Canada would need to double or triple its electrical grid capacity by 2050 to reach its net-zero emissions goal.

That would require costly upgrades to the entire grid, from transformers to substations to distribution lines.

WATCH | How to go green and build a net-zero dream home:

Harris said generating power close to where it's consumed is another option.

""We need to get more out of the grid that we already have,"" he said. ""If we can put these smart assets out there, actually we don't need to upgrade those lines for decades into the future.""

Harris is also the founder and chief operating officer of Calgary-based Eguana Technologies Inc., a home battery storage provider that is building a one megawatt virtual power plant with B.C. Hydro. The utility is offering batteries for free to 200 homes where the local grid would otherwise need capacity upgrades to ensure reliability.

As with the Blatchford project, the homeowner will get backup power from the batteries, but the utility will control them. B.C. Hydro can charge the batteries when demand is low. During peak times, it can disconnect them from the grid and get the homeowners to rely on the battery, reducing demand on the local grid.

Room to grow?

So far, the Blatchford virtual power plant includes only about 20 townhomes completed by Landmark Homes. But by the end of 2026, the development is expected to have 100 homes whose solar panels and batteries will be able to store up to two megawatt hours of power and deploy nearly half a megawatt as needed.

Ferrell, the VP at Sonnen, said his company's first Canadian project is just a demonstration, but he hopes it will pave the way for bigger ones.

In the United States, one of Sonnen's partners, Rocky Mountain Power, now has a growing VPP of 8,000 batteries that store up to 114 MWh and can supply 39 MW daily to the grid — similar in scale to Capital Power's 130-hectare solar farm, with 110,000 solar panels, in Strathmore, Alta.

That's still tiny compared with a 12 GW plant run by Oslo-based Statkraft that comprises more than 1,400 wind and solar installations in Germany. Billed as Europe's largest virtual power plant, it shows the potential huge scale of such networks.

WATCH | Taking on power outages with a giant battery in your home:

Kelly Tallas, co-founder and CEO of Calgary-based Solartility Group, said some countries in Europe have really implemented this kind of technology well.

So far in Canada, a hurdle to larger-scale projects is varying regulations among provinces, and most are designed to allow large generators to sell to the grid — not small, distributed energy sources. But Tallas said Alberta has started to allow ""micro"" generators, such as individual homes, to sell power to the grid through aggregators like Solartility. Harris, of Eguana Technologies, said there's also interest in this technology in British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia.

Meanwhile, Calder said she's really happy with her system and would ""definitely recommend"" something similar to other families.

""The big thing for me is we produce power, we use our own power, we save our power and we give back power,"" she said. ""That is fantastic.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dL1cyIaEKiGWaS9Z3YhGhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/a075c09765d14084f3b5ccf7830a97e2,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:53.979234

And the ILO estimates that the green economy could create at least 3.3 million jobs across the continent by 2030.
Incentives for small-scale solar, vital for clean energy access and SME job creation, are missing, but the groundwork for a more inclusive green economy is being laid.
In Kenya, where the informal sector drives over 80% of employment, most green skills programmes still target the formal economy.","Climate High-Level Champion for COP29, Nigar Apadarai, calls for urgent alignment between youth skills, SME growth and climate ambition.

Across Africa, small businesses are already delivering climate solutions. They power homes, grow food, repair machinery, and manage waste. These are the kinds of enterprises that keep economies running; mostly informal, often climate-smart by necessity, and critical to everyday life. But they remain largely invisible in the ecosystem of climate policies, investment flows, and skills development required to shape the green economy.

At the same time, millions of young people are being trained for jobs that don’t yet exist. Across the continent, green skills programmes are preparing graduates for formal careers in sectors like green hydrogen or utility-scale renewables. These industries are vital to long-term climate goals, but in many countries, they are not yet creating employment at scale. Meanwhile, the businesses already hiring in climate-relevant sectors lack the support to grow.

The old saying that it is better to teach people to fish than to give them a fish has new relevance: the skills we teach will determine whether young people can seize the opportunities of a changing economy. The good news is that new delivery models — powered by the internet — mean skills can be rolled out faster and more affordably.

This week, as governments, investors and campaigners gather in Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit, that disconnect is in sharp focus. The transition cannot succeed unless it creates jobs and livelihoods.

Each year, up to 12 million young Africans enter the workforce, yet only 3 million formal jobs are created, according to the Africa Development Bank. At the same time, more than 72 million young people are not in education, employment or training, the ILO reports, while many others are stuck in training pathways that don’t match employer demand. The result is a green economy that looks viable on paper, but remains disconnected from the realities of Africa’s labour markets.

The potential is there. SMEs already generate up to 80% of employment in many African economies, according to the International Finance Corporation. And the ILO estimates that the green economy could create at least 3.3 million jobs across the continent by 2030. But that will only happen if market conditions improve and, crucially, if the systems that shape climate delivery, enterprise growth, and skills development are aligned.

Right now, they are not. Climate and economic planning remain siloed; policy frameworks often prioritie large-scale industries and multilateral investment; skills systems are designed without meaningful employer input; and access to finance remains limited, particularly for small businesses operating in informal or decentralised sectors.

Positively, in July, Liberia launched Africa’s first Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Bank, supported by the African Development Bank, to tackle youth unemployment. It aims to finance 30,000 youth-led businesses, create 120,000 jobs, and unlock $500m in lending – with nearly half expected in the green economy.

In South Africa, the Just Transition Pathways study maps what a net zero economy needs – including 6-12 gigawatts of new renewables each year. That evidence base helped shape the Just Energy Transition Skills for Employment programme, which links training with real market demand and supports SME participation in sectors like solar and green hydrogen. Incentives for small-scale solar, vital for clean energy access and SME job creation, are missing, but the groundwork for a more inclusive green economy is being laid.

Elsewhere, momentum is building but is uneven. In Kenya, where the informal sector drives over 80% of employment, most green skills programmes still target the formal economy. In Ghana and Nigeria, renewable energy SMEs face financing barriers even as demand grows. Modular, work-integrated training, which allows young people to earn while they learn, is gaining traction as a way to scale both skills and opportunities, but progress must accelerate.

That’s why we need to refocus on delivery. First, by recognising SMEs as central to climate action and job creation. That means integrating them into national climate planning and removing policy barriers.

Second, by tying training to enterprise demand. Modular, job-embedded skills programmes, delivered through technical colleges and community-based providers, can help bridge the gap between training and employment. But they must be designed with employers, not just by administrators.

Third, by broadening the focus of climate finance. While large-scale projects remain essential, decentralised solutions and SME-led delivery offer faster returns in terms of both impact and employment. Investments in platforms, capacity-building, and supportive infrastructure are urgently needed.

This is the approach we are taking through the Climate-Proofing SMEs campaign, launched under my mandate as Climate High-Level Champion for COP29. So far it has engaged more than 45 collaborators and reached nearly 90 million SMEs in more than 100 countries. The campaign focuses on three priorities: helping large businesses strengthen climate-resilient supply chains by supporting SMEs to adopt climate action; mobilising finance from development banks, commercial leaders, and investors for SMEs in emerging economies; and equipping SMEs with practical tools to help them embed climate action into their operations.

Africa’s young people have the talent to lead the green economy. But they cannot do it alone. It’s time to build systems that align skills, finance and policy with the enterprises creating jobs today.

The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has unveiled its first public EV battery-swapping station, offering an alternative to traditional charging that could make electric vehicle ownership easier, faster, and more affordable than ever.

The station, first launched at Bescom's KR Circle office, allows EV user to replace their depleted batteries with fully charged ones in just two minutes, according to the Deccan Herald. This pit stop-style station is as fast as grabbing a cup of coffee, unlike traditional charging, which takes a lot of time.

""This battery-swapping centre is a significant milestone in delivering fast, reliable, and accessible EV services to users in Bengaluru,"" said Dr. N. Shivashankar, managing director of Bescom. The project is a collaboration with IndoFast Energy, which already operates more than 250 swapping centres across India.

This innovation is just the beginning. Bescom has also announced plans to set up 20 additional stations across the city in the coming months.

This impressive innovation is not without its concerns. Many who are sceptical of EVs and their positive effects on the environment often point to the significant energy and resources that go into creating an EV battery.

While it's true that manufacturing an EV battery requires considerable energy and raw materials, this is only part of the story. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, EVs powered by clean energy dramatically reduce the release of polluting gases compared to gas-powered cars.

It is unclear at this time exactly how the Bescom battery replacement stages work on a procedural level. However, it seems as though they remove the battery, replace it with a charged one, and charge the removed battery themselves for a future battery swap. This is a great way to extend battery lifespans and enable reuse cycles.

Pairing EV ownership with home solar takes these advantages even further. Charging your vehicle with clean, self-generated solar power can slash fuel costs dramatically while cutting reliance on the grid. For drivers considering the switch, EnergySage offers a free tool to compare local installers to get the best price and value possible.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bescom-battery-swapping-stationimage-rectJ6pW9SwT6CjFh.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 13:03:58.166813

From real estate and electric mobility to corporate transportation and tax advisory services, the impact of these changes is expected to be wide-ranging.

In the real estate sector, the reduction of GST on key construction materials like cement and steel is being viewed as a major boost.

Snehdeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman of Bhartiya Group, said, 'The reduction of GST on cement, steel and related construction materials is a timely and much-needed boost for the real estate sector. Lower input costs will allow developers to invest more in superior design, modern amenities, and sustainable practices, while ensuring greater affordability for homebuyers.'

'Corporate real estate too will benefit from improved cost efficiencies, making office and commercial projects more attractive for businesses and investors,' he added.

The reforms also address the corporate transport ecosystem, with a sharp cut in GST on commercial vehicles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. This is expected to enhance the viability of vehicle ownership for driver-partners and improve the scalability of corporate commute programs.

Sriram Kannan, Founder & CEO of Routematic, said, 'The GST 2.0 reforms will significantly transform the corporate commute ecosystem in which Routematic operates. By reducing GST on commercial vehicles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, more driver-partners will find it viable to purchase ICE vehicles at lower EMIs, boosting their earnings and livelihood security.'

In the electric vehicle (EV) space, keeping all EVs--across segments--within the 5% GST slab without cess is being viewed as a progressive, market-shaping move.

From a tax and regulatory standpoint, the three-rate GST structure and process simplifications are being hailed as a long-awaited reform.

Subroto Bose, Partner, ASA & Associates, said, 'The recommendations on tax rate changes by the GST Council will have a huge positive impact on consumption and boost production.'

'The 3-rate slab structure brings much-needed clarity, especially to foreign investors interested in the India growth story.

We’re not living in a natural outcome of human needs and behavior. The built environment as we know it—buildings and the spaces between—does direct damage to our minds. Land use planning has had devastating impacts on Americans: economically, socially, and culturally. But I’m not a doomer and I know these things are fixable. Not overnight reversible, but certainly fixable.

Copycat plans

Typical land use rules are written, updated, and enforced at the local government level. But as you might expect, agencies copied each other over the years because why wouldn’t they. Years ago, when I learned some photography techniques that were new to me, I made cheat sheets for other photographers. Much of what I’ve learned as an adult (podcasting, publishing, public speaking, etc.) has been taught by generous people who themselves had learned tips and tricks. So of course public agencies copied each other with their rule-making. “That worked for a similar river city? Let’s try it here.”

Planning departments at city and county levels weren’t setting out to guide development in a way that would purposefully harm people. Quite the opposite.

If a new Sears distribution center was coming to town, they’d want to map out a plan to accommodate all the new employees and subsequent traffic. In the middle of the 20th century, planners were still very much concerned about separating dirty and/or dangerous land uses from residential areas. The result was that all across the country, local development rules required or incentivized development patterns that spread everyone and everything across the landscape.

A work zone, school zone, shopping zone, entertainment zone, and a sleep zone were established. And then each major category started getting more prescriptive subcategories. “Residential” morphed into single-family, multi-family (apartments), and condos. But wait, there’s more! Residential land uses started to be regulated by local governments according to lot size: garden apartments, planned unit developments, and subdivisions were each given rules. Residential was also regulated by the type of people living in a place: public housing, group dwellings, age-restricted dwelling, renters, and owners.

Local regulations created (and continue to create) sprawl in cities, not just the suburbs.

The traffic factor

Land use planning requires traffic engineering analysis, a process prioritizing speedy car movement above all else. Wider roads and intersections are not just suggested but required with the express goal to move vehicular traffic from zone to zone as quickly as possible. This has been going on for nearly 100 years without taking a foot off the brake.

The obvious outcome of modern land use planning is that Americans drive everywhere all the time. Not just work commutes, but all the errands before, during, and after work. Half of our car trips are less than a few miles long. A quarter are less than one mile. Less than a mile in a car by ourselves.

The mental health connection

Life in a single-occupant vehicle has its perks, like singing along to music or listening to podcasts uninterrupted. It also has its pains, like separation from other humans and mental deterioration.

Loneliness is a significant variable affecting depression. It’s a predisposing factor. Cigna conducted a study of 20,000 Americans, and reported a jaw-dropping finding: nearly half of adults sometimes or always feel alone. 40% said their relationships aren’t meaningful and they feel isolated.

Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. She says the health risks of missing out on social connection is like smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Worse yet, there’s a causal relationship between social isolation and suicide. Conversely, having a crew (“social support” in doctor jargon) has a protective effect against suicide. For every suicidal death, another 20 people attempted suicide.

The takeaway

So what do you do with all this heavy information?

First, remember that the built environment is deliberately planned for us to drive in cars from zone to zone. Planners aren’t trying to destroy our minds, but the built environment increases anxiety, depression, isolation, loneliness, and suicide.

Second, understand the land use catastrophes are reversible. Compact development won’t be legalized overnight, but reform can come as quickly as local leaders are willing. Walk-friendly, bike-friendly, transit-friendly places are good medicine, and they’re made possible at the local level.

Third, and most important of all, know that things can get better in the end. America’s built environment does not fit who we are as humans, but we can turn this around with something as boring as reforming land use planning. Start by legalizing healthy infrastructure—a variety of land uses within walking distance of homes and streets designed for safe walking and cycling.

GM’s sudden shift comes as it prepares for what it calls “irrational” EV discounts to expire at the end of September.

GM cuts EV production as drastic discounts expire

GM sold over 21,000 electric vehicles in August, the most it has ever sold in a single month. Although that’s nearly double the 10,671 crosstown rival Ford sold last month, it apparently isn’t enough.

In a memo sent to employees, GM announced plans to reduce output at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant. A source close to the matter confirmed the news to Reuters, claiming GM will halt production of two Cadillac EVs, starting in December.

The Cadillac Lyriq and larger Vistiq, both of which are built at the facility, will see significantly less output during the first five months of 2026.

According to the source, GM plans to suspend one of its two shifts at the facility, resulting in layoffs for workers on the second shift.

In what could be even bigger news, the source said GM is delaying the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant outside of Kansas City “indefinitely,” where the new Chevy Bolt EV is scheduled to enter production later this year.

GM said it was “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

After reporting August sales numbers, the company said it expects to see strong EV demand in September, but after the $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of the month, it expects a slowdown in the fourth quarter.

“We are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts,” GM said. Although it anticipates a smaller EV market, GM still believes it can grow its market share.

he news comes after GM announced last week that it plans to slow production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit.

Through the first eight months of the year, GM remains the second-best-selling EV maker, behind Tesla. The Chevy Equinox EV, or “America’s most affordable 315+ range EV,” is expected to be the third most popular EV in the US in 2025, trailing only the Tesla Model Y and Model 3.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GM-EV.webp,N,,2025-09-07 12:08:24.459750

Perched majestically on the Blue Nile River, this colossal dam promises to be a beacon of progress, development, and regional integration—provided it is managed with wisdom, foresight, and cooperation. For Ethiopia, the GERD represents not just a source of clean energy but a foundational pillar for economic growth and poverty alleviation. For the surrounding region, it offers unprecedented opportunities for stability, development, and shared prosperity. Yet, these immense benefits hinge critically on Ethiopia’s ability and willingness to harness the dam with judicious planning and equitable partnerships.

First and foremost, the GERD is poised to revolutionize Ethiopia’s energy sector. With an installed capacity exceeding 6,000 megawatts, it is set to double the nation’s current electricity production, dramatically expanding access to power for millions of Ethiopians who have hitherto lived without reliable electricity. Access to electricity is a cornerstone of modern development—it transforms education, healthcare, industry, and business. The dam’s energy output will catalyze industrialization, enabling Ethiopia to move beyond a primarily agrarian economy to a more diversified, manufacturing-led growth path. This in turn will create jobs, raise incomes, and expand the tax base that funds social services.

Moreover, the GERD’s capacity to deliver clean hydropower aligns perfectly with global imperatives to combat climate change. Ethiopia’s commitment to renewable energy advances a sustainable development model that mitigates reliance on fossil fuels while addressing its own environmental vulnerabilities. This strategic positioning could also attract climate-friendly investments and green finance, further accelerating national development.

Regionally, the GERD offers an opportunity to redefine water resource management on the Nile Basin. Historically, the Nile waters have been a source of tension among Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, owing to complex colonial-era treaties and competing downstream needs. If managed transparently and collaboratively, the dam could shift these dynamics from conflict to cooperation. The regulated flow of water from the dam can reduce devastating floods downstream, provide reliable irrigation support to boost agricultural productivity, and ensure water availability during periods of drought. Sudan, for example, stands to benefit from reduced flood damage and improved electricity imports, creating incentives for constructive partnerships.

Equitable sharing of the GERD’s benefits, however, requires trust-building and clear frameworks for water management. Mechanisms that guarantee transparent data sharing on dam operations, flow rates, and reservoir levels will prove essential. Robust regional agreements must balance Ethiopia’s sovereign right to develop its resources with downstream states’ legitimate water needs. This spirit of cooperation could serve as a blueprint for transboundary water governance across Africa, fostering peace and shared prosperity.

The hydropower generated by GERD also has the potential to stimulate power trade across the Horn of Africa and beyond. Regional power pools can optimize electricity generation and distribution, stabilizing supply and lowering costs. For instance, surplus power from Ethiopia could be exported to energy-deficient neighbors, strengthening economic ties and building interdependence that undergirds political stability. Ambitious cross-border infrastructure projects — power lines, substations, and transmission corridors — will be crucial complements to GERD’s success.

Despite its promise, the dam is not without challenges that require prudent management. Environmental considerations near and around the reservoir must be carefully addressed to prevent negative ecological impacts. Resettlement of affected communities should be conducted with fairness and transparency to avoid social grievances. Furthermore, Ethiopia must invest substantially in its national electricity grid and distribution systems to maximize the dam’s benefits internally.

Financial sustainability is another key facet. While much of the initial funding has come from Ethiopian citizens and institutions, continued investment in maintenance and infrastructure is essential for long-term operation. Harnessing revenues from electricity sales to reinvest in infrastructure and community development will be fundamental.

Importantly, the GERD’s potential will only be fully realized if Ethiopia embraces inclusive governance and strategic planning. National-level policies must ensure that the dam’s benefits extend beyond urban centers to rural, underserved populations. Proactive capacity building in technical, managerial, and regulatory domains will optimize dam operations and water use efficiency.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam encapsulates the aspirations of a nation and a region for sustainable growth, energy security, and shared prosperity. It is a powerful symbol of how major infrastructure projects, when wisely stewarded, can unlock national potential and forge regional solidarity. By prioritizing transparent governance, regional cooperation, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development, Ethiopia can lead a transformative pathway for the Horn of Africa. The GERD is not just a dam — it is the cornerstone of a new era, the renaissance of Ethiopia and a hopeful testament to Africa’s ability to rise and thrive in the 21st century. The task ahead is immense, but so too are the rewards for Ethiopians and their neighbors if the journey is navigated with wisdom and unity.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Editorial.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:10.483333

Still, manufacturers hope to make EV batteries even better through faster charging and longer lifespans.

A Norwegian University of Science and Technology research team may have found the key to doing just that by creating a new life-extending coating for lithium-sulfur batteries, reported Interesting Engineering.

Li-S batteries are the gold standard for EVs. They can charge faster and are generally safer than lithium-ion batteries.

However, because of the consistent movement of particles inside operating Li-S batteries, they wear out fast. That's a big problem for EV manufacturers prioritizing long-lasting batteries.

To fix this, the NTNU team developed and patented a coating that can potentially extend their lifespan by up to five times. By adding the coating to the battery's separator, which sits between its electrodes, the separator becomes a filter to reduce damage from chemicals moving within the battery.

The longer lifespan can translate to a lighter battery because its cells can store more energy without wearing out as quickly. This higher energy density requires fewer cells within the battery, resulting in a lighter weight.

According to Interesting Engineering, that could make a typical 800-volt EV battery about 440 pounds lighter. Lighter EVs have numerous benefits, including better handling, less tire wear, and extended battery range.

The research team believes this technology could work for other applications, too, such as amplifying the ability of batteries to store excess energy generated from home solar panels.

""The goal is to scale up the technology and license it to an industrial partner so that it can be used in everything from electric cars to storage of green energy,"" said Kristina Nydal, business developer at NTNU's Technology Transfer Office, per IE.

That means that if you use solar panels to charge your EV at home, you may get to eventually double-dip the benefits of this new technology if and when it goes mainstream.

This editorial was authored by Tony Dearing, director of news operations.

You open your electric bill one month, and it’s $66. You think, OK, not bad. But the very next month, that cost has skyrocketed to $340.

Yikes!!!!!

There’s nothing like electricity to put the shock in sticker shock.

Those numbers are no exaggeration. To the dollar, that’s the 415% increase our reporter Katie Kausch saw in her July bill from JCP&L. She cited her own experience in an article asking New Jerseyans what they think about the staggering jump in electrical costs. Spoiler alert: They’re mad as hell.

So angry, in fact, that this issue may decide the election for governor, depending on who voters decide to blame.

If you’re looking for a culprit, you’ve got so many options.

The easiest target is PJM Interconnection, a regional organization that manages the power grid across the East Coast, including New Jersey, and plays a key role in setting wholesale prices for electricity.

PJM plodded along in obscurity for decades, setting electrical prices through an annual “capacity” auction.

Then came the 2024 auction, and the lid blew off.

Faced with voracious demand for electricity and a declining supply, the cost of securing a reliable supply of electricity across the region spiked to $14.7 billion, compared to $2.2 billion the previous year. That staggering cost is now being passed on to you as a consumer.

PJM says it’s just responding to market realities, and while it is by no means blameless, there are bigger players to be fingered here.

Tom Martello, our sage political columnist, recently called out the “two biggest elephants in the room” — Gov. Phil Murphy and President Donald Trump. Regardless of your political leanings, there’s blame to heap on either.

Here’s what it boils down to. Our traditional sources of electrical energy — such as coal and nuclear — are on the wane. One of our three nuclear plants shuttered in 2018, and New Jersey’s last remaining coal-burning power plants shut down in the early 2020s.

We need new ways to generate our own electricity, and it’s not happening nearly fast enough, leaving us overly reliant on power from elsewhere. We now know how cruel the cost of that can be.

Critics blame Murphy for staking New Jersey’s future too heavily on massive wind turbines proposed off the Jersey Shore, and then failing to deliver on that promise. His vision of N.J. as a center of wind energy tanked two years ago the Danish company Ørsted canceled its Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects due to inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain issues.

Then came Trump, who loathes clean energy projects like “windmills,” as he calls them. On his first day in office, he issued a memorandum designed to stall off-shore wind projects.

Trump has since removed federal subsidies for wind and solar, and as recently as last month, halted work on a wind farm nearing completion off the coast of Rhode Island.

Neither Murphy nor Trump is on the ballot in November, but their specter hangs over both candidates running for governor.

The Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli, is endorsed by Trump but finds himself doing a “delicate dance” as he deals with the unpopularity of Trump’s policies on Medicaid and immigration here in New Jersey.

Meanwhile, the Democratic hopeful, Mikie Sherrill, must distance herself from Murphy, whose popularity continues to decline by the day as he approaches the end of his second term.

Who will voters choose to punish this fall for the outrageous cost of electricity?

That’s the wrong question. What voters should ask themselves instead is, which candidate’s policies will give New Jersey the best chance of lowering electrical costs in the near future?

Because this problem has become so complex and intractable, you could be facing higher and higher electric bills for years to come.

We believe the best opportunity for lower electrical costs sooner lies in clean, renewable energy sources.

Maybe not wind turbines — despite New Jersey’s wind resources like its enviable sea breeze and proximity to the jet stream. Between Murphy’s failure to deliver and Trump’s antipathy, it would be hard to revive the momentum for offshore wind farms. And public support for that has been ebbing here in New Jersey anyway.

A Stockton poll last fall showed a narrow majority of New Jerseyans support offshore wind turbines, well down from the whopping 80% who favored wind power in 2019. And while only 26% strongly reject this idea, the opposition here is vocal and well-organized.

But other clean energy options, including solar and batteries, remain both viable and popular in the Garden State. In that same poll, a comfortable majority of state residents preferred renewable energy over fossil fuels, compared to the 37% who said fossil fuels are the better choice for increasing our energy supply.

Current state policy favors renewable energy, and now would be the wrong time to turn our back on that option. Other choices, be they fossil fuels or nuclear power, come with their own issues. And new plants powered by these sources can take anywhere from four years to a decade to get up and running.

Customers in New Jersey need relief from the high cost of electricity sooner than that. Solutions like solar and battery are less expensive and can typically be brought into production in a couple of years.

And that should be New Jersey’s choice. We don’t want our options dictated by climate deniers or others whose attitudes about energy are as fossilized and the fuels they favor. We need to chart our own course here.

If you want to know where the gubernatorial candidates stand on energy policy, you can get a detailed look by using our NJ Elections Chat tool on NJ.com. The at-a-glance answer is:

Ciattarelli wants to ban offshore wind, overhaul the state’s energy strategy and increase natural gas generation, which Murphy cut back on.

Sherrill wants to increase spending on solar and nuclear energy, modernize the natural gas infrastructure and vows a ban on any increase in the price of electricity next year.

But we encourage you to go deeper, and educate yourself on how each candidate proposes to approach this important pocketbook issue.

While we favor clean energy options, we understand that natural gas figures prominently in our current and future energy portfolio, and even those are only part of the answer on a public policy issue this complex and vexing.

More transparency and accountability are needed in the way PJM sets wholesale rates and around its epically dysfunctional permit process for getting new supplies of energy connected to the power grid.

And yes, the other elephant in the room is the proliferation of AI data centers that are sucking up massive amounts of electricity, which in turn drives up electrical cost that we now are paying through the nose for. We’ll take on these concerns in future editorials.

But in terms of energy policy, the future is now.

In this political season, electricity has become a lightning-rod issue. The choices that an angry electorate make in November will define where our power comes from and what it costs for years to come.

Clean, renewable energy is cheaper and could give us relief sooner. Why would New Jersey turn its back on that now when we need it more than ever?

These innovations could help communities move away from pollution-heavy power sources and create jobs in emerging energy sectors.","American researchers have found a way to turn atomic waste materials into tritium, a necessary fuel for fusion reactors, reported Interesting Engineering.

This technology solves a pressing problem: America is sitting on thousands of tons of atomic waste from decades of nuclear power generation, but it must import all its tritium, a hydrogen isotope needed for fusion energy.

""Right now, the value of commercial tritium is about $15 million per pound [$33 million per kilogram], and the U.S. doesn't have any domestic capability to create it,"" explained Terence Tarnowsky, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, per IE.

The new technology works by directing particle beams at stored atomic waste. When atoms break apart, they create neutrons that eventually form tritium through a chain of reactions.

Unlike traditional reactors, workers can activate or deactivate the process as needed, which makes the process safer.

Computer simulations indicate a single reactor that consumes 1 billion watts could generate roughly 4.4 pounds of tritium each year. That's more than 10 times what comparable fusion systems might create.

Fusion power combines deuterium and tritium atoms to create energy, just like the process that powers stars. While deuterium exists in abundance in seawater, tritium is scarce. Canada's reactors currently produce most of the world's supply, and Earth's total inventory sits at just 55 pounds.

Nuclear power could help us meet our energy needs, but in its current state, it presents obstacles.

On one hand, fusion reactors could generate huge amounts of electricity with minimal radioactive by-products. Compare this to today's fission plants, which leave behind dangerous materials that need millennia of storage.

On the other hand, nuclear technology hurdles include high costs, safety concerns, and public skepticism about past accidents.

This recycling approach addresses the foremost concern by turning a costly burden into valuable fuel. Instead of paying billions to store radioactive materials for thousands of years, facilities could convert waste into tritium worth millions per pound while powering future clean energy systems.

If you support the advancement of clean energy solutions, consider contacting your representatives to discuss funding for fusion research and waste recycling technologies. These innovations could help communities move away from pollution-heavy power sources and create jobs in emerging energy sectors.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tritiumimage-recrKQqxFsC2NS0r4.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 13:03:53.584094

Xiaomi's YU7 reportedly undercuts the Model Y on price while offering similar features.
Increased EV competition accelerates the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, cutting pollution faster.
""The YU7 will outsell the Model Y because they have more tech and are priced lower to undercut the competition.","The world's best-selling electric vehicle has some competition. This month in China, Xiaomi unveiled its new YU7 electric SUV, positioned squarely against the Model Y with a lower price tag, competitive tech integrations, sleek, sporty design, and vibrant colors. Tesla's foothold at the top of the EV market is being seriously challenged — and consumers should pay attention.

""In China, the Model Y is already feeling the impact of Xiaomi's YU7,"" reported Electrek.

Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun is not mincing words when it comes to his goal for the company. Xiaomi ""has set a goal for the YU7 to outsell the Tesla Model Y, the best-selling electric premium SUV, in China,"" reported Electrek in June.

As YU7 orders skyrocket, Model Y purchases are falling. This mimics the performance of Xiaomi's first EV, which is comparable to the Model 3 and has outsold its Tesla counterpart since its release.

For buyers, this competition could be a win. Xiaomi's YU7 reportedly undercuts the Model Y on price while offering similar features. That kind of innovation forces Tesla to either drive down costs or significantly improve quality for customers worldwide. Greater choice at more competitive prices is exactly what EV shoppers want, especially in a time when affordability is a major barrier to widespread EV adoption.

Increased EV competition accelerates the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, cutting pollution faster. Increased production also requires more and more batteries and mineral mining, but the mining needed for the clean energy transition is a fraction of what is done annually for the oil industry.

Ultimately, Tesla's battle with Xiaomi signals a changing EV landscape. Consumers are hungry for a growing market, and China offers one of the most competitive car markets in the world.

""There are numerous cars coming out of the woodwork there regularly,"" wrote one commenter. ""The YU7 will outsell the Model Y because they have more tech and are priced lower to undercut the competition. This is what all competitors in China have to deal with, not just Tesla. It will be interesting to see who is still selling cars in China in a few years.""

""For the last 5 years, the American automaker enjoyed some dominance in the Chinese market, but now local companies have caught up and Xiaomi is one of the best examples,"" said Electrek.

""Well, that was to be expected. Tesla desperately needs a brand new model. The competition is moving very fast. And not just in China,"" said another commenter.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-recZxIKj1bvwC32N7.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:08:45.540867

A Case Study in Short-Termism Politicizing projects like Revolution Wind serves no one’s long-term interests.
Conclusion In the end, the decision to halt Revolution Wind is a case study in how political short-termism can sabotage economic rationality.","The abrupt halt of Ørsted’s Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island has become one of the most striking examples yet of political interference derailing sound economic logic. This was not a struggling venture or a risky experimental bet. It was a nearly complete, multi-billion-dollar project designed to deliver clean power to more than 350,000 households. Eighty percent of the turbines were already in place, the investment had largely been sunk, and the project had a clear pathway to profitability. Yet the U.S. government ordered a stop, citing vague national security concerns. The decision has rattled markets, hammered Ørsted’s stock, and left observers questioning how reliable the American policy environment is for large-scale energy investments.

Economic Sense, Political Nonsense

For Ørsted, the project represented both a cornerstone of its U.S. ambitions and a test case for its ability to scale offshore wind in one of the world’s most important energy markets. For the United States, Revolution Wind was more than a power plant, it was a strategic infrastructure project. It promised to strengthen grid reliability in New England, diversify the regional energy mix, and provide a secure, local source of electricity at competitive prices. Jobs were created, supply chains were mobilized, and construction was already transforming the landscape. In every respect, the economics of the project made sense not just for Ørsted and its partners, but also for the communities and consumers who stood to benefit from it.

Signals to Investors

The logic of halting such a project is difficult to reconcile. At a time when global capital is increasingly cautious about deploying billions into long-term infrastructure, the United States had successfully attracted one of the world’s leading offshore wind developers. Years of regulatory approvals had been navigated, financing secured, and state-level political support firmly in place. To pull the plug so late in the process, with billions already spent and the project nearly ready to deliver power, sends a chilling signal to investors: no matter how advanced a project may be, no matter how rigorous the permitting process, politics can still override economics at the final stage.

Offshore Wind Is No Gamble

This is particularly damaging because offshore wind is not a fringe technology. In Europe, it is already a backbone of the energy system, delivering reliable power at scale. Costs have fallen sharply over the past decade, making it one of the most competitive forms of renewable generation. Revolution Wind was structured with long-term power purchase agreements, providing predictable revenue and stable returns. Its role in stabilizing the New England grid had been recognized by regional operators. By almost any measure, this was exactly the type of project that energy economists point to when they talk about the viability of renewables.

Ørsted’s Losses, America’s Losses

The consequences for Ørsted have been severe. Already under pressure from rising global costs and earlier project delays, the company saw its market value tumble to historic lows after the halt was announced. Its ability to raise new capital, including an emergency injection to stabilize its balance sheet, has been thrown into question. For a company once held up as a global leader in the energy transition, the setback is dramatic, threatening to undermine its broader U.S. growth strategy.

A Chill Across the Market

Yet the impact extends far beyond a single company. For the United States, halting Revolution Wind represents a lost opportunity to reinforce energy security with a domestic, low-carbon resource. Instead, New England will remain more reliant on natural gas imports and on an aging grid that is increasingly strained by extreme weather events. Consumers are likely to face higher costs and greater volatility as a result. And perhaps most significantly, the decision undermines America’s credibility as a destination for energy investment. If even projects that are 80 percent complete can be stopped on political whim, why would any global developer commit billions to the next offshore wind farm, or to hydrogen hubs, or to long-duration storage?

Geopolitics or Ideology?

Some have speculated that the halt may have less to do with the project itself and more to do with geopolitics. Denmark, Ørsted’s home country, has clashed with Washington in the past over issues ranging from Arctic policy to Greenland. Others see the decision as part of a broader ideological push against renewable energy from the current U.S. administration. Whatever the true motives, the result is the same: an erosion of trust in the stability of U.S. policymaking.

The Transition Will Not Stop

The irony is that stopping Revolution Wind will not halt the energy transition. Global momentum behind renewables continues, driven by economics as much as by climate goals. The cost trajectory of wind and solar, combined with storage, makes them increasingly competitive against fossil fuels. Demand from corporations and states for clean power remains strong, regardless of federal policy swings. What the halt does accomplish, however, is to delay the U.S. in securing its share of that momentum. Other regions will move faster, attract more capital, and develop the industries and jobs that come with leadership in clean energy.

A Case Study in Short-Termism

Politicizing projects like Revolution Wind serves no one’s long-term interests. It undermines investor confidence, discourages innovation, and deprives consumers of cost-effective power. For the U.S. economy, it risks leaving the country less competitive in the industries of the future. For the global climate effort, it removes a project that would have delivered meaningful emissions reductions. And for companies like Ørsted, it reinforces the perception that the U.S. is not a reliable partner for long-horizon energy infrastructure.

Conclusion

In the end, the decision to halt Revolution Wind is a case study in how political short-termism can sabotage economic rationality. Here was a project that ticked every box: nearly finished, financially sound, socially beneficial, and strategically important. Instead of celebrating its completion, the U.S. government chose to halt it, leaving investors and partners bewildered. The damage will be felt for years, not only by Ørsted, but by every energy company now rethinking whether America is a safe place to bet on the future.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.
“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said.
He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.
But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes.","NARY, Minn. — Brian Ingmire’s mission to help reforest northern Minnesota with trees from south of here became a lot more important after the June 21 storm that leveled millions of trees in the Bemidji area.

Ingmire and his wife, Trina, own the 10-acre New North Farm southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County. They sell Certified Naturally Grown produce at Bemidji’s Natural Choice Farmers Market on Saturdays. They also raise sheep and chickens.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said. “Something like 10 million trees are needed every year at a minimum. And we have a lot of forest disturbance, whether it’s fires or wind events.”

Ingmire figures he has about 30,000 tree seedlings on his farm, and about two-thirds of them will be available for purchase this fall. Online orders can be placed at climatesmarttrees.com. He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.

New North Farm is one of 24 members of the cooperative. Ingmire is growing several varieties, including red oak, burr oak, yellow birch and silver maple. All are collected from about 200 miles south and then started up north.

“I can tell you where their parent tree came from,” Ingmire said. “They should be able to handle the changes in temperature extremes. We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes. These trees should have the genetic ability to deal with that kind of extreme.”

The need for reforestation was certainly exacerbated in the Bemidji area after the June storm. It is estimated that Beltrami County lost nine million trees, and many were also downed in parts of Hubbard and Cass counties.

“That number exceeds a lot of the nursery capacity that we have,” Ingmire said.

Trees that are purchased this fall should be planted right away to ensure their survival.

“Most of our sales will be done for spring planting,” Ingmire said, “but I would like to see as many available in the fall as possible. I think the trees do better when they're planted in the fall. But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes. Some years you've got a month to get all that done, and some years you've got two weeks.”

Listening to Ingmire talk about the seedling program, his gardens and forest ecology, it’s clear to see his passion for science and the environment.

""In a lot of ways it’s a spiritual thing for me,"" he said. ""You either set everything aside and you take a preservationist mindset where nature's best left without man touching it, or you recognize that we as humans have a unique role and responsibility to participate and be part of the natural world. There's really no separation between the two of them.""

He noted that the impacts humans have are global, but that these impacts start on a local level.

""One tree at a time, or one farm that's growing vegetables that feed people. So you can choose to participate in a lot of different ways,"" Ingmire said. ""The way that I choose to participate is to imagine and envision what it could be, and then work to model that and make it happen. And help other people do the same.""

Ingmire's full-time job is with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as a water certification specialist. It’s a position that allows for flexibility, especially during the growing season, and it also allows him to visit with farmers throughout the region.

He has a degree in natural resources and environmental maintenance from Ball State University in his native Indiana. He did graduate work at Western Kentucky University and Indiana University before becoming a science teacher at the junior college and high school level.

After that, he managed water quality programs for the Environmental Protection Agency and spent 13 years as a conservation planner and trainer with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The Ingmires moved to Minnesota nearly four years ago after he started his current position with the MDA. But finding the right place to live was a bit of a challenge for Brian and Trina.

“It was right in the middle of COVID,” Brian said. “Interest rates were starting to go up. Everybody was racing to get a place.”

The couple had planned to visit five properties in the Bemidji area, but by the time they arrived, three of them had been sold.

“The first one we looked at was just a nightmare,” Brian said. Even the farm they bought didn’t look right when they pulled into the snow-covered driveway.

“It looked horrible,” Brian said. “We didn’t have any photos of the inside of the house. The doors were open on the sheds when we pulled in. It hadn’t been plowed. But then we got into the house and it had a bank of south-facing windows and all the sun was shining through. We thought, ‘This is it. We can do this.’”

Fast forward four years, and Brian and Trina have created a pristine and productive farm, with a lot of sweat equity and a little help from their hungry sheep.

“I was looking at soil maps and thought it should be good,” Brian said. “It’s prime agricultural land. We had a lot of little surprises when everything thawed. There were piles of trash, it was all grown over and full of boxelder. Kind of daunting, but I was ready for it. I was just ready to have my own piece of land, and I had ideas I wanted to try out.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6270a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F20%2Fa80e09dd49a3ae86822b44a6ae3b%2Fingmire2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:19.441352

But the city’s green goals have also drawn a critical eye from Florida’s Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, which is auditing the city alongside several other local governments across the state.
In his recent State of the City speech, Mayor Buddy Dyer said that the city was on track to run city facilities with solar by early 2027 — an initiative he said boasts environmental and economic benefits.

But the city’s green goals have also drawn a critical eye from Florida’s Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, which is auditing the city alongside several other local governments across the state.

In his recent State of the City speech, Mayor Buddy Dyer said that the city was on track to run city facilities with solar by early 2027 — an initiative he said boasts environmental and economic benefits.

“Yes, this is about fighting climate change. But it’s also about saving money and increasing operational efficiency,” Dyer said. “It’s an up-front investment that pays for itself over time, and then generates a return in dollars, jobs and other tangible benefits.”

The city council first set the goal in 2017, alongside a larger target of powering the entire city with renewable sources by 2050. Other cities, like Burlington, Vermont and Aspen, Colorado, have entirely renewable electrical grids, though Dyer has strived to position Orlando as the most sustainable city in the southeast.

The city’s solar investments also continue, with about 10 new systems expected to be added by the end of 2026 on buildings ranging from community centers to fire stations to the city’s fleet and facilities headquarters.

Between now and the third quarter of 2026, that’s about a $4 million investment, said Mike Hess, the city’s director of sustainability, resilience and future-ready.

At the city’s fleet and facilities building — where employees maintain, repair and replace a range of vehicles and equipment like police cars and solid waste trucks — the new solar system will produce more energy than is used there, Hess said.

Solar is a good investment for cities like Orlando because city workers will occupy their buildings for long periods of time, he said. New solar systems are expected to last about 25 years, and should be entirely paid off in 10 years, meaning taxpayers would reap savings for 15 years.

“If we’re installing roughly $4 million in solar projects … 10 years from now, our taxpayers are going to start to see a $400,000 per year savings on our energy bills,” Hess said.“Ten-year paybacks are great for us because we’re going to own our buildings for a long, long time.”

These investments come as NASA confirmed 2024 was the warmest year recorded, which scientists have blamed on carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, which trap heat.

Environmental policies, however, have been some of the biggest targets of Florida DOGE, which Gov. Ron DeSantis and CFO Blaise Ingoglia has characterized as looking for waste and inefficiency but has included scouring records for phrases it deems ideologically suspect.

In its letter demanding a slew of records, DOGE asked the city to turn over documents and data about any “Green New Deal” policies related to climate change, carbon reduction, as well as capital and operating expenses of any such programs.

The Green New Deal itself was a 2019 proposal from U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. that did not advance in Congress and has no connection with local environmental initiatives such as Orlando’s.

City staffers leading the city’s green initiatives were also interviewed by DOGE auditors when they visited City Hall last month, an official said.

Despite the increase in solar usage, the Orlando Utilities Commission, which is city-owned, still relies on coal at its Stanton Energy Plant — at least for now. The utility intends to phase out coal and natural gas by 2050 in favor of solar and renewable sources. It announced in 2020 it would stop burning coal there in 2027 and switch to natural gas.

City leaders have also sought to reduce the energy needed to power its facilities by 20% since 2011. The city issued a $17.5 million bond to cover 55 projects across the city, including switching lights to LED, replacing HVAC systems with more energy-efficient models and automating buildings with smart systems to control usage. Such upgrades were done at the Kia Center, City Hall, fire stations, community centers and other facilities.

Dyer said the results were $2.5 million in annual energy savings.

The automaker unveiled the plan at its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant, where the new model will be built starting in 2027, Electrek revealed. The electric truck will be the first vehicle based on Ford's new ""Universal EV Platform,"" which is designed to provide more interior space and lower ownership costs compared with competitors like Tesla's Model Y.

The announcement came with surprises. Ford said it will discontinue the Escape, its second-best-selling SUV, and the Lincoln Corsair after the 2026 model year. Both models are currently built at the Louisville facility, which will be repurposed to produce the new generation of affordable EVs.

Ford has invested about $5 billion into the plant, creating nearly 4,000 jobs in preparation for this shift. The company says the new truck will be part of a family of lower-cost EVs that are expected to expand consumer access to clean transportation.

Electric vehicles are gaining traction worldwide as automakers push out new models at lower price points. EVs save drivers money by eliminating oil changes and many fluid replacements, cutting fuel costs, and reducing long-term maintenance. They also operate with quieter engines and produce no tailpipe pollution. Drivers can explore how to make their next car an EV with more resources available for first-time buyers.

Some critics point to the environmental impact of mining for lithium and other minerals used in batteries. Research shows the clean energy transition requires about 30 million tons of minerals each year, but the world currently extracts about 16.5 billion tons of dirty energy annually, which is burned and cannot be reused, unlike battery materials — so electric is still better for the planet.

Studies also show EVs quickly pay off their environmental footprint — a Tesla Model 3 offsets its manufacturing costs after just 13,500 miles compared with a Toyota Corolla, according to Reuters.

The benefits grow when EVs are paired with home solar panels, which lower charging costs even further. Fueling with solar energy is cheaper than using public stations or the grid, and EnergySage makes it easy to compare local installer quotes and save up to $10,000 on installations.

Republican Rhode Island Governor Don Carcieri was a conservative, pro-business politician. Socially, he was opposed to gay marriage and abortion.

First elected in 2002, Carcieri promised to cut state government and create 20,000 jobs.

His two terms were bumpy as he often clashed with the Democratic legislature.

In Carcieri’s final years, he pushed two major economic development strategies. The first economic development initiative involved a funding scheme that provided $75 million to 38 Studios, a video game company founded by former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling.

That was an almost immediate failure, with the company going into bankruptcy in less than two years after Carcieri and the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) pushed through the massive public spending for the fledgling company. The investment, bankruptcy, and legal actions made Rhode Island national news. It was an abject embarrassment.

The second Carcieri initiative was to create an offshore wind industry in Rhode Island. Massachusetts had first attempted to build an offshore wind project in America, but powerful interests, including U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, the Koch brothers, and even Walter Cronkite, opposed the Cape Wind project.

The offshore wind industry began in earnest in Rhode Island in 2008, as Carcieri pushed through legislation to start the wind industry in the state.

It took almost a decade, and the first successful project in America was Deepwater Wind.

The Beginning - Big Goals

In September of 2008, Carcieri announced that Deepwater Wind was chosen as the developer to construct a wind energy project off the shores of Rhode Island that could provide 1.3 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity per year, 15 percent of all electricity used in the state. It was expected that the project would cost more than $1 billion to construct, with all the capital coming from private investment sources.

“Today marks a major step to bring wind power to Rhode Island and to reach our goal of at least 15 percent of all electricity in the state be renewable energy,” Carcieri said at the time. “Of the many forms of renewable energy alternatives available, wind is the proven leader. Wind power is clean, green power that is not subject to variations and increases in fuel prices. Rhode Island is uniquely positioned to lead the nation with the development of this country’s first offshore wind farm.”

Democratic Opposition

The lead opponent to the project was the Democratic Rhode Island Attorney General.

In July of 2010, GoLocal reported that Attorney General Patrick Lynch took his opposition to the proposed wind farm off Block Island to the next level, announcing he was challenging the constitutionality of a new law that allowed the project to move forward.

As reported, the law would send the issue back to the Public Utilities Commission, which had already once turned down a proposed contract between National Grid and Deepwater Wind, After the law took effect, Deepwater Wind filed a new proposed contract with the PUC.

“We continue to fight against this special-interest measure and inside deal tailored to put only one entity, Deepwater Wind, on the fast track to develop a costly demonstration project that isn’t needed and will create only six full-time jobs,” said Lynch, who at the time was a Democratic candidate for governor.

“It’s an exercise in futility that will not spur economic development in Rhode Island, will not generate much-needed jobs for our residents in a cutting-edge industry and, despite its supporters’ promises, provides absolutely no guarantee that our state will rise as the primary purveyor of affordable wind energy along the Atlantic coast,"" Lynch added.

Charges of Inside Deal

Carcieri hammered away at Lynch for saying the new law was “an inside deal” tailored to favor just one company—Deepwater Wind.

“The Attorney General is making a reckless charge that the new law was the result of an inside deal tailored to favor one developer,” said Carcieri at the time. “The Attorney General should know that there was a competitive process to select a preferred developer for the proposed wind farm. The process was open, transparent, and based on competitive scoring of all interested applicants.”

Carcieri said Deepwater Wind was chosen because it had the lowest energy price, the strongest financial assets, and could commit to creating jobs in Rhode Island.

“The Attorney General is either uninformed or misleading the public – which is it?” Carcieri concluded.

The project was ultimately cut down to a pilot project located off Block Island.

After a battle to get the pilot project approved, Deepwater was off and running, but faced challenges, including financing, legal, and local zoning.

In May of 2017, Block Island switched over and was powered by Deepwater — making American history.

The success of the project made global news, and the Block Island project was featured in a national Citi ad.

Today, the success of Deepwater seems forgotten, and the offshore wind industry is mired in political and legal chaos.

It all started in Rhode Island.

The SPEED Act takes aim at the scientific foundation of environmental review

By guest contributor Justin Pidot.

On September 10, the House Natural Resources Committee will convene a hearing on the SPEED Act—the latest NEPA reform bill championed by Chairman Bruce Westerman. The bill includes provisions that would fundamentally compromise the integrity of federal decision making processes by allowing—or even compelling—the government to ignore scientific and technical information critical to understanding the effects of a federal action and how those effects could be mitigated.

This component of the SPEED Act would operate against the backdrop of a provision Congress added to NEPA in 2023 to limit an agency’s obligation to generate new information. NEPA section 106 (b)(3), which addresses the threshold question of whether to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), provides an agency:

“is not required to undertake new scientific or technical research unless the new scientific or technical research is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives, and the overall costs and time frame of obtaining it are not unreasonable.”

This approach to new information strikes a balance, an appropriate one in my view, between analytical integrity and efficiency. The SPEED Act would obliterate that balance by providing that an agency is also not required:

“to undertake new scientific and technical research after the receipt of an application, as applicable, with respect to such proposed agency action.”

If you’re scratching your head trying to parse the language precisely, you’re in good company. I think the convoluted text running from “receipt” to “proposed agency action” describing the covered circumstances simply means whenever an agency receives an application, but maybe there’s a nuance I’m missing.

But that text certainly seems to provide that where it applies, an agency never needs to perform scientific or technical research, no matter how essential or reasonably obtained.

The SPEED Act would add even more capacious (and clearer) provisions to section 107—which addresses conducting environmental reviews—providing:

“no Federal agency shall be required to consider any scientific or technical research that becomes publicly available” after the agency has received an application or published a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an environmental document, whichever comes sooner; and

“[a] Federal agency may not delay the issuance of an environmental document or a final agency action . . . on the basis of awaiting new scientific or technical information.”

One consequence of those provisions is that they would allow agencies to entirely ignore information provided during public comment periods, including a provision of the 2023 NEPA amendments requiring agencies to take comment on NOIs—which, by definition, occur after the NOI is published.

It is Orwellian indeed to require an agency to seek input from the public that the agency is expressly excused from having to consider. And if you’re wondering if this is an intended consequence, it clearly is, because the bill specifies that permitting agencies to ignore information in environmental review processes does not affect their obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act to respond to comment when issuing or revising regulations.

So far, I’ve talked about the consequences of the SPEED Act in abstract terms. Here’s a concrete example of two agencies developing essential information that would be compromised: In 2003, the BLM and Forest Service commenced an EIS for a proposal to expand a phosphate mine in Idaho and dispose of toxic waste from the expansion at a site nearby. Evaluating the risk of contaminating streams, rivers, and groundwater in the area required information about the geology of the disposal site. But as is typical, that kind of detailed site-specific information didn’t exist when the environmental review process began. So, during the EIS process (which concluded in 2006), more than 50 bore holes were drilled to characterize the geochemistry of the site. Information from that research enabled development of a new alternative in the final EIS with improved engineering of the disposal site. That alternative, enabled by research occurring during the environmental review, was ultimately adopted.

This kind of circumstance isn’t unusual. The environmental review process often involves some degree of research on the:

natural resources occurring in a project area

amount of air pollution a project will generate, where it will end up, and how that may impact people’s health

fate of oil or chemicals released in an accident and how they could be contained

area’s risks of wildfire, flood, earthquake or other natural disasters; and

hydrology of the area and how a project could pollute drinking water or reduce water supply.

Developing information about those kinds of things is central to the NEPA process and can often be done quickly and affordably.

The SPEED Act’s approach would have further, and I suspect unintended, consequences: It would encourage development in locations where we know less about the environment; and it would encourage the use of less tested technologies and methods. That’s because analysis would only be required to the extent that technical and scientific information is already available. In other words, if we know nothing, no analysis needs to occur.

By calcifying scientific and technical information at the moment an agency receives an application, or publishes an NOI, the SPEED Act would enable the government to turn a willfully blind eye to inconvenient information about harms to human health, air and water quality, biodiversity, and other aspects of the human environment. That’s a recipe for ill-conceived decisions, not better government.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NEPA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:33.360291

Automakers can chase longer range, but that drives up cost. They can make the battery charge very rapidly, but that can shorten its lifespan. Push too far in one direction and something else inevitably gives.

To make a battery that’s great at all those aspects is tough, but automakers and battery companies have signed up for the challenge regardless, thanks to solid-state batteries.

If solid-state batteries are manufactured at scale, they can offer an ideal balance of range, safety, performance and fast-charging in a similar or a smaller pack size. There’s a reason why scientists call it the “holy grail” of battery technology.

These batteries replace the liquid electrolyte, the chemical that facilitates the charge and discharge cycles, with a solid one. The solid materials theoretically perform better, but they’re difficult to manufacture in large volumes without defects.

Even if battery companies succeed, they won’t turn things around overnight. Research firm BloombergNEF projects solid-state batteries to account for just 10% of global EV and battery storage demand by 2035. The exact path to scalability and commercialization still looks murky, and the initial rollout could be concentrated in premium EVs.

In the meantime, semi-solid-state batteries are gaining traction. These batteries use a gel-like electrolyte that also promises improvements over traditional lithium-ion batteries. Chinese battery companies have established a firm lead in this space, with 83% of current or planned solid-state battery manufacturing capacity all concentrated in China, BNEF said.

EVs with semi-solid-state batteries are already rolling out in China, albeit in small numbers. Customers can buy and drive them today, thanks to early adopters such as Nio and the state-backed SAIC Motors that invested in the tech early. In the West, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are testing solid-state batteries, and Stellantis is planning to begin trials next year.

Japanese and Korean automakers are also working on this tech, but they’ve been tight-lipped about their plans. In 2022, Nikkei reported that Toyota held the highest number of solid-state battery patents, followed by Panasonic and Idemitsu.

In this list, we’re covering both semi-solid-state and all-solid-state batteries. Some of these EVs are already on the market in China, while others are planned to go on sale in the coming years. A few of them are demo cars, but we’re including them in the list anyway. We’re also including automakers that have not yet installed solid-state batteries in an actual EV, but have shown the intent to do so. The list covers both Chinese EVs as well as some Western models that are in the works.

Nio ET7/ET5

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 360 watt hours per kilogram

Supplier: Beijing WeLion New Energy Technology

Claimed Range: 652 miles (1,050 kilometers)

In late 2023, Nio’s Founder, Chairman, and CEO William Li got behind the wheel of the sleek ET7 sedan and drove more than 648 miles on a single charge. He did that in real-world conditions and, moreover, in frigid temperatures, the automaker claimed. The ET7 was equipped with a 150 kWh semi-solid-state battery, which is available to rent for Nio EV owners in China for a per-day fee. It’s a great idea: Do your daily driving using the brand's small 70-75 kWh packs and switch to solid-state via battery swapping before long road trips.

IM Motors L6

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Supplier: Suzhou QingTao Power Technology

Range: 620+ miles (1,000 km)

IM Motors is the luxury arm of China’s state backed SAIC Motors. SAIC has made a significant headway into semi-solid-state batteries with multiple models on sale already in China.

The IM L6 rivals the Tesla Model 3 and the Xiaomi SU7. Its entry-level versions get lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, but it’s also available with a 133 kWh semi-solid-state pack that’s good for more than 620 miles of range on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC). A 900-volt architecture makes adding 248 miles of range in just 12 minutes of charging possible, with a powerful enough charger. It’s priced between 230,000 and 330,000 yuan ($28,000-$45,600).

MG4

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 180 Wh/kg

Supplier: Suzhou QingTao Power Technology

British carmaker MG Motor is another SAIC owned brand benefitting from semi-solid-state batteries. MG made waves recently by announcing the launch of the first affordable mass market EV powered by a semi-solid-state battery later this year. The battery size and range are still unknown, but MG said the cells use only 5% liquid electrolyte. The prices look competitive, too. The MG4 is available with both LFP and semi-solid state batteries, costing between 73,800 and 105,800 yuan ($10,100-14,400).

Voyah Passion (Locally called Voyah Zhuiguang)

Voyah Passion/Zhuiguang

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Range: 360 miles

Voyah, the premium brand under China’s Dongfeng Motor Corporation, launched the Passion sedan in China in 2023 in both plug-in hybrid and battery-electric versions. Its 82 kWh semi-solid-state battery is installed in the entry-level version, whereas the 109 kWh lithium-ion battery is the one with significantly more range, as per local news reports. The 82 kWh pack is good for 360 miles of CLTC range, whereas the bigger pack can deliver 453 miles. It's priced between 322,900 and 432,000 yuan ($45,000-$60,000).

The semi-solid state pack was an early generation of the battery, and the automaker is reportedly working on its third generation solid-state tech.

Dongfeng Fengshen E70 (Demo EV)

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Range: 620+ miles

Supplier: Ganfeng Lithium

China’s DongFeng Motor Corporation started testing semi-solid-state batteries way back in 2022. At that time, the automaker installed semi-solid-state batteries in 50 prototype E70 electric sedans. The pack was developed in collaboration with battery company Ganfeng, and also supports swapping, local media said at the time.

In August, the automaker said the commercial production of the semi-solid-state battery would begin in 2026. And it would deliver a range of over 620 miles.

Dodge Charger Daytona EV (Demo EV)

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 375 Wh/kg

Supplier: Factorial Energy

Stellantis and Massachusetts-based battery startup Factorial have validated a semi-solid-state battery cell with a claimed energy density of 375 watt hours per kilogram, which is more than the typical 200-300 Wh/kg energy density of traditional lithium-ion batteries. The automaker claims the cells can charge from 15-90% in 18 minutes at room temperature. It has a discharge rate of up to 4C, meaning it can fully discharge four times in an hour. The battery will be tested on a demo fleet of Charger Daytona EVs next year, Stellantis has said.

Mercedes-Benz EQS (Demo EV)

Photo by: Mercedes-Benz

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Supplier: Factorial Energy

Range: 620 miles (WLTP)

Factorial is also supplying semi-solid-state batteries to Mercedes-Benz. Earlier this year, the automaker showcased a prototype EQS equipped with Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery, claiming it could deliver 25% more range without increasing the size or the weight of the pack. The current EQS has a battery capacity of roughly 118 kWh. Factorial expects mass production to begin by the end of the decade.

BMW i7 (Demo EV)

Photo by: BMW

Battery type: All-solid state

Energy Density: 390 Wh/kg

Supplier: Solid Power

BMW started testing a prototype i7 powered by all-solid-state cells in Munich this summer. It’s using prismatic cells developed by Colorado-based battery start-up Solid Power. The automaker didn’t share the size of the pack, but said it would begin making the cells on a pilot production line in Germany by licensing Solid Power’s technology. Crucial information such as estimated range is missing, but it’s probably too early for that.

Automakers With Plans To Launch Solid-State Batteries

Toyota

2019 Toyota LQ concept

Toyota put a solid-state battery in the futuristic-looking LQ prototype way back in 2021, way before the technology started making weekly news headlines. It expects its first solid-state battery to enter mass production in the 2027-2028 period.

The automaker claims that its solid-state battery will deliver more than 620 miles of range. And it could charge from 10-80% in less than 10 minutes. However, we’re likely to see a solid-state battery in a Toyota hybrid before an EV. Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist and head of the Toyota Research Institute, confirmed that in 2022.

That makes perfect sense. Toyota hybrids are as popular as ever, and if the RAV4 or Prius can double their electric-only driving range, it’s a win for the brand and also for the climate.

Honda

Honda is working independently to develop an all-solid-state battery, which it intends to install in production vehicles sometime in the second half of this decade. The automaker said last year that its solid-state cells could potentially be 50% smaller, 35% lighter and 25% cheaper than current lithium-ion batteries.

It expects a driving range exceeding 620 miles, which could increase to over 700 miles over time. It’s currently testing the battery on a pilot production line in Japan, ironing out issues related to mass production.

Volkswagen

QuantumScape Battery Prototype

The Volkswagen Group is working closely with California-based battery startup QuantumScape to develop all-solid-state batteries. Its battery subsidiary PowerCo has invested upwards of $260 million into QuantumScape, with a recent funding round going towards a pilot production line for the cells.

QuantumScape has said that today’s EVs with 350 miles of range could achieve between 400 and 500 miles of range using its anode-free lithium metal batteries. However, that number could vary substantially depending on the pack size and the application.

Nissan

Photo by: Nissan

Nissan is not in good shape, with its profits tanking and sales falling off a cliff. But it’s not giving up in the race to develop next-generation battery cells. Like Toyota and Honda, Nissan is also working on solid-state batteries in-house. Executives from the company even told InsideEVs in April that they’re planning commercialization by the end of fiscal year 2028.

The automaker’s all-solid-state cells will use a sulphur-based electrolyte and maybe even a sulphur-manganese cathode, which could allow it to eliminate cobalt entirely. Cobalt—a byproduct of copper—requires dirty and expensive mining and is linked to labor violations in Congo.

BYD

Photo by: BYD

BYD said this year that it was working on solid-state batteries, but denied rumors of the popular Seal sedan benefitting from the tech. The automaker said that it expects to begin demonstrations starting in 2027, with mass production expected after 2030, but stopped short of sharing which EV exactly it will use for testing.

Hyundai-Kia

Hyundai is probably among the most cautious when it comes to solid-state batteries. While the automaker still appears to be working on the tech behind-the-scenes, senior Hyundai officials have said that they won't be able to commercialize the cells before 2030. The Japanese automakers by comparison seem to have more aggressive timelines for bringing these batteries to market.

It’s worth noting that today’s dominant chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) are steadily improving. Gains in performance, coupled with established supply chains and the falling cost of lithium, could delay the need for solid-state cells or make their business case harder to justify.

Still, we’re keeping a close eye on the battery market and will update this list as new developments arise. If you know of a model or brand working on solid-state batteries that we’ve missed in this list, let us know in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XB6kyV/s1/mercedes-eqs-with-solid-state-batteries.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:06:30.183662

As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes record-high Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027, stakeholders are grappling with the dual challenges of small refinery exemptions (SREs) and the geopolitical dynamics of biofuel trade. For investors, this debate represents both a high-stakes policy gamble and a potential inflection point for domestic renewable energy infrastructure.

The RFS Reallocation Landscape: Policy Shifts and Market Signals

The EPA’s proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027—24.02 billion gallons (bg) and 24.46 bg, respectively—mark a 9.5% increase from 2025 levels, with a clear tilt toward domestic production [1]. Notably, the agency has introduced a 50% devaluation of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and foreign-sourced feedstocks, a move explicitly designed to bolster U.S. corn ethanol and biomass-based diesel (BBD) producers [2]. This policy shift aligns with the Renewable Fuels Association’s (RFA) advocacy for “prioritizing domestic renewable fuels over imports,” which it argues will stabilize markets and support rural economies [3].

However, the reallocation of SREs remains a contentious wildcard. As of August 2025, the EPA has granted exemptions to 175 small refineries across multiple compliance years, with 13 petitions still pending [4]. While the agency has committed to reallocating these volumes to maintain RVO integrity, industry groups like the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association warn that delays or inconsistent enforcement could create a “2-billion-gallon uncertainty” in the market [5]. This uncertainty is already manifesting in RIN price volatility: D4 (BBD) credits recently traded between $0.84 and $0.89 per RIN, while D6 (conventional ethanol) credits hovered near $0.80–$0.82 [6].

Investment Opportunities: Domestic Biofuels and Agricultural Synergies

The EPA’s policy recalibration is creating clear tailwinds for U.S. biofuel producers and agricultural stakeholders. The proposed RVOs are expected to drive demand for corn and soybeans, with Darling Ingredients noting that the devaluation of imported feedstocks could boost soybean oil demand by 1.5 billion gallons annually [7]. This has already spurred capital investment in soybean crush capacity, with five new plants operational in 2024 and more under construction [7].

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies these opportunities. Section 45X tax credits for clean manufacturing have drawn $115 billion in U.S. clean energy investments since 2022, with biofuels and hydrogen production emerging as key beneficiaries [8]. For instance, biomass-based diesel producers stand to gain from the IRA’s 45V tax credit, which offers up to $1.29 per gallon for low-carbon fuels [9]. Similarly, the proposed 5.61 bg BBD mandate for 2026 could catalyze infrastructure upgrades at existing refineries, particularly in the Midwest [1].

Risks on the Horizon: SREs, Imports, and Market Fragmentation

Despite these opportunities, investors must navigate significant risks. The SRE backlog and reallocation process remain a source of regulatory ambiguity. Clean Fuels Alliance America has warned that delayed RVO finalization could disrupt compliance planning for 2026, while the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers argue that reallocating exempted volumes risks “increasing imports and undermining U.S. energy dominance” [10].

Geopolitical tensions also loom large. Brazil’s recent trade barriers against U.S. ethanol exports—coupled with the EPA’s import devaluation policy—threaten to fragment global markets and reduce price competitiveness for U.S. biofuels [3]. Meanwhile, the elimination of eRINs (electricity from biogas) under the “Set 2” rule has shifted focus back to liquid biofuels, potentially slowing innovation in emerging sectors like sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) [2].

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For investors, the RFS reallocation debate underscores the importance of hedging against policy volatility while capitalizing on structural trends. Key strategies include:

1. Diversifying Exposure: Balancing investments in conventional biofuels (e.g., corn ethanol) with advanced categories (e.g., BBD, cellulosic biofuels) to mitigate SRE-related risks.

2. Leveraging IRA Incentives: Targeting projects aligned with 45X and 45V tax credits, particularly in soybean oil processing and biomass-based diesel upscaling.

3. Monitoring RIN Markets: Closely tracking RIN price movements as a barometer of RVO enforcement and SRE reallocation progress.

Conclusion

The RFS reallocation debate is a microcosm of broader tensions in U.S. energy policy: the push-pull between domestic production and global trade, regulatory certainty and political expediency, and short-term compliance costs versus long-term decarbonization goals. For investors, the path forward lies in navigating these complexities with a dual focus on policy agility and market fundamentals. As the EPA moves toward finalizing its 2026–2027 RVOs by October 2025, the coming months will test whether the RFS can evolve into a stable, scalable framework—or remain a source of market fragmentation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 12:08:28.528845

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm Mexico's energy and trade sectors are at a crossroads.","The U.S.-Mexico relationship in 2025 is a volatile chessboard of tariffs, political brinkmanship, and energy sector recalibration. For investors, the stakes are high as U.S. policy shifts—ranging from Trump-era tariff hikes to judicially driven regulatory uncertainty in Mexico—reshape the calculus of nearshoring and energy investments. This article dissects the risks and opportunities in Mexico's energy and manufacturing sectors, offering a roadmap for navigating the turbulence.

The Tariff Tightrope: U.S. Policy as a Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. has weaponized trade policy to address non-economic issues, with tariffs on Mexican steel, aluminum, , respectively. These measures, framed as responses to fentanyl and immigration concerns, have created a ""shadow tax"" on Mexican exports. For context, . content threshold under USMCA. This creates a paradox: while U.S. manufacturers benefit from lower effective tariffs, foreign automakers (e.g., Kia, Nissan) struggle to compete, potentially diverting investment to U.S. or Asian hubs.

The Trump administration's 90-day tariff suspension in July 2025 offered a temporary reprieve, but the underlying instability persists. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's efforts to negotiate a new trade agreement are hampered by U.S. demands to curb Chinese transshipment and limit non-USMCA compliance. For investors, this means hedging against sudden policy pivots, particularly in sectors like steel and automotive manufacturing.

Energy Sector Paralysis: Policy Uncertainty vs. Decarbonization Needs

Mexico's energy sector is caught between its decarbonization goals and the U.S.-driven regulatory fog. The Sheinbaum administration's constitutional reforms, which redefined state-owned energy giants CFE and Pemex as ""state-preferred"" entities, have spooked private investors. These reforms, coupled with the elimination of independent regulatory agencies, have eroded confidence in Mexico's ability to enforce contracts or resolve disputes—a critical concern for capital-intensive energy projects.

Meanwhile, U.S. energy policies are compounding the challenge. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) has accelerated timelines for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, forcing developers to meet 2026-2027 deadlines for solar, wind, and battery projects. Mexico's energy infrastructure, , now faces a dual threat: U.S. tariff-driven supply chain disruptions and domestic policy unpredictability.

The irony is stark: Mexico's geographic and labor advantages make it an ideal nearshoring destination for clean energy manufacturing, yet U.S. tariffs on critical components (e.g., transformers, semiconductors) and Mexico's own regulatory overhauls are stifling growth. For instance, the 50% U.S. tariffs on Mexican copper—a key material for EVs and renewable projects—threaten to derail decarbonization synergies between the two nations.

Nearshoring Opportunities: A Fragile Window

Despite the headwinds, nearshoring remains a compelling opportunity for Mexico. The country's 12 free trade agreements, including USMCA, provide a framework for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, the Sheinbaum administration's judicial reforms—popularly elected judges and weakened oversight—have dampened investor appetite. In Q1 2025, , a stark decline from historical averages.

The automotive sector offers a glimmer of hope. , . While this challenges Mexican automakers, it also creates a niche for U.S. firms seeking to outsource production to Mexico's lower-cost, high-skilled labor force. Investors should monitor how U.S. .

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Hedge Against Political Risk: Prioritize investments in sectors less sensitive to U.S. tariffs, such as Mexico's renewable energy storage or hydrogen projects. These align with global decarbonization trends and are less exposed to trade policy swings.

Leverage USMCA Compliance: Target Mexican manufacturers that can meet the 40% U.S. content threshold, reducing effective tariff rates. This is particularly relevant for automotive and battery supply chains.

Diversify Trade Partnerships: Mexico's negotiations with the EU and Brazil to update trade agreements could offset U.S. volatility. Investors should consider portfolios that span multiple trade corridors.

Monitor 2026 USMCA Renegotiations: The Trump administration's push to renegotiate USMCA in 2026 could either stabilize or further destabilize the investment climate. Positioning for potential tariff reductions on steel and autos could yield long-term gains.

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Mexico's energy and trade sectors are at a crossroads. While the country's strategic location and labor advantages make it a nearshoring magnet, U.S. policy shifts and domestic reforms are creating a minefield of risks. For investors, the key lies in balancing short-term caution with long-term optimism—capitalizing on nearshoring opportunities while hedging against political and regulatory volatility. As the 2026 USMCA review looms, the next 12 months will be critical in determining whether Mexico can stabilize its investment climate or become a casualty of U.S. geopolitical maneuvering.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:40.761890

The electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing turbulent times, especially in the aftermath of policy shifts following the previous U.S. presidential administration. Initiatives aimed at bolstering EV adoption, such as emissions regulations, tax credits, and funding for charging infrastructure, have faced significant rollbacks. These developments have contributed to a perception among certain sectors that the push for EVs is misguided, branding it as part of a “green new scam.” This sentiment has not only affected domestic manufacturers but has also created challenges for foreign automakers operating in the U.S. market.

A notable casualty of this shift is Volkswagen, which recently announced the furlough of 160 employees at its ID.4 factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, citing declining demand for the model. While a surge in EV sales is anticipated before a federal tax incentive deadline at the end of September, the longer-term outlook remains grim, raising concerns about consumer interest in electric vehicles in the future.

In a parallel development, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reversed a previously established mandate that required automakers to meet specific EV sales targets. This decision comes amidst ongoing trade tensions and is intended to provide relief to domestic manufacturers grappling with the fallout from U.S. tariff policies. Initially, the Trudeau administration aimed for a goal of 20 percent electric vehicle sales by 2026, escalating to 100 percent by 2035. Industry experts criticized the plan as unrealistic, arguing it was not grounded in a thorough analysis of market conditions.

As manufacturers grapple with these shifting dynamics, a company named Horse Powertrain is putting forth a novel solution aimed at easing “range anxiety” among potential EV buyers. This joint venture between Renault and Geely has developed a compact engine and generator that can be retrofitted to existing battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Set to be showcased at the upcoming IAA auto show in Munich, Horse Powertrain’s C15 engine is marketed as small enough to fit within a briefcase, though its actual dimensions suggest it is slightly larger.

Horse Powertrain’s approach enables manufacturers to convert BEV platforms into range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) without extensive modifications. This innovation aims to capitalize on the increasing demand for REEVs in various global markets. The C15 engine is designed to comply with stringent emissions regulations and can run on a range of fuels, including gasoline, ethanol, and synthetic fuels. Importantly, it functions to maintain the battery’s charge rather than directly powering the vehicle, optimizing efficiency and minimizing fuel consumption.

Industry observers note that Horse Powertrain’s emergence at this juncture may reflect a broader reckoning within the automotive sector, as both governments and manufacturers reassess their commitments to purely electric vehicles. While many have long championed the all-electric future, the hesitation observed in consumer interest signals that more diverse powertrain solutions, such as hybrids, may become increasingly relevant.

As ongoing debates about the future of transportation technology continue, the need for affordability looms large. Currently, the higher price points of EVs compared to traditional vehicles remain a substantial barrier to widespread adoption. Until these concerns are addressed, the trajectory of the EV revolution may remain uncertain, with manufacturers needing to adapt swiftly to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EV-Market-Faces-Setbacks-as-Canada-Rescinds-Mandate-and-US.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:06:34.328148

Real Clear Wire

The most disturbing thing about the nationwide rise in electricity prices is that the average consumer is footing the bill for the biggest power users – huge data centers for artificial intelligence.

Electricity prices could jump 15% to 40% in just the next 5 years, according to a recent forecast. And prices have already begun to jump. Retail electric prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022 – rising 13%.

Make no mistake, high electricity prices are now America's most pressing energy problem, affecting everybody, from the ordinary citizen to the huge corporation.

Ohio is part of the PJM Interconnection, a 13-state regional grid operator, the largest in the nation. Shortages in the supply of electricity – and even higher power prices – may affect PJM and the neighboring MISO grid in the Midwest sooner than other regions of the country. Both grids are staring down rapidly approaching capacity shortfalls.

Our electric power usage for AI data centers, electrification and industrialization is growing rapidly and supply is struggling to keep up. Some utilities in the Midwest have encountered demand levels they did not project for a decade. And we’re learning in real time the evolving mix of resources on the grid is proving ill-equipped for periods of peak demand.

During a recent heatwave, the MISO grid, which at times gets 25 GW of wind power – enough for 15 million homes – got just 1 GW of wind generation when power demand was its highest. Brutal heat and no wind left ten-of-billions of dollars in wind investments hulking statues. It was the coal and natural gas fleets that once again came to the rescue.

Our supply of power has almost no margin for error. And the situation is growing more challenging. While rising power prices are a signal to bring new generating capacity to the market, demand is growing faster than our ability to meet it.

New power plants and energy infrastructure – like pipelines and transmission lines -take years of planning and development before they can be connected to the grid. New data centers, on the other hand, with the power needs of entire cities or state are going from the drawing board to operational in a matter of months.

Ohio is already home to 172 data centers, the fourth largest total in the nation. But the next generation of data centers developed to serve the needs of AI dwarf these existing facilities. Consider the data centers tech giant Meta is building, including in Ohio. Just one of these data centers – scheduled to begin service next year – will have the power needs of the entire state of Nevada.

While policymakers are grappling with the challenge presented by the AI boom, and trying to regulate the impact these data centers will have on power markets, the onus must be on tech companies to step up.

Tech giants are placing orders for their own natural gas facilities and are even contracting to bring next generation nuclear power plants to the grid. While helpful, these are solutions for tomorrow while the impact on consumers is already biting today.

What tech companies have not done – at least so far – is embrace the existing coal fleet. It’s a glaring mistake.

Despite soaring electricity demand, many existing coal plants are scheduled to close early—a response to years of state and federal regulatory pressure. Losing these plants is simply incompatible with this moment.

Tech giants have the resources to ensure these facilities not only aren’t pushed off the grid but can be used far more efficiently to meet rising demand.

Addressing soaring electricity prices is going to take creative solutions. And the companies driving the surge must lead the way.

Consumers deserve reliable and affordable electricity, and the knowledge the corporations driving the surge in power prices are doing all they can to confront it.

President of the United States Donald Trump signed The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a move that substantially alters the nation's energy investment and supply chain landscape, as detailed in a report by Rystad Energy. The legislation reverses key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), shortening tax credit timelines for renewable energy while extending support for biofuels and fossil fuels.

The act accelerates the expiration of tax credits for wind, solar, and clean hydrogen projects. Solar and wind facilities must now begin construction within 12 months and be operational by the end of 2027, a significant contraction from the previous 2032 deadline. This compressed timeline is expected to trigger a rush among developers to secure project materials and qualify for incentives before the window closes.

New domestic content and foreign entity restrictions are central to the OBBBA's changes. To qualify for tax credits, projects must meet escalating sourcing thresholds for components, which top out at 90% for some equipment. Data from the IndexBox platform indicates these rules will necessitate a rapid and costly restructuring of clean energy manufacturing supply chains to prioritize domestic or ally-sourced materials.

The legislation introduces benefits for the oil and gas sector, particularly for companies operating on federal lands. A reduction in federal royalty rates and the reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures are projected to lower breakeven prices for new production by one to two dollars per barrel in most core US shale plays.

The OBBBA's provisions are projected to reshape global energy trade flows, creating advantages for North American biofuel feedstocks and disadvantaging foreign entities.

The key is on the Atlantic Ocean wind that will be captured by 176 wind turbines installed offshore, around 38 km from the Virginia Beach coast. Each of these turbines will be about 100 meters high and it will take advantage of the wind’s strength that constantly blows in the open sea, to generate free polluting emissions energy. So, let’s learn more about this interesting project that could benefit the environment.

Clean energy

The aim of this project is to produce 2,600 megawatts of electricity, which is 2,600,000 kilowatts. To have a clear picture of what this means, we could say that this amount of energy could keep lights, home appliances, and electric devices on thousands of families in the entire state of Virginia.

Apart from its environmental contribution, this project is going to have a huge impact on Virginia’s energy independence. I mean it will lower its dependence on power plants that work with coal, gas or petroleum. Less pollution for our planet, hurray!

Local economy

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will also improve the economy of the region. During the construction, more than 1,000 jobs will be created and once the wind farm starts functioning, those jobs will continue being useful for operations and maintenance.

It is estimated that the economic impact will be hundreds of millions of dollars per year for Virginia. Also, it is expected the state will save about $3,000 millions in fuel costs for the first 10 years of the wind farm functioning.

Day and night energy

One of the positive things about offshore wind turbines is that they can generate electricity day and night, as long as there’s wind. In the open sea, the wind is more constant and stronger than in solid ground.

The project is also taking measures to protect marine life. During the process of the turbines installation, some special protocols have been implemented to minimize the impact on whales, dolphins, fish, and other species that live in nearby Virginia Beach.

Virginia’s energy future

This offshore wind farm wasn’t thought of as an isolated project, it is part of a wider strategy to transform Virginia into a clean energy leader in the U.S. The project shows evidence that the Atlantic Ocean can be a great source of renewable energy, and that investing in green technology is both beneficial for the planet and the local economy. So, everybody wins!

The CVOW joins other efforts of the country to diversify its sources of energy, reducing dependency on fossil fuels and strengthening energy safety. Now Virginia will have its own stable clean energy source.

What’s coming next?

The wind farm is expected to have the 176 turbines completely installed and functioning by 2026. However, the project has already started being built in 2023. Once this is finished, the energy will go through underwater cables toward the regional electric network (how crazy, right?). So, many homes and companies in Virginia will directly benefit from it. This project is a turning point in the way energy is produced in the state of Virginia, but also it will be a great example for other similar projects in the U.S. and around the world.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/virginia-offshore-wind-turbines-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 08:01:10.869675

This launch will transform everything we know about automotive sustainability, demonstrating that electric cars may not be the only solution for a cleaner future. Discover the German giant behind this project and what we can expect from this incredible synthetic fuel.

The secret project from a German company

The automotive industry has been increasingly seeking more sustainable solutions for its vehicles. The old ways of generating energy and producing fuel are no longer acceptable due to the alarming increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which are very harmful to the environment. With new regulations to reduce the carbon footprint within the automotive sector, companies are investing in more sustainable and clear fuel manufacturing technologies.

With this in mind, a renowned German company has decided to invest in a secret project, envisioning a cleaner future for the automotive sector. The company aims to become a pioneer with this unexpected and innovative new launch: the company is working on a hydrogen fuel cell and a super-tech car with 2,000-kilometer range, to accommodate this hydrogen fuel cell pill. The company behind this new and green project is Volkswagen, one of the leading players in the automotive market.

The model hasn’t been officially launched yet, but when it hits the market, it will be Volkswagen’s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. This project is being manufactured in partnership with another German company, Kraftwerk Tubes, and the two are preparing to pioneer this new market that’s opening up in the automotive industry: the search for clean energy options beyond the more common electric cars.

Will Volkswagen abandon the manufacture of electric cars?

Despite Volkswagen’s decision to invest in this synthetic fuel project, the company assures that it will not be completely abandoning the development of electric vehicles. The model has seen a decline in production and growth — fell by about 15% and 40% in Europe —, not only at the German company but globally. This is related to several issues, such as the electric motor manufacturing process and the cost involved. These are precisely the reason that led Volkswagen to invest in other models.

Electric cars are known for commanding high market prices. Both their production and sales are quite expensive, and maintaining such a car ends up being costly and unaffordable for most people worldwide. With this in mind, Volkswagen is interested in connecting with this audience by offering its new hydrogen fuel cell car and another model, which will be electric but aims to be more affordable.

Volkswagen is already the leader in electric car sales in German — even surpassing the famous Tesla. Now, by adopting this new stance of maintaining more affordable prices for electric cars, the brand hopes to counter the prices of Chinese models, which are responsible for the decline in sales figures for European companies. With the cell of these two new projects, Volkswagen has everything it needs to leads the automotive industry into the future of the energy transition.

The future of the automotive industry has more than one option

As mentioned earlier, this Volkswagen project has not yet been officially launched; hydrogen fuel cell technologies is still in the conceptual stage. But there is undoubtedly a lot of anticipation.

This technology is expected to be more productive and affordable than current market trend, and hydrogen is considered the fuel of the future. After the company’s patent filling for this project, we hope to see other companies in the sector invest in this technology, moving towards an energy transition.

The Burden of Limited Electricity Access Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 100 million people.
The country is experiencing rapid population growth, which has contributed to challenges such as food insecurity, environmental strain and low electricity access.
Looking Ahead Access to electricity in Ethiopia has risen to 55.4% and continues to grow rapidly.","The continent of Africa has one of the lowest electricity access rates in the world, making life more difficult for millions of people. Africa is home to 19% of the world’s population, yet many—mostly in sub-Saharan Africa—are living without electricity. Those who do have access often rely on power sources that are unreliable and unsustainable. Electricity demand has continued to grow over time, especially in Ethiopia, but the World Bank has been making moves to change that.

The ELEAP Program

The Ethiopia Electrification Program (ELEAP) is under the leadership of the World Bank Group. Its main goal is to reach complete electrification in Ethiopia by the end of 2025 and to support the rollout of new electrification systems. The plan is to expand electricity through solar mini-grids, with some grid (65%) and some off-grid (35%) energy systems.

So far, the results have been positive. As of 2025, the program has made strong progress. From March 1, 2018, to June 4, 2024, 6.3 million people gained access to on-grid electricity sources. Solar energy is the most viable option for renewable energy and the most reliable source, as it has already been a major part of Ethiopia’s electrical landscape. The implementation of solar energy fits easily with the systems already in place, which allows them to work together effectively. Because of these systems, more than 19,000 public facilities have gained access to electricity, including health clinics and schools. Forecasts suggest that by 2026, 10 million more people in Ethiopia will have access to electricity.

The Burden of Limited Electricity Access

Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 100 million people. The country is experiencing rapid population growth, which has contributed to challenges such as food insecurity, environmental strain and low electricity access. Even though Ethiopia has substantial renewable energy resources, most of the population still relies on traditional biomass energy such as firewood and coal.

Even when households have access to power, financial constraints often prevent them from using it. Most electricity needs are for cooking, but the existing systems are not large-scale enough to provide the energy required for all Ethiopians to prepare their meals. As electricity reaches more areas, household chores have become easier since many families can now use electric stoves instead of fire-burning stoves, saving time and benefiting the environment. Solar-powered water pumps have also been introduced to provide clean water to rural communities.

Before the introduction of new energy systems, women and children had to go outside and search for wood to use as fuel and poor households had to devote all their income to energy. With expanded access, energy is now reaching both large infrastructure projects and poor urban communities.

Looking Ahead

Access to electricity in Ethiopia has risen to 55.4% and continues to grow rapidly. ELEAP has made significant progress in electrifying the country within just a few years. The outlook for Ethiopia and ELEAP remains positive, with sustainable energy sources supporting growth and improving the lives of many.

Now 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, we stand together as those who not just refuse to be silenced but who demand and reimagine anew.","“WE HAVE THE BODY BAGS READY.”

Though it was more than 25 years ago, I still feel the chill that ran through my body in a conference room in the wetlands of Northern California. I was a graduate student on a multi-university, interdisciplinary wetland restoration project team. We, a group of scientists from the south and west, had convened near one of our research sites, and a prominent plant biologist from Louisiana who spent her career researching the wetlands of New Orleans was presenting her work. It was four years prior to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, when we were naïve to the harsh reality that the government, at all levels, could and would devastatingly fail the most vulnerable Americans during an unprecedented natural disaster, leaving human tragedy in its wake.

Recall that in New Orleans, in the face of the catastrophic hurricane assigned the name Katrina, it was the levee system that did not hold, that burst sending water gushing back into the Lower Ninth Ward and other impoverished areas. Our project team was exploring what happens to wetland ecosystems when levee systems like the one that broke (i.e., an elevated humanmade barrier or embankment constructed to stop the natural flow of water often to create dry developable land) breach naturally over time. During her presentation, four years before Katrina, the plant biologist said she knew with certainty that if a massive storm hit, the levee systems in New Orleans would not hold. Four years prior to Katrina, she urgently shared this information with government officials, warning them of the imminent threat particularly to poor, elderly, and Black residents if the levee system broke. But instead of taking action to bolster the failing system, she was told: “We have the body bags ready.”

Warnings ignored before the storm

What have we learned in the 20 years since Hurricane Katrina? Twenty years after the dehumanization of the Superdome, the false and racialized narratives conflating looting with survival, the gutting helicopter footage of primarily poor and Black Americans seeking refuge on sinking rooftops, the government, at local, state, and federal levels collectively left the most vulnerable communities to drown and then fight for their lives on their own.

Surely, we’ve made advances since 2005 to increase disaster response. We certainly have. Yet it’s difficult to see that progress as the current federal administration systematically dismantles the upstanding science agencies designed to keep Americans safe. Innovations that include: advances in extreme weather modeling and forecasting, efficient warning systems, effective evacuation mechanisms, comprehensive disaster recovery plans and strategies. For example, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency foundational to our knowledge and understanding of extreme weather events has been decimated and the experts that created and perfected hurricane modeling and tracking have been fired. Likewise, it is the knowledge of experts at the National Weather Service (also part of NOAA) used to issue timely severe weather watches and warnings. Further, these lifesaving warnings and evacuation orders, that allow people time to plan and escape are being silenced.

Just this summer Congress unconscionably voted to cancel funding for the Center for Public Broadcasting which supports the very public radio that broadcasts critical extreme weather information to impacted areas, especially in rural regions that may not have access to other information sources. Finally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), designed to help Americans navigate unexpected disasters that leave their lives in disarray was merged with the Department of Homeland Security and lacks leadership and expertise. We saw the consequences of these unconscionable elimination decisions that allowed incompetence and dysfunction to lead the response in Texas during the floods that took too many lives; urgent calls unanswered, critical funding inaccessible, emergency warning systems failed. The slice of human tragedy we witnessed in Texas is a warning of what is to come on much larger scales as climate change increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events. We must act now.

Reimagine, resist, stand together

What can we do? How do we maintain hope and possibility as publicly available climate data and tools are erased from federal websites, limiting the ability to make evidence-based decisions? As agencies like the National Science Foundation terminate grants that engage in climate science research because they “no longer effectuate agency priorities;” an experience I know too well, having lost my NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award that supports science teachers and students as community-based climate action researchers.

What we do is we reimagine, we resist, we collectively stand up. For inspiration, I look to sources of bravery and determination in and outside of science including: Data scientists saving and archiving tools that the government has tried to erase, scientists at the National Institutes of Health and on, issuing powerful statements of ethics and solidarity; persistent Americans, especially in red states, who attend town halls demanding that politicians answer to them, their constituents; residents of Los Angeles peacefully marching in solidarity with their immigrant neighbors and in defiance of a president who they will not allow to mischaracterize them; artists who reject the attempted erasure of their creativity because U.S. history and politics, in its truth telling, isn’t supposed to be comfortable.

As a professor I see the young people across this nation fighting to be heard, demanding the future they desire and envisioning it into being. We must stand up for science because science can be used to keep us all safe, especially the most vulnerable among us. Now 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, we stand together as those who not just refuse to be silenced but who demand and reimagine anew.

The federal government’s decision to pause the 2026 target of requiring 20% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales—originally set under Justin Trudeau—reflects a shift toward prioritizing industry competitiveness amid U.S. trade pressures. While this move has been welcomed by automakers like General Motors and Ford as a reprieve from unrealistic mandates, it raises critical questions about the sustainability of Canada’s climate goals and the resilience of its EV supply chain in a volatile trade environment.

Short-Term Relief: Industry Flexibility and Tariff Mitigation

The pause of the 2026 EV mandate, announced by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is part of a broader strategy to alleviate financial strain on the auto sector caused by U.S. tariffs. These tariffs, including a 25% duty on non-U.S. vehicle imports and additional levies on steel and aluminum, have disrupted supply chains and forced automakers to reevaluate production strategies [1]. By removing the 2026 sales target, the government aims to provide automakers with greater flexibility to adjust to market realities. GM Canada’s president, Kristian Aquilina, praised the decision, arguing that EV adoption should align with consumer demand rather than government-imposed timelines [2].

The pause also coincides with the temporary resumption of the iZEV Program’s claims portal, allowing dealerships to submit unprocessed rebates for eligible vehicles. However, the program remains paused for new incentives, leaving consumers without financial support for EV purchases [3]. This gap in consumer incentives could slow adoption rates, particularly as EV prices rise due to tariffs and supply chain costs.

U.S. Tariffs and Supply Chain Reconfiguration

The U.S. trade war has amplified the challenges for North American automakers. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese EVs and non-U.S. auto parts have forced companies to localize production and rethink sourcing strategies. For example, Honda delayed its $15 billion EV production hub in Ontario, citing tariffs and slower market demand as key factors [4]. Similarly, General Motors has prioritized localized battery production to reduce costs and mitigate trade risks, aiming to cut battery cell costs by $30 per kilowatt hour in 2025 [5].

The Canadian government’s $5 billion aid package for firms affected by tariffs further underscores the urgency of reshoring efforts. However, this support does not extend to the steel and aluminum industries, which have been disproportionately impacted by U.S. levies [6]. This uneven relief highlights the fragility of Canada’s industrial strategy in a trade environment increasingly shaped by protectionism.

Long-Term Risks: Climate Goals and Market Uncertainty

While the 2026 pause offers short-term relief, it introduces long-term risks for Canada’s climate commitments. Environmental advocates warn that delaying EV targets could undermine efforts to increase supply and lower prices for consumers [7]. The 2030 and 2035 goals of achieving 60% and 100% ZEV sales, respectively, remain intact, but the absence of a 2026 benchmark may erode momentum. Provinces like British Columbia have maintained their EV mandates, creating a patchwork of regulations that complicate national coordination [8].

Financial analysts also caution that policy uncertainty could deter private investment in EV infrastructure. The Parliamentary Budget Officer’s analysis of production subsidies for Stellantis-LGES and Volkswagen highlights geographic and economic risks in scaling the EV supply chain [9]. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada’s assessment of weak productivity growth underscores broader challenges in reallocating capital to support electrification [10].

Strategic Adjustments and Investment Trends

North American automakers are adapting to these dynamics by shifting R&D and capital toward localized battery production and nearshoring. Ford and GM have announced significant investments in U.S. and Canadian plants to meet USMCA compliance and reduce reliance on foreign components [11]. However, the absence of federal rebates and the potential influx of cheaper Chinese EVs into Canada threaten to erode market share for domestic producers [12].

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) recent rollback of EV tax credits further complicates the investment outlook. This policy reversal could reduce consumer demand and slow the pace of electrification, particularly in cross-border markets where Canadian automakers compete with U.S. and Chinese rivals [13].

Conclusion: Balancing Competitiveness and Climate Objectives

Canada’s EV policy pivot reflects a pragmatic response to immediate economic pressures but risks undermining long-term climate and industrial goals. While the pause provides automakers with short-term flexibility, it also exposes the sector to heightened trade volatility and reduced consumer incentives. For North American automakers and suppliers, the path forward requires a delicate balance between aligning with regulatory shifts and maintaining commitments to decarbonization. As the 60-day review of the EV Availability Standard (EVAS) unfolds, stakeholders must advocate for policies that harmonize climate ambitions with market realities—ensuring that Canada remains a competitive player in the global EV transition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 10:00:53.132519

Türkiye’s upcoming Renewable Energy Resource Zone (YEKA) tenders in November and December are expected to attract about $3.3 billion in investment, allocating 2,000 megawatts (MW) of wind and solar capacity across 12 provinces.

The projects aim to cut reliance on imported energy, expand domestic clean power use and strengthen the country’s renewable manufacturing base.

YEKA, a special tender model, is designed to allocate large-scale wind and solar projects, encourage local manufacturing, and attract foreign and domestic investment.

Six wind projects totaling 1,150 MW will be auctioned in Sivas, Balıkesir, Aydın, Denizli, and Kütahya, with project sizes ranging from 110 MW to 500 MW.

Nine solar projects, ranging from 40 MW to 260 MW, will be tendered in Elazığ, Kahramanmaraş, Erzurum, Bolu, Eskişehir, Mardin, and Van.

Alongside YEKA tenders, Türkiye is also advancing floating solar power projects. In Manisa's Demirkopru Dam reservoir, a 35-megawatt floating solar installation is planned.

To meet its 2035 energy targets, Türkiye recently passed a reform law to streamline permitting and approval processes, aiming to accelerate investments.

The government also plans to strengthen transmission infrastructure with 14,700 kilometers of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines totaling 40 gigawatts of capacity.

An additional 15,000 km of alternating current lines will be built, while interconnection capacity is set to reach 6750 MW for exports and 6600 MW for imports.

Alper Kalaycı, the head of Energy Industrialists and Businessmen Association (ENSIA), told state-run Anadolu Agency that wind projects from the tenders are expected to generate about $2.3 billion in investment, while solar projects will account for roughly $1 billion.

These large-scale YEKA projects will particularly benefit companies producing domestic components in the renewable energy sector, he added.

They will also help firms shape their future plans, he explained and added that demand is rising for wind equipment such as turbine blades, towers and generators, as well as for solar panels and other components.

""Localizing production not only boosts demand but also contributes to technological development,"" Kalayci concluded.

Hakan Erkan, secretary-general of the Turkish Solar Energy Industrialists and Industry Association (GENSED), said the 35-megawatt floating solar project planned at the Demirköprü Dam reservoir would attract about $20 million in investment.

Erkan added that floating solar plants help conserve water by reducing evaporation through their shading effect.

Co-published with Inside Climate News and The Texas Tribune

( ProPublica ) – Hakim Dermish moved to the small South Texas town of Catarina in 2002 in search of a rural lifestyle on a budget. The property where he lived with his wife didn’t have electricity or sewer lines at first, but that didn’t bother him.

“Even if we lived in a cardboard box, no one could kick us out,” Dermish said.

Back then, Catarina was a sleepy place. A decade later, oil and gas drilling picked up, and he welcomed the financial opportunities it brought. Dermish launched businesses to support the industry, offering everything from guards for drill sites to housing for oil field workers.

The growth also brought flares — flames burning off excess natural gas — that blazed day and night at wells in the surrounding countryside. Initially enamored of the industry’s potential, Dermish now worried that its pollution endangered the health of the town’s 75 residents. He began lodging complaints with the state in 2023, asking it to push companies to control emissions.

Inspectors with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated, finding only a handful of violations, some of which the companies addressed. But that did little to allay the concerns of Dermish and his neighbors, who continued to see flares light up the sky and to smell gas wafting over the community.

“Starting first thing in the morning, talk about the stench. Then you call the state and nothing happens,” Dermish said. “They do absolutely nothing.”

His neighbor Lupe Campos, who worked in the oil fields for more than three decades, lives three blocks from a flare. Toxic hydrogen sulfide escapes from nearby wells, giving the air the smell of “burnt rotten eggs,” Campos said. “It’s hard to bear.”

While working to expand the nation’s oil and gas production, President Donald Trump’s administration has maintained that drilling in the U.S. is cleaner than in other countries due to tighter environmental oversight. To mark Earth Day, for example, the White House boasted in a statement that increased natural gas exports meant the U.S. would be “sharing cleaner energy with allies” and “reducing global emissions.”

But Texas, the heart of America’s oil and gas industry, tells a different story.

Texas regulators tout their efforts to curtail oil field emissions by requiring drillers to obtain permits to release or burn gas from their wells.

Yet a first-of-its-kind analysis of permit applications to the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state’s main oil and gas regulator, reveals a rubber-stamp system that allows drillers to emit vast amounts of natural gas into the atmosphere. Over 40 months — from May 2021 to September 2024 — oil companies applied for more than 12,000 flaring and venting permits, while the Railroad Commission rejected just 53 of them, a 99.6% approval rate, according to the data.

Natural gas is composed mostly of climate-warming methane but also contains other gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which is deadly at high concentrations. Gas escapes as wells are drilled and before infrastructure is in place to capture it. It also can be intentionally released if pressure in the system poses a safety risk or if capturing and transporting it to be sold is not profitable. Typically, drillers burn the gas they don’t capture, converting the methane to carbon dioxide, a less potent greenhouse gas, in a process called flaring. Sometimes, they release the gas without burning it, in a process called venting.

The permit applications showed oil companies requested to flare or vent more than 195 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, enough to power more than 3 million homes and generate millions of dollars of tax revenue had the gas been captured. Those emissions would have a climate-warming impact roughly equivalent to 27 gas-fired power plants operating year-round, even if the flares burned every molecule of methane released from the wells.

“It’s a gargantuan amount of emissions,” said Jack McDonald, senior analyst of energy policy and science for the environmental group Oilfield Witness. “Because so much of this gas is methane and so much of it is either incompletely combusted or not combusted at all through the venting process, we see a huge climate impact.”

Oilfield Witness gathered and studied the Railroad Commission data on exemptions to the state’s flaring rules and shared it with ProPublica and Inside Climate News. The news organizations verified the data, including by soliciting input from professors at universities in Texas.

Railroad Commission spokesperson R.J. DeSilva said in a statement that Texas has made “significant progress” in addressing methane emissions. Companies must provide evidence that flaring is necessary, and, when approving permits, the agency follows all applicable rules, he said. “If an application lacks sufficient justification, it is returned with comments for clarification.”

“I am proud of the progress that has been made to reduce the waste of our natural resources,” Jim Wright, chair of the Railroad Commission, said in a statement, adding that “there is always room for further improvement.”

The analysis likely overstates emissions, since the near-guarantee that regulators will approve a permit gives companies an incentive to request authorization for amounts larger than they intend to emit to ensure they’re in compliance. For example, operators in four Texas counties flared about 70% of the volume of gas that their permits allowed, according to a recent effort to compare the state’s flaring data to information collected via satellite. And the Railroad Commission sometimes approves flaring smaller volumes than requested, which is not captured in the data.

“The Texas oil and natural gas industry is committed to ongoing progress in reducing flaring and methane emissions while continuing to meet the ever-growing demand for reliable oil and natural gas across the globe,” Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, a trade group, told ProPublica and Inside Climate News in a statement.

Residents of communities surrounded by flares and leaking wells, like Catarina, want the state and the industry to do more to control oil field emissions. The Railroad Commission approved eight flares within 5 miles of the town during the study period and 280 across surrounding Dimmit County, according to agency data.

The danger posed by the gas became impossible to ignore on March 27, as a 30-inch steel pipeline a half-mile from Catarina failed. The rupture blasted more than 23 million cubic feet of gas into the air, as much as is used in 365 homes in a year, according to data the company that owns the pipeline, Energy Transfer, reported to the Railroad Commission.

Dermish recorded the chaos with his cellphone. “The house is shaking,” he says in the video as the escaping gas roars, its concussions jostling the camera.

Fearing for their safety, he and his wife evacuated, heading to a neighboring town for the day. After they returned home that evening, he called the sheriff to ask what had happened. During the conversation, Dermish could feel the gas causing him to slur his words. The next morning, Dermish noticed new gas flares, presumably lit to release pressure in the pipeline network by burning excess gas. A cellphone video he recorded shows a towering column of flame, taller than a nearby telephone pole, billowing and rippling.

“Have you ever seen ‘Lord of the Rings’? Do you remember the Fire of Mordor?” Dermish said in an interview. “That’s what we have here.”

An incident report submitted to the state by Energy Transfer attributed the pipeline failure to a technician’s errors. Without objection from the Railroad Commission, the pipeline was repaired and back in service three days later. The agency did not assess Energy Transfer with a violation or a fine.

Energy Transfer did not respond to a request for comment.

After more than two decades in Catarina, Dermish and his wife are planning to move away. “It’s just too dangerous,” he said.

Is American Oil and Gas Cleaner?

While the Trump administration characterizes American oil and gas as cleaner than fossil fuels from other countries, it has rolled back rules regulating methane.

The Environmental Protection Agency has, under Trump, delayed implementing previously finalized rules that would’ve mandated that the industry monitor for methane leaks and address them. He and Republicans in Congress also repealed the country’s first-ever tax on methane. And in June, Trump revoked a Biden administration guidance document laying out how companies should comply with a law aimed at reducing methane leaks from pipelines.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

As the nation’s highest-producing oil and gas state, Texas is a key barometer of the U.S. regulatory environment and whether it has created a cleaner fossil fuel industry.

The Permian Basin — the country’s largest oil field, which straddles the Texas-New Mexico border — was estimated by a 2024 study to emit the second-most methane of any oil field in the world.

The industry disputes that finding, pointing to a June report from S&P Global Commodity Insights that found that the rate of methane emissions in the Permian Basin dropped 29% between 2023 and 2024. “Methane emissions management” is increasingly a part of the industry’s operations, Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at S&P, said in a statement announcing the findings. However, S&P’s report acknowledged that satellite data showed a much more modest reduction of 4%, contradicting the company’s own data, which was collected by airplane.

“We can say confidently that there is no evidence that methane emissions from the Permian Basin are low,” said Steven Hamburg, who studies methane as the Environmental Defense Fund’s chief scientist.

Texas’ Attempt to Rein In Flaring

In Texas, State Rule 32 prohibits flaring and venting gas at wells, except under a few specific conditions: while the well is being drilled, during the first 10 days after the well is completed and when necessary to ensure safety. Otherwise, drillers must seek an exception.

The Railroad Commission changed the application process for these exemptions in 2020 and issued new guidance in 2021. Operators would have to explain why they could not suspend drilling to avoid flaring and indicate that they had investigated all options for using the gas before flaring.

Oilfield Witness gathered all exemption requests since 2021, which showed the agency repeatedly approving permits that failed to comply with its guidelines. In many cases, oil companies asked to flare indefinitely or didn’t justify why they needed to flare, leaving blank the section of the application asking why the exemption was needed.

Capturing the gas requires an expensive system of pipelines, compressors and other infrastructure that can cost more than the gas is worth. In their permit applications, companies cite this reality, often listing financial considerations as the reason for seeking exemptions, Oilfield Witness found. These were nearly always approved, even though the agency wrote that finances were an insufficient explanation in a presentation on the permitting process.

“The Railroad Commission seems very interested in devolving decision-making processes to the companies themselves,” McDonald said.

The data also showed that nearly 90% of the approved permit applications were backdated, retroactively giving permission for flares that were already burning. Oil companies typically asked the Railroad Commission for permission to flare 10 days after they had already burned the gas.

A spokesperson said that when the commission revamped its guidelines in 2020, it allowed a longer period in which companies could file for a permit after they’d already started to flare. Even so, nearly 900 of the permits were applied for after the updated filing window and still accepted by the agency.

The Railroad Commission also approved more than 7,000 flares within areas where the gas reservoir being drilled was known to be high in hydrogen sulfide, increasing the likelihood that the toxic gas could escape into the air. Of those flares, 600 were within a mile of a residence, the agency’s data showed.

Minimizing flaring permits is “not a priority in any sense” for the Railroad Commission, said Gunnar Schade, an associate professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. “The priority is oil produced, and that means revenue for the state. Oil and gas is a priority, so who cares about the flaring?”

Overstating the Progress

The Railroad Commission and the state’s oil industry trumpet their work to reduce flaring. The agency points to state data showing flaring rates dropping dramatically, specifically since 2019. And the Texas Oil and Gas Association announced in early August that drillers in the Permian Basin “slashed methane emission intensity by more than half in just two years.”

But such claims are misleading, according to experts such as David DiCarlo, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s petroleum engineering school. Using 2019 as a starting point leaves a false impression that there’s been a sharp decline, he said, as methane emissions that year were staggeringly high due to booming production and inadequate pipeline capacity to gather the gas.

DeSilva, the Railroad Commission’s spokesperson, defended using 2019 as the baseline because “about five years ago we began taking proactive steps to reduce flaring in Texas.”

Taking a longer view shows that a median of 2.2% of gas at Texas oil wells was flared or vented over the past decade, according to a ProPublica and Inside Climate News review of state data. (Flaring at gas wells is rare because those sites have the necessary pipeline infrastructure in place to collect the gas.) That figure hovered just north of 2% in the most recently available data, representing a much smaller drop than the state and industry claim. The industry still hasn’t built sufficient pipeline networks to capture gas at oil wells, so, as production rises, so does flaring and venting.

“They can’t get it below 2% because they keep drilling,” DiCarlo said. Since emissions are highest when a well is being drilled, overall emissions will remain high as long as the industry is drilling new wells. “That’s just the nature of the beast.”

Among the largest beneficiaries of the state’s lax permitting system was an oil company called Endeavor Energy Resources. More than half the approved permanent flaring exemptions went to Endeavor, which merged with the $40 billion Diamondback Energy in September 2024. Endeavor also applied for the longest flaring permit — 6,300 days, or more than 17 years. The Railroad Commission approved the permit without shortening its duration.

Diamondback Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

The industry has simultaneously claimed that it is addressing methane while bristling at oversight.

Steven Pruett is the president and CEO of Elevation Resources, a Permian Basin oil company, and the immediate past chair of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, one of the industry’s main trade groups. His company saw a 2,408% increase in flaring immediately following new wells being drilled and a 692% increase in flaring overall in 2023, according to emails unearthed by environmental watchdog organization Fieldnotes and shared with ProPublica and Inside Climate News. In the email exchange with University of Texas faculty who were preparing a grant application for a federal methane-reduction program, Pruett blamed the increases on inadequate infrastructure to capture the gas.

Just weeks later, Pruett participated in a tour of the oil field alongside EPA staff, where he echoed the claim that the American oil and gas industry is cleaner than others and that drilling companies were complying with efforts to reduce emissions.

During his term at the helm of the national trade group, it spearheaded multiple lawsuits against the EPA over the government’s methane rules.

Pruett did not respond to a request for comment.

“A Constant Roar”

Those opposed to flaring face long odds in halting the practice, even in rare instances when the Railroad Commission hears objections.

Consider the experience of Tom Pohlman, then sheriff of Fisher County, who had a flare burning next to his home in the Texas Panhandle starting in October 2023. The driller responsible for it, Patton Exploration, solicited companies to extend a pipeline to the oil well to capture the gas and evaluated whether the gas could be used to mine bitcoin. But by July 2024, it still had no deal, so the company sought another permit to continue flaring up to 1 million cubic feet of gas per day for 18 months. “Patton is diligently pursuing every avenue possible to find a solution, but still needs more time,” the company wrote in its application.

When Pohlman learned that Patton Exploration had applied for a new permit, he and his neighbors urged the Railroad Commission to deny it.

“The sound that comes from the flame is a constant roar that we can hear throughout our property both day and night,” the neighbors wrote in their objection. “There is no peace and quiet since the day of its ignition.”

In September 2024, Pohlman became one of the few people to officially challenge a flaring permit in Texas, as he and Patton Exploration representatives went head-to-head in a hearing before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge.

“For approximately 20 of my residents in this area, it completely lights up their yard and everything else,” Pohlman said, telling the judge that the flare was 45 feet high. “I just need liveability for this neighborhood. We’ve had nothing but issues here.”

Patton Exploration’s lawyer, David Gross, acknowledged the neighbors’ frustrations but emphasized the importance of keeping the well pumping.

“You can’t produce the oil without producing the gas,” he told the judge. “It’s the public policy of Texas that the recoverable oil and gas in the state’s reservoirs be recovered because it is in the public interest.”

In January, the three elected members of the Railroad Commission voted unanimously to approve the permit and allow flaring for another 12 months.",https://media.juancole.com/images/2025/09/texasoil-copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 07:03:25.045578

With recent movements in technology and AI, Political Analyst Scott Mitchell talks through the potential impact it could have in Oklahoma, as the AI and energy consumption conversation grows day by day.

Watch the full conversation above or follow along for the biggest takeaways:

Rising Electricity Demand and Market Pressures

Data centers, AI, and big tech companies are major drivers of increased electricity demand, both in Oklahoma and across the U.S.

There's pressure on the grid and concerns that electricity price inflation will soon outpace the general consumer price index due to this rapid demand growth.

New energy generation projects—especially natural gas—face long lead times (up to four years), creating a ""capacity gap"" where demand may outstrip supply.

Oklahoma’s Energy Mix and Transition

The state has transitioned away from out-of-state coal toward local natural gas and renewables, which has reduced emissions, supported local tax bases, and helped keep electricity prices among the cheapest in the nation.

More than 60 renewable projects in Oklahoma have provided significant local economic benefits, especially to landowners and schools, and have enhanced the state’s ability to export electricity.

Oklahoma’s unique taxation and regulatory structure affects oil, gas, and renewable projects differently—renewables typically provide more direct local benefits while oil and gas provide gross production taxes to the state.

Politics and Policy Tensions

State legislative activities and proposals have led to uncertainty, with some described as “anti-business” or as favoring certain energy sectors over others.

There is a perceived lack of a “level playing field” between renewables and oil and gas in terms of regulatory burdens like setbacks and property rights.

National and state politics—including differences between federal administrations and Oklahoma’s own political factions—further complicate energy policy, sometimes leading to confusion and market disruptions.

Economic and Social Impacts

Keeping a broad mix of energy sources is considered essential for suppressing electricity prices and supporting Oklahoma’s economy; removing options could drive prices up, deter business investment, and negatively impact consumers.

Policy shifts that disadvantage renewables could mean lost opportunities, as energy markets are regional—neighboring states could step in to meet demand, taking economic benefits with them.

The discussion repeatedly highlights the strategic importance of energy affordability and supply in attracting and retaining businesses, and the ripple effect on local economies and jobs.

Energy Policy History and Lessons

Oklahoma’s move away from Wyoming coal toward in-state natural gas and renewables is cited as a major positive development, providing local economic, educational, and environmental benefits.

Lessons include the importance of energy self-reliance, supporting local industry, and ensuring that government policies do not unnecessarily obstruct growth or distort market incentives.",https://fueltools-prod01-public.fuelmedia.io/91fa9954-d7e6-483b-9fc0-19e5940628a5/20250907/ddf9f23c-e927-4951-a4d0-8295dba10bcc/thumbnail_20250907025238946.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 08:01:47.399787

Wind farms are derided as ugly, solar farms as land-grabbers tied to China, and nuclear energy as the patriotic option that showcases American technology and resilience.","Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has been reshaping the United States’ energy policy in ways that have alarmed advocates of renewable energy. His administration has rolled back incentives for wind and solar, halted projects already underway and sought to direct investment toward nuclear power and fossil fuels instead.

According to Reuters, officials close to the president have said the rationale is partly economic, partly aesthetic, and partly nationalistic, as nuclear power is seen as “more American” than wind and solar.

Nuclear as the “patriotic” option

According to Jarrod Agen, director of the US Energy Dominance Council, nuclear power fits more closely with the administration’s long-term vision than other clean energy sources. He argued that nuclear energy is more likely to be built with American parts and by American companies, which makes it a priority for federal financial backing, including loan guarantees and tax breaks, Reuters reported.

Agen described nuclear power as a “long-term play” that had not received the same investment focus as intermittent renewables like wind and solar. He added that the president viewed nuclear expansion as part of a three-pronged strategy to strengthen US energy and technological dominance. These are extending the life of existing coal plants, improving grid efficiency and investing in next-generation nuclear. In this framing, nuclear energy was not just a climate or energy issue but part of a broader competition with China, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence.

Renewables under siege

By contrast, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive stance against wind and solar. Since January, the White House has halted permitting for wind projects on federal land and waters, rescinded Biden-era plans for offshore leasing and revoked permits for projects that were already underway. As per a Bloomberg report, the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island — 80 per cent complete — was ordered to stop construction, ostensibly on national security grounds.

Trump’s Interior Department has also tightened approval processes for renewable projects, requiring personal sign-off from the Secretary of the Interior for all new wind and solar projects on federal land. This effectively subjects proposals to political scrutiny and delays, while simultaneously expanding opportunities for oil and gas drilling.

Why Trump dislikes wind and solar

The president has made no secret of his disdain for wind and solar power. He has long described wind turbines as ugly, inefficient and even dangerous. In July, after visiting his golf resort in Scotland, he reiterated that “windmills are a disgrace,” calling them bird-killing eyesores and “the most expensive form of energy there is”. Years earlier, he had unsuccessfully tried to block an offshore wind project near the same course.

Solar has fared little better in his rhetoric. Trump has mocked large solar farms as “big ugly patches of black plastic” that despoil farmland and rely heavily on Chinese imports. He has also portrayed renewable power more generally as unreliable, citing the fact that the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. While developers have increasingly turned to batteries to address this intermittency, Trump has remained sceptical, Bloomberg reported.

Reversing the Biden legacy

Trump’s hostility to renewables represents a dramatic reversal of the policies put in place by his predecessor. Under Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was hailed as the most significant climate legislation in US history, providing long-term tax credits and subsidies that spurred a wave of investment in clean energy. But the Trump administration has worked quickly to undermine those measures.

The new tax-and-spending law, branded the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” phases out key credits for wind and solar earlier than planned. The Treasury Department has also issued guidance that makes it more difficult for projects to qualify for the remaining incentives. Beyond subsidies, the administration has launched trade probes that could result in new tariffs on wind turbine parts and polysilicon for solar panels, further raising costs for developers.

The cost debate

The administration has justified its actions partly by pointing to rising electricity costs. Officials have argued that adding renewable energy to the grid has driven up prices for households and businesses. Nationally, electricity costs rose at more than twice the rate of inflation over the past year, a trend the White House attributes to the expansion of intermittent power sources, Bloomberg said.

However, independent analyses suggest a different picture. Much of the increase has come not from renewables themselves but from the cost of upgrading the nation’s aging grid. Utilities have been spending heavily on transmission lines, poles and other infrastructure, both to accommodate new sources of energy and to harden systems against extreme weather. According to Bloomberg, analysts warn that slowing down renewables could actually make the supply crunch worse, as coal and gas plants retire and demand grows from industries such as data centres and artificial intelligence.

Economic fallout for the clean energy sector

The administration’s moves have already had significant economic effects. According to the advocacy group E2, $22 billion worth of clean energy projects were scrapped or downsized in the first half of 2025 alone, with job losses and investment shortfalls concentrated in states that had previously benefited from the IRA. Offshore wind, which was just beginning to take off in the US, has been especially hard-hit, as developers face both political uncertainty and financial losses from halted projects.

Smaller and mid-sized renewable developers are considered particularly vulnerable, lacking the resources to weather prolonged policy shifts. Larger firms have expressed cautious optimism that they can continue building projects grandfathered under existing credits, but even they face a tougher economic environment.

Renewables still competitive

Despite the administration’s rhetoric, independent cost assessments show that renewables remain competitive. BloombergNEF estimates that onshore wind and solar are cheap enough to compete directly with new natural gas plants, even without subsidies. Offshore wind remains more expensive but is still cheaper than new nuclear builds, which are slow to construct and face their own economic hurdles.

Blue states like California and New York continue to push forward with renewable energy, seeking to decarbonise their grids regardless of federal policy. Even in red states, renewables have proven popular. Texas, for instance, has led the country in wind generation and ranks second in solar, with most of its new grid capacity since 2020 coming from renewables or batteries. That momentum, however, could falter under Trump’s accelerated subsidy phaseouts.

Long-term outlook

The uncertainty created by Trump’s policies has raised alarms about the long-term outlook for US renewables. Developers and financiers may grow wary of committing to projects if they fear federal support can be withdrawn suddenly, even for projects already near completion. States counting on offshore wind to meet climate goals and rising demand could face setbacks, while the country as a whole risks losing ground in the global clean energy race.

At the same time, the administration’s favoured alternatives — nuclear and fossil fuels — face their own challenges. New nuclear capacity is years away from becoming operational, while gas and coal plants continue to retire due to age and market pressures. As per Bloomberg, analysts warn that slowing renewables could leave the US struggling to meet rising demand while falling behind in energy innovation.

A defining energy philosophy

Ultimately, Trump’s clean energy stance reflects more than economics. It embodies a broader worldview that prizes nationalism, aesthetics and traditional energy dominance over climate goals. Wind farms are derided as ugly, solar farms as land-grabbers tied to China, and nuclear energy as the patriotic option that showcases American technology and resilience.

The result is a sharp break from the trajectory set under Biden and a return to a vision of energy policy where fossil fuels remain central, and nuclear is elevated as the clean alternative worthy of federal support. Whether that approach can deliver affordable, reliable, and competitive energy for the future remains a subject of fierce debate.","https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/08/2-2025-08-44ce44a0c1ca3fd5c3dddb7024d89c69.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)",N,,2025-09-07 08:01:50.690149

The newly released Tesla Model Y L is capturing attention across China, with throngs of potential buyers flocking to showrooms eager to explore this latest addition to Tesla’s electric vehicle lineup. This model enhances the existing Model Y range by offering six seats, as opposed to the traditional five, and is priced at approximately $47,180. Notably, the Model Y L boasts an impressive extended range of up to 751 kilometers (around 467 miles) on a single charge, making it the highest-performing offering within the Model Y series.

Despite a slowdown in Tesla’s sales during the first half of 2025, the overall electric vehicle market is thriving, attributed to decreasing prices, an expanding charging infrastructure, and improvements in vehicle range. This shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) not only provides a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered vehicles but also plays a crucial role in reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change.

Additionally, EV ownership presents long-term financial advantages. As gas prices continue to rise, drivers can benefit from lower operating costs and reduced maintenance requirements associated with EVs. A further cost-saving opportunity exists for those who install solar panels for home charging, allowing them to step away from dependency on the grid or public charging stations. EnergySage offers a streamlined process for comparing quotes from solar panel installers, potentially saving consumers up to $10,000 on installation costs. The combination of EVs and solar energy can significantly diminish individual carbon footprints.

Reports indicate that the Tesla Model Y L has been met with considerable enthusiasm in China, with sources indicating that around 35,000 orders were placed on its launch day. By introducing a higher-range, six-seat option, Tesla seems to be strategically enhancing demand and targeting a broader audience, particularly in a segment that was predominantly filled by the pricier Model X.

Donate Now Building on Bay Area Legacies The Bay Area’s Black churches have long been a force for social change.
“Black churches have always been resilience hubs,” said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis.","HAYWARD, Calif.—On a Sunday morning, the swirling timbre of a Hammond organ drifted into the lobby at Glad Tidings International Church of God in Christ. On the stage, a lively guest preacher, Ronzel Pretlow, roused the congregation in the Hayward, California, church, his raspy voice rising and falling as he sang and shouted, prompting his audience to stand. When the excitement waned, he shifted their attention to Glad Tidings’ founder, Bishop Jerry Macklin, seated in the pulpit.

“I think we owe our Bishop another round of applause for leading us into innovation and creativity,” the preacher said, eliciting a jingle from the organist. “I’m going back home to see if I’ve got room for some electric vehicle chargers,” he joked, knowing the profit that the chargers the church would soon have up and running could bring.

In September, Glad Tidings will complete its new Community Decarbonization Hub—a multipurpose campus featuring a 13,000-square-foot solar-powered building with battery storage and ten EV charging stations. The project, which started four years ago and has a $4.3 million price tag, won’t only cut the church’s energy usage and costs—it’s expected to generate around $500,000 annually. And in five to seven years, as more people charge their vehicles at the church, that amount is projected to double.

Glad Tidings isn’t the only Black church in the Bay Area undergoing this kind of transformation. It’s one of four, thanks to a partnership with Green the Church, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit founded by Reverend Ambrose Carroll, and Gemini Energy Solutions, a cleantech company founded by Stanford University graduate Anthony Kinslow. The hubs Carroll and Kinslow are helping to build won’t only bring clean energy infrastructure to these churches, but also turn them into year-round resilience hubs, ready to support residents when a disaster hits—be it a power outage, wildfire or heatwave.

As climate change progresses and brings more frequent extreme weather events, resilience hubs are becoming increasingly necessary—especially in Black and low-income communities, where legacies of redlining and other forms of racial discrimination have left residents particularly vulnerable. These communities are often the last to receive access to affordable, energy-efficient technology. Still, they persevere through brutal temperatures, hurricanes and other weather disasters, frequently earning praise from political leaders and news media for their resilience.

“Resiliency isn’t enough,” Kinslow said. “Resiliency implies maintaining where you’re at, but I would think most of us would agree that the current baseline isn’t where we want it to be. Communities need to be generating their own money to implement their own decarbonization projects.”

Black churches don’t just need money for decarbonization, but for their basic survival. Across the country, their congregations are shrinking due to aging populations and a larger generational shift away from religion, according to a Gallup study. Unable to rely on tithes and offerings, church leaders are under pressure to find new ways to maintain their buildings—their largest economic assets—and cut costs. Clean energy offers them a way to keep thriving.

Inside the Decarbonization Hub

Bishop Macklin began building his ministry in the late 1970s, when South Hayward was troubled by “drugs, crime, and rampant poverty,” according to the church’s website. Called a “visionary” by many in his circle, about 30 years ago, Bishop Macklin established the Glad Tidings Community Development Corporation (CDC), a separate entity from the church, to help area residents access essential resources, such as food, healthcare and affordable housing. Between the church and the CDC, they’ve acquired enough buildings to cover half a city block.

At the church’s north campus, directly across from the main sanctuary, the new resilience hub features a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium, an exercise room, a STEM lab, a youth lounge, a kitchen and classrooms. Powered by solar energy, the building can accommodate over 500 people in an emergency, providing them with electricity, as well as air conditioning and filtered air. The church will add six EV charging stations to a sliver of parking lot between the resilience hub and the main sanctuary, which will also be equipped with solar panels this fall.

According to Benita McLarin, who leads the Glad Tidings CDC, her team has spent the past six months training a 15-person Community Response Team on fire safety, CPR and mental health first aid. “Bishop Macklin is well respected and people look to him always for answers,” said McLarin, a former military commander and public health official. “He shouldn’t be the only person in our organization who is ready to provide them.”

At the south campus, where the church operates its Spanish-language ministry, four of the fastest EV chargers on the market are already installed under eight solar-paneled carports. McLarin, who drives an EV herself, expects this location to be their greatest revenue generator, as it’s located closest to Highway 880, a major thoroughfare that runs from Oakland to San Jose. Currently, there are few charging options in this part of Hayward, a common issue in many lower-income and Black and brown neighborhoods. These are the same neighborhoods where gig drivers, who often struggle with low wages, tend to live. Access to EVs and charging stations could help them save money in the long term and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process.

According to Kinslow, Glad Tidings will reinvest 80 percent of its profits back into the church and the larger South Hayward community. “We’re actually building more solar than the demand of the buildings, so we make a profit from that [by selling the excess electricity they generate through the public EV charging stations], and then we use that profit for programming,” Kinslow said.

For example, they may use the funding to provide free solar panels and batteries to income-qualifying households or help to finance electric vehicles for people in the neighborhood. “We see this clean energy hub as the starting point to decarbonizing the rest of the community,” he said. Kinslow’s company is also creating a “Neighborhood Decarbonization Index” that utilizes survey data and machine learning to assess greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate neighborhood decarbonization progress over time.

Partners in Energy and Faith

Kinslow completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and spent most of his student years thinking about how to bring renewable energy to communities of color. Inspired by Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” in high school, he wanted to make a difference. He launched Gemini Energy Solutions while he was still in graduate school, with the goal of democratizing clean energy. In 2020, he met Bishop Macklin at an event organized by Carroll’s nonprofit, Green the Church (GTC), and was later introduced to McLarin. A year later, they began crafting a plan to bring the community decarbonization hub to fruition.

Gemini Energy Solutions handles project management and community engagement, while Green the Church rallies clergy and collaborates with their internal “green team.” Rev. Carroll founded GTC fifteen years ago and has built relationships with faith leaders across the country. The organization currently has contracts with more than 15 churches, representing various denominations, to develop Community Decarbonization Hubs. In addition to Glad Tidings, GTC and Gemini are working to build these hubs at three other Bay Area churches: Twenty-Third Avenue Church in Oakland, The Way Christian Center in Berkeley and University AME Zion in Palo Alto. Glad Tidings is the furthest along, and the lessons learned there are shaping the work Kinslow and Carroll are doing at the other churches.

According to Kinslow, Pacific Gas & Electric Company’s (PG&E) delays in connecting the solar panels, battery, master meter and EV chargers to the power grid set the project back by about six months. Now, their construction partner, Imperial Electric Service in Fresno, has a designated interconnection representative at PG&E to accelerate future projects.

Gemini’s project team also realized they needed a contractor to explain the impacts of construction, like loss of parking, “which is a big thing for churches,” Kinslow said.

But perhaps the biggest challenge was the two years it took to find financing.

“We started this project based on faith,” said Carroll, noting this was before the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions in clean energy. But banks struggled to grasp the concept of a Black community generating income rather than an outside company profiting from it, Carroll said. Eventually, he and Kinslow formed a joint entity, Green the Church Renewable Energy Development (GTC R.E.D.), which secured a $3 million revolving loan from the Kresge Foundation to bring clean energy to churches across the country.

More support came from Green Power Ventures, a Black-led investment management firm focused on climate resilience in low- to moderate-income areas, and Freedmen Green Bank & Trust, a Black-led nonprofit and charitable trust devoted to climate resilience and clean energy. And while the churches aren’t putting money into the community decarbonization hubs, Kinslow said, they are investing a lot of “sweat equity.”

Building on Bay Area Legacies

The Bay Area’s Black churches have long been a force for social change. In East Palo Alto, congregants organized community watch programs during times of racial unrest. St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church in Oakland is the birthplace of the Black Panthers’ first free breakfast program, which served undernourished children before school. At the 107-year-old University AME Zion (UAMEZ) church in Palo Alto, they see their forthcoming community decarbonization hub as a continuation of this legacy—and their own commitment to justice.

“When we started talking [about the hub] as a community, it wasn’t like, ‘Why should we do this?’” said UAMEZ Pastor Kaloma Smith. ”It was like, ‘This makes sense for the betterment of our world.’”

Born in Jamaica and raised in New York, Smith arrived at UAMEZ in 2013 to find common challenges facing Black churches, including declining membership. That drop-off is partly from residents leaving Palo Alto—and the state of California—due to rising costs of living, Smith said. The community decarbonization hub is part of his long-term effort to “revitalize” the church and “be more effective, particularly for Gen Z and young families,” for whom he says environmental issues are a top concern.

Working with Kinslow on the hub marks a full-circle moment: he joined the UAMEZ congregation while still a student at Stanford, and approached Pastor Smith with a proposal to replace the sanctuary’s fluorescent lights. “We didn’t really have the money at the time,” said Smith. “But we saw there was phenomenal intersectionality between creating a benefit for the church, the environment and the community.”

Besides installing solar panels and making energy-efficient upgrades, UAMEZ will add 12 to 16 EV charging stations, including eight fast chargers, to its parking lot. Construction of the UAMEZ hub is expected to take only six months, including its connection to the power grid. In the event of an earthquake, Smith envisions UAMEZ as the go-to place for “all the things” residents of midtown Palo Alto might require.

“Black churches have always been resilience hubs,” said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis. But they have the potential to do more, he said, by turning their parking lots into “revenue-generating microgrids” that meet their neighborhoods’ rapidly changing energy and climate needs.

Back in the pulpit at Glad Tidings, pink and purple lights illuminate the stage, casting a glow on Pretlow, the guest preacher, and an attentive congregation. “Prosperity is coming to your house,” he proclaimed, as the bassist plucked his strings. “Favor is getting ready to find your address!” His words seemed fitting for the era Glad Tidings is entering—as if that blessing had already come to pass.

This marks the first project under President Trump’s Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

This development represents an advance in providing modular nuclear energy for manufacturing operations, promising a reliable and sustainable energy source.

The Aalo-X represents a new breed of extra modular reactors (XMR), being positioned strategically next to INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

The target is for the reactor to reach criticality, enabling a self-sustaining nuclear reaction by 4 July 2026.

Aalo Atomics secured this opportunity through the competitive process managed by the US Department of Energy (DOE) as part of their pilot programme.

Government and national laboratory support

The DOE launched the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in June 2025 after Executive Order 14301, reforming testing protocols to authorise advanced nuclear designs at non-traditional sites, thereby fostering innovation for applications such as the growing demands of the manufacturing sector.

Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics, says the selection is a clear signal of public-private alignment: “Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ‘founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago.

“This milestone groundbreaking event is a testament to the potential that can be unlocked when public entities and private companies partner together in the critical interest of the nation.

""This is a pivotal time for the US nuclear energy industry and we are incredibly proud to be at the forefront.”

Designed as a testing site, INL supports technologies aimed at enhancing energy scalability, reliability and deployment speed—crucial for manufacturing facilities that seek consistent, low-impact energy solutions.

“Today’s ground-breaking symbolises the progress that can be achieved when innovation, vision and national purpose come together,” adds John Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL.

“At Idaho National Laboratory, we are proud to support the Department of Energy’s efforts to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen America’s energy security, provide reliable power and inspire the next generation of innovators.

“Projects like Aalo-X reflect the promise of nuclear energy to meet our nation’s historic demand growth and help enable a more prosperous future for our nation.”

Meeting manufacturing energy needs

The Aalo-X reactor serves as a prototype for Aalo’s commercial solution: the Aalo Pod, which is tailored to supply power to manufacturing centres.

Major domestic coal companies, such as CHN Energy, Jinneng and Shaanxi Coal and Chemical, have considerable political influence.
“If China were to set a course for a 1.5C world, it would need to cut emissions by 30% by 2035.","China’s vital statistics

Chinese power took on an old-fashioned hue in the past week with a huge military parade, a gathering of former allies Russia and North Korea, and President Xi Jinping’s defiant vow not to be intimidated by bullies.

That display reminded many of the cold war, but it captured only a fraction of China’s far greater modern influence, primarily built on a formidable economy, dramatic advancements in renewable energy, and a willingness to engage globally with the greatest crisis facing humanity: climate breakdown.

In that sense, the tanks, cannon and missiles that filed past Tiananmen Square may well prove less important in reshaping the world order than the wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars that are churning out of Chinese factories on to fields and roads all over the planet. They are the reason China has already won the battle for the energy of the 21st century.

If history is any guide, the country that dominates energy usually dominates economics and politics, which is why it is not just old war allies that are cosying up to Beijing. Narendra Modi, the president of longtime rival India, also visited China last week for the biggest ever meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation along with dozens of other regional leaders. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, led a delegation to Beijing this summer to coordinate climate policy. The Brazilian executive secretary of Cop30 will visit next week with a similar mission, knowing the success or failure of the annual climate summit now depends on China more than any other nation.

Expectations for Chinese climate leadership are rising in tandem with dismay at the US, which will attend Cop30 as an observer and disrupter that, under Donald Trump, appears to be trying to lurch backwards towards a 20th century comfort zone of oil, gas and coal.

The contrast could become even more striking once China confirms it has reached a positive tipping point after which it will irreversibly shift away from fossil fuels. Last year, the world’s biggest carbon emitter registered a very slight decline in greenhouse gas output. Many analysts believe this means the country’s carbon use will peak this year or very soon. If that is confirmed, it would be a moment of considerably greater significance than Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from UN climate negotiations.

The timing will be clearer when China unveils its revised nationally determined contribution (NDC), the climate actions plans countries promised to provide under the Paris agreement. This announcement, expected before next month’s UN general assembly, will be one of this year’s most eagerly watched declarations because no other country has been able to match China’s power to make or break the Paris targets to hold global heating between 1.5C and 2C.

But how real are the hopes China will step up and show greater leadership on finance and emission cuts, as well as renewable manufacturing?

There have been false dawns in the past. Coal – the most polluting of fossil fuels – drove China’s supercharged economic growth for most of the past three decades, though production declined for a few years in the wake of the global financial crisis and plateaued briefly during the Covid lockdown. Whether predictions of peak carbon prove more substantial this time will depend on the Beijing leadership’s next five-year plan, a domestic policy document for 2026-2030 being drawn up by the leadership in Beijing.

Speculation about the priorities continues to swirl. On one side is caution and a sense of justice that China should not try to step into the void left by the US because that would allow the latter to escape its responsibility as the world’s biggest historic emitter. On the other is geopolitical ambition and the momentum of an economy increasingly reliant on renewable energy investment for growth.

While China’s overall GDP expansion is slowing, the speed of cleantech investment remains breathtakingly fast. Last year, the amount of wind and solar under construction was double the rest of the world combined, helping China to reach an installed capacity of 1,200GW six years ahead of the government’s schedule.

The country is similarly ascendant in supplying overseas markets with renewable technology. Last year for the first time, the top four wind turbine makers in the world were all Chinese. It is a similar story of majority market share for the manufacture and export of photovoltaic cells and electric vehicles.

When it comes to clean energy, it no longer makes sense to talk about competition, says Li Shuo, the director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society. “There is only one player. The US is not even in the room. I have full confidence that dynamic will continue.”

In the run-up to Belém, the contrast with the US looks ever more stark and is likely to shape geopolitics for decades to come. Under Trump, the US has shut down climate research centres, promised to drill for more gas and declared this to be “the moment” for coal. Meanwhile, $22bn in clean energy projects have been cancelled and wind power investment has shrunk to its lowest level in a decade.

China may not be in favour of multiparty democracy at home, but on the global stage its officials have made clear it will be a champion of multilateral decision making.

Xi has not tried to fill the void left by Trump, but he has presented himself – and China – as a reliable and constructive partner, particularly on the climate issue: “However the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international cooperation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind,” he said this year.

Before previous Cops, senior US and Chinese negotiations often held a bilateral meeting to ensure the world’s two biggest emitters were on the same page. This year, China held separate climate talks with the EU and affirmed they would work together to achieve a successful Cop30 with “ambitious and equitable” outcomes. Von der Leyen called the joint declaration a big step forward. “Together, the European Union and China must uphold the Paris agreement. Now more than ever,” she said.

The text did not mention the main areas of friction between the signatories: China’s fast-growing share of sales of electric cars, batteries and solar panels, its stranglehold on critical minerals needed for wind turbine magnets, and its continued heavy investment in coal.

Scientists and campaigners say the climate will not be stabilised solely by selling more photovoltaic cells or windmill blades; it is also necessary to phase out fossil fuels. On this half of the balance sheet, China’s record remains “highly insufficient” and its current policies would, if continued, push the planet towards 4C of heating, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent initiative assessing countries’ compliance with the Paris agreement. It points out that China is off course from the commitments it previously made to “strictly limit” coal use and to reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025.

Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said Xi had compromised. “He does favour cleaning up the energy system and moving to a cleaner economy more broadly – this is a consistent and longstanding feature in his speeches – but clearly it’s not an overriding priority for him when there is pushback.”

The pushback has been most evident in the coal sector, where there has been a surge of investment in the past two years to the highest level in a decade. Major domestic coal companies, such as CHN Energy, Jinneng and Shaanxi Coal and Chemical, have considerable political influence. Although they don’t actively campaign against climate science like Exxon in the US, China analyst Qi Qin said they often pushed the energy security narrative by positioning coal as essential for reliability and independence, adding: “A lot of it comes down to concerns about energy security. During 2021–2022, droughts hit hydropower hard, and the system didn’t have the flexibility to handle that well. That led to some power shortages, and since then, there’s been more focus, especially from local governments, on securing local power supply, which partly explains the new wave of coal project approvals and construction.”

Even so, renewables has moved faster. The share of fossil fuels in China’s installed generation capacity has now fallen below half, down from two-thirds a decade ago. Whether this trend continues will depend on a recent change in energy pricing and the level of ambition in the NDC and five-year plan.

If the government wanted to send a strong signal, it could commit to no new coal power, sectorial targets for electric vehicles, electric steelmaking and building efficiency, and – most importantly – a sizeable cut in overall emissions over a clearly defined period.

Li dampened expectations the headline figure would fully align with the Paris targets. “If China were to set a course for a 1.5C world, it would need to cut emissions by 30% by 2035. A 2C world would mean reductions of 20% by the same year. Neither is likely. He said: “We understand the Chinese side is most likely to provide 8-15%. There will be a gap. If that landing zone is where they end up, then there could be the usual story of ‘under promise, over deliver.’”

He expects specific sectoral targets on how much renewable capacity China will install over the coming decade. “They will be very very big numbers,” Li predicts.

The economy may drive ambition more than politics. Belinda Schäpe, a policy analyst at CREA, said existing trends suggested it was still possible for China to reduce emissions by 30% over the coming decade, which would bring huge economic benefits, especially if combined with a continued global energy transition. “This would also strengthen China’s clean energy industries, which could double in value by 2035, adding CNY 15tn ($2.1tn) to the economy.”

At Belém, China will also seek to boost sales of renewables and possibly announce deals to build and finance a solar panel manufacturing plant in Brazil, in addition to the BYD electric car factory that is already there. This may have the feel of a trade fair, but the conference organisers said this was in line with the primary goal of Cop30, which is to accelerate action on global heating.

Brazilian diplomats also expect their Brics partner to invest in the Tropical Forests Forever Fund, which is the flagship initiative of the summit host. Chinese government sources told the Guardian this proposal was viewed positively in Beijing. Support for this effort to protect standing forests would be a sign of how China is steadily increasing climate finance outside the UN framework as it grows in wealth and responsibility. European diplomats express hope that China will lean in much further during Cop30.

Conservation NGOs hope Beijing will do more to crack down on imports of wood products from areas of illegal deforestation. China’s revised forest law theoretically prohibits these items, but it does not demand transparency or due diligence from traders so little has changed. China remains the biggest importer of illegally felled timber.

At previous Cop meetings, China has often cut an understated figure relative to its size. But its role is often decisive. At Cop26, it aligned with India to water down the language to fossil fuel “phase down” rather than “phase out” and at the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, it was criticised for sabotaging the conference. More positively, it was widely credited for helping to get the Paris agreement over the line and last year played a crucial role together with the EU to set a climate finance target, the new quantified collective goal, that most countries could sign up to.

China sees itself as a leader of the developing world, but as it has grown richer from renewable technology and is increasingly to blame for the climate crisis (it is now the second biggest emitter), it is under more pressure to cut emissions and pay more to help others do the same. Brazilian diplomats expect their Brics partner to be a quiet but strong supporter of their agenda.

How far it goes is still to be seen, but the direction of travel is at least clear – and it is the opposite of the US.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15ae8a33c3fce2a09a434aa480021c97716990d/625_0_3750_3000/master/3750.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51c4fc10b69e1f9009b29e2ccfa6ede0",N,,2025-09-07 05:00:24.905251

Robotic arms swing methodically, while digital screens display real-time production data.

The park has established a complete industrial chain covering research and design, manufacturing and quality testing, according to He Changguo, manager of the firm's northern regional manufacturing center. Since 2008, wind turbines produced in the park have been deployed in more than 100 projects across China.

This facility epitomizes the accelerating pace of Inner Mongolia's green transition. Rich in coal and central to China's energy supply, the region accounted for more than one-quarter of the nation's coal output in 2024. This wealth of resources fueled decades of growth but also tied the region to high-polluting and resource-heavy industries.

In recent years, however, the nationwide low-carbon push has set the region on a new course. By tapping its abundant wind and solar resources, the region is cultivating fresh momentum for growth. Once renowned for its coal reserves and desert environment, Inner Mongolia is now dotted with vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.

So far, over 30 companies similar to Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, which operate full industrial chains in the new energy sector, have taken root in the region. In 2024, the added value of large-scale new energy and related industries rose by 20.1 percent compared with 2023, and that of new energy equipment manufacturers surged 42.4 percent year on year.

Gong Mingzhu, director of the regional Development and Reform Commission, said Inner Mongolia has established a comprehensive industrial chain for wind, solar, hydrogen and energy storage equipment manufacturing, effectively positioning the region to embark on a new chapter in industrial development.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.

A plant in Ordos exemplifies this transformation. Built by Inner Mongolia Baofeng Coal-based New Material Co., Ltd., the facility synthesizes olefins -- a class of chemical compounds serving as key raw materials for industrial products from plastics to textiles and aerospace components -- from coal.

With an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes, this facility stands as the world's largest single-site coal-to-olefins project, according to the company.

Notably, the plant employs green hydrogen at scale to replace fossil fuels in olefin production, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 6.3 million tonnes annually.

In 2024, Inner Mongolia's modern coal chemical industry output exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 14.07 billion U.S. dollars), while the region ranked first nationwide in both coal-to-gas and coal-to-olefin production capacities.

""Simply mining and selling coal cannot fully realize the value of Inner Mongolia's energy endowment, nor can it meet the requirements of building a modern country,"" said Hu Chengdong, deputy director of the regional energy bureau.

It is imperative for Inner Mongolia to transition from an extractive growth model, shift from factor-driven to innovation-driven development, and propel traditional industries toward higher efficiency and greater value, Hu added. ■",,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:38.516841

Implications for Investors: Risks and Rewards For EV investors, Rivian's strategy presents a compelling but high-risk proposition.
However, execution risks remain: - Production Delays: The temporary shutdown of the Normal plant in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could disrupt delivery targets.","The electric vehicle (EV) market has entered a new phase of brutal competition, where margin preservation and capital efficiency are no longer optional—they are existential imperatives. Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging supplier renegotiations, production scaling, and design simplification to outpace rivals like Tesla (TSLA) and BYD (BYDDY). For investors, the question is no longer whether Rivian can survive this environment but whether its strategic pivot to lean production and commercial vehicle focus can unlock long-term value in a sector increasingly defined by razor-thin margins.

Capital Efficiency: The R2 Revolution

Rivian's transition from the R1 to the R2 model represents a masterclass in capital efficiency. The R2, a midsize SUV priced at $45,000, is designed to be 40% cheaper to produce per unit than the R1 lineup. This cost reduction stems from two pillars: supplier renegotiations and design simplification.

Supplier Contracts and Bill of Materials (BOM) Optimization:

Rivian has secured 50% lower component costs for the R2 compared to the R1, with a BOM of $32,000 per unit. This was achieved through aggressive supplier renegotiations and a shift to U.S.-based sourcing, which avoids 25% import tariffs. By locking in these costs, Rivian insulates itself from the volatility that has plagued competitors like BYD, whose Q2 2025 gross margin fell to 16.3% due to price wars in China.

Conversion Cost Reduction:

The R2's simplified architecture—streamlined body design, fewer wiring harnesses, and modular closures—reduces assembly complexity. Rivian projects conversion costs for the R2 to be less than half of those for the R1, a critical advantage in an industry where fixed costs dominate. This contrasts sharply with Tesla's recent struggles, where Q2 2025 automotive gross margins fell to 18% despite energy storage profits.

Supply Chain Optimization: Scaling Without Sacrificing Profitability

Rivian's ability to scale production while maintaining cost discipline is underpinned by its dual-facility strategy. The Normal, Illinois plant, now expanded to 1.1 million square feet, will produce 215,000 R2 units annually by 2026. This is complemented by the Georgia facility, a $5 billion project set to begin production in 2028 with 400,000-unit capacity. Crucially, Rivian has secured a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan and a $1 billion Volkswagen investment to fund these expansions, ensuring capital efficiency without diluting equity.

The Georgia plant's phased approach—200,000 units per phase—allows Rivian to align production with demand, avoiding the overcapacity pitfalls that have plagued Tesla's Gigafactories. Meanwhile, the R2's U.S.-based production and eligibility for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit further enhance gross margins, a stark contrast to BYD's reliance on price cuts to maintain volume.

Margin Projections: A Path to Outperformance

Rivian's Q2 2025 results—$206 million gross profit loss—highlight its current challenges. However, the company's trajectory is clear: it anticipates gross margins above 20% by 2026, driven by R2's cost structure and economies of scale. This would outperform Tesla's 18% and BYD's 16.3%, positioning Rivian as a margin leader in a sector where profitability is increasingly elusive.

The key differentiator lies in Rivian's commercial vehicle focus. While Tesla and BYD compete in the consumer segment, Rivian's Electric Delivery Van (EDV) and R2's commercial potential offer higher-margin opportunities. Amazon's 100,000 EDV order and Rivian's partnerships with logistics firms provide a stable revenue stream, reducing reliance on volatile consumer demand.

Implications for Investors: Risks and Rewards

For EV investors, Rivian's strategy presents a compelling but high-risk proposition. The company's focus on lean production and commercial vehicles aligns with long-term trends in logistics electrification and U.S. manufacturing. However, execution risks remain:

- Production Delays: The temporary shutdown of the Normal plant in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could disrupt delivery targets.

- Tariff and Regulatory Shifts: The expiration of the EV tax credit in September 2025 and potential changes in trade policy could erode margins.

- Competition: Tesla's vertical integration and BYD's cost leadership pose ongoing threats, particularly in the mass-market segment.

That said, Rivian's capital-efficient model and strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and the Department of Energy provide a buffer against these risks. For investors with a medium-term horizon, Rivian's ability to achieve EBITDA breakeven by 2027 and its projected margin outperformance make it a high-conviction play in the EV sector.

Buyers are making quick decisions to take advantage of the expiring incentive.

Washington had a record year for electric vehicle sales in 2023, with registrations increasing by 43%. Nearly 224,000 electric vehicles are now on the state’s roads.

Steven Hershkowitz from the Washington Department of Commerce noted Washington’s leadership in electric vehicle sales.

“Nationally, we haven’t seen a huge spike in sales, a little bit of an increase, and we expect that increase to go up quite a bit in September before the tax credit expires,” he said.

Incentives have played a significant role in driving this growth. Last year, a state rebate program offered up to $9,000, but demand was so high that it sold out in just three months.

“Commerce ran a program called the EV Instant Rebate Program. It offered up to nine thousand dollars for new leases as compared to the seventy-five hundred that are offered at the federal level under the tax credits. It ended in 82 days. Last year, it was so popular that we ran through the more than six thousand rebates in less than three months,” Hershkowitz stated.

For climate officials, electric vehicle sales are not just about incentives. They emphasize the importance of adoption as Washington faces the challenges of a changing climate. Jennifer Hennessey from the Washington Department of Ecology highlighted the current impacts.

“In Washington, climate change impacts are already here. We’re seeing wildfires around the state and smoke that comes with it, heat waves. This is our third year in a row declaring drought, and all of these impacts are putting lives and livelihoods here in Washington at risk,” Hennessey said.

With the federal tax credit expiring soon, officials are urging buyers ready to switch to electric vehicles not to delay.

“This is definitely going to be a good moment to go out and get an EV,” Hennessey advised.

Even after the credit expires, Washingtonians are expected to continue embracing electric vehicles at a record pace.",https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6887be412d143.image_.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:03.827240

Not only is renewable energy known to be better for the planet, but it can also help make energy cheaper for people. Who would complain about spending less on energy bills?

The National Grid claims that ""solar and wind energy are now the most affordable sources of new electricity in 82% of the world.""

Moving toward a more self-sustainable model of energy production, such as wind farming, can also create more stability for a country's electrical grid. In the transition to clean energy, new jobs will be created for the local community and help boost the economy.

Renewable sources of electricity help energy providers move away from relying on dirty fuels, which are known to be harmful to the health of people and the planet. Research by Harvard University links pollution to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, cancer, reproductive and developmental impacts, and even an increased risk of premature death.

Moving toward energy sources that cause fewer health issues can only be a step in the right direction for a cleaner, safer future. Enormous companies like Amazon getting behind a greener option is heartening to see.

The managing director of Amazon Web Services over much of Southeast Asia, Jeff Johnson, commented per Renewable Energy Magazine: ""We're proud to work with forward-thinking organisations like Gentari who share our commitment to both technological advancement and environmental stewardship.""

China has dramatically increased its investment footprint in Brazil's energy landscape, establishing itself as a dominant foreign investor in South America's largest economy. In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $4.18 billion across 39 projects, with the China investment in Brazil energy sector capturing the largest share of this capital influx. This strategic focus reflects China's dual approach to securing both traditional and renewable resources while expanding its global economic influence.

The power sector, particularly solar and wind projects, received 34% ($1.43 billion) of total Chinese investments in Brazil during 2024, while oil and gas attracted 25% ($1 billion). This balanced approach demonstrates China's pragmatic energy transition trends that simultaneously advances renewable capacity while maintaining access to fossil fuel resources.

What Drives China's Interest in Brazilian Energy Resources?

Strategic Resource Security

China's investment strategy in Brazil is fundamentally driven by resource security concerns. As the world's largest energy consumer, China seeks to diversify its supply sources and reduce vulnerability to market volatility and geopolitical tensions. Brazil offers an attractive combination of established oil production, renewable energy potential, and critical minerals necessary for energy transition technologies.

The investments serve multiple strategic objectives:

Securing long-term access to Brazil's offshore oil reserves

Establishing positions in renewable energy development

Accessing critical minerals like lithium, niobium, and rare earths

Building influence in a major regional economy with significant natural resources

Complementary Energy Policies

Both China and Brazil pursue parallel energy strategies that combine aggressive renewable energy expansion with continued fossil fuel development. Brazil maintains approximately 90% renewable electricity generation (primarily hydropower) while simultaneously expanding its oil production capacity. Similarly, China leads globally in renewable energy deployment while continuing to develop coal, oil, and gas resources.

This policy alignment creates natural investment synergies, allowing Chinese firms to pursue diverse energy projects that match their domestic expertise and strategic priorities. According to a recent analysis by Alvarez & Marsal, this complementary approach has positioned Brazil as China's third-largest investment destination globally.

Which Sectors Receive the Most Chinese Investment?

Renewable Energy Dominance

Since 2007, Chinese companies have invested $77.5 billion across 303 projects in Brazil, with the power sector claiming the largest share at 45% of total investments. Major Chinese energy corporations have established significant positions in Brazil's renewable energy landscape:

China Three Gorges (CTG): Acquired multiple hydroelectric assets and developed solar projects

State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC): Invested in wind and solar facilities

CGN Power: Developed utility-scale solar installations and transmission infrastructure

The Luiz Gonzaga Solar Complex represents one flagship project with substantial Chinese investment, highlighting the scale of renewable energy commitments and battery recycling innovation efforts.

Oil and Gas Strategic Positioning

The oil industry ranks as the second-largest recipient of Chinese investment at 29% of the cumulative total since 2007. Chinese national oil companies have secured stakes in Brazil's prolific pre-salt offshore oil basin, which has driven most of Brazil's production growth in recent years.

These investments provide China with:

Direct access to Brazilian crude oil exports

Participation in production sharing agreements

Technology transfer opportunities in deep-water exploration

Diversification away from Middle Eastern oil dependencies

Critical Minerals and Manufacturing

Beyond direct energy investments, Chinese firms have strategically targeted Brazil's mining sector, focusing on materials essential for the energy transition supply chain. For example, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) acquired Brazilian firm Mineração Taboca, the country's largest refined tin producer, for $340 million in late 2024.

This acquisition secured access to:

Tin (used in solar panel manufacturing)

Niobium (critical for high-strength steel and superconductors)

Tantalum (essential for electronics and energy storage)

Manufacturing investments have also followed, representing 8% of total Chinese investment since 2007, often supporting energy-related supply chains.

What Are the Recent Investment Trends?

Accelerating Capital Flows

Chinese investment in Brazil energy has shown remarkable acceleration in recent years. The $4.18 billion invested in 2024 represented a 113% increase compared to 2023, while the number of projects grew by 34% year-over-year. This surge has positioned Brazil as the top emerging market destination for Chinese foreign direct investment.

Recent high-profile investments include:

Envision Group's $1 billion sustainable aviation fuel project (2025)

CGN's $529 million combined wind and solar developments (2025)

Multiple transmission infrastructure projects to support renewable integration

Shifting Focus to Energy Transition

While maintaining positions in oil and gas, Chinese investors have increasingly targeted projects supporting Brazil's energy transition. These investments align with Brazil's ""Fuel of the Future"" initiative and its ambition to become a global green energy hub, as reported by China News.

Investments now frequently support:

Local manufacturing of wind turbine components (60-80% locally produced)

Green hydrogen development infrastructure

Electric vehicle supply chain integration

Smart grid and energy storage technologies

What Challenges Do These Investments Face?

Political and Regulatory Risks

Chinese companies consistently identify political risk as their primary concern when investing in Brazil. The country's complex regulatory environment and history of policy shifts create uncertainty, particularly with elections expected in 2026 that could affect the investment strategy insights.

Key risk factors include:

Potential changes to foreign investment regulations

Environmental licensing delays and complications

Local content requirements and labor regulations

Currency volatility affecting project economics

Environmental and Social Considerations

As investments expand into environmentally sensitive areas, Chinese companies face increasing scrutiny regarding environmental and social impacts. This is particularly relevant for investments in:

Amazon basin oil exploration (such as Petrobras' efforts in Foz do Amazonas)

Hydroelectric projects affecting indigenous territories

Mining operations in ecologically sensitive regions

Chinese investors must navigate these complexities while maintaining their strategic objectives and addressing stakeholder concerns.

How Does This Investment Affect Brazil-China Relations?

Economic Integration

China has maintained its position as Brazil's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, with energy investments deepening this economic relationship. The growing investment ties create mutual dependencies that shape diplomatic and economic relations between the two BRICS nations.

Trade and investment flows have created:

Increased Brazilian commodity exports to China

Growing Chinese manufactured goods imports to Brazil

Technological collaboration in energy sectors

Financial cooperation through development banks

Geopolitical Implications

The strengthening Brazil-China energy partnership carries significant geopolitical implications, particularly as both nations seek to expand their influence in global energy markets and governance structures. Their cooperation represents a major South-South partnership that challenges traditional North-South investment patterns and creates potential trade war impact concerns.

This relationship influences:

Global oil market dynamics

International climate negotiations

Regional economic integration in South America

Multilateral institutions like BRICS and G20

What Does the Future Hold for Chinese Energy Investments in Brazil?

Continued Growth Trajectory

All indicators suggest China investment in Brazil energy will continue their upward trajectory. The complementary nature of their energy strategies, Brazil's abundant resources, and China's capital availability create powerful incentives for ongoing partnership.

Future investment areas likely include:

Expanded offshore oil development

Accelerated utility-scale solar and wind deployment

Green hydrogen production facilities

Battery manufacturing and energy storage

Critical mineral supply chain integration

Strategic Adaptation

As global energy markets evolve, Chinese investments will likely adapt to changing priorities while maintaining core strategic objectives. This may include greater emphasis on technologies supporting electrification, digitalization, and decarbonization while maintaining positions in conventional energy resources.

The investment relationship will continue balancing:

Short-term resource security needs

Long-term energy transition goals

Technological leadership ambitions

Economic and political influence objectives

Conclusion

China's multibillion-dollar investments in Brazil's energy sector represent a sophisticated strategy that secures access to both traditional and renewable resources while expanding economic influence in Latin America's largest economy. The complementary energy policies of both nations create natural investment synergies, despite apparent contradictions between fossil fuel development and renewable energy expansion.

As Brazil positions itself to host the COP30 climate summit while simultaneously pursuing oil production growth, Chinese investment provides crucial capital and technology to advance both conventional and renewable energy development. This partnership will continue shaping global China investment in Brazil energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitical relationships in the coming decades.

The dual focus on securing traditional energy resources while investing heavily in renewables reflects a pragmatic approach to energy transition—one that acknowledges the continuing importance of fossil fuels while building the infrastructure for a lower-carbon future. As this investment relationship evolves, it will significantly influence both countries' energy landscapes and their positions in the global energy order.

The person posted images in the r/teslamotors subreddit showing the severed cables and a repair truck that had arrived to fix the problem.

""Someone keeps cutting the SC Cables at the [Cincinnati] Meijer,"" they wrote. ""Tech showed up while I was there and said it happened the day before as well. Camera only can see last 4, which are never cut.""

Meijer is just one store that has worked to expand its EV charging options. Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Ikea are others, and it's a sign of the times: More than 1 in 5 vehicles purchased this year will be electric.

While the proliferation of charging stations is good news, there is more work to be done. It has become clear that these chargers, which feature thick copper wires inside insulated cables, will continue to be targeted by thieves.

The Biden-Harris administration has said there will be 200,000 chargers available to drivers by the end of the year, but the rollout has been slow.

Watch now: Uber-wealthy couple makes unprecedented move with $300 million land

Ride-hailing company Uber is offering drivers up to $22,000 to buy EVs as we work to decarbonize the transportation sector.

Internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) are powered by gasoline, a source of dirty energy that pollutes the environment, harms our health, and costs more money than electricity. In one year of use, an ICEV releases 2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), while an EV releases zero, according to Recurrent.

Critics trumpet the outsize pollution that comes with manufacturing an EV — especially the battery — but EVs are still much better for the environment, our well-being, and our wallets than ICEVs over the vehicles' lifetimes.

Despite contributing 14 tCO2e during production — compared to 10 tCO2e for an ICEV — and 26 tCO2e for charging from the grid (which is mostly still powered by gas, coal, and oil), an EV's pollution output is 39 tCO2e over 16 years. On the other hand, an ICEV's tCO2e is 55, more than 58% of which comes from tailpipe pollution.

Thankfully, it seems there's a simple way to prevent EV charging stations from being destroyed.

After the Federal Issues Forum, I walked around the state fair.
The Nebraska State Fair is a yearly reminder of the values that make the Good Life in our state.","One of my biggest priorities as your Senator is hearing directly from Nebraskans. I continue to do what I did as Governor. I travel the state, talk to Nebraskans, and listen to their concerns. Last week, I welcomed hundreds of Nebraskans to my annual Federal Issues Forum at the State Fair in Grand Island. I’m grateful for everyone who attended.

The Federal Issues Forum is an event where we discuss federal issues impacting Nebraskans. This year, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso joined me. We highlighted solutions to get America back on track. Senate Republicans and the Trump Administration are delivering for Nebraska. We are fighting to protect and promote the Good Life.

Administrator Zeldin and I discussed the importance of the EPA cutting excessive regulation. Nobody cares more about preserving our water, air, and land resources than our farmers and ranchers. They are the original conservationists. What farmers and ranchers want are common-sense rules and regulations that allow them to continue managing their land. That’s what Administrator Zeldin and I are fighting to deliver.

Reining in overregulation means reforming rules like Waters of the United States (WOTUS). In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act. This gave the EPA authority over navigable waters like lakes, rivers, and oceans. Then, the Obama and Biden administrations tried to illegally increase the EPA’s authority. They redefined what navigable waters are. They claimed that navigable waters include roadside ditches, puddles on construction sites, and farm ponds. Last time I checked, those aren’t navigable waters. That’s not what Congress voted for. Administrator Zeldin and I are putting an end to this kind of overreach.

Administrator Zeldin and I also discussed the Renewable Fuel Standard. He previously committed to me that EPA would follow the standard Congress passed. This includes getting the process back on schedule. The EPA’s most recent Renewable Volume Obligations exceeded our expectations. It will drive strong biofuel markets. This will benefit energy consumers with cheaper prices at the pump, help clean up our environment, and be great for our farmers and ranchers. The Biden administration ignored biofuels and weakened American energy independence. We’re unleashing American energy dominance again.

Senator Barrasso and I discussed how the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) strengthens Nebraska families. It’s rare to have the opportunity to pass legislation that preserves the Good Life for generations.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is good for families. It avoids a $2,400 tax hike on the average Nebraska family. OBBB expands the child tax credit. It makes the Death Tax exemption permanent. OBBB expands child and dependent care credits while increasing take-home pay by up to $9,000. It ensures no tax on tips or overtime. 88% of seniors will no longer pay taxes on Social Security due to a new $6,000 tax credit. OBBB includes a $50 billion rural health care fund. This makes sure Nebraska gets a minimum of $100 million each of the next five years. OBBB secures our border. It promotes peace through strength by deterring foreign adversaries like Communist China.

Senator Barrasso and I also discussed historic votes from this Congress. Bipartisan laws like the HALT Fentanyl Act and the Laken Riley Act are keeping Nebraskans safe. We have confirmed 125 of Trump’s nominees. We passed a $9 billion cut to spending.

After the Federal Issues Forum, I walked around the state fair. I spoke with small business owners, fair staff, and Nebraskans enjoying the fair. I saw the ingenuity of Nebraska entrepreneurs at the expo hall. I saw the impressive livestock shown in fair competition by our next generation of farmers and ranchers. I was even able to help show a Rambouillet ram in competition. I also won a blue ribbon!

Nebraska is what America is supposed to be. The reason is our people. As I travel across our state, I’m reminded of the values that make Nebraska special. We’re committed to faith, family, community, and hard work. These values are the same ones that guide my service to Nebraska.

""The momentum is incredible,"" said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X.
If timelines hold, Americans could see this next generation of nuclear fuel powering homes and businesses before the end of the decade.","At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, researchers are crafting what look like gray pool balls (or pebbles) that may hold the power to usher in a new era of nuclear energy in the U.S.

But inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny uranium particles enriched beyond what today's power plants use.

Built by X-energy at Oak Ridge in Maryland, the researchers hope to fuel a new wave of nuclear reactors, expected to be operational by 2030, as Tech Xplore reported. This includes companies like Standard Nuclear and Orano, producing fuel and enrichment facilities to help reach that goal.

The uranium-based fuel, Tri-structural Isotropic particle fuel or TRISO, inside the pebbles is the ""most robust nuclear fuel on Earth,"" according to the Department of Energy, as it cannot melt in a reactor. Each pebble can cycle through a high-temperature reactor multiple times, making it more efficient and safer than traditional fuel rods.

This breakthrough couldn't come at a more critical time. Nuclear fission, the process of splitting atoms to release energy, is far cleaner than coal or gas, generating large amounts of power without the same level of climate-warming pollution.

But new advanced reactors need advanced fuels, and right now, most of the world's supply chain for high-assay, low-enriched uranium is controlled by Russia and China. X-energy's work represents a push for the U.S. to ramp up domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign sources.

Still, experts caution that nuclear power isn't a clean energy silver bullet. Building new reactors is costly and often delayed. And while TRISO fuel is designed to be safer, it's not unlimited, and all nuclear waste must still be contained and stored securely to avoid disasters to human health and the environment.

Even so, the potential is enormous as we continue to rely more and more on massive amounts of energy to power new technology. If advanced reactors paired with TRISO fuel succeed, they could provide stable, low-carbon power that supports renewables like wind and solar, reducing air pollution and making the grid more resilient against extreme weather and climate.

Therefore, these small TRISO pebbles could have a huge impact by cutting pollution, strengthening U.S. energy security, and potentially lowering costs for consumers.

""The momentum is incredible,"" said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X.

With $2 billion invested in a fuel production campus in Oak Ridge, X-energy hopes that by 2028, the factory could produce enough TRISO pebbles to power 11 new reactors, with plans for a large production facility by 2029. Amazon has also invested in X-energy in hopes of helping to fuel its power-hungry data centers.

During his holiday in Scotland last month, the US vice-president held private talks with a string of major US nuclear companies about projects they are pursuing in the UK.

Executives from Westinghouse, GE Hitachi, X-energy, Holtec International and TerraPower, the nuclear developer co-founded by Bill Gates, are understood to have attended the meeting.

It was scheduled to last just 20 minutes but ultimately went on for double that amount of time, multiple sources confirmed.

Now with less than a fortnight before the president touches down for his state visit in London, the White House is understood to be lobbying in support of plans for American companies to build nuclear power plants and data centres that could power artificial intelligence (AI) software in the UK.

These include a major nuclear plant proposed by Westinghouse on the island of Anglesey, North Wales, as well as a string of miniature plants that X-energy, the start-up backed by Amazon, wants to build in industrial areas across the country.

Mr Vance’s meeting with nuclear companies is understood to have been billed as a fact-finding mission to explore opportunities for US business in Britain.

But government sources acknowledged that both countries see nuclear energy as key to meeting the massive electricity demands expected to come from AI data centres and are discussing how to work more closely together.

One well-placed British source who is familiar with the discussions said: “The White House wants announcements for Trump to make while he’s here.

“So there is huge pressure to make that happen. But the Government won’t allow that to happen unless there are credible proposals from the nuclear companies on the table.”

On Friday, Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to Washington, also hinted that deals spanning energy, defence, AI and quantum computing were potentially on the cards, with a view to “create jobs, drive innovation and ensure that British and American ingenuity continues to lead the world”.

While once the preserve of national energy companies, Silicon Valley’s tech giants are piling into nuclear energy because it is seen as the only clean, large and uninterrupted power source capable of meeting the 24/7 needs of data centres.

X-energy is seeking to build an advanced modular reactor (AMR) in Hartlepool, County Durham, with a view to building up to 10 in the UK if it proves successful.

The company is understood to be regarded as highly credible within Whitehall and is in talks about receiving potential debt and equity financing from the National Wealth Fund.

It is also seeking revenue support and guarantees that the Government will follow through on planning reforms that would let nuclear companies build mini reactors near cities.

In June, The Telegraph also revealed that Westinghouse was in talks with the Government about a proposed large nuclear power station at Wylfa, Anglesey.

Westinghouse is pushing for the site to be set aside for the project, which could see it build four large reactors capable of generating almost five gigawatts of electricity – enough to power millions of homes.

The company insists the scheme would be privately financed, and so kept off the Government’s balance sheet, but it is seeking minimum revenue guarantees and £50m to carry out a feasibility study.

However, the proposal has created a potential dilemma for Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, as Wylfa is also being eyed as a potential testbed for the first mini nuclear reactors plants designed by Rolls-Royce, which are due to be built by the mid-2030s.

On Friday, a government spokesman declined to comment on talks with the Trump administration, but said: “Over the past year we’ve taken action to deliver a golden age of nuclear for Britain, with record funding for Sizewell C and our first small modular reactors – creating thousands of new, skilled jobs through the Plan for Change.

“No decisions on a future large-scale nuclear project have been made.”

The factory, now shut, was once recognized as a source of lead, chromium and other pollution by state regulators — as well as by concerned locals such as Roxxanne O'Brien.

But as O'Brien focused on fallout from the metals factory on her impoverished north Minneapolis neighborhood, her gaze widened to the many other industrial operations lining the river, each spewing out its own cocktail of pollutants.

""All of these different industries combined were creating a toxic soup,"" O'Brien, a mother of three, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

She refers to these combined pollution levels as ""cumulative impacts"" — when multiple sources of pollution come together and hurt human health.

It is a particular concern in poor, minority areas, she said, citing places such as north Minneapolis, where heavy industry, manufacturing and transport tend to concentrate.

Regulators, meanwhile, have focused on individual operations rather than look at the implications of a concentration of industry in any given area.

But O'Brien, co-founder of a group called Community Members for Environmental Justice, is now hoping she has a solution.

The Frontline Communities Protection Act is a state law that creates a new permitting process for industry in impoverished, minority ""environmental justice"" communities.

The law passed in 2023, and an implementation framework is due by next May.

It’s the country’s third, after New Jersey and New York.

The trend offers a major new tool to address pollution in ""overburdened"" communities that backers say local officials are increasingly taking up.

This comes as President Donald Trump undermines national momentum on the issue through funding cuts and by banning government ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" efforts that could have helped impacted communities stave off pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which in November released an interim framework for a national policy, has now ""paused"" that work, a spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The Minnesota bill met with pushback from industry groups, including local chambers of commerce and utilities, warning it could stifle economic development or duplicate existing rules.

Yet the need for change is a ""no-brainer,"" said Minnesota state Representative Fue Lee, who spearheaded the law.

""If we have the tools already, why are community members still coming to me to have the state step in?""

Discussion of the cumulative effects of air, water and soil pollution took root in the 1980s and 1990s as communities grew frustrated with regulators' reliance on risk analysis that didn’t reflect the harm they'd witnessed first hand.

More racially segregated areas are up to 75% more likely to have high copper, chromium, lead and other particulate concentrations, with low-income communities suffering higher levels of asthma, diabetes and hypertension, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

A facility permit might allow a set level of pollutants but did so without taking into account what other industries were polluting the area, said Ana Baptista, director of the Tishman Environment and Design Center at the New School in New York.

""So communities would be hitting brick walls every time they tried to fight these facilities,"" Baptista said.

She helped get the first such law enacted in New Jersey.

The new law requires regulators to consider the cumulative effects of polluting industries, strengthens their power to win changes and ensure that local voices are part of the process.

While it is too early to gauge the impact, New Jersey regulators in May issued their first decision under the law, on permits for a recycling plant, and ordered changes.

Campaigners applauded that milestone but said ""significantly more could have been done to ensure protections for the surrounding overburdened communities,"" according to the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, a coalition of groups.

In addition to Minnesota and New York, dozens of states and cities — including Maryland, D.C. and Colorado — have proposed similar laws, according to tracking by the Tishman Center.

The return of Trump has prompted many communities to turn to state legislators for their help, said Baptista, since they no longer feel the federal government will protect them.

In 2019, researchers found that Chicago had a life expectancy gap between racially segregated neighborhoods of 30 years — the country’s widest such discrepancy.

Clustering industries in certain areas had measurable fallout: high levels of cancer, asthma and other respiratory illnesses, said Iyana Simba of the Illinois Environmental Council, an advocacy group that represents 130 groups.

""It's not just one single factory or warehouse. It's these communities that have several in the same area,"" she said.

The mayor and others introduced a cumulative impacts bill in April, for an ordinance that could be voted on in coming weeks.

A U.S.-based nuclear fusion startup is setting its sights on Japan as a key market for deploying its advanced reactor technology, signaling a potential shift in global energy strategies. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a Massachusetts company backed by tech giants like Nvidia, has initiated discussions with Japanese government officials about bringing its fusion power plants to the island nation. According to reporting in The Japan Times, CFS aims to have a reactor operational in Japan by the late 2030s or early 2040s, aligning with Tokyo’s push for carbon-neutral energy sources.

This move comes amid a surge of investment in fusion energy, with CFS recently securing $863 million in funding from investors including Nvidia, as detailed in the same Japan Times article. The company’s technology revolves around high-temperature superconductors to create compact tokamaks, which could generate electricity from fusion reactions mimicking the sun’s power. Japan, with its history of energy innovation and post-Fukushima caution toward traditional nuclear fission, sees fusion as a safer, cleaner alternative to meet rising demands from data centers and manufacturing.

Investment Surge and Strategic Partnerships

The influx of capital underscores investor confidence in fusion’s viability. CFS’s funding round, highlighted in Bloomberg, positions the firm to accelerate development, potentially outpacing competitors. In Japan, a consortium of 12 companies, including Mitsubishi Corporation and Kansai Electric Power, has invested in CFS, marking the first such involvement from Japanese firms, as reported by Digitimes. This collaboration aims to import technical know-how for domestic commercialization.

For industry insiders, this partnership highlights the interplay between U.S. innovation and Japanese industrial might. Japan’s government has been proactive in fusion, evidenced by the JT-60SA tokamak, a joint EU-Japan project that began operations in 2023, according to the European Commission. CFS’s entry could build on this foundation, integrating American magnet technology with Japan’s precision engineering.

Technological Hurdles and Market Potential

Yet, challenges remain in scaling fusion from experimental to commercial stages. CFS’s approach promises net energy gain, but skeptics point to historical delays in the field. As Reuters noted in coverage of a U.S.-Japan fusion partnership announced earlier this year, bilateral efforts are crucial for overcoming plasma stability and material durability issues.

Japan’s energy needs, driven by AI and electrification, make it an ideal testing ground. A recent Interesting Engineering article discussed Japan’s consideration of new fission reactors, but fusion offers a zero-waste, abundant fuel option using seawater-derived deuterium. CFS executives, per The Japan Times, emphasize regulatory alignment and site selection as next steps.

Global Implications for Energy Transition

The broader implications extend to international energy security. With fusion potentially providing baseload power without greenhouse emissions, CFS’s Japan plans could inspire similar deployments elsewhere. Neutron Bytes reported on CFS’s funding, noting its role in advancing tritium fuel cycles alongside partners like General Atomics.

For insiders, this development signals a maturing fusion sector, where private ventures like CFS are bridging lab breakthroughs to real-world applications. As talks progress, the fusion race heats up, with Japan poised as a pivotal player in realizing this long-elusive energy dream.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-396840a8-80d3-432d-9872-f5af5e84ba13.jpeg,N,,2025-09-07 02:59:13.795253

That's because a Los Alamos National Laboratory-led team has tapped the power of ""THOR,"" according to a news release.

And while there isn't a hammer-wielding god involved, there is potential for plenty of cleaner power thanks to the Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow diagnostic device. The team was able to achieve ignition through a self-contained feedback loop called burning plasma. It's part of the way our sun continues to burn, according to the release and other government data.

It's also extremely hard to sustain, making fusion energy an as-yet unrealized power source on Earth. But if experts can make a key breakthrough, the reaction could provide nearly unlimited energy. Unlike common fission reactors, fusion doesn't produce long-lasting nuclear waste or carry meltdown risks. Fusion combines atoms to create energy, while fission splits them, according to the Department of Energy.

Powerful lasers creating astounding heat are needed to create ignition, something the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first achieved in 2022. The extreme settings provide them with a setting to observe how materials respond to severe plasma conditions. And THOR is essentially a better window to look through, per the summary.

As lasers are fired at a gold-coated cylinder holding fusion fuel, a ""bath"" of X-rays is produced that is needed to create ignition. As part of the THOR process, the cylinder, known as a hohlraum, includes ""windows"" that allow some of the X-rays to escape. This technique gives the scientists another look at how materials are reacting to high heat and radiation, according to the release.

""We pulled this off in less than a year because of everyone's commitment. We moved fast and we moved together, showing what can happen when the whole team is aligned and all-in,"" THOR project lead Ryan Lester, a physicist, said.

It's an exciting benchmark in the effort for sustainable fusion energy, as the power comes without heat-trapping air pollution that the World Health Organization said is a health problem for almost everyone on Earth. Indoor and outdoor dirty air is linked to 7 million premature deaths a year, per the WHO. A study has even associated it with dementia risks.

However, there are also nuclear pitfalls. The Los Alamos news release mentioned that the information they are gathering is also of value for weapons development. Experts and advocates on both sides continue to debate the repercussions of nuclear waste, meltdown risks, and the prospect of limitless, cleaner power.

Fission energy, powering 54 plants stateside, is still being developed as growing data center electricity demand strains the power grid.

For its part, fusion could resolve many of the concerns. The THOR project was completed in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility. The experts plan to continue refining the diagnostic system, per the release.

""This is a game-changing breakthrough,"" physicist Joseph Smidt said.

Solar energy is another clean energy option that is among the cheapest — second to wind — to develop, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It doesn't provide weapons-related data or create radioactive waste, either.

Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year requires more than nine million cubic meters of water.
On a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, green hydrogen risks becoming water plunder disguised in green labels.","Energy that is hailed as clean demands a vital resource that is missing: water.

The world applauds green hydrogen as the clean energy that will save the planet. It is sold as the invisible gold of the twenty-first century. But there is a truth buried under the propaganda. To produce every kilo of hydrogen, liters and liters of pure water are needed. On a planet already suffering historic droughts, where millions of people lack drinking water, that promise turns into a threat.

The geopolitics of the twenty-first century will not only revolve around minerals and fuels. It will also revolve around water. The same countries that are pushing green hydrogen megaprojects are the ones watching their people dry up. Chile announces plants in Atacama, one of the driest deserts in the world. Namibia and Mauritania hand over land for gigantic projects while their populations still carry buckets of water. Saudi Arabia builds complexes with desalination plants that generate more brine than energy.

The contradiction is brutal. They speak of clean energy, but they hide the water cost. They proclaim the fight against climate change, but they risk deepening the water crisis. What should be a path toward sustainability can become a new form of plunder. Green hydrogen not only divides the world into producers and buyers. It also divides it between those who will have water to live and those who will give up theirs to export molecules.

The water cost of hydrogen

Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis. A process that splits water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen using renewable electricity. The equation is simple in theory, but brutal in practice. To produce one kilo of hydrogen, between nine and twelve liters of pure water are needed, free of salts and minerals. That water must be treated and demineralized before entering the electrolyzers, which makes the process even more expensive.

The numbers escalate at industrial scale. The International Energy Agency estimates that if the world produces the 530 million tons of green hydrogen projected for 2050, more than five billion cubic meters of water per year will be required, equivalent to the annual consumption of a nation of one hundred million people. In other words, the energy transition based on hydrogen demands a new sacrifice: turning water into exportable energy.

The contradiction is obvious. Projects rise in arid regions where water is scarcest. Chile announces complexes in Atacama and Magallanes. Namibia and Mauritania promise massive exports from the desert. Saudi Arabia pushes its futuristic city Neom based on hydrogen, with desalination plants that generate millions of tons of brine discharged into the sea. They call it progress, but for local communities it is another form of dispossession.

The water cost of green hydrogen opens a new political question. Should water be used to feed electrolyzers or to secure life and agriculture? What right do corporations have to drain rivers and aquifers in the name of an energy that will not even remain in producing countries? At its core, green hydrogen risks being clean only in appearance. Clean in Europe’s and Asia’s carbon accounts, but dirty in the thirst it leaves behind.

Latin America: green energy in dry lands

Latin America is presented as the new Saudi Arabia of green hydrogen. Governments and corporations announce gigantic projects that promise billion-dollar exports to Europe and Asia. But behind the discourse of progress lies a paradox: many of these megaprojects are being built in territories where water is scarce and where millions of people still lack access to the most basic resource.

Chile leads the regional map. In Magallanes, world-scale plants are planned to produce green ammonia and export it to Germany and Japan. In Atacama, the driest desert on the planet, solar parks are being built to power electrolyzers that require thousands of cubic meters of pure water every day. The same country where more than 400,000 people suffer chronic water scarcity is handing over its water to corporations that will generate energy for European ships.

Argentina is not far behind. In Río Negro, the Australian company Fortescue is projecting an $8.4 billion investment to install a green hydrogen hub that will need water resources in a province already under stress. Patagonia, with its wind potential, is turning into the epicenter of a clean energy that risks drying up agricultural valleys.

Brazil and Mexico are moving forward with pilot projects in Ceará, Bahia, and Yucatán—regions where water is limited and contested between human consumption, agriculture, and mining. Figures projected by the International Energy Agency indicate that producing just one million tons of green hydrogen per year consumes more than nine million cubic meters of water, enough to supply a medium-sized city.

The warning is clear. Latin America is giving up water and territory to produce energy it will not consume. Green hydrogen is sold as the key to the future, but in practice it threatens to repeat the history of plunder: cheap raw materials for the north and thirst for the south.

Africa: the desert as a testing ground

Africa is the new laboratory of green hydrogen. In the midst of energy poverty and lack of drinking water, megaprojects are rising that promise to save the planet but may condemn local communities. Namibia is the most brutal example. There, the company Hyphen Energy is pushing a $10 billion complex on the southern coast, aimed at exporting green ammonia to Germany and the Netherlands. The project will use desalinated water, but that desalination will generate tons of brine discharged into the ocean, altering already fragile marine ecosystems.

Mauritania has become the other epicenter. The consortium CWP Global is planning a $40 billion megaproject, one of the largest in the world, also geared toward exports to Europe. The Mauritanian desert, where communities survive with minimal water and electricity, will be converted into an energy extraction zone to supply foreign trains and ships. The paradox repeats itself: countries where more than 40 percent of the population lacks regular access to electricity are giving up their water resources to produce energy they will not consume.

South Africa and Morocco have joined the race. Pretoria announced a hydrogen corridor in Northern Cape, while Rabat signed agreements with the European Union and Germany to be a key supplier in the next decade. Both rely on desalination to sustain production. That technology raises the cost of hydrogen and generates a hidden problem: millions of tons of brine dumped into the sea, impacting fisheries and biodiversity.

The figures are stark. Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year requires more than nine million cubic meters of water. Namibia, Mauritania, and Morocco aim to multiply that figure tenfold over the next twenty years. On a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, green hydrogen risks becoming water plunder disguised in green labels.

Asia and the Middle East: water or energy

Asia and the Middle East concentrate the paradox of green hydrogen at its most extreme. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announce gigantic hydrogen plants in the middle of the desert. The flagship project is Neom, the futuristic Saudi city presented as a model of sustainability, which includes the installation of one of the largest hydrogen plants on the planet. Production depends on massive desalination, a process that requires additional energy and discharges millions of tons of highly polluting brine into the Red Sea. Clean energy in theory, but with a toxic environmental trail.

India faces an even more direct dilemma. The government launched a national green hydrogen plan with the goal of producing five million tons annually by 2030. However, much of that production would be located in the arid regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat, where water is already insufficient for agriculture and human consumption. One kilo of hydrogen means ten liters less of water for farmers already enduring chronic droughts. In a country with more than 100 million people without secure access to drinking water, hydrogen can become more of a threat than a solution.

China is also betting big. Its hydrogen megaprojects are concentrated in the north, in areas such as Inner Mongolia, rich in wind and solar power but poor in water. The challenge is obvious: while China leads in electrolyzers, it must guarantee water to sustain large-scale production. The risk is that the energy meant to decarbonize the global economy will end up worsening local water stress.

The figures don’t lie. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 60 percent of green hydrogen projects in Asia and the Middle East are located in regions with high or extreme water stress. The question becomes unavoidable: what is worth more—water for life, or water turned into fuel for global trade?

Potential conflicts

Green hydrogen is not only an energy bet, it can also become a new motive for water wars. Where historical tensions already exist, the arrival of HV megaprojects threatens to deepen conflicts. The Nile River is a clear example. Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia have spent years disputing control of the Grand Renaissance Dam. If hydrogen production is added in Ethiopia and Sudan, the waters of the Nile will become fuel for export and not a vital resource for 150 million people.

The Indus River in Asia faces a similar situation. India and Pakistan dispute its flow under a fragile sharing agreement. India’s decision to push hydrogen projects in arid regions using Indus water could ignite a new conflict front. The same is happening in the Amazon, where there is already talk of exploring HV projects in Brazil and Peru, in a basin that holds 20 percent of the world’s freshwater and already suffers from deforestation and pollution. Turning that river into an energy input for export would be repeating plunder under another guise.

The numbers put the contradiction in black and white. More than 400 million Africans and 100 million Asians today lack secure access to drinking water. Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year consumes more than nine million cubic meters of water, enough to supply a city of half a million inhabitants for a year. Water colonialism is taking hold in silence. The north buys green molecules, and the south gives up the water it needs to live. They call it energy transition, but it smells like the same old story: exporting life and staying with thirst.

Alternatives and solutions

Green hydrogen does not have to be a water plunder. There are technological and political alternatives that could prevent the energy of the future from being built on the thirst of the people.

The first option is to look to the sea. New electrolyzers designed to operate directly with seawater reduce dependence on freshwater sources. The technology is still expensive, but it is advancing quickly. Researchers in China and Australia have already tested prototypes that produce hydrogen without the need for desalination.

The second alternative is the reuse of wastewater. Cities that today dump millions of liters of treated water into the sea could redirect part of that flow to hydrogen production. Germany and Japan are already developing pilots along these lines. The cost is lower than desalination and avoids tensions with agriculture and human consumption.

The third solution is not technical but political. Water justice must be a principle of the energy transition. No hydrogen project should advance if it compromises access to drinking water for local communities. The priority must be clear: life first, export second.

The numbers show viability. Using wastewater could cover up to 15 percent of the projected water demand for hydrogen by 2030. Direct seawater electrolysis could reduce operating costs by 20 percent if scaled up industrially. These are figures that prove this is not science fiction, but political will and real investment.

The dilemma is clear. Hydrogen can be the excuse to deepen water colonialism, or it can be the impulse for a just and sustainable energy transition. It all depends on who sets the rules: the banks and corporations of the north, or the peoples who put their water at stake.

Green hydrogen is announced as the key to a clean future. But behind every electrolyzer beat the rivers, the aquifers, and the communities that feed it. There will be no just transition if water becomes a commodity to produce molecules destined to light up distant cities while entire peoples continue carrying jugs just to drink.

The history of energy colonialism may repeat itself in another disguise. First it was gold, then oil, now it may be water turned into hydrogen. The discourse changes, the logic remains. The south delivers what is vital, the north keeps the benefit. They call it green energy, but it may end up being blue plunder, hidden in liters of water evaporated in silence.

And yet, not everything is written. Technologies exist that can use seawater and urban waste. Social movements already raise their voices to demand water justice. Governments could still put sovereignty above contracts signed on their knees. Hope is not naivety, it is memory. The peoples who survived past colonialism know they can resist the colonialism of the future.

Green hydrogen can be a mirage or a real opportunity. It can dry out the planet or give it a breath. The decision is not in tanks or ports. It is in the hands of those who must choose between selling the water of life or defending it as a human right.

And that choice will define whether the energy of tomorrow will be liberation or condemnation.

The EV revolution has taken a huge hit since the failed US president brought his team of fossil fuel champions to Washington. Emissions rules? Gone. EV tax credits? Gone. Funding for EV chargers? Gone — although, most of it was later restored. EVs are now viewed as part of the “green new scam” touted by America’s Dear Leader and his jock-sniffing coterie of sycophants.

It’s not just the US that is affected. The malevolence against electric cars in the US has been a disaster for foreign automakers. Volkswagen this week announced it will furlough 160 employees at its ID.4 factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as demand for the car has evaporated. Although everyone in the industry expects EV sales to break records in September as buyers race to get their orders in before September 30, which is when the federal tax incentive ends, after that, sales of electric cars are expected to plummet, and how long will it be before Americans begin to embrace them again is a matter of intense speculation.

Canada Ditches EV Mandate

This week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rescinded a policy put in place by his predecessor that would require automakers in Canada to sell a certain percentage of electric cars beginning next year. According to Bloomberg, the move is designed to support domestic manufacturers whose business has been upended by the cockamamie tariff wars initiated by Washington.

Under the Trudeau plan, 20 percent of new cars sold in Canada in 2026 would need to be electric, rising to 100 percent by the end of 2035. “These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August.

An Engine For All Seasons

So, what are manufacturers who have designed battery electric cars supposed to do now that the bloom is off the EV rose? Horse Powertrain, a joint venture between Renault and Geely, says it has the answer — an ultra-compact engine and integrated generator it says can be retrofitted to any EV to help calm the fears of customers who are still freaked out by charging anxiety.

A year ago, Horse Powertrain introduced a compact electric motor that can be added to virtually any conventional car to boost its efficiency. Next week at the IAA auto show in Munich, if you stop by booth B40 in hall A2, you can see its latest creation.

That may seem like a stretch to most of us. The engine may be diminutive, but there are things like gas tanks and exhaust systems that need to be fitted as well. Horse Powertrain suggests those niggling issue can be overcome. Perhaps they can.

The company slyly suggests its C15 engine is small enough to fit into a briefcase. Actually, it measures 19.7 x 21.7 x 11 inches (50 x 55 x 28 cm). Perhaps briefcases are bigger in Europe and China than they are in the US, but give the company credit for some creative marketing. If you call it a suitcase engine, everyone will want to see it, which is pretty much the point of all marketing.

In a press release, the company says “the C15 integrates an engine, generator, and inverter into a unit compact enough to be fitted within existing battery electric vehicle (BEV) platforms with little to no modification. This allows OEMs to easily and efficiently convert a BEV platform into a range extended EV (REEV), allowing them to expand their product line-ups to meet local market demands.”

Matias Giannini, CEO of Horse Powertrain, said: “Range extended EVs are the fastest-growing powertrain category in many global markets. The Horse C15 range extender solution offers OEMs a straightforward and cost effective way to tap into this opportunity, and adapt their native BEV platforms into REEVs.

“We believe demand for REEVs will continue to grow. Horse C15 will play a critical role in this transition, as one of the market’s most efficient and flexible REEV solutions to date. It also underlines our commitment and ability to support OEMs in delivering a full range of EVs, hybrids, and combustion platforms.”

The C15 has been designed for Euro 7 compliance, including China 7 and SULEV 20. It will be available in naturally aspirated form for B and C segment vehicles, with maximum engine power of up to 70 kW (93 hp). For larger D segment vehicles and commercial vehicles, the addition of a turbocharger increases power output up to 120 kW (161 hp).

The little engine is able to run on gasoline, ethanol or methanol flex fuels, and synthetic fuels. In all applications, the range extender maintains the charge level of the battery used to power the drive motor of an EV. By adding the C15 to an existing model, the manufacturer can elect to use a smaller battery, which could lower the price of the vehicle and make it more appealing to customers.

By definition, the C15 never powers the vehicle’s wheels directly, which allows it to operate as efficiently as possible to minimize fuel consumption and emissions, while keeping noise, vibration, and harshness to a minimum.

Splitting The Difference

Writing in New Atlas, C.C. Weiss summed up the Horse Powertrain phenomenon succinctly. “Horse has always struck us as a company just over the right side of the thin wire fence dividing genius from insanity. Had it debuted a couple of years earlier, when the automotive world had its head down toward going 110% all-in on electric vehicles, it would have struck us as a bit insane, or at least too little, too late.

“But having ramped up at a time when governments and automakers worldwide are rethinking those EV plans and timelines, it seems to be perfectly positioned for a renaissance in hybrid technology. For now, at least.”

We agree. The debate about hybrid, plug-in hybrid, series vs parallel, extended range, and battery electric cars has been raging for nearly 15 years. We confess that here at CleanTechnica, most of us have always laughed at manufacturers who couldn’t make up their minds about what direction the market — and government polices — were likely to go in the future, and so designed their platforms to accept a variety of powertrains.

We thought that was nuts because anyone with more than a 4th grade education could see that EVs were the future. By relying on such multi-dimensional chassis configurations, they are denying their customers some of the important benefits of an EV, such as more interior space for people and stuff, more “cab forward” designs, and worst of all — no frunk!

But as things have developed, the companies that allowed themselves such flexibility may be better positioned for the markets of today. Tomorrow can always take care of itself, we suppose.

It pains us to admit we might have gotten too far out over our skis when it comes to promoting the EV revolution and wishing the S curve would hurry up to work its magic. The biggest factor, of course, other than the whiplash of changes in policy, is that in many places — particularly in the US — EV prices are still significantly higher than they are for conventional cars. That has to change before the EV revolution becomes unstoppable.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/C15-top.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 01:58:53.026868

“Mozambique has the resources, gas, hydro, solar, and it’s already the biggest supplier of excess power to southern Africa,” Banga said.
The World Bank is not financing the project outright.
The World Bank is providing a mix of support including concessional funding for legal and environmental issues and transmission lines, partial risk guarantees and political risk insurance.
In Congo, the World Bank is backing the huge Inga 3 project that could also send electricity to South Africa, Nigeria and others.","SIDUAVA, Mozambique -- Hermínio Guambe used to cut hair in a tiny barbershop with no electricity in his village outside Mozambique’s capital. The arrival of power changed everything.

The 48-year-old now uses hair dryers. The village pharmacy stocks vital medicines requiring refrigeration. More jobs were created as trading and transport picked up.

“These are the kinds of businesses that drive economies,” World Bank President Ajay Banga said in an interview with The Associated Press during a July visit to tour electrification projects and meet entrepreneurs like Guambe. “Electricity isn’t just light, it’s a chance.”

Mozambique has won World Bank backing for the $6 billion Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric plant, southern Africa’s biggest such project in 50 years.

Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries by per capita income, aims to connect all of its 33 million mostly rural citizens to electricity by 2030, largely through renewable energy from hydroelectric, solar and other sources.

The challenge is similar in much of sub-Saharan Africa, home to 85% of the global population living without power, according to the World Bank.

Electricity access in Mozambique has nearly doubled from 31% in 2018 to 60% in 2024. The state-run energy supplier Electricidade de Moçambique, or EDM, says it connected 563,000 homes in 2024 and plans to reach 600,000 this year.

“Mozambique has the resources, gas, hydro, solar, and it’s already the biggest supplier of excess power to southern Africa,” Banga said.

His visit came with fanfare, and political undertones. President Daniel Chapo, who took office after a disputed 2024 election, raised his fist to cheering crowds.

Located 60 kilometers (37 miles) downstream from the even larger Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam along the Zambezi river, the Mphanda Nkuwa plant is expected to generate 1,500 megawatts when it begins operations in 2031. That will help a region facing a 10,000-megawatt deficit that keeps millions from accessing power.

The World Bank is not financing the project outright.

Global energy firm TotalEnergies, French utility Électricité de France and Mozambique’s Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa will develop the plant. The World Bank is providing a mix of support including concessional funding for legal and environmental issues and transmission lines, partial risk guarantees and political risk insurance.

Banga said this approach in Africa aims to move away from reliance on donors for high-impact projects. It coincided with a global shift in development funding. With the Trump administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, multilateral lenders like the World Bank are stepping in, often emphasizing private sector–led growth.

“Many shareholders, even in Europe, are reducing their overseas development assistance budgets because they have to divert the money to defense and their own needs. This is the way it is,” Banga said.

Mphanda Nkuwa could also help Mozambique earn critical foreign exchange through exports of electricity to neighbors like South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is among several large hydropower projects aiming to reshape Africa’s energy future.

Ethiopia is preparing to inaugurate its $4 billion Grand Renaissance Dam, which will eventually generate over 5,000 megawatts, doubling the nation’s power output despite fierce opposition from Egypt. In Congo, the World Bank is backing the huge Inga 3 project that could also send electricity to South Africa, Nigeria and others.

Yet hydropower — the world’s largest source of renewable electricity — remains mostly untapped in Africa, with the World Bank and the International Hydropower Association estimating around 90% of capacity is still unused.

And building a mega-dam is only part of the challenge in Mozambique.

“Our country is quite big, and it’s not so easy to go everywhere with the national grid,” said EDM chairman Joaquim Ou-Chim. “So it’s off-grid solutions, mainly driven by solar.”

About 10% of electricity access in Mozambique comes from off-grid projects, and more are being rolled out.

Evaristo Cumbane, an energy consultant based in Maputo, said large projects like Cahora Bassa and Mphanda Nkuwa are important but stressed the need for smaller, local sources of energy.

“We are talking about plenty of rivers, plenty of sunshine, plenty of wind, plenty of coastlines,” he said, adding that “the real Mozambique is in rural, remote areas.”

Cumbane also urged caution over Mozambique’s growing debt burden. Public debt rose to about $17 billion in the first quarter of 2025. A record $2.1 billion was spent in 2023 in debt service, according to the Finance Ministry.

“The World Bank is not a godfather, it is not god. The guy is here on business. These are not donations,” he said.

It was not clear how much new debt is involved in the Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric project. Banga said the project’s final cost is yet to be determined but estimated $5 billion to $6 billion.

Mozambique’s path has been complicated. Since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, it has seen civil war, flare-ups of fighting following a peace deal and an ongoing Islamist insurgency in the north that forced TotalEnergies to halt a $20 billion gas project, though it hopes to restart operations.

But for Mozambicans, Guambe’s buzzing barbershop is proof of what’s possible when power reaches the people.

In another impoverished neighborhood outside Maputo visited by Banga, 38-year-old Aurélio Arlindo has been unemployed for years and lives without electricity. But new power poles signal hope.

“It’s really coming. I am just waiting,” he said, and he hopes to open a cold drinks stall.

The mirrors tilt to varying degrees throughout the day, tracking the sunrays and projecting them onto a tower. The tower houses a receiver that absorbs intense heat, boils water and produces high-pressure steam. This is then converted into 50 megawatts of electricity — enough to power over 40,000 households for 24 hours.

The KHI Solar One project is one of many looking to add renewable energy to South Africa's power grid, which is heavily reliant on coal-fired power stations.

However, as hundreds of delegates prepare to gather in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit this week, it's clear that many more such projects are needed to bring electricity to millions of people on the continent who need it and to fight the impacts of climate change.

Africa's energy needs

According to the International Energy Agency, about 600 million people on a continent of some 1.5 billion live without electricity, leaving children without lights to study at night and homes without power for appliances.

The World Bank estimates that Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people have no electricity, the electrification rate is as low as 8%.

The lack of electricity also limits the continent's access to quality health care, education and economic growth brought about by a sufficient and uninterrupted power supply.

The continent's embracing of renewable energy has been slow when compared to more developed economies like China, European countries and the U.S., which account for 80% of renewable power capacity installed worldwide.

Only 1.5% of installed renewable power capacity is in Africa.

Renewable energy potential in Africa

According to a report by the United Nations released in July, Africa has 60% of the world's best solar resources with the continent's deserts and warm climate creating massive potential for solar projects.

Despite this, Africa received just 2% of global clean energy investments in 2024.

At a climate summit in January this year, African leaders committed to bringing renewable energy capacity in Africa to 300 gigawatts by 2030. That amount of power equals the output of about 114 large power stations — enough to power a large city or a small country. Meanwhile, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that 90% of Africa's power could be generated from renewables including solar by 2050.

This includes other renewable energy sources besides solar, with countries like South Africa opting for an energy mix that includes hydropower and wind energy.

China's rising solar exports to Africa

Some recent analysis of Chinese export data has shown that exports of solar panels to Africa have increased significantly over the last 12 months.

A report by energy think tank Ember notes that imports from China rose 60% in the last year to 15,032 megawatts, with 20 African countries setting a record for imports of solar panels in a 12-month period.

While the surge in solar panels had previously been buoyed by imports by South Africa, which went through years of power blackouts due to a lengthy electricity crisis, imports of solar panels from outside of South Africa tripled in the last 12 months.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HuQ.Z1jYEg.sNIwg1x2a5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/ddaa0e404cd17be1dbd648bb10e4766d,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:56.504986

Along with Jackson County, the first awardee, Spencer will be on the receiving end of a program that provides local governments with private funding to address environmental barriers, preparing rail-served properties for new industrial uses that attract investment and create lasting jobs.

“Not every job-creating site begins as a blank slate,” said Carl Warren, NCRR president and CEO. “We help communities overcome early redevelopment hurdles, unlocking the potential of rail-served properties.”

Brownfields are sites hindered by environmental concerns that can complicate redevelopment. NCRR’s program helps communities take critical, initial steps toward entry into the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) Brownfields Program, positioning sites for remediation, industrial investment and job creation.

“NCRR is helping communities turn yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities by preparing rail-served sites for new industry and lasting jobs,” said Trish Haver, NCRR’s chief commercial officer.

Spencer plans to facilitate transformation of a property at 2555 North U.S. Highway 29, once a textile dyeing and finishing facility, into a rail-accessible industrial site, attracting investment and expanding job opportunities. NCRR awarded the municipality $99,800 in grant funding, with a 20-percent match, or nearly $20,000, provided by Samet Corporation.

“This funding helps us partner with property owners and redevelopment professionals to ready a site that has remained inactive and largely untouched for roughly 25 years,” Spencer Town Manager Peter Franzese said. “By preparing this property for industrial use, we hope to identify new possibilities for investment and quality jobs in our community, while addressing a site that has long stood as a reminder of one of North Carolina’s most significant economic challenges.”

Jackson County received $92,000 to assess a 42-acre former sawmill site at 3636 Skyland Drive in Sylva which closed in early 2024. The county will provide a 20-percent match toward the $115,000 project, which will fund environmental assessment and remediation planning. The goal is to repurpose the property for future industrial use.

“This project allows Jackson County to transform a recently closed sawmill into new opportunities for our people and our future,” said Kevin King, Jackson County manager. “With NCRR’s support, we are preparing the site for industry, rail access and workforce training. These investments will create good jobs and long-term prosperity for families across Western North Carolina.”

To ensure long-term impact, the railroad company requires that supported sites:

• Enter the NCDEQ Brownfields Program as part of redevelopment planning.

• Use grant funds within two years of the award for on-site remediation.

• Secure a company that will move at least 40 rail cars annually for five years; if not, partial repayment may be required.

For investors, the U.S. natural gas sector presents a compelling case study in how strategic infrastructure development and regional production shifts can create long-term value.

Production Growth and Regional Drivers

U.S. dry natural gas production has defied expectations of decline, surging to 107.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in June 2025—a 4.5% increase compared to June 2024 and the highest monthly output since 1973 [1]. This growth is underpinned by robust performance in key shale basins. The Permian Basin, for instance, added 2 Bcf/d in 2025 alone, while the Haynesville and Appalachia regions each contributed an additional 0.9 Bcf/d [2]. These gains reflect a strategic reallocation of drilling rigs to gas-rich plays, with the Haynesville region seeing an 18% increase in active rigs between April and August 2025 [2].

The EIA forecasts that 2025 production will average 106 Bcf/d, a 3% rise from 2024 levels, with growth sustained by new infrastructure. The Louisiana Energy Gateway pipeline, set to expand takeaway capacity in the Haynesville region, and LNG export projects like Golden Pass and Plaquemines LNG Phase 2 are critical to unlocking future output [2].

Demand Resilience and Export Dynamics

Despite flat domestic consumption, U.S. natural gas demand remains resilient due to its role in power generation and industrial processes. However, the true driver of demand is the global LNG market. Exports are projected to rise by 2 Bcf/d in 2025–2026, tightening supply-demand balances and supporting price stability [2]. This trend is amplified by Europe’s continued reliance on U.S. LNG to replace Russian imports and Asia’s seasonal demand spikes, particularly in Japan and South Korea.

Price Resilience and Investment Implications

Natural gas prices have exhibited remarkable seasonal resilience, with the Henry Hub price averaging $3.60 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the second half of 2025 and projected to climb to $4.30/MMBtu in 2026 [2]. This upward trajectory is fueled by infrastructure bottlenecks—such as constrained takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin—and the ramp-up of LNG export facilities. For investors, this volatility underscores opportunities in midstream assets, such as pipelines and processing facilities, which are essential to monetizing production gains.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

Shale Plays and Drilling Efficiency: The Permian, Haynesville, and Appalachia basins remain high-conviction areas. The Permian’s associated gas production, driven by record crude oil output, is expected to add 11.5 Bcf/d in 2025 [4]. Operators with strong acreage in these regions and access to capital-efficient drilling technologies will outperform.

Midstream Infrastructure: Projects like the Matterhorn Express Pipeline and Louisiana Energy Gateway are critical to alleviating bottlenecks and enabling production growth. These assets offer stable cash flows and long-term value as they connect supply hubs to export terminals.

LNG Export Facilities: With global demand for cleaner energy intensifying, new LNG terminals will become pivotal. The EIA estimates that U.S. LNG exports could reach 12 Bcf/d by 2026, creating a tailwind for companies involved in terminal construction and operations [2].

Conclusion

The U.S. natural gas market is undergoing a transformation, characterized by production growth, infrastructure innovation, and export-driven demand. While 2026 may see production stabilize, the long-term outlook—projected to reach 120 Bcf/d by 2040—remains bullish [5].

The bigger problem is that, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, Canada’s federal and provincial governments – mainly Ontario and Quebec – have earmarked up to $52.5 billion to subsidize 13 major Electric Vehicle supply chain projects, 14% more than the $46.1 billion the EV industry in Canada is spending on itself.

While most of these subsidies have yet to be paid, these governments have a huge financial stake of taxpayers’ money in the eventual success of the EV industry, with some projects already delayed because of lower-than-expected EV sales due to higher costs to consumers compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, a shortage of public charging stations and reduced range in cold weather.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have further decreased sales of EVs and the U.S. is abandoning subsidies to the American EV sector approved by his predecessor, Joe Biden, throwing the future of Canada’s EV industry into doubt.

Canada to stall electric vehicle rules as Carney seeks to boost auto sector

Poilievre accuses PM of flip-flopping on gas, diesel car ban

ELBOWS DOWN: Carney sees popularity drop, Tories still leading Liberals

When Carney announced his decision to cancel the 20% mandate for new EV sales in 2026 on Friday, he said the government will conduct a 60-day review of future mandates of 60% of new car sales being EVs by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

He said this will “consider potential amendments to the annual sales targets,” as well as “explore possible additional flexibilities” to ensure government programs promoting EV sales “reflect market realities, remain effective for Canadians” and do not “place undue burden on automakers.”

Aside from responding to the public’s declining interest in EVs in a time of economic uncertainty, rising unemployment and cost-of-living concerns, Carney is responding to warnings from the auto sector that its unrealistic EV mandates would further damage Canada’s struggling auto sector, which employs almost 550,000 Canadians in direct and indirect jobs.

Carney’s cancellation of the consumer carbon tax and his postponement of the 2026 EV mandate – both Justin Trudeau-era policies – while welcome, are baby steps compared to what really needs to be done.

They are only two of more than 140 federal government programs, administered by 13 federal departments and agencies, that as of 2023 had committed more than $200 billion of taxpayers’ money to address climate change.

Independent evaluations – for example, by the federal environment commissioner and PBO – have concluded they will fall far short of achieving Canada’s target of reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050.

RECOMMENDED VIDEO

According to the latest government data from 2023, emissions were down only 8.5%.

The problem with these unrealistic federal targets is that they lead to unattainable and costly policies, such as the now-cancelled mandate that EVs had to reach 20% of all new car sales by next year.

A report by federal environment commissioner Jerry DeMarco following an audit of the Liberals’ Net Zero Emissions Accountability Act last year concluded the government’s lack of transparency made it impossible for the average citizen to understand, much less believe, its claim it will reduce Canada’s emissions by at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.

In examining a sampling of 20 government measures to reduce emissions, it found only nine were on track to achieve their goals.

Of 32 additional measures the government claimed would help boost reductions from 36.2% to at least 40% in 2030, only seven were new.

An investigation last year by Auditor General Karen Hogan of the now-disbanded, $1-billion Sustainable Development Technology Fund, which audited a sampling of the projects it funded, found 90 cases where conflict-of-interest rules were not followed in awarding $76 million worth of government contracts and 10 examples where $56 million was awarded to ineligible projects.

It’s not just the Liberal government’s EV mandates that needs to be critically assessed. So does its entire $200-billion program to address climate change.

Black Hollow Sun I delivers clean energy to Platte River Power Authority, powering thousands of local homes

SEVERANCE, Colo. — A major milestone for renewable energy in Northern Colorado arrived this week as ContourGlobal announced the start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I (BHS I), a 185-megawatt solar facility located just east of Fort Collins.

The project, the company’s first renewable facility in the United States, is delivering electricity directly to Platte River Power Authority, which serves Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. Once complete in 2026, the two-phase Black Hollow Sun complex will be the largest photovoltaic installation in Northern Colorado, producing enough power to supply more than 73,000 homes while offsetting nearly 450,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions annually.

Regional Impact

BHS I created a significant economic boost during construction, generating about 450 direct jobs and 250 indirect jobs for skilled workers and regional partners across Weld County and surrounding communities. With BHS II already under construction, more opportunities for local contractors, suppliers, and service providers are expected over the next year.

The clean power produced by the project will strengthen the resilience of Northern Colorado’s electric grid while supporting the community-owned Platte River Power Authority’s commitment to reliable, low-carbon energy.

Looking Ahead

ContourGlobal leaders say this development is part of a larger U.S. strategy to expand renewable energy investments. American-manufactured solar modules provided by Qcells are being used in the project, underscoring both domestic supply partnerships and long-term sustainability goals.

The company has also shown its commitment to community engagement, recently sponsoring the Severance Days Festival, strengthening ties with the growing town located just 16 miles from Fort Collins.

Robotic arms swing methodically, while digital screens display real-time production data.

The park has established a complete industrial chain covering research and design, manufacturing and quality testing, according to He Changguo, manager of the firm's northern regional manufacturing center. Since 2008, wind turbines produced in the park have been deployed in more than 100 projects across China.

This facility epitomizes the accelerating pace of Inner Mongolia's green transition. Rich in coal and central to China's energy supply, the region accounted for more than one-quarter of the nation's coal output in 2024. This wealth of resources fueled decades of growth but also tied the region to high-polluting and resource-heavy industries.

In recent years, however, the nationwide low-carbon push has set the region on a new course. By tapping its abundant wind and solar resources, the region is cultivating fresh momentum for growth. Once renowned for its coal reserves and desert environment, Inner Mongolia is now dotted with vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.

So far, over 30 companies similar to Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, which operate full industrial chains in the new energy sector, have taken root in the region. In 2024, the added value of large-scale new energy and related industries rose by 20.1 percent compared with 2023, and that of new energy equipment manufacturers surged 42.4 percent year on year.

Gong Mingzhu, director of the regional Development and Reform Commission, said Inner Mongolia has established a comprehensive industrial chain for wind, solar, hydrogen and energy storage equipment manufacturing, effectively positioning the region to embark on a new chapter in industrial development.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.

A plant in Ordos exemplifies this transformation. Built by Inner Mongolia Baofeng Coal-based New Material Co., Ltd., the facility synthesizes olefins -- a class of chemical compounds serving as key raw materials for industrial products from plastics to textiles and aerospace components -- from coal.

With an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes, this facility stands as the world's largest single-site coal-to-olefins project, according to the company.

Notably, the plant employs green hydrogen at scale to replace fossil fuels in olefin production, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 6.3 million tonnes annually.

In 2024, Inner Mongolia's modern coal chemical industry output exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 14.07 billion U.S. dollars), while the region ranked first nationwide in both coal-to-gas and coal-to-olefin production capacities.

""Simply mining and selling coal cannot fully realize the value of Inner Mongolia's energy endowment, nor can it meet the requirements of building a modern country,"" said Hu Chengdong, deputy director of the regional energy bureau.

It is imperative for Inner Mongolia to transition from an extractive growth model, shift from factor-driven to innovation-driven development, and propel traditional industries toward higher efficiency and greater value, Hu added. ■",,N,,2025-09-06 22:02:46.662188

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump.
Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.
In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk's previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time.","Synopsis

Tesla has proposed a new pay package for Elon Musk, potentially making him the world's first trillion-dollar executive if he meets aggressive targets, including significant increases in car production, share price, and operating profit. However, Tesla faces challenges such as declining sales in Europe due to Musk's political affiliations and intensifying competition from rivals like BYD.

The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee - not least because of Tesla's main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

""It doesn't matter how much money he gets. He can't help himself,"" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. ""And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.""

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Live Events

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla's 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, ""Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, ""We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.""

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk's previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla's last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of ""transformative and unprecedented"" growth - despite the drop in sales and profits - and noting that the CEO hadn't been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn't be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company's shares, up from 13% today.

Tesla's stock nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

BP is seeking a development consent order (DCO), which is required for nationally significant infrastructure projects, for a blue hydrogen plant on the Teesworks site in Redcar.

The government had been set to make its decision by 28 August, but this has now been pushed back to 30 October to ""allow time to request further information"", according to MP Miatta Fahnbulleh.

Since BP first announced its plans, landowners South Tees Group (STG) has sought permission for the data centre.

If the hydrogen plant is approved, BP would be given the power to compulsorily purchase the land it needs.

But STG now has different plans for the site and wants to build a giant AI data centre on it instead.

Teesworks is run as a joint venture between the publicly-owned and funded South Tees Development Corporation, led by the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA), and two Teesside businessmen, Martin Corney and Chris Musgrave.

The men initially owned 50% of the shares of Teesworks, but that was raised to 90% in 2021 with the remaining 10% staying in public hands.

BP has said the plant would be one of the UK's largest blue hydrogen facilities and represent more than 10% of the government's hydrogen production target by 2030.

But in a letter detailing its opposition to BP's plans, STG claimed the proposed data centre, which was approved by Redcar and Cleveland Council in the summer, was of ""critical national importance"".

For renewable energy investors, the pause raises questions about the alignment of Canada’s energy transition with its automotive policy.
A slowdown in EV sales could indirectly weaken the business case for renewable energy projects, particularly those tied to grid modernization and battery storage.
Opportunities in Alternative Clean Energy While the EV mandate pause may dampen short-term momentum for battery electric vehicles, it opens avenues for alternative clean energy pivots.
Global investment in clean energy is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, dwarfing fossil fuel investments [6].","The Canadian government’s decision to pause its 2026 electric vehicle (EV) mandate has sent ripples through the automotive and renewable energy sectors, creating a complex landscape of strategic risks and opportunities for investors. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s move, announced amid escalating trade tensions with the United States and domestic industry lobbying, suspends a policy that would have required 20% of new light-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2026. While the long-term targets of 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain intact, the immediate pause reflects a recalibration of priorities in the face of economic headwinds [1].

Strategic Risks for Investors

The automotive sector, particularly automakers and dealers, has welcomed the pause as a necessary reprieve from what they describe as unrealistic targets. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) has praised the decision, arguing that the mandate’s aggressive timelines risked affordability crises and supply chain disruptions [2]. However, this pause introduces uncertainty for EV infrastructure investment. According to a report by BloombergNEF, Canada’s EV charging network expansion had already lagged behind its climate goals, with only 12% of required charging stations operational as of mid-2025 [3]. The suspension of the 2026 mandate may further delay private-sector commitments to infrastructure, as companies reassess the viability of long-term projects.

For renewable energy investors, the pause raises questions about the alignment of Canada’s energy transition with its automotive policy. The federal government’s Clean Electricity Strategy, which aims to position Canada as a global leader in low-carbon technologies, relies on robust EV adoption to drive demand for clean power [4]. A slowdown in EV sales could indirectly weaken the business case for renewable energy projects, particularly those tied to grid modernization and battery storage.

Opportunities in Alternative Clean Energy

While the EV mandate pause may dampen short-term momentum for battery electric vehicles, it opens avenues for alternative clean energy pivots. The government’s 60-day review of the EV Availability Standard (EVAS) has already sparked discussions about biofuels and hydrogen as complementary technologies. For instance, the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association has lobbied for expanded incentives for biofuel integration, which could diversify the country’s decarbonization strategy [5].

Investors may also find opportunities in the renewable energy sector’s broader resilience. Global investment in clean energy is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, dwarfing fossil fuel investments [6]. Canada’s Green Bond Program, which has raised over $11 billion since 2023, continues to fund projects in solar, wind, and grid modernization, even as EV policy evolves [7]. Additionally, the federal government’s $5-billion Strategic Response Fund, designed to cushion industries against U.S. trade pressures, could redirect capital toward innovation in low-carbon manufacturing and energy storage [8].

Balancing the Scales: A Call for Flexibility

The pause underscores the need for policy flexibility in a rapidly shifting economic and technological landscape. While environmental advocates warn that the move risks undermining Canada’s climate commitments, industry leaders argue it preserves jobs and stabilizes the auto sector during a period of global uncertainty [9]. For investors, the key lies in hedging against volatility by diversifying portfolios across EV-related infrastructure, renewable energy, and alternative decarbonization technologies.

The coming months will be critical. The 60-day review of the EVAS, set to conclude by October 2025, could yield adjustments that reconcile industry needs with climate goals. In the interim, investors must navigate a landscape where policy uncertainty coexists with long-term opportunities in clean energy. As one analyst noted, “The pause isn’t a pivot—it’s a recalibration. The direction remains clear; the pace may shift” [10].",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 20:01:04.514454

Nio (NYSE:NIO) Stock

Chinese EV maker NIO recently reported mixed results for Q2 2025. The company missed sales estimates, as robust growth in deliveries, driven by models like the ONVO L90, was offset by the impact of price wars amid intense competition in the Chinese EV market.

Nonetheless, improved deliveries and optimism about the demand for the ES8 model have moved NIO ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) higher by 32% over the past month and more than 36% year-to-date.

Looking ahead, Nio expects Q3 vehicle deliveries in the range of 87,000 to 91,000 units, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 40.7% to 47.1%. It is worth noting that Nio’s August deliveries jumped 55% to 31,305 units, including 10,575 units of the ONVO L90, the flagship SUV of its mass-market brand.

Is NIO a Good Stock to Buy?

Reacting to the Q2 print, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the price target for NIO stock to $6 from $3.50, while reiterating a Hold rating. The 5-star analyst noted that Nio’s Q2 revenue and earnings were “modestly softer” compared to the consensus estimates. Rakesh added that Nio’s Q3 deliveries guidance of 89,000 units (at the midpoint), which missed the consensus of 91,100 units, indicates 47% sequential growth and a new lower average selling price (ASP) related to the Firefly/ONVO L90 ramps.

While better near-term EV demand for lower ASP models is helping, Rakesh argues that the expectation for exiting Q4 2025 at about 50,000 deliveries per month seems challenging. Overall, Rakesh believes that NIO is fairly valued at a price-to-sales (2026) multiple of 0.8x, as near-term revenue and delivery tailwinds are offset by margin challenges as models ramp.

Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Nio stock based on six Buys, five Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NIO stock price target of $5.95 indicates that the stock is fully valued at current levels.

XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) Stock

Let’s look at another Chinese EV maker, XPeng, which has seen its stock rally about 68% year-to-date. XPeng impressed investors with a 125% year-over-year jump in its Q2 revenue. Moreover, the company reported a 63% year-over-year reduction in its second-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders, thanks to robust deliveries and improved margins.

XPeng is benefiting from continued demand for the Mona M03 and P7+ sedans, the updated versions of the G6, G9, and X9 models, and the launch of the new G7 SUV.

Looking ahead, XPeng is confident about continued growth, backed by its focus on innovation and overseas expansion. In the first half of the year, XPEV’s overseas deliveries surpassed 18,000 units, increasing more than 200% year-over-year.

Is XPEV a Good Stock to Buy?

Recently, Jefferies analyst Alexious Lee reiterated a Buy rating on XPeng stock with a price target of $29. The 4-star analyst hosted a post-result non-deal roadshow (NDR) for XPeng in Hong Kong. Lee noted that XPeng’s first-half results beat expectations, thanks to solid margins from economies of scale.

Lee sees a clear path to profitability by the fourth quarter of this year, with the G7 and new P7 models set to start mass deliveries. Lee stated that he views XPeng’s “tech DNA as the most differentiated moat,” which is combining rapid product innovation, AI leadership, and global expansion to bolster its place as a top-tier EV maker. Further, Lee believes that the CEO’s share buyback reflects confidence in XPeng’s trajectory.

Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on XPeng stock based on nine Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average XPEV stock price target of $25.75 indicates about 30% upside potential.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock

Tesla stock has been under pressure this year due to concerns about weak deliveries, CEO Elon Musk’s political distractions, and a lack of innovation. The stock is down 13% year-to-date and has underperformed the broader market.

However, TSLA stock has recovered 14% over the past month due to optimism about the company’s full self-driving (FSD) technology, the continued rollout of its robotaxi service, and prospects for Optimus, its humanoid robot.

Moreover, investors cheered the decision of Tesla’s board to approve a $1 trillion pay package for CEO Musk, contingent upon his achieving certain milestones.

Is TSLA Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Reacting to the board’s proposed pay package for Musk, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro called the milestones “very aggressive.” The 4-star analyst added that achieving these targets would “clearly require sustained executional excellence” and strong growth in auto deliveries, FSD success, robotaxi traction, and robust success of the Optimus humanoid robot.

Gengaro stated that the unprecedented pay package clearly incentivizes Musk to lead Tesla for the long term. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $440.

Overall, Tesla scores a Hold consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 14 Holds, and eight Sell recommendations. The average TSLA stock price target of $309 indicates about 12% downside risk from current levels.

Conclusion

Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Nio and XPeng stocks, but sidelined on Tesla. Analysts see higher upside potential in XPEV stock than in the other two EV stocks. XPeng’s robust deliveries in recent quarters, despite intense competition in the Chinese EV market, solid execution, and improving margins support analysts’ bullish stance.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2314812733-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 20:00:53.548918

City Council members approved a $4 million loan agreement with the Texas Water Development Board during their Aug. 26 meeting. The funds will go toward a water treatment project to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that are commonly known as “forever chemicals,” from fluid coming from the city’s southeast landfill before being treated.

The chemicals have been found in leachate, the fluid that drains from landfills or through waste, that then flows into the city’s wastewater collection system and is treated at the Village Creek Water Reclamation Facility, city spokesperson Mary Gugliuzza said in a statement.

The southeast landfill receives residential, commercial and industrial waste.

Because of the amount of PFAS collected over the last 50 years in solid waste streams, leachate often contains high concentrations of the chemicals, Gugliuzza said.

PFAS are made up of manufactured chemicals that break down very slowly and can build up in humans, animals and in the environment over time, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Forever chemicals can be found in sources of drinking water systems, landfill and disposal sites, fire extinguishing foam, food packaging, household cleaning products, biosolids and manufacturing or chemical production plants.

Exposure to the chemicals can lead to decreased fertility, developmental effects in children, increased risk of some cancers, a weakened immune system and increased cholesterol levels, according to the EPA.

The project comes in response to the city’s requirements on industrial waste pretreatment, Gugliuzza added, which limits the amount of forever chemicals that go through wastewater treatment.

The city will not have to repay the loan as long as it meets contractual requirements, according to city documents.

Fort Worth leaders have taken up other water quality treatment projects recently to address PFAS in local water supplies.

In March, city officials joined a lawsuit alleging the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth and chemical manufacturers contaminated Fort Worth’s water supply by using products containing forever chemicals, including fire-fighting foam.

The city sought $420 million in reimbursement for treating the water. The lawsuit, originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, was dismissed by Fort Worth officials.

They later joined a federal lawsuit filed out of South Carolina along with other plaintiffs against the original 12 defendants. City officials could not provide an update on the case.

Water treatment plant to supply additional millions of gallons of water

Council members also approved a contract with the state water board to fund the $180 million expansion of the Eagle Mountain Water Treatment Plant.

The plant will be able to treat an additional 35 million gallons a day after the expansion, up from the 105 million gallons a day it currently produces.

The funds, made available through the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas, offers local governments financial assistance to fund projects related to conservation and reuse, water treatment plants, reservoirs and pipelines.

The expansion project comes in response to rapid development and population growth.

Fort Worth has 1 million residents. Officials expect to add 550,000 more residents by 2045 throughout the city’s service areas, water utility director Chris Harder said in a Feb. 18 meeting.

The water department ultimately plans on expanding the Eagle Mountain plant to produce up to 200 million gallons a day, Harder said. The total expansion is projected to cost up to $250 million.

However, as gas prices fluctuate wildly, many Americans may reconsider the cars they drive and how much they drive.","Gas can get real expensive, real fast

Unless you are a proud owner of an electric car, you know that paying for gas is an expense that cannot be ignored for the life of you. It’s one of those routine costs that sneaks up on your budget every week, and depending on where you live, it can take a much bigger bite out of your paycheck than you might expect. Gas prices vary wildly across the country, but the real story isn’t just about what’s posted on the pump; it’s about how much of your paycheck is swallowed up at the gas pump.

For some drivers, it’s a manageable hit and just another part of the weekly grind. For others, it can be a heart-wrenching expense that creates a significant hole in their online banking statements. A new study looking at both pump prices and local incomes paints a clearer picture of which states’ drivers are sacrificing the most just to keep moving.

The brains at FinanceBuzz used data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources like AAA to calculate and compile the U.S. states where the average driver spends the most of their monthly income on gas.

They found that drivers' gas spending and financial impact can vary significantly based on various factors like the median income in different states, the average number of miles they drive, and local gas prices. After analyzing all the data, it was determined that, on average, Americans spend 2.28% of their income on gas nationwide. However, in some states, this expenditure can be as high as 3.73%, while in others, it can drop as low as 0.76%.

Drivers in the South have it the worst at the pump

FinanceBuzz analyzed states where drivers need to budget heavily for gas, revealing that in many of these states, apart from Montana and Florida, drivers clock in over 1,000 miles per month on average. These states are often large and rural, resulting in long daily drives that can lead to higher fuel costs than their residents can afford.

Mississippi and Arkansas have the lowest median incomes, with the average driver taking home less than $50,000 a year, and New Mexico and Louisiana are close behind. Despite states like Mississippi having some of the lowest gas prices nationally, drivers in these states spend a larger chunk of their income on gas, due to the combination of low earnings and high monthly mileage.

Drivers in D.C. and on the Coasts have it the best at the pump

Unlike the states where drivers spend a large portion of their income on gas, the states where people spend a much smaller percentage of their take-home pay tend to be smaller, more urbanized areas with higher median incomes.

Drivers in Washington, D.C. may spend the smallest percentage of their incomes on gas, but FinanceBuzz notes that drivers there clock in an average of just 440 miles per month, the lowest in the country. Though it’s technically not a state, our nation’s capital is a city with a well-developed public transportation system that enables people to get around without much driving. At the same time, drivers in New York and Rhode Island drive fewer than 600 miles per month on average, largely due to the New York Metro Area’s robust transit systems and Rhode Island being the smallest U.S. state by total land area.

In addition, drivers in states on this list tend to have higher average incomes. The median income in Washington, D.C., is the highest in the country, topping $100,000, while median earnings in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland rank among the highest in the country.

Final thoughts

Ultimately, the link between gas prices, income, and the cars Americans drive underscores the complexity of decisions influenced by economic circumstances. Beyond our cities, the United States is a landscape where gas prices play a pivotal role in shaping the choices of a diverse range of car owners. The connection between income levels and gas prices can significantly impact what people drive and how much gas they use. However, as gas prices fluctuate wildly, many Americans may reconsider the cars they drive and how much they drive.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ec6b54898649cb72ac9af060130ea595,N,,2025-09-06 19:06:42.737518

Gavin Newsom, whose administration signaled strong opposition to advancing E15 ahead of a California Air Resources Board regulatory review.

In testimony at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing last month on Assembly Bill 30, California Department of Finance officials labeled the bill as duplicative and unnecessary. A budget official pointed to the $2.3 million and 10 positions the Legislature approved this year for CARB to implement the new E15 standards, resources that will not be available until the agency completes its review.

The administration’s opposition to AB 30 centers on new costs to the California Department of Food and Agriculture for enforcing petroleum product quality standards. CDFA would need new equipment to sample and test E15, along with other expenses for maintenance and supplies. To cover those costs, the department would have to raise its motor vehicle fee beyond the current five cents per gallon. Increasing fuel fees would run counter to the administration's priority to lower gas prices.

Finance staff underscored that CARB’s review is the proper venue to determine how E15 fits within those standards.

Newsom has until Oct. 12 to decide.

Legislative Push for Lower Prices

Despite the administration’s stance, lawmakers moved the bill with rare bipartisan unity. The Assembly passed AB 30 in June without opposition, and the Senate followed with a 39-0 vote this week. With its urgency statute, the bill would take effect immediately upon the governor’s signature.

Backers have highlighted the potential for cost savings as Californians continue to pay some of the nation’s highest gas prices. A University of California, Berkeley and U.S. Naval Academy study estimated drivers could save about 20 cents per gallon, or $2.7 billion statewide, if E15 were widely available.

“California consumers cannot wait any longer,” said California Sen. Laura Richardson, D-South Bay, during the floor debate.

The bill’s author, Assemblymember David Alvarez, D-San Diego, argued it is past time for the state to join the other 49 states that already allow the blend.

Industry groups representing ethanol producers and corn growers have echoed those arguments, citing both economic and environmental benefits. Studies by CARB and UC Riverside have suggested E15 could cut tailpipe pollutants that contribute to smog and health risks.

Fuel Industry Urges Signature

The Renewable Fuels Association pressed Newsom to sign quickly.

“Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15 — healthier air, better engine performance and cost savings at the pump,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “Now California drivers are on the cusp of experiencing those same advantages.”

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor pointed out that E15 is already approved for use in 96% of all light-duty vehicles on the road.

“Growth Energy has already begun to provide technical expertise in support of CARB’s still-forthcoming E15 approval rulemaking, and we encourage the state to identify other ways to maximize the impact AB 30 can have in the short-term,” said Skor. “With AB 30, the Legislature heard and responded to California drivers that demanded more affordable fuel options.”

In addition to national trade groups, California-based stakeholders have lined up behind the bill. The California Farm Bureau has endorsed AB 30, citing potential relief for rural communities facing high fuel costs. The California Fuels and Convenience Alliance, which represents the state’s retailers, has also backed the measure.

What’s Next

Newsom now faces a decision that could anger Democrats and biofuel producers alike if he issues a veto. His administration has leaned on fiscal concerns, warning that authorizing E15 before CARB’s process concludes would raise state spending — as it continues to grapple with an ongoing budget deficit — while undermining regulatory integrity.

In a special session last year, lawmakers shot down a bill to accelerate E15. Matthew Botill, a division chief at CARB, explained to the lawmakers that the agency must evaluate the potential air, water and soil impacts. That has led to several studies and literature assessments, followed by a review from an environmental policy committee, extending the process. Once that is completed, CARB can consider reopening the rulemaking, triggering several more months of hearings and administrative review.

“It's a resource-intensive process,” said Botill. “It does take time and staff on the CARB side.”

Two weeks after the bill stalled, Newsom directed CARB to accelerate its review regardless of the legislation. A month later, Alvarez echoed that message with AB 30.

Newsom's office declined Friday to comment on his plans for the bill.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/QI8cdkoufBfmwkc6h6GViAr8dC0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ethanol20from20flickr-2000-0a0d81f6221043f98e22ca5a38613e31.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 19:02:44.074432

International markets are gaining significant ground due to more attractive valuations, favorable monetary policy, and a different mix of companies.
While the U.S. equities markets will remain the gold standard, there are definitive signs that global dynamics are shifting.","For much of the past decade, the U.S. stock market has dramatically outperformed its global counterparts. A major reason is the emergence and dominance of the U.S. technology sector and the rapid expansion of “mega-cap” companies such as Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia. However, there are signs that international equities may be making a comeback.

Thus far this year, international stocks are enjoying higher returns than those of U.S. firms by some measures. This phenomenon has not been limited to a single region, as numerous markets have shown impressive gains. Historically, the performance leader has swung from the U.S. to the rest of the world and back multiple times, and several key factors are contributing to this current shift.

One reason is the high values of U.S. stocks, particularly in the technology sector, which have been trading at a significant premium compared to international equities. Price-to-earnings ratios for U.S. stocks have been higher for quite a while. In fact, the valuation gap is the widest that it has been in decades. As a result, other major markets are becoming a more attractive proposition for value-seeking investors.

In addition, many countries began easing up on monetary policy before the United States. The Federal Reserve has not yet reduced interest rates this year (following three moves in 2024), while central banks elsewhere (particularly in Europe) have implemented cuts. Much of this pattern stems from the potential inflationary effects of tariffs and the resilience of domestic growth. Nonetheless, this approach has put U.S. economic prospects and corporate earnings at a comparative disadvantage.

Another factor is that, while U.S. market strength has been highly concentrated in relatively few technology-oriented stocks, other sectors, such as financials and industrials, are now showing some momentum. These segments are more heavily represented in international markets, thus enhancing the attractiveness of global investments.

Despite the performance of international stocks, investors have been slow to shift until recently. There is growing acknowledgment of the risks associated with concentration in the U.S. market due to high valuations and the importance of a small number of firms to overall returns. Additionally, U.S. firms are affected by various domestic policy issues which have brought unprecedented uncertainty and notable volatility of late (though many nations face significant challenges).

International markets are gaining significant ground due to more attractive valuations, favorable monetary policy, and a different mix of companies. The underlying driver of stock markets is expected firm profitability which is in turn dependent on economic conditions and innovation. While the U.S. equities markets will remain the gold standard, there are definitive signs that global dynamics are shifting. The coming months should be quite interesting to watch.

As the CTO for GE's Energy Storage division, Hollo built a global engineering organization of 120+ employees and oversaw the scale-up of GE's Durathon™ battery plant in Schenectady, New York. The factory produced a sodium-nickel battery based on a similar sodium metal chloride (NaMX) chemistry as Inlyte's iron-sodium battery, and Hollo will bring his decades of experience with the technology to optimize Inlyte's products for the stationary storage market. Most recently, Hollo served as the Chief Engineer at REFIRE, a leading fuel cell and electrolyzer manufacturer. ""Having spent over a decade commercializing sodium metal chloride batteries, I can say with confidence that what Inlyte has accomplished is a real leap forward,"" said Hollo. ""Inlyte's iron-sodium battery is technically mature, the supply chain is secure, and the company is ready to meet the needs of today's grid.""

Armstrong joins following a distinguished career in manufacturing across Ford Motor Company, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Tesla, and Zero Motorcycles. At Tesla, Armstrong led a team of 1,800 employees manufacturing powertrain products for the Model X and Model S, and she brings her experience in scaling high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing in the United States to Inlyte. Armstrong also served as the VP of Manufacturing and Programs at Zero Motorcycles, where she doubled the company's manufacturing footprint in California to grow battery and motor production. ""In my experience, high-volume manufacturing is one of the hardest transitions for startups,"" said Armstrong. ""I'm excited to bring my experience scaling domestic manufacturing to deliver resilient, affordable energy storage to our customers.""

Goswami co-founded Molekule and led the company as the CEO, President, and CTO to $100M+ in revenue, $100M+ in successive fundraises and a public listing through a merger with AeroClean Technologies. Goswami's decision to join the leadership team follows his term as a Venture Partner at At One Ventures, where he led the firm's initial investment in Inlyte Energy. Goswami will lead Inlyte's finance and strategy to position the company for its next phase of growth. ""Inlyte has a unique position of innovative but proven technology, unbeatable cost, and surging customer interest,"" said Goswami. ""Now it's time to execute on our vision for large scale, safe, cost-effective energy storage.""

These hires come as Inlyte has announced its first utility-scale BESS project with Southern Company and a Department of Energy-backed commercial-scale project in a fire-risk zone in Northern California this year. The team will be attending the RE+ Conference in Las Vegas, NV next week to build commercial partnerships for Inlyte's first US factory.

(CNN) — The Environmental Protection Agency has moved to suspend more than 100 staffers who signed a letter of dissent against the Trump administration’s policies in July, a representative of the union covering the agency’s staff told CNN on Friday.

The EPA previously moved to fire a handful of employees late last week, but now it is taking disciplinary action against more than 130 employees also suspected of signing the letter, the representative said. These employees were sent letters indicating they would be suspended for 14 days without pay.

The reason cited in the letters is for “conduct unbecoming of a federal employee,” the representative said, noting that is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, under the circumstances.

An EPA spokesperson would not confirm the report or details, saying the agency “does not comment on individual personnel matters.”

“These workers bravely voiced concerns about harmful changes at the Agency that threaten the lives of every American. And we know the administration’s motives are not about government efficiency or advancing public safety. Placing these workers on leave and now firing or suspending them months later has wasted over 47,000 work hours and $2 million. This is simply about squashing dissent and preventing workers from protecting American lives,” said Justin Chen, president of the union group AFGE Council 238, in a statement Friday.

The EPA placed roughly 140 employees on administrative leave in July, days after they signed a public letter expressing concern about the treatment of federal employees and the Trump administration’s regulations on climate and public health. In the letter, employees criticized the EPA, saying it has strayed from its core mission to protect human health and the environment.

The EPA conducted an “administrative investigation” into the employees, who were placed on administrative leave until July 17, according to internal emails viewed by CNN at the time. Some employees were let go last week, but additional staff members were affected on Thursday.

On Friday, the agency’s spokesperson also repeated its previous statement on the matter, saying the EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage, and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November. Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”",https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:02:59.764527

Although the energy-rich Central Asian nation is expected to soon become the third-largest holder of rare earth reserves in the world, Astana is signaling that it wants to be more than just a raw material supplier.

Kazakhstan’s decades-old cooperation with major international energy giants has shaped the country’s overall economic growth. The nation’s GDP per capita ($14,770, by far the highest in Central Asia) is expected to surpass Russia’s $14,260 and China’s $13,690. But from the Kazakh perspective, things could be even better. Astana now seeks to revise its contracts with Western oil corporations, particularly when it comes to oil exploitation.

According to reports, 98% of the revenue generated from Kashagan – a massive offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan’s most valuable find in the last five decades – is being funneled into the profits of Shell (UK), Eni (Italy) and Total Energies (France). It is, therefore, no surprise that the Central Asian nation aims to secure a more favorable stance in these arrangements.

Another challenge for Kazakhstan is the very structure of its export portfolio. Presently, Europe primarily imports oil from Kazakhstan, with 80% of it passing through Russia. Astana is actively working to diversify its exports and boost crude oil shipments via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.

Simultaneously, Astana is expected to continue working toward another ambitious goal: generating 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 50 percent by 2050. It is part of the nation’s strategy to become a significant exporter of green electricity to Europe.

In parallel, Kazakhstan plans to attract new investors to its energy sector. It seeks to develop nuclear cooperation with Japan, while also eying to establish joint gas projects with Indonesia. Moreover, by the end of 2026 Kazakhstan and Jordan are expected to begin developing uranium deposits in the Middle Eastern country. If the results prove economically viable, a joint enterprise will be launched, and Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom will hold a 70% stake, while the Jordanian National Uranium Company (Jumco) will retain 30%.

This move suggests that Astana is not only focused on tapping into its own natural resources, but is also looking to expand its energy interests beyond its borders. It is no secret that Kazakhstan – despite being the world’s largest producer of uranium – is interested in the extraction and processing of uranium and rare-earth metals in Tajikistan, a landlocked Central Asian nation that appears keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbor, the region’s largest economy.

Indeed, an increasing number of countries are eager to do business with Kazakhstan and establish closer economic and political ties with the energy-rich state. Fully aware of this, Kazakh policy makers decided to invite experts from various nations to discuss geopolitical, economic and strategic issues at upcoming the Astana Think Tank Forum. The event will take place on October 15-16, providing a platform for honest, constructive policy dialogue in a polarized world.

Over the years, Kazakhstan has been pursuing a balanced multilateral approach in the international arena, balancing relations with all major actors in Central Asia: Russia, China, the United States, and the European Union. The fact that Russia’s Rosatom and the China National Nuclear Corporation are set to build nuclear power plants in the largest regional nation, clearly indicates that Astana intends to extend its “multi-vector” approach to the energy sector as well.

In an attempt to diversify its export portfolio, Kazakhstan is actively cooperating with China in the development of its energy and mining sectors. At the same time, it seeks to strengthen ties with the U.S.-based investment firm Cove Capital, a company interested in conducting geological explorations in the former Soviet republic.

Reports suggest that in the first three months of the year, authorities in Kazakhstan identified 38 new mineral deposits, including gold, rare earth metals, copper, nickel, and brown coal. As Jozef Síkela, the European Commissioner for International Partnerships, stressed in March, the access to critical raw materials is essential for the EU to modernize its economy.

Kazakhstan, on the other hand, intends to modernize its existing production facilities and infrastructure, expand geological exploration, introduce modern processing technologies, and strengthen the research base. To achieve that goal, Astana plans to bring international partners into exploration and processing projects, aiming to gain access to advanced technology, state-of-the-art equipment, and lucrative markets.

The country holds significant reserves of critical minerals, including zinc, copper, lead, and nickel. However, despite the growing global demand for these resources, the ease and cost of mining will vary depending on factors such as depth, grade, water availability, and accessibility. Kazakhstan knows its mineral wealth has huge potential to help accelerate the world’s energy transition, and yield tangible benefits for its people. That is why the Central Asian nation – already producing rare metals worth over $252.7 million annually – is investing in advanced mining technologies, infrastructure enhancements, and diverse international partnerships.

Energy Equity: A Balancing Act For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the immediate risks of rising utility costs with the long-term potential of green energy.
Conclusion: Strategic Opportunities in a Shifting Energy Landscape Missouri's utility sector is a microcosm of the broader energy transition.","Missouri's energy landscape is undergoing a pivotal shift as Spire Missouri's recent gas rate hike—approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC)—takes effect on October 24, 2025. The 10% to 10.5% increase in natural gas rates will add approximately $8.21 to $8.93 per month to the average residential bill, depending on the region. While the hike is framed as necessary to fund infrastructure upgrades, it raises critical questions about affordability for households and the broader implications for energy equity. At the same time, the regulatory environment and infrastructure investments are creating fertile ground for energy infrastructure and green utility stocks to thrive.

The Financial Impact on Missouri Households

Spire's rate increase, though reduced from its original $289.5 million request to $210 million, still represents a significant burden for consumers. For eastern Missouri households, the $8.21 monthly increase may seem modest in isolation but compounds over time. For a family earning below the median income of $65,000 annually, this hike could consume 1.5% of their monthly budget—a non-trivial share when combined with inflationary pressures on other essentials. Western Missouri residents face a slightly higher 10.5% increase, reflecting regional infrastructure disparities.

However, the PSC's approval included safeguards. The rate hike is partially offset by a 40% drop in natural gas prices since 2024, ensuring that 2025 bills will still be lower than in the previous year. Additionally, Spire's low-income programs, such as the Limited Income Customer Charge Pilot Program—which waives a $22 monthly fee for qualifying households—provide critical relief. These measures highlight the tension between utility profitability and consumer affordability, a theme that will define energy policy debates in the coming years.

Regulatory Shifts and Infrastructure Investments: A Tailwind for Energy Stocks

The rate hike is part of a broader trend of regulatory alignment with infrastructure modernization. Missouri utilities are increasingly prioritizing grid resilience and renewable integration, driven by both necessity and policy incentives. Ameren Missouri (AEE), for instance, is capitalizing on this momentum with its $28 billion five-year plan. The company's Reform Renewable Energy Center—a 250-MW solar project adjacent to its nuclear-powered Callaway Energy Center—exemplifies the hybrid approach to energy generation. By pairing solar with battery storage and natural gas backup, Ameren is positioning itself to meet reliability demands while reducing carbon intensity.

Ameren's strategic alignment with regulatory goals—such as its net-zero-by-2045 target—has already translated into strong investor confidence. Its disciplined execution and regulatory approvals in Missouri and Illinois have enabled stable returns, making it a standout in the utility sector. Similarly, Evergy (EVE), another Missouri-based utility, is expanding its natural gas and solar capacity under a $2.75 billion infrastructure plan. While environmental groups have criticized its reliance on gas, the company's ability to secure federal tax credits for solar projects underscores the financial incentives driving this transition.

National Green Utility Stocks: Riding the Renewable Wave

Beyond Missouri, national green utility stocks are poised to benefit from the same forces. NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE), the world's largest wind and solar generator, is a prime example. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has supercharged its growth, with agreements to develop 10.5 gigawatts of renewables and storage by 2030. NextEra's transmission projects in AI-driven data center hubs like the PJM Interconnection further position it to capitalize on surging electricity demand.

Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP) is another key player, leveraging its global hydroelectric and solar assets to meet corporate clean energy demands. Its recent partnership with Cameco to acquire Westinghouse—a nuclear services giant—signals a strategic pivot toward diversified energy solutions. Meanwhile, GE Vernova (GEV), spun off from General Electric, is gaining traction with its focus on offshore wind and grid modernization, supported by IRA tax credits.

Energy Equity: A Balancing Act

For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the immediate risks of rising utility costs with the long-term potential of green energy. Spire's rate hike and Missouri's regulatory environment highlight the need for utilities to invest in infrastructure while maintaining affordability. Companies that successfully navigate this balance—like Ameren and NextEra—offer a compelling mix of stable dividends and growth potential.

However, energy equity remains a critical concern. Low-income households, which already spend 3.5 times more of their income on energy than higher-income households, are disproportionately affected by rate hikes. Investors should consider utilities that integrate social responsibility into their strategies, such as Spire's pilot programs or Ameren's community-focused solar initiatives.

Conclusion: Strategic Opportunities in a Shifting Energy Landscape

Missouri's utility sector is a microcosm of the broader energy transition. While rising gas rates test consumer resilience, they also catalyze investments in infrastructure and renewables. For equity investors, the path forward lies in supporting companies that align with both regulatory trends and societal needs. Ameren, NextEra, and Brookfield represent not just financial opportunities but also models for sustainable energy equity in an era of rising costs and climate urgency.

As the October 24 rate hike looms, the interplay between affordability, infrastructure, and innovation will define Missouri's energy future—and the stocks that lead the charge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:13.591064

The act, which underscored the administration’s domestic energy dominance ambitions, was packed with various cost-cutting measures that directly reversed key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Rystad Energy estimates that the OBBBA’s aggressive foreign content tests, and restrictions on Specified Foreign Entities (SPEs), may force companies to build more resilient, but potentially more expensive, supply chains, independent of target nations. Specific provisions, like the North American feedstock requirement for biofuels, will likely directly reshape global trade flows, creating clear-cut winners and losers in international commodity markets.

Compared to the IRA’s original timeline, the OBBBA shortens the runway for projects in several key sectors, accelerating the termination of tax credits for wind, solar and clean hydrogen. In a clear policy choice, biofuels received a favorable multi-year extension of credits, while consumer-facing credits for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential solar are eliminated.

One of the law’s most significant revisions is the shortened timeline for Clean Electricity Production and Investment Tax Credits, known as the 45Y and 48E credits. Now, solar and wind projects must begin construction within the next 12 months and be placed in service by end of 2027, rather than after 2032. Rystad Energy expects developers to rush orders for project materials to comply with the new one-year period set by the OBBBA to safe-harbor incentives for projects to be placed in service by 2029-2030.

The OBBBA also?introduces stringent changes for clean energy manufacturing and supply chains, with the most critical changes in the introduction of new restrictions on foreign content. To qualify for the remaining tax credits, project components must meet domestic or ‘friend-shored’ sourcing thresholds that escalate over time, topping out as high as 90% for some equipment. From a solar developer’s perspective, meeting the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements will be a costly and arduous process.

US shale companies with the most exposure to federal land with mineral rights stand to benefit from the royalty rate cut and tax incentives ushered in through the OBBBA. Although the legislation may not spur a new era of high growth from US shale oil plays, marginal benefits can be realized through continued near-term investments and improved economics that will favor companies with the most exposure to federal lands. In the long term, reduced federal royalty rates could help lower the marginal supply cost needed for new incremental sources of gas. Additionally, Rystad Energy finds that the reinstatement of the 100% bonus depreciation for tangible capital expenditure could lower breakeven prices by one to two dollars per barrel for short-term development in most core unconventional US oil plays, assuming consistent recurring investment. This benefit will apply to all companies, regardless of federal lands exposure.

The impact of the OBBBA, much like the IRA, will resonate globally, calibrating the competitive landscape for clean tech investment. Ultimately, the US has shifted its policy away from green technology acceleration to a more guarded strategy focused on domestic energy security, creating a more complex and uncertain environment for the future of the energy transition.

It's a shame that we let it go to waste day after day after day after day.","McKibben is not a common name in my experience, but it is at times an influential name. On more than one occasion at a Marriot Hotel, we were treated like royalty when announcing our name while checking in. Some Marriot properties are managed by McKibbon Hospitality, that had its beginnings in 1926 by the McKibbon brothers in Gainesville, Georgia, with a small Piggly Wiggly franchise.

I’ve seen portraits of Jack McKibbon adorning the registration desk area of a few hotels and even when we have protested that our name is spelled differently, insisting that we are not related, we were treated as if we were. Which in all fairness, is a goal of the McKibbon Hospitality management team.

When we visited Walden Pond, just after we were coming out of the pandemic lockdown, we were invited by the ranger to watch a brief film, “Henry David Thoreau, Surveyor of the Soul,” before heading down to the pond. She was cautious, as she should have been, about shaking Bruce’s outheld hand, keeping her own hands firmly tucked in.

The beautiful film closed with remarks from Bill McKibben, known as the first environmentalist to sound the alarm about global warming with his groundbreaking book, “The End of Nature,” published in 1989. As we exited the theater, Bruce told the ranger that we were in town for the McKibben Family reunion and she eagerly grabbed his hand that she had shunned earlier, in awe that we were McKibbens.

I would love to be related to Bill McKibben. Educated at Harvard University, he is the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in Environmental Studies at Middlebury College, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the 2013 winner of the Gandhi Prize and the same year the Thomas Merton Prize, and holds honorary degrees from 18 colleges and universities.

In addition to writing 21 significant books on climate and justice, “he is a founder of 350.org, the first planet-wide, grassroots climate change movement, which has organized twenty thousand rallies around the world in every country save North Korea, spearheaded the resistance to the Keystone Pipeline, and launched the fast-growing fossil fuel divestment movement.”

Turning point with climate

He also is a co-founder of Third Act, which mobilizes people over age 60 for action on climate and justice, including Third Act Florida in our state: thirdact.org.

On Aug. 19, 2025, Bill McKibben launched his most recent book, “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization.” What is most remarkable to many, including Bill McKibben himself, is that just when it seems the news could not be worse about the condition of the planet, renewable energy has crossed a crucial threshold of being both affordable and accessible.

“Sometime in the course of this decade, we passed some invisible line where it became cheaper to produce energy from the sun and the wind than from burning coal and gas and oil,” McKibben writes. He believes that if we act now, we will be able to put the brakes on climate devastation and solve problems related to our earth and our humanity that desperately need addressing.

As someone who has for most of his career been the bearer of bad news regarding climate, the “doomsday prophet” as he has been called and calls himself, what a delight to him and to us to realize that there is legitimate hope for our planet if we act now.

Another 'Sun Day' on Sept. 21

On the first “Sun Day,” on May 3, 1978, President Jimmy Carter visited the Solar Energy Research Institute that his administration had founded in 1977, three years after Congress and the Nixon White House had taken steps to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

Carter said, “We must begin the long, slow job of winning back our economic independence. Nobody can embargo sunlight. No cartel controls the sun. Its energy will not run out. It will not pollute the air; it will not poison our waters. It's free from stench and smog. The sun's power needs only to be collected, stored, and used.”

McKibben laments that we did not find the will to move on this opportunity 48 years ago, but is so thrilled that we have another chance today if we only take it.

This year’s Sun Day is scheduled for Sept. 21, and the hope is to organize a powerful climate movement to take advantage of this remarkable opportunity affordable solar power is presenting to us. The Sun Day website found at sunday.earth is easy to use and offers helpful ideas about how to plan and register an event, whether large or small, to take action, how to find an event to join, and how to celebrate the power of clean energy.

Harnessing solar

There is a playlist on Spotify of sun songs, a sun drawing collection from people around the world who have drawn the Sun Day logo, to which you can add your own drawing, and suggested postcards you create to send to lawmakers. And above all, we can read and share McKibben’s remarkable book, with astonishing information about the ways in which we are on the road to restoring some of what we have lost.

Solar is no longer alternative energy, as it is growing faster than any energy source in history. And the key now, he says, is to propel the rising solar power movement forward despite massive resistance from the fossil-fuel industry and its political enablers.

A theologian I admire, Diana Butler Bass, praises his book not only for the remarkable information contained within it, but “the sheer beauty of its prose.” It has important dimensions of scientific information and moral imperative that invite the reader to hope and to action.

McKibben is not a preacher, though he has taught Sunday School and led worship at his small Vermont Methodist Church.

He does say in gratitude, “The good Lord was kind enough to hang this big ball of burning gas 93 million miles up in the sky. And he's given us the wit to learn how to make full use of it. It's a shame that we let it go to waste day after day after day after day. The sun already gives us light; it already gives us warmth. It already allows us to have photosynthesis, and now it's willing to give us all the power we could ever want. I think we should thank God for that.”

It is my prayer that we will thank God and find the will to take advantage of this remarkable gift that is ours if we act now. Would you join thousands of others across the globe who see this as a decisive moment?

Sept. 7 is Grandparents Day. Perhaps those of us who are grandparents will get involved for the sake of those children we adore. Or the one death in five globally that could be saved annually without breathing combustion byproducts of fossil fuel.

Why are electric bills in Indiana higher this summer?

Electric bills in Indiana, including Monroe County, are higher this summer than a year ago because of higher electricity rates and above-normal temperatures.

State regulators early this year approved a request by Duke Energy to be allowed to raise its electric rates.

A spokeswoman for the utility said the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission allowed Duke Energy to raise its rates by about 9% in February, which is contributing to rates this summer being higher than a year ago. Rates will increase another roughly 4% early next year.

However, Duke’s Lead Communications Manager McKenzie Barbknecht said higher temperatures this summer also have contributed.

Average temperatures in Bloomington this summer:

June: 75.6 degrees, or 3.6 degrees above normal, Barbknecht said via email.

July: 79.3 degrees, or 4.6 degrees above normal.

August, as of the middle of the month: 76.4 degrees, or 2.4 degrees above normal.

What does Duke Energy plan to do with the additional revenue?

The utility said in a news release early this year that it asked state regulators to be allowed to hike rakes “to continue making investments in a modernized electric grid that is more resistant to power outages, increasing reliability at our power plants, constructing hundreds of miles of new power lines, complying with evolving environmental responsibilities and improving electric grid security.”

The utility said that among other things, it has been installing:

Sensors on power lines that can detect problems automatically and would reroute power, much like a GPS system in a car reroutes a driver.

Underground power lines and steel poles to replace wood poles to harden its system against severe weather.

How can you lower your electric bill?

Duke and the U.S. Department of Energy said you can reduce your electricity usage by:

Raising your thermostat.

Using cool water to wash clothes.

Running heat-producing appliances in the morning when it’s cooler.

Closing curtains on the sunny side of your home.

Operating ceiling fans (counterclockwise).

Buying energy-efficient appliances, electronics and lights.

Reducing “always-on” appliances. Look for electronics that you don’t use or can switch off — or perhaps get rid of that extra refrigerator.

Are we done for the year with high temps? What's the forecast?

While many Hoosiers have gotten a nice break from summer heat in the past few days, with highs in the low- to mid-70s, the mercury is expected to rise again in Bloomington, with highs in the mid-80s in mid-September, according to The Weather Channel — though lows will remain in the mid- to high 50s.

Source: DOT, IRS EV STATS IN HAWAII >> Hawaii has 38,086 registered passengers EVs.","For electric vehicle drivers in Hawaii, there will soon be few, if any, perks left — as some of the most popular ones are set to expire this month.

Solo drivers with EV license plates have since 2012 been permitted to use the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Oahu highways, which are usually reserved for cars with at least two occupants during rush hour to encourage carpooling.

On Sept. 30, a federal code allowing states to set their own HOV lane requirements expires, and federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of EV vehicles also end.

These changes come at a time when Hawaii is being held accountable for its ambitious, state-mandated goals of achieving 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2045, and are expected to hamper efforts to get more residents to drive electric in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It definitely doesn’t help,” said state Rep. Nicole Lowen, chair of the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. “Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.”

Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market­ driven.

The HOV lane perk may have been an incentive for some drivers commuting on the H-1 freeway to go electric, but even without it, EVs remain a competitive choice for consumers, she said, because they cost less to own and operate in the long run.

There are fewer maintenance costs, such as a regular oil changes, and no more waiting in line at the gas station.

“From a consumer point of view, there’s still a really strong case for it,” she said. “I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.”

History of perks

In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.

EVs were not only allowed to use the HOV lane with only one occupant, but granted free parking at street parking meters, in state and county parking lots, and at airport parking lots.

Those privileges sunsetted on July 1, 2020, but the state Department of Transportation extended the HOV perk for EV drivers.

DOT says it is complying with federal law come Sept. 30, but will retain language written into Hawaii’s administration rules should states be able to make their own rules once again.

Additionally, car consumers will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of new EVs as a result of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” adopted in July. Hawaii does not offer tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs.

The Electric Vehicle Association called the rollback of incentives a step in the wrong direction and “a lane change we can’t afford to make.”

EVA board member Elaine Borseth called the HOV lane perk “one of the simplest, most effective ways to encourage clean transportation,” and said it’s still necessary, given that EV adoption is still in a critical growth phase.

“We’re on our way, but we’re not there yet,” she said in a recent blog post. “Removing low-cost, high-impact incentives like HOV access risks slowing the momentum just when we need it most.”

EVs on the rise

Noel Morin, president of the Hawaii EV Association, said it is unfortunate to see these barriers to adoption, especially as sales are gaining momentum in the state.

The perks and tax incentives appear to have spurred the growth of EVs in Hawaii, with year-over-year increases over the past five years.

In July 2021 there were 15,551 registered EVs in Hawaii, which more than doubled to nearly 33,000 by July 2024. As of July this year, the state counted 38,086 registered EVs in Hawaii, a 16% increase from 2024.

EVs now represent 3.5% of the more than 1 million registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“If you look at the trajectory, more people are adopting EVs,” Morin said. “As people upgrade, and rental car companies dispense of EVs, it also means you have a pre-owned market.”

The range of EV batteries has improved, and there are an expanding number of EV options to choose from in the U.S., including ones that start at lower price points from brands such as Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.

Locally, the expanding pre-owned EV market also offers consumers more affordable EV choices.

The addition of tariffs and Matson’s recent announcement that it will no longer ship EVs to Hawaii complicate the market outlook, but the days in which EVs were considered a rarity in Hawaii are over.

The Tesla Model Y, despite a drop in sales, is the third-most-popular vehicle in the state, according to Hawaii Auto Outlook, two notches below the Toyota Tacoma, which has long taken the top spot.

Hawaii also has been recognized as a top state in the U.S. for EV adoption.

J.D. Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability. Hawaii was also among the top five EV markets, with EVs making up nearly 12% of new vehicle sales in the state.

Achieving EV equity

“We see an increase in EV registrations, so it’s steadily heading in the right direction, but obviously, not fast enough,” said Jeff Mikulina of Climate Hawaii. “The timing is very unfortunate for these new changes.”

While perks help get people in the door, he said, Hawaii needs a clean transportation program that works for everyone.

“So I think it’s on the state, now, particularly with this Navahine settlement, to really focus on equity and infrastructure, and making those take center stage,” he said.

That means making EVs more accessible for families, renters, and rural communities, he said, and investing in more charging stations, particularly for multifamily units — and doing everything possible to make clean transportation “the default as opposed to a luxury.”

DOT released a 205-page draft of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a settlement of a lawsuit – Navahine vs. DOT — filed by a group of young climate activists.

Public comments on the draft were due by the end of Sunday.

As a legislator, Lowen has introduced bills seeking to expand EV charging infrastructure, including one offering rebates for EV-ready parking stalls in new affordable housing developments.

Morin agreed much more needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the state if Hawaii is to reach its clean-energy goals.

Hawaii consumes nearly 40 million gallons of gasoline and diesel each month, and gas and diesel vehicles still make up 93% of all registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“It’s not just about EVs,” Morin said. “It’s about sustainable transportation. It’s about efficient transportation.”

That includes expanding other options like public transit, biking, walking, and rideshares.

“We want to be independent of fossil fuel imports,” Morin said. “We don’t want to be dependent on ships coming in to turn on our lights, transport our kids, or do our jobs. One way to do that is to achieve these goals.”

While it’s going to “take a little longer to make it happen,” he said, it doesn’t change the urgency of those aspirations.

Education is still a part of it, and Hawaii EV is hosting events locally from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12 to raise awareness on the numerous benefits of electric cars, trucks, and motorcycles as part of National Drive Electric Month.

Mikulina said the timing of the federal cutbacks is unfortunate, but is nevertheless confident that market demand for EVs will not go away, as global trends show the future is electric.

“Really, I think the momentum is so strong to electrify transportation and for clean energy,” said Mikulina, “that this is this is just a speed hump.”

CHANGES AFOOT FOR EV DRIVERS

>> On Sept. 30, the right to use the HOV lane during rush hour by solo EV drivers ends.

>> Where are HOV lanes? Oahu, the most populated isle in Hawaii, is home to most HOV lanes, which are available on the H-1 highway weekday mornings, as well as on H-2, Nimitz, Moanalua, and Kalanianaole highways.

>> On Sept. 30, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used EVs expires. These tax credits were originally set to last through Dec. 31, 2032, under the Inflation Reduction Act.

>> What to know: The IRS says a contract signed or down payment made for an EV before Sept. 30 is still eligible, even if the car is delivered at a later time. The vehicle must be acquired with a written binding contract before Sept. 30.

>> Starting in July, Hawaii EV owners could choose between paying a per-mile road usage charge of $8 per 1,000 miles, capped at $50, or annual fee of $50 (replacing the $50 EV surcharge). In 2028, all EV owners must pay the per-mile usage charge.

MEDIA RELEASE

Port Kembla Transformation a Generational Opportunity for Illawarra

The Property Council of Australia today welcomed the NSW Government’s announcement of plans to transform 200 hectares of underutilised land at BlueScope’s Port Kembla site into a hub for advanced manufacturing, clean energy, logistics, and education – creating up to 30,000 new jobs.

Property Council Illawarra Shoalhaven Regional Director Matthew Wales said the announcement was a major win for the region, reflecting years of advocacy for investment in Port Kembla’s future.

“Port Kembla has always been the industrial heartbeat of the Illawarra, and today’s announcement sets the stage for it to become the region’s growth engine for the next generation,” Mr Wales said.

“Our members have consistently called for government and industry to work together on a long-term plan for Port Kembla. We are proud to see this vision taking shape with a rezoning proposal that unlocks new industries while preserving the site’s proud industrial history.”

Mr Wales said the Property Council has long championed the need for a diversified Illawarra economy, with the Port Kembla Master Plan at the centre of that ambition.

“BlueScope’s master plan shows what’s possible when we plan big – thousands of jobs in emerging industries, billions in new investment, and a secure future for local workers,” Mr Wales said.

“With this rezoning now on exhibition, we look forward to working with government, BlueScope and the community to ensure the delivery of this transformational project.”

The Property Council has previously called for state investment to support Port Kembla’s expansion, recognising the precinct’s potential to underpin economic growth and create a multi-faceted industrial hub for the future.

“We’ve consistently highlighted the opportunity to unlock underutilised land around the steelworks to attract new industries and create a stronger future for the Illawarra,” Mr Wales said.

“This project is about giving local workers and businesses the confidence that Port Kembla will remain the region’s industrial engine while opening the door to new careers in advanced manufacturing, clean energy and technology. That certainty is exactly what investors, educators and contractors have been waiting for.

“This site might be the same size as Monaco, but it won’t be luxury yachts, casinos and Formula One, it will be proudly Illawarra – practical, hardworking and focused on building the industries of tomorrow.”

“The Property Council will continue to work with all partners to make sure this momentum translates into lasting jobs and opportunities for the community,” Mr Wales said.

Spiro and Catholic Church Partner to Roll Out Solar-Powered Swap Stations Across Kenya

Spiro, one of the leading electric mobility companies in Africa, has just signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Catholic Church in Kenya to establish solar-powered battery swap stations nationwide, advancing the country’s transition to clean and affordable mobility.

Spiro says this initiative is the first of its kind at this scale, combining Spiro’s e-mobility technology with the Catholic Church’s trusted grassroots presence to expand access to affordable, renewable energy solutions across urban and rural Kenya. The Catholic Church has a big presence in Kenya. For example, the Archdiocese of Nairobi, which covers two counties (Nairobi and Kiambu Counties), has 16 deaneries, 127 parishes, and over 4,000 small Christian communities. Across the whole country, the Catholic Church has over 1,000 parishes and over 5,000 mission stations. Facilities ranging from schools to healthcare centres, as well as other real estate, form quite a large portfolio.

“Rolling out solar-powered swap stations marks a new chapter in Kenya’s clean mobility journey. By combining renewable energy with our battery swapping technology and working hand in hand with the Catholic Church, we are ensuring riders can power their journeys affordably, sustainably, and closer to where they live and work,” said Kshitij Sharma, Spiro Kenya country head.

“The Catholic Church is committed to initiatives that safeguard creation and promote the wellbeing of our communities. Partnering with Spiro to establish solar-powered battery swap stations aligns with our mission of stewardship and service, bringing affordable and clean mobility solutions closer to the people we serve,” said Fr. John.

Spiro says the rollout will be phased across the country, helping Kenya cut emissions, lower transport costs, and advance its climate action goals. By embedding clean energy infrastructure within communities, the partnership is set to unlock new green jobs, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and make sustainable transport accessible to millions.

Spiro adds that this MoU reflects Spiro’s wider mission to transform Africa’s transport ecosystem through locally manufactured, green mobility solutions while collaborating with institutions that hold deep trust and reach at the community level. This collaboration came out of the blue. It’s one that you wouldn’t normally expect. But it’s an interesting one that makes a lot of sense. The motorcycle industry is a vital pillar of Kenya’s transport system. There are about 4 million vehicles registered in Kenya. Motorcycles make up over 50% of the country’s fleet. It’s no surprise then that motorcycles are seeing most of the action in Kenya, and at the moment, the motorcycle sector is the main driver of electric vehicle adoption. In 2024, just over 7% of new motorcycle registrations were electric, followed by 4% for electric tuk tuks, 1.1% for electric buses and minibuses, and then 0.18% for electric cars.

As the Catholic Church is embedded in the community with a wide presence, people going to church or other business at Catholic Church facilities will no doubt include a large portion getting there via motorcycle taxi. Leveraging this large network and real estate to facilitate adoption of electric mobility supported by solar-powered swap stations at these Catholic facilities looks like a great initiative. A good number of these facilities would naturally be in rural areas as well. Therefore, implementing this solar-powered swap station there would help improve connectivity in these areas as well.

This collaboration got me thinking. Smart partnerships between the new electric mobility companies and existing local organisations can help propel the electric mobility industry to new heights at a much faster pace. In general, the electric mobility sector in most African countries has been driven by startups without much government support. We haven’t seen the kind of financial incentives that helped propel the EV sector in Europe, North America, and China. In a lot of African countries, the transition has been led by locally developed solutions solving real-world everyday problems, resonating with the target market and driving initial uptake. In sectors such as the motorcycle industry, the unit economics just made sense, and customers in the target segments clearly saw the potential savings on fuel and general operational costs, enticing them to switch to electric motorcycles.

Armed with results from real-world pilots, several firms have managed to raise significant funds from investors, helping them grow from early pilot phase to early commercialisation, and some have even grown to full commercial operations. Besides traditional equity and debt contributions, which can be quite hard to close for startups on the African continent, especially in a new sector such as electric mobility, innovative partnerships could provide a pathway to sustaining these businesses. In all of these markets, there are family owned or even larger businesses that have been operating in those markets for decades, accumulating decades of local market expertise, including how to navigate the local business environment. These businesses would have accumulated loads of cash over the years and would be looking to diversify and put some of that money to use in a forward-looking industry.

Another area to leverage is these organizations would have built a very large client base and network that these electric mobility startups could plug into, providing a good base to start with and scale. Just like in the case of the Catholic Church, some of these organisations could have large real estate portfolios, which in some cases are underutilised, and partnerships with electric mobility startups could open up win-win scenarios where the mobility startup gets access to prime sites for infrastructure such as EV charging and battery swap stations and the owners of the properties get to earn some additional revenues and unlock efficiencies. I think the industry will grow more via leveraging these local partnerships. This will help get it to a level where large institutional investors will start to notice and get the confidence to invest in mobility companies as they usually do in other areas. This will also give confidence to larger traditional investors such as the large pension funds that want to invest in less risky portfolios.

Here in Connecticut, we’re not backing down. This fall, we have important opportunities to defend clean energy, and make sure people know the facts about what’s at stake and how we can take action together.

Although this bill passed, federal clean energy tax credits are still available, but only for a limited time.

Families can save thousands of dollars while reducing pollution:

$4,000 back on a used EV, or instant savings when you lease one before September 30th 2025.

Households can also receive up to $1,000 for installing a home charger. For home energy upgrades by June 30, 2026.

Families can claim up to $3,200 in tax credits for audits, heat pumps, and insulation through December 31, 2025.

For solar panels, home batteries, and other clean energy projects, the credit covers up to 30% back on multiple projects through 2025.

These programs were designed to save money and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Trump’s cuts will take that away, which makes it more important than ever to claim these benefits now and speak out.

In the weeks ahead, we’re coming together to show the strength of the clean energy movement.

OFFSHORE WIND

On Friday, August 22 the Trump Administration ordered an immediate halt to work on Revolution Wind, a wind project that was 80% complete. The wind farm was being built at the State Pier in New London, and part of its electricity is coming to Connecticut bringing affordable, renewable offshore wind to our state. In all, this wind project supports more than 2,500 U.S. jobs across construction, operations, shipbuilding, and manufacturing.

You can see the Sierra Club Connecticut statement on this order.

Connecticut has committed to two gigawatts of offshore wind energy, and support is growing across the state and along the East Coast. Offshore wind is one of the most powerful tools we have to tackle the climate crisis while creating healthier communities and stronger local economies.

Offshore wind means good jobs for local workers, from shipyards and ports to electricians and clean energy technicians. It means healthier air by cutting pollution from fossil fuels so families can breathe easier. It means homegrown, reliable power that stabilizes electricity costs and reduces our dependence on imported fuels. And it means thriving coastal economies, with revitalized infrastructure and new opportunities for small businesses.

We stand with communities, laborers, and local leaders who are saying YES to Offshore Wind. Together, we can power our future with clean, affordable, and reliable energy while creating resilient places to live and work.

Add Your Name: Say YES to Offshore Wind

Even though the federal government is eliminating federal tax credits (September 30 for EVs, December 30 for other clean energy solutions), New Jersey has allocated $618 million through PSE&G to help residents lower energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to Electrify SOMA volunteers.

Electrify SOMA is supported by the Environmental Commission of South Orange and the Environmental Advisory Committee of Maplewood and was created to help neighbors navigate energy saving changes to their homes and vehicles and to get their share of federal and state financial support, said Electrify SOMA volunteers Cynthia Thompson and Bob McCoy.

“The NJ incentives are comprehensive and make these improvements affordable,” Thompson said. “Electrify SOMA’s goal is to educate SOMA residents about the best ways to ‘electrify’ their homes.”

Volunteers draw on their personal experience and knowledge about the following electrification measures:

Weatherization to reduce energy waste (free for income-eligible households)

Electric vehicles (including purchase and home charging)

Solar (including for renters and those with little sun)

Heat pumps for heating, air conditioning, and water heating

As a free service, Electrify SOMA will connect its volunteers to those just beginning their electrification journey.

“Electrify SOMA is dedicated to the idea that SOMA neighbors are good, reliable sources of information about what works in our homes,” McCoy said.

Among Electrify SOMA’s many volunteers are some who have taken advantage of New Jersey incentives and IRS tax credits, including:

Joe Gonzalez, a Maplewood homeowner and small business owner, who pays the equivalent of .75 cents per gallon to charge the electric vehicle he uses to commute to his business.

Kathleen Grant, a college professor and South Orange parent of two, who uses 2/3 less energy to heat water for her family with a heat-pump water heater. With solar, she paid $0 for electricity this summer despite using air conditioning.

Bob McCoy, a 30-year Maplewood resident and volunteer, who pays nothing for his home heating, cooling, and other energy needs after investing in solar on his family’s roof and a heat-pump home heater and air conditioning.

Andrew Howell, a researcher at EDF and Maplewood parent of high schoolers, who made renovations to his previously drafty home that save his family $800 per year in energy bills — he is paying off the investment on his PSE&G bill over 10 years at 0% interest.

This is because of a growing and ageing population who are more vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution, resulting in nearly 13,000 increased air pollution deaths in 2030 compared with 2015.
Yet it is increasingly clear that reducing fossil fuel combustion will bring immediate benefits for the issue of air pollution.
Racial-ethnic minorities were found to experience the greatest differences in air pollution exposure and health burdens.
An earlier economic analysis estimated that improvements in air pollution from net zero policies in the US could reduce early deaths from air pollution by between 4,000 and 15,000 a year in 2035, a health gain of $65bn-$128bn.","Efforts to improve the climate could reduce the number of deaths caused by air pollution in the US by about 6,000 people a year by 2030, according to a study. If action is not taken, the situation is predicted to worsen. This is because of a growing and ageing population who are more vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution, resulting in nearly 13,000 increased air pollution deaths in 2030 compared with 2015.

The research, led by Princeton University, looked at pollution sources and population. These revealed health gains from climate actions across every US state and, more locally, in nearly every US county.

Climate actions are often framed around targets that are several decades away. Yet it is increasingly clear that reducing fossil fuel combustion will bring immediate benefits for the issue of air pollution.

Xinyuan Huang, the lead author of the US-wide research, said: “Climate actions not only reduce carbon emissions but also bring significant air-quality improvements to regions with historically high pollution levels.

“Under ambitious climate policies, states like West Virginia and Kentucky could see deaths from particle pollution decrease by over 19% in 2030, demonstrating the substantial health benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels.”

Policies and actions included more renewable energy, such as wind and solar power; increased uptake of electric cars; and the electrification of freight trucks.

They also included reductions in vehicle miles travelled as well as gains from low- and zero-emission zones and decongestion charging, such as the successful scheme in New York. As in many parts of the world, decarbonising US buildings is challenging, although heat pumps outsold fossil gas boilers in the country in 2023.

Dr Wei Peng said: “Figuring out how to leverage and combine actions to maximise local benefits will be important to promote widespread public support for this transition. With a focus on the health benefits, our study aims to offer insights into this critical policy challenge.”

Separate research, published last month, found large inequalities in the health burden from fossil fuel and production and use in the US. Racial-ethnic minorities were found to experience the greatest differences in air pollution exposure and health burdens. Louisiana and Texas had the most extreme inequalities in exposure, mainly from fossil fuel production and processing.

An earlier economic analysis estimated that improvements in air pollution from net zero policies in the US could reduce early deaths from air pollution by between 4,000 and 15,000 a year in 2035, a health gain of $65bn-$128bn.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba11d7b78f296b602da23f474b235c78f8d4c73/0_0_4259_3409/master/4259.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=175e794f619789f17b9e923454be2c83",N,,2025-09-06 18:03:29.425522

Conclusion Trump’s renewable energy rollbacks exposed the sector to strategic risks but also revealed its capacity to adapt through market innovation and subnational action.","The Trump administration’s aggressive rollback of renewable energy policies between 2017 and 2021 created a polarizing environment for the U.S. clean energy sector. While federal deregulation and a focus on fossil fuels introduced significant strategic risks, market forces and state-level initiatives revealed enduring opportunities. This analysis examines how these dynamics shaped investor sentiment, corporate strategies, and stock performance in the renewable energy space.

Regulatory Rollbacks and Market Dynamics

The Trump administration’s energy agenda prioritized deregulation and fossil fuel expansion, epitomized by the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 and the replacement of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan with the weaker Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in 2019 [1]. These moves accelerated permitting for oil, gas, and coal projects while slowing the deployment of renewables [2]. According to a report by Renewable Energy Vulnerabilities and Fossil Fuel Revival, the administration’s policies created a “headwind” for solar and wind technologies reliant on federal subsidies, such as the 30% tax credit for solar installations [3].

However, the sector’s resilience emerged from declining technology costs and state-level commitments. Despite federal rollbacks, solar installations grew by 50% during Trump’s first term, driven by state incentives and corporate demand [4]. This duality—federal policy headwinds and market-driven tailwinds—underscored the sector’s adaptability but also highlighted its vulnerability to regulatory shifts.

Investor Sentiment and Stock Volatility

Clean energy stocks faced heightened volatility during Trump’s tenure, particularly in response to policy announcements. A 2024 Reuters analysis noted a sharp drop in the MAC Global Solar Energy Index following Trump’s re-election, as investors feared further rollbacks of tax credits and subsidies [5]. The administration’s emphasis on deregulation and fossil fuels also led to a “divergence in market performance,” with the S&P 500 rising 63.0% from 2017 to 2021, while clean energy indices lagged [6].

Academic studies further contextualize this volatility. Research published in Energy Economics found that Trump’s tweets on energy topics amplified speculative behavior in oil markets, indirectly affecting renewable energy sectors through investor uncertainty [7]. Additionally, the phaseout of federal tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by 2025 introduced a “race against time” for companies like Xcel Energy to secure incentives, creating short-term price swings [8].

Corporate Adaptation Strategies

Faced with federal inaction, corporations and states became pivotal in sustaining clean energy growth. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden, demonstrated how state-level and private-sector initiatives could fill federal gaps. Even during Trump’s term, companies leveraged state incentives and international markets to advance projects [9]. This adaptability, however, came at a cost: firms had to navigate fragmented regulatory landscapes and accelerate timelines to meet expiring tax credit deadlines [10].

ESG Fund Flows and Long-Term Resilience

The ESG investment landscape reflected a similar tension. While $50 billion flowed into ESG funds in 2020 and $70 billion in 2021, reflecting strong demand for sustainable investing, outflows began in 2023 and 2024 as Trump’s anti-ESG rhetoric gained traction [11]. A CNBC analysis noted that despite these outflows, ESG assets still grew in 2024 due to market appreciation, suggesting long-term resilience [12].

Strategic Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the Trump-era experience highlights two key lessons:

1. Policy Risk: Clean energy stocks remain sensitive to regulatory shifts, as seen in the MAC index’s post-2024 drop. Companies reliant on federal subsidies face heightened exposure to policy reversals.

2. Opportunistic Resilience: Declining technology costs and state-level momentum create a floor for growth. Firms that diversify funding sources (e.g., state incentives, private equity) and prioritize international markets may mitigate federal policy risks.

Conclusion

Trump’s renewable energy rollbacks exposed the sector to strategic risks but also revealed its capacity to adapt through market innovation and subnational action. While federal policy uncertainty remains a headwind, the interplay of falling costs, corporate agility, and ESG demand suggests that the clean energy transition is far from derailed. Investors must balance short-term volatility with long-term structural trends, recognizing that the sector’s future will be shaped as much by state and corporate action as by federal policy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:21.125881

Experts predict EV sales gains through the end of the month.

Car buyers may get some good deals on EVs, analysts said.

August was Ford Motor Co.'s sixth consecutive month of sales gains, driven by SUVs and big gains in sales of electric vehicles as the nation's car buyers hurried to get ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit.

On Sept. 3, Ford reported August U.S. sales increased by 3.9% to 190,206 vehicles sold in the month compared with the year-ago August. For the first eight months of the year, Ford has sold a total of 1.5 million vehicles in the United States, a 6.6% gain compared with the same period a year ago.

Sales for Ford's luxury brand, Lincoln, declined 14.9% to 8,379 vehicles sold in August and sales at the Ford brand came in at 181,827 vehicles, a 5% gain compared with August 2024.

But the big winner for Ford was its retail EV sales. Sales of EVs skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August. Year to date, however, Ford's EV sales are down 5.7% at 57,888 sold.

""The ‘pull forward’ effect of vanishing EV incentives is reflected in Ford’s electric vehicle sales last month,"" Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Sept. 3. ""Consumers planning an EV purchase in the next three to six months are now rushing to buy one before the federal tax break goes away on Sept. 30.""

What's driving EV sales

In August, Ford sold 18,773 hybrid vehicles, a gain of 14.5% compared with August 2024. Hybrid vehicles run on an electric motor before switching to a gasoline engine when the electric motor charge runs out.

Ford's sales of internal combustion vehicles, those that run on gasoline, inched up 2% in August to 160,762 gasoline cars sold.

Year to date, Ford's sales of hybrid vehicles are up 24% to 155,107 sold. January through August, Ford has sold 1.3 million gasoline-powered vehicles, a gain of 5.5% compared with the same period in 2024.

Sales of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E rose 35.3% to 7,226 in the month; sales of the Lightning F-150 rose 21.2% to 3,217 in the month; but sales of the limited commercial vehicle E-Transit plummeted 76% to 228 sold.

The driver behind these gains in retail EV sales is the mega-tax bill signed into law in July. That legislation pushed up the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit to Sept. 30 from its original date of 2032. That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying, new electric vehicle is closing in.

Edmunds.com's Ivan Drury said Ford’s straightforward marketing messages coupled with incentives that resonate with consumers has resulted in positive sales, especially in EVs.

""This is a night and day difference between last year when Ford’s EVs were sitting on the lot for 99 days on average back in August of 2024 versus this August at nearly half that with 51 day lot times,"" Drury, Edmunds' director of Insights, said. ""The EV turnaround stems from both the right mix of incentives catering towards leasing with 64% of Ford EV’s being leased versus 48% last August as well as the clock ticking on the EV tax credit expiring, putting a sense of urgency behind any potential EV consumers.""

The problem is sustainability, Drury said. He said with the tax credit set to expire, the industry will see the binge on EVs result in a hangover during fourth quarter.

Car buyers can expect EV deals

Savvy consumers can't help but be aware of the EV tax credit's impending death. For those who aren't, all they have to do is look at auto websites and ads. Some dealers are running headlines on their sites that read: ""Plug in before it powers down.""

As the Detroit Free Press reported in early August, analysts predict EV sales to be the strongest ever during the third quarter as consumers scramble to take advantage of the tax credit.

“The urgency created by the administration’s decision to sunset government-backed, IRA-era EV incentives was expected to create serious demand for EVs in the short term. If last month is any measure: Mission Accomplished,"" wrote Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox senior analyst, in a report released Aug. 13. ""July sales were near an all-time monthly record. At this pace, Q3 will be the best ever and then some, as buyers jump in before the big incentives dry up.”

Brauer told the Free Press that the EV sales spike will continue through the end of September across all EV models, ""followed by a whipsaw"" in the other direction as EV sales evaporate in the fourth quarter, similar to Drury's prediction.

""It’s a predictable pattern, one we see whenever large purchase incentives are removed from the marketplace,"" Brauer said.

In the meantime, consumers can expect to find deals as EV inventory evaporates.

""Dealers are very aware of this pattern, and those with EV stock will offer increasingly desirable pricing and financing as the end of September draws near,"" Brauer said. ""Having a large supply of unsold EVs on their lot on Oct. 1 is a position dealerships will actively avoid.""

Ford's other results

For the month, Ford sold 81,539 SUVs, a 6.2% gain compared with August 2024. Sales of pickups rose 2.4% to 105,432 sold. Sales of traditional passenger cars inched up 2.2% to 3,235 sold.

Some winners: Bronco sales rose 32% to 13,378 vehicles sold in August compared with the year-ago period. August Explorer sales soared 22% to 20,617 vehicles sold. Sales of the Maverick pickup rose 16.4% to 11,956 vehicles sold.

Some losers: Sales of the Escape were down 10.4% to 12,290 in August compared with the year-ago period. Despite Lightning sales rising, sales of the F-Series in total dipped 3.4% to 68,318 units sold in August.

At Lincoln, only the Navigator and Corsair saw sales gains. The Corsair, which Ford will stop producing by year-end, sold 2,526 units in August, a 8.6% gain. The Navigator saw a 2.5% sales gain to 1,624 units sold.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/06/USNK/86016128007-20230405-t-165518-z-201621158-rc-2-f-80-agip-39-rtrmadp-3-autoshownewyork.JPG?crop=3078,1732,x0,y160&width=3078&height=1732&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-06 15:02:58.828956

The California-based company cited insurmountable financial pressures, including failed attempts to secure investor funding and generate sufficient sales, leading to the closure of its facilities in Michigan and California as well.

The decision, announced this week, marks a significant setback for North Carolina’s burgeoning electric-vehicle and renewable-energy ecosystem. State officials, who had celebrated the project as a landmark economic win just a year ago, confirmed that the Rocky Mount-area factory is now off the table, leaving local communities grappling with dashed expectations.

A Promising Start Derailed by Market Realities

Natron’s trajectory had seemed promising. In August 2024, the company unveiled plans for what would have been the first U.S. gigafactory dedicated to sodium-ion batteries, a technology touted for its potential to offer cheaper, more abundant alternatives to lithium-ion counterparts. Governor Roy Cooper heralded the announcement, noting it would inject nearly $1.4 billion into Edgecombe County and create high-paying jobs in manufacturing and research.

According to reports from WRAL, the state approved an incentives package worth up to $56.3 million to lure Natron to the Kingsboro megasite, positioning it as one of the largest economic development deals in eastern North Carolina in recent years. This move aligned with broader efforts to bolster the state’s clean-energy profile, attracting companies focused on sustainable technologies amid global supply-chain shifts away from lithium dependencies.

Financial Strains and Operational Halts

However, cracks began to appear earlier this summer. By July, Natron paused its North Carolina plans due to funding shortfalls, as detailed in an article from the Raleigh News & Observer. The company struggled to raise capital in a competitive market where investor enthusiasm for battery startups has waned amid economic uncertainties and fluctuating raw-material prices.

The final blow came this month, with Natron confirming it would end all operations effective immediately. Sources from CleanTechnica highlighted “strong financial pressures” that rendered the business unprofitable, despite the technology’s advantages in safety and scalability for applications like data centers and electric vehicles.

Implications for Regional Economies and Industry Trends

The fallout extends beyond North Carolina. In Michigan, where Natron had operations, similar job losses are rippling through local supply chains. Industry analysts point to this closure as a cautionary tale for the battery sector, where hype around next-generation technologies often outpaces commercial viability. Sodium-ion batteries, while promising due to their use of plentiful sodium instead of scarce lithium, face hurdles in energy density and market adoption.

State commerce officials, as reported by NC Commerce, expressed disappointment but emphasized resilience in pursuing other clean-energy investments. The Kingsboro site remains available, potentially attracting new suitors in a sector still hungry for domestic manufacturing capacity.

Lessons for Future Investments in Emerging Tech

For industry insiders, Natron’s demise underscores the volatility of scaling innovative energy solutions. While the company secured partnerships and initial funding rounds, it couldn’t bridge the gap to mass production amid rising interest rates and investor caution. Comparisons to other battery ventures, such as those in lithium-iron-phosphate, reveal a pattern: success hinges on not just technological edge but also robust financial backing and timely market entry.

Looking ahead, North Carolina’s economic developers are likely to scrutinize incentives more closely, balancing optimism with due diligence. As one expert noted in coverage from the Carolina Journal, this episode highlights the risks of over-reliance on speculative tech firms in state-led growth strategies.

Broadening Horizons Amid Setbacks

Yet, the closure isn’t entirely devoid of silver linings. The groundwork laid for the Kingsboro megasite—improved infrastructure and workforce training—could accelerate future projects. Broader industry shifts, including federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, continue to fuel interest in U.S.-based battery production, potentially filling the void left by Natron.

In the end, this development serves as a reminder of the high-stakes nature of the energy transition, where innovation must align with economic realities to thrive.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-d2658df3-993e-4a1b-895b-8615664c145b.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 15:03:11.756075

As the country pushes for greener power and energy independence, the agreement marks a major step toward making solar not just cleaner but truly local.

Starting in late 2026, Corning will supply solar wafers from its Michigan factory that T1 will use to make solar cells at a new facility in Austin, Texas. Those cells will then be assembled into panels at T1's existing Dallas-area plant.

T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo said in a statement, per Reuters: ""This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.""

The timing is key. With solar demand rising and new federal rules favoring American-made components, this deal reduces dependence on China, currently the world's leading wafer producer, and boosts both clean energy and U.S. manufacturing.

By making solar panels cheaper and more locally available, the deal could help lower energy costs for households while also cutting harmful carbon pollution by replacing fossil fuels with clean, homegrown power.

It also supports thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs, keeping the benefits of the clean energy transition rooted in local communities.

Thanks to deals like the one between T1 Energy and Corning, more affordable, American-made solar panels are on the way, making installing solar the ultimate home energy hack.

Once panels are installed, your electricity costs can drop to near zero. If you are curious to learn more about installing solar in your home, EnergySage provides a free service that can help you compare quotes from vetted local installers with the potential of saving up to $10,000 on installations.

This year’s fire season has been the worst in European history, driven in part by lightning-caused wildfires in Spain.
Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future.
More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particles that can make them melt more quickly.
Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.","The climate crisis will continue making lightning-sparked wildfires more frequent for decades to come, which could produce cascading effects and worsen public safety and public health, experts and new research suggest.

Lightning-caused fires tend to burn in more remote areas and therefore usually grow into larger fires than human-caused fires. That means a trend toward more lightning-caused fires is also probably making wildfires more deadly by producing more wildfire smoke and helping to drive a surge in air quality issues from coast to coast, especially over the past several years.

Over the last 40 years, thunderstorms and other weather conditions favoring lightning have been happening more often across many parts of the US west, including western Washington, western Oregon, the California Central valley, and higher elevations throughout the Rocky Mountains.

This trend isn’t just in the US. This year’s fire season has been the worst in European history, driven in part by lightning-caused wildfires in Spain. In Canada, huge fires this year have burned more than 200% of normal forest area, the vast majority of which were caused by lightning.

Despite the well-documented trend toward worsening fires, most climate models have been too coarse to resolve how the relationship between lightning and wildfires will change as the climate crisis deepens.

A new study published last week is the first to use machine learning techniques to tackle this problem, simultaneously looking at future changes in lightning frequency and changes in weather variables like air temperature, humidity, wind and soil moisture that can predict how likely a fire is to spread.

“The overall signal is that we will have more risk of lightning-caused fires,” said Dmitri Kalashnikov, a climate scientist at the Sierra Nevada Research Institute at University of California-Merced and the study’s lead author.

The findings come as this year’s wildfire season in the US is shifting into high gear in a manner eerily similar to what Kalashnikov imagines for the future – lurching forward after a series of dry thunderstorms tore through California earlier this week.

Thousands of lightning strikes this week have sparked at least 20 new fires and burned tens of thousands of acres across California’s Central valley and into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, with one fire destroying several structures in the Gold Rush-era settlement of Chinese Camp east of Modesto.

Kalashnikov’s team found that some places, like the inland Pacific north-west, will see a surge of lightning with a relatively small increase in overall fire risk due to a moistening environment. Other places, like the desert south-west, will see an increase in wildfire risk without much of a change in the number of days with lightning due to an overall trend towards more pervasive drought.

Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future. In fact, Kalashnikov’s team found future increases in the number of lightning-caused wildfires across a robust 98% of the western US “due to more lightning, or more fire weather, or both”, he said.

In a future world with limited firefighting resources, the implications of more lightning-caused wildfires are worrying.

Over a recent 15-year span, wildfire smoke killed about a thousand people in the US each year. A surge in lightning-caused fires could cause America’s smoke epidemic to take the lives of potentially more than 20,000 people a year by mid-century.

In addition to the increase in wildfire risk, Kalashnikov’s study found the biggest impact from the expected increase in thunderstorms and lightning across some parts of the west could be an increase in flash flooding and mudslides, especially in recently burned areas. More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particles that can make them melt more quickly.

Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.

Even today, a sudden lightning storm “can stretch resources really, really thin” for weeks during peak wildfire season, said Max Moritz, a University of California Cooperative Extension wildfire specialist and adjunct professor at University of California-Santa Barbara.

“Maybe a week or two later you may have a big Santa Ana wind event,” said Moritz, “then you have a real recipe for catastrophe.”

When coupled with the trend of urbanization of wildfire-prone areas that we are seeing across the west, a world with worse wildfires could place additional pressure on the insurance industry which is digesting billions of dollars of claims from this year’s fires in Los Angeles alone.

In the US, firefighting resources are stretched thin nationwide as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Park Service and a host of other federal agencies with staff throughout the west. As of late July, more than one-quarter of all firefighting jobs remained vacant at the US Forest Service, and a recent immigration raid within an active firefighting crew in Oregon has reportedly reduced firefighter morale.

Moritz sees a possible partial solution – change the way we build cities in fire-prone regions.

In addition to instituting basic fire safety building codes, Moritz envisions agricultural buffers surrounding cities that could effectively shield homes and people from encroaching fire.

“There’s a growing awareness now that live fuel moisture, the amount of water in green living twigs and leaves, is also a really strong control on fire dynamics,” said Moritz. “That’s what we have here in Santa Barbara.

Legal challenges to federal incentives, regulatory rollbacks, and geopolitical tensions are reshaping the industry’s trajectory. For investors, the implications are profound: automakers are recalibrating strategies, energy markets are reconfiguring supply chains, and sector rotations are accelerating. Understanding these dynamics is critical for navigating the next phase of the EV revolution.

Automakers: From All-Electric Hype to Pragmatic Pivots

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit at year-end 2025 has forced automakers to abandon earlier all-electric ambitions. General Motors, for instance, has scaled back its 2030 EV production targets, shifting to a hybrid model that includes internal combustion engines (ICE) and plug-in hybrids [4]. This pivot reflects a broader industry trend: Hyundai and Honda are retooling factories to produce multiple vehicle types, while Ford has delayed battery plant expansions due to uncertain demand [1].

Regulatory uncertainty is compounding these challenges. The Trump administration’s 2025 rule banning critical minerals from “foreign entities of concern” has forced automakers to reconfigure supply chains at significant cost. For example, GM’s partnership with Australian lithium producers and Tesla’s vertical integration of battery production highlight the scramble to comply with new sourcing mandates [3]. Meanwhile, tariffs on Chinese EVs and batteries—accounting for 60% of global EV sales—have further strained domestic producers [2].

Energy Markets: Resilience Amid Disruption

Battery manufacturers and renewable energy firms are adapting to a post-incentive era. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§45X) remains a lifeline, but its stringent sourcing criteria—requiring 65% of materials to be U.S.-sourced—have spurred vertical integration. Companies like Panasonic and LG Chem are consolidating production facilities to meet these thresholds, while startups are exploring alternative chemistries to bypass supply chain bottlenecks [1].

Grid operators, meanwhile, are deploying smart technologies to manage EV-driven demand. Time-of-use pricing, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems, and AI-driven load management are gaining traction as utilities seek to balance renewable energy integration with peak demand [5]. California’s ongoing legal battle with the DOJ over truck emissions standards underscores the state’s role as a regulatory bellwether, with its policies still driving 30% of U.S. EV adoption despite federal rollbacks [5].

Investor Strategies: Navigating Volatility and Long-Term Themes

For investors, the EV sector’s volatility demands a dual approach: hedging against regulatory risks while capitalizing on enduring trends. Q2 2025 data reveals a sector in flux: Tesla’s Cybertruck sales plummeted 50%, while GM’s Equinox EV doubled its sales to 78,000 units [1]. Such divergences highlight the importance of stock-specific fundamentals over broad sector bets.

Sector rotation is accelerating as investors seek defensive plays. European infrastructure funds, for instance, attracted $100 billion in inflows in Q2 2025, reflecting a shift toward regulated utilities and grid modernization [4]. Conversely, U.S. equity funds faced outflows amid trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Yet long-term themes—such as AI-driven electrification and critical minerals—remain intact. Nickel and lithium producers, despite 50% of global nickel supply operating at a loss, are seeing government-backed rebalancing efforts [2].

Conclusion: Strategic Exposure in a Fragmented Landscape

The EV sector’s future hinges on navigating regulatory fragmentation. Automakers must balance short-term pragmatism with long-term electrification goals, while energy markets will need to innovate to offset supply chain constraints. For investors, the key lies in diversification: pairing exposure to resilient subsectors (e.g., grid infrastructure, critical minerals) with active hedging against policy risks. As one industry analyst notes, “The EV transition isn’t over—it’s just becoming more complicated.” [3]",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:25.030335

The EPA previously moved to fire a handful of employees late last week, but now it is taking disciplinary action against more than 130 employees also suspected of signing the letter, the representative said. These employees were sent letters indicating they would be suspended for 14 days without pay.

The reason cited in the letters is for “conduct unbecoming of a federal employee,” the representative said, noting that is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, under the circumstances.

An EPA spokesperson would not confirm the report or details, saying the agency “does not comment on individual personnel matters.”

“These workers bravely voiced concerns about harmful changes at the Agency that threaten the lives of every American. And we know the administration’s motives are not about government efficiency or advancing public safety. Placing these workers on leave and now firing or suspending them months later has wasted over 47,000 work hours and $2 million. This is simply about squashing dissent and preventing workers from protecting American lives,” said Justin Chen, president of the union group AFGE Council 238, in a statement Friday.

Three automakers benefit from increased EV sales

The $7,500 federal tax credit for buying an electric vehicle will officially end on September 30, 2025. Then poof, that massive EV incentive will be history.

Some states will continue providing tax credits until funds run out. However, they’re much lower than $7,500. For example, Maine offers $2,500.

This has started a fire under some drivers, pressuring them to get the best electric vehicle deal possible before prices increase.

Electric Ford models have benefited from a year-over-year sales increase of 20%. The Ford Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning have ballooned to about 10,671 units per month.

Kia has also enjoyed increased sales. The Kia EV9 has a 54% sales increase over last month, with 2,679 units sold.

According to Index Box, the smaller Niro EV has experienced sales increases of 39% and 57%. Kia has had increasing electric vehicle sales for the past four consecutive months.

Hyundai is the third automaker with booming electric car success. Its total sales increased by 12.0% compared to last month.

Electric vehicles are responsible for 32% of the total sales volume. Sales for one of my favorite electric SUVs, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, increased by 60%.

Crews have successfully drilled more than 18,437 feet to tap Sweetwater County’s Madison Limestone formation. The engineering feat, which took months, is a major step toward establishing what developers hope will be one of the largest carbon dioxide storage projects in the U.S.

At 3.5 miles, it’s the deepest Class VI carbon dioxide injection well in the U.S., according to project officials, and it is the second well completed for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project. It is part of the public-private Wyoming CarbonSAFE program, which aims to identify geologic formations to permanently store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities in the region.

The average depth for an oil or natural gas well in Wyoming is about 8,000 feet or 1.5 miles, according to industry sources. Anything more than 12,000 feet is considered “deep,” by industry standards. The deepest petrol well in Wyoming is nearly 26,000 feet, in the Madden formation near the Lost Cabin gas plant in north-central Wyoming, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.

The first well for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub reached a depth of just over 16,000 feet.

“This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries,” Frontier President and Co-Chief Executive Officer Robby Rockey said in a prepared statement.

The new well, referred to as J1-15, will provide a wealth of new data to potentially confirm years of previous modeling, which has so far suggested the Madison Limestone is capable of holding large volumes of carbon dioxide. Targeting several geologic strata, the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub could hold more than 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to Frontier.

For scale, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage vision

The University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy about 10 years ago on the CarbonSAFE Initiative. The vision is to advance the use of carbon capture technologies — filtering carbon dioxide from smokestacks — by providing a place to put the greenhouse gas.

It’s a major pillar of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Decarbonizing the West energy policy initiative, which he has said will help keep Wyoming’s fossil fuels in the nation’s energy mix while building a new commercial sector to reduce the nation’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

In addition to the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project, exploration and validation efforts are underway at Echo Springs in Carbon County and at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant in Campbell County. Apart from the Wyoming CarbonSAFE efforts, Tallgrass Energy is exploring a carbon sequestration project in Laramie County.

Frontier Infrastructure, a division of Dallas-based Tailwater Capital, is the primary private partner for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub. The $54 million project is backed by about $43 million in federal money, according to project officials. It’s unclear, so far, exactly which companies and gas-emitting facilities might sign on to offload their carbon dioxide, but Frontier has indicated that local trona mines and soda ash processing facilities in the southwest corner of the state will serve as its “anchor” clientele.

One potential client, the Project Bison direct-air capture partnership between Carbon Capture Inc. and Frontier Carbon Solutions, is no longer active, according to those familiar with the project. Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to ease emission regulations, many still see carbon capture and carbon storage as a growing industry in the U.S. and abroad.

Frontier Infrastructure, for its part, is dedicated to “empowering industries to meet their carbon reduction goals” and helping to ensure “that the region remains competitive in an evolving global market,” according to its website.

As for the security of existing federal funding for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub efforts, it is currently “obligated” through February, according to an SER official close to the project.

In an emergency court filing Friday, the company said a Portland judge has set up an “impossible schedule” of 160 jury trials “week after week” over 2 1/2 years. The trials are for small groups of individual homeowners to seek millions of dollars in monetary damages for homes and businesses destroyed by the blazes four years ago, PacifiCorp said.

The unrelenting pace of the trials “imperils the operations of an essential public utility on which millions of customers depend” and threatens to “impose a crushing financial burden” on the largest electric grid operator in western US, according to the filing.

The company already has been hit with almost $500 million in damages for about 90 plaintiffs following a jury’s finding in 2023 that PacifiCorp was negligent for failing to shut off power lines ahead of a big wind storm. More than 1,900 fire victims in western Oregon have yet to present evidence of damages to juries in a case that’s shaping up as one of the biggest in the state’s history.

While destructive wildfires are now an almost routine part of summer in the American West, PacifiCorp’s decision to take its chances with a jury in 2023 marked the first time a lawsuit over large-scale devastation blamed on a utility’s equipment went to a trial.

PacifiCorp has said it’s confident it will get the landmark verdict overturned on appeal. But it’s now asking a state appeals court to halt further damages trials until the appeal is resolved, which could take several years.

PacifiCorp representatives didn’t immediately respond outside regular business hours to a voice mail request for comment.

In a regulatory filing last month, PacifiCorp didn’t describe its financial risk from the 2020 fires in the same dire terms as the court filing. The company said it has paid more than $1 billion in settlements, and estimated that probable losses for the fires totaled about $2.7 billion at the end of June.

Lawyers for fire victims declined to comment on Friday’s filing. They argued in a filing last week that pausing the trials would be unfair, as the fires “left thousands of Oregonians homeless, struggling to make ends meet, and traumatized.”

In 2024, Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to investors that wildfires have turned utilities across western US into risky investments. Utilities in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas have also faced billions in fire liabilities.

PacifiCorp has explored options with Oregon regulators and lawmakers to minimize its wildfire exposure, including recouping its litigation losses from customers and capping damages for non-economic claims.

Maximilian was recently joined by Mayor Tom Roach, state Sen. Shelley Mayer and Rep. George Latimer for the unveiling of the bench, which he helped secure with a $5,000 grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

The charging and connectivity bench, which is manufactured by SELS Solar, costs over $5,000 but Max – as he’s commonly known – used his negotiating skills to bring the price down to the amount in the grant, which he pursued independently.

“The bench is a renewable energy source. It’s also a public amenity, which is a bonus,” he said Thursday while sitting on his futuristic bench, which is covered with solar panels that convert sunlight to electricity using photovoltaic cells.

“People from all over White Plains can come and have a place to sit, a place to charge, free WiFi and Bluetooth,” Max said, adding that it is the only such bench in the city of some 60,000 residents.

For pedestrians who wish to do more than stop for a rest and figuratively recharge, the SB1020 stainless steel bench features USB charging ports, an inductive charging pad, WiFi connectivity and Bluetooth. The various options are displayed with blue logos on either side of the armrests.

“I want to try and make a change. If I can do this with $5,000, imagine what the city can do with a budget of $100,000,” Max said. “I want this to be a stepping stone for the city to implement more renewable energy sources. “This is a testament for what White Plains can do,”

Max said he was grateful for the city and thanked its leadership, the library and Public Works crews for their roles in bringing the project to fruition.

The student, who has attended the district’s schools since kindergarten, also praised WPHS and his teachers over the years.

“White Plains High School is a really good place and I love the learning atmosphere. The teachers really facilitate learning and make it more enjoyable,” said Max, whose brother, Josh, is entering the 10th grade.

He is already applying to colleges with the goal of entering the field of finance after first considering a career in computers.

Following the passage of Trump’s tax-and-spending law, BloombergNEF’s revised estimate for new wind, solar and energy storage additions in the US through 2035 is 26% lower than previously projected.","President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented attack on wind and solar power as he seeks to reshape the US energy landscape and reverse the green agenda put forward by his predecessor.

Since Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken aim at projects on federal lands and oceans, stopping work on wind farms, revoking permits, and making it more difficult for new renewable energy developments to secure approval. He’s also weakened the economics of wind and solar projects more broadly, pushing legislation through Congress that phases out key tax breaks and moving to tighten access to these incentives.

The broadsides have thrown the US clean energy industry into crisis, putting billions of dollars of investment at risk and threatening thousands of jobs. It’s a sharp reversal from just three years ago, when the sector hailed the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act under then-President Joe Biden as the most significant piece of climate legislation in US history.

Why does Trump dislike renewables?

Trump has criticised solar and wind as being unreliable and expensive. He’s called for more power to be generated from fossil fuels, namely natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear.

Renewables generation is intermittent as the sun isn’t always shining nor the wind blowing. But developers are increasingly turning to batteries to store surplus power and discharge it to the grid when needed.

Trump also isn’t a fan of how renewable power installations look, describing solar projects as “big ugly patches of black plastic that come from China” and mar farmland.

He’s been a vehement critic of wind turbines for years, falsely claiming they cause cancer and deriding them as bird-killing eyesores. Before his first presidential term, Trump lost a legal challenge in the UK to prevent an offshore wind project from being built within sight of a golf course he owns in Aberdeen, Scotland.

“Windmills are a disgrace,” he said in July after a visit to the course. “They hurt everything they touch. They’re ugly. They’re very inefficient. It’s the most expensive form of energy there is.” Looking at the levelised cost of electricity the long-term price a power plant needs to break even offshore wind is much more expensive than a new gas-fired facility, but it’s cost-competitive with coal and cheaper than nuclear, according to BloombergNEF’s assessment published in February. Meanwhile, onshore wind, as well as solar, is cheap enough to compete with a new-build gas plant.

How has Trump sought to curb wind and solar developments?

The Trump administration has harnessed its oversight of millions of acres of federal land and waters, where developers need government authorisation to build. While these areas are being made easier to explore for the oil and gas industry as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda, the government is imposing standards that would essentially prevent new renewables installations.

On Trump’s first day back in office, he froze permitting for all wind projects on federal land and oceans, and indefinitely halted the sale of new leases for offshore wind development. He also directed the Interior Department to review the “necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases” and to identify “any legal bases for such removal.” Since then, a number of wind projects have been upended. This includes the Revolution Wind development off the coast of Rhode Island. The government issued an order halting construction of the project which is already 80% complete citing national security concerns. This sent shares of developer Orsted A/S to record lows and added to the Danish company’s mounting troubles. Orsted’s Revolution Wind LLC unit filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in early September, seeking to overturn the stop-work order so that it can finish the project.

For developers hoping to get past the planning stage, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has ordered that all solar and wind projects on federal lands require his personal sign-off, which could mire the approval process in red tape. The department said it’s acting in accordance with Trump’s order to end “preferential treatment” for these technologies.

As part of this mandate, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management rescinded Biden-era decisions that earmarked coastal waters for future wind turbines. This covers more than 3.5mn acres, including in the Gulf of Mexico, the New York Bight, and off the coast of California and Oregon.

How has the Trump administration targeted renewables beyond federal land and waters?

Only 4% of operational US renewables capacity is located on federal land. While the government doesn’t have direct control over clean energy developments on private property, many of those projects still need federal approvals that are being held up. In addition, the Trump administration has been trying to make the economics of wind and solar less attractive.

Trump has branded efforts to combat climate change as the “Green New Scam” and vowed to do away with subsidies for these activities. The tax-and-spending law he helped push through Congress known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out the tax credits for wind and solar projects years before they were due to expire. On top of this, the Treasury Department has issued guidance making it harder for developments to qualify for the incentives.

There could be bad news to come on the tariff front, too. Wind turbines and parts are already subject to the 50% duties Trump imposed on imported steel and aluminium products. But the Commerce Department has opened a so-called Section 232 investigation into the national security implications of importing wind energy components, which could lead to sector-specific levies.

It also opened a Section 232 probe into imports of polysilicon a key raw material for solar modules which could result in additional duties on imports.

How have these actions impacted the US clean energy industry?

The industry had been building momentum as solar and wind power almost tripled their share of US electricity generation over the past decade, topping 15%. But it’s now in a tough spot. Billions of dollars of new factories and clean energy projects have been cancelled, delayed or scaled back since the start of the year.

Clean energy advocacy group E2 estimates that $22bn worth of projects were scrapped or downsized from January to June, and more than half of the investment lost was in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

Trump’s crackdown on renewables will likely hit smaller and medium-sized companies harder because they lack the financial moat needed to survive the instability. Larger solar developers have expressed more cautious optimism, saying they’ve been able to start enough projects that qualify for the expiring tax credits in order to continue their projects for the next several years.

The nascent US offshore wind industry is perhaps in the most precarious position given it was just starting to take off before Trump re-entered the White House.

How is this affecting energy prices?

That’s a subject of huge debate and has become a hot-button political issue. Electricity prices nationally rose at more than twice the rate of overall inflation in the past year and remained at a record high in June.

While the Trump administration says that adding wind and solar to the grid has been pushing up the cost of electricity, data shows that increased spending on power lines and poles has been the biggest driver of utility bill hikes.

Utilities have been upgrading their grids to accommodate new sources of generation and demand, and network operators are also trying to improve resilience to extreme weather events and modernise infrastructure that was built in the 1960s and 1970s.

Higher electricity costs are a reflection of tight supply as well, as aging coal- and gas-fired plants retire and power consumption rises after years of relatively tepid growth. Demand is being propelled by industrial users and the power-hungry data centres behind artificial intelligence. Slowing the deployment of renewables could exacerbate the situation.

The phaseout of wind and solar incentives under Trump’s tax-and-spending law could raise average US household energy bills by $78 to $192 in 2035, and increase annual industrial energy expenditure by $7bn to $11bn, according to the Rhodium Group.

Where does this leave the outlook for US renewables?

The threat of the federal government pulling the plug on fully permitted and nearly complete assets could make renewables developers and project financiers more wary of making long-term investments in the US, even after Trump has left office. It could also create uncertainty for states such as Massachusetts and Rhode Island that are relying on offshore wind to meet growing power demand and decarbonise their grids.

Blue states won’t be the only ones facing challenges. In red Texas the top US state for wind generation and number two for solar behind California all but 6% of new capacity added to the grid since 2020 has come from renewables or batteries, fuelling the power needs of its growing economy. That momentum is at risk of slowing as the accelerated phaseout of tax credits makes wind and solar projects more expensive.

Despite the Trump administration’s roadblocks, the US clean energy buildout is expected to continue, albeit more slowly. Solar and batteries are faster to deploy than Trump’s favoured energy sources. There’s currently a multiyear manufacturing backlog for the combined-cycle turbines used in gas plants, while new nuclear capacity whether based on conventional or next-generation reactors is many years away.

And onshore wind and solar are expected to be cost-competitive even without subsidies, according to BloombergNEF. In addition, blue states including California and New York are still pushing to expand their clean power fleets.

But the outlook for the sector has certainly dimmed.

“My prayer for our legislature is to be a good carpenter, right? Measure twice, only cut once,” Roth said. “We don't want to harm private rights. We don't want to cause danger around people.”

Political extremes and public frustration

Mitchell noted that recent disputes over energy development reflect the chaos of a political environment where ideas swing from one extreme to another. Roth agreed, adding that most Oklahomans aren’t engaged in the political noise.

“I think 80 percent of the public that’s in the middle is too busy to be on Facebook ranting with internet science,” Roth said. “I know a lot of Oklahomans who are working hard to get by.

The rules will largely scrutinise whether industrial units are compliant with environmental regulation. The overall framework for monitoring and compliance within the existing environmental framework is presently supported by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Regional Offices of the Environment Ministry, and the State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees. They have, however, been facing significant constraints in terms of manpower, resources, capacity and infrastructure. “These limitations have hampered their ability to comprehensively monitor and enforce environmental compliance across the vast number of projects and industries operating nationwide,” said a press statement by the Environment Ministry. This scheme aims to bridge the manpower and infrastructure deficits faced by regulatory authorities, thereby strengthening the effective implementation of environmental compliance mechanisms.

Under the new rules, private agencies can get themselves accredited as auditors. Much like chartered accountants, environment auditors can get themselves licensed and be authorised to evaluate the compliance of projects with environmental laws and their adherence with best practices in the prevention, control and abatement of pollution. Environmental regulation has, in recent years, transcended policing and bookkeeping. Given that human-caused climate change is seen as a problem that nations must collectively fix, new dimensions to environmental regulations have emerged. Thus, audits undertaken by these agencies can also be used for compliance with ‘Green Credit Rules’, under which individuals and organisations can gain tradeable ‘credits’ for afforestation, sustainable water management and waste management among other activities. Beyond industrial units, nearly every company in India will have to account for its direct and indirect carbon emissions. This will entail fairly complex accounting practices, which are beyond what Pollution Control Board officials can handle. However, preparing for the future should not be at the expense of compromising core responsibilities.

Corporate travellers are switching from the East to the West Coast with demand for US West Coast corporate housing across key locations including California, Washington, Seattle and Silicon Valley rising by 44% YOY for the last quarter. At the same time, ongoing legislation changes and uncertainty ahead of the upcoming mayoral election scheduled for November coupled with average daily rate (ADR) rising 41% YOY for the last quarter, are also impacting the decline in corporate demand for New York. These are some of the findings in SilverDoor’s latest Quarterly Market Update report published today. With enquiries for New York City down by nearly a third – 29% - for the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year, it has been replaced by Dubai in the top five cities for corporate demand according to the latest SilverDoor booking data:

London

Singapore

Madrid

Amsterdam

Dubai

Corporate demand and mobility are growing from the advancing technology sector which is continuing to increase its footprint across the West Coast and towards the southern states. The advance of AI and machine learning investment is spearheading the combined 44% growth in demand YOY for this quarter across Seattle and California’s Silicon Valley. Likewise further south, Houston in particular continues to offer comparatively lower operating costs, more favourable tax rates and a significantly lower ADR compared to New York such that as corporates continue to diversify operations beyond core cities, bookings for the popular Texas city are up 58% YOY this quarter.

The ever-advancing growth in AI investment is also having a ripple effect across the Pacific into the APAC region. Whilst Singapore demand remains high, it is starting to soften, with a 10% decline in demand YOY and ADR also following suit with a similar 13.5% decline YOY for the last quarter. Conversely, growth in AI demand globally has meant growth in demand for semiconductor manufacturing particularly in Taiwan. Likewise tech sector and cloud service growth is impacting demand in Tokyo – both destinations are reporting triple figure growth of 600% and 154% increase in bookings respectively for this quarter YOY. Across EMEA it is the renewable energy sector that has delivered significant growth in destinations to more coastal locations. Investment in solar power and offshore wind farms, particularly in Spain, has resulted in a marked shift in corporate demand as bookings for a number of destinations including Bilbao, Valencia and Zaragoza are all on the rise. Bilbao bookings have increased by 50% in the last quarter compared to the same period in 2024, Zaragoza bookings are up five-fold, and the number of room nights booked in Valencia in the last quarter is up 380% YOY. An increase of bookings by 65% YOY for the last quarter has seen Dubai claim a place in the top five with growth in demand for the region primarily coming from not only an increase in extended stays but also an increase in relocation assignees from the financial, law and pharmaceutical sectors, all of which are increasing investment across Dubai and the Middle East. Commenting on the report, Martin Klima, SilverDoor Chief Customer Officer, said, “These latest demand trends reflect a continuing wider shift in both corporate travel and operating policies. As businesses continue to balance their own growth plans against wider geopolitical and economic landscapes, diversifying operations and locations can be one way to achieve just that. Growth in regions beyond the more traditionally popular hubs like New York City towards cities in western and southern US states, and likewise the significant APAC demand growth in Taiwan, indicate where corporates are committing to investing their funds and placing their people. “As AI, technology, and renewable energy investment continues, it will be interesting to watch how the diversification trend evolves in the coming months and the impact it will have on demand across both the serviced apartment and wider accommodation sector both, from a short-term and longer-term perspective. “Growth in serviced apartment usage also comes with a shift in how corporate travellers are choosing their accommodation. Guests are increasingly keen to return to a particular apartment or operator if and when budgets and policy allow, particularly for longer stays where assignees have come to know and trust a specific operator. Pointing to more brands now having a strong presence in different markets and delivering consistent levels of service and quality throughout their portfolio, this brings with it the potential for increased loyalty across the sector.” The full SilverDoor Market Update is now available to read here *Figures from SilverDoor’s own booking data.

We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes.","NARY — Brian Ingmire’s mission to help reforest northern Minnesota with trees from south of here became a lot more important after the June 21 storm that leveled millions of trees in the Bemidji area.

Ingmire and his wife, Trina, own the 10-acre New North Farm southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County. They sell Certified Naturally Grown produce at Bemidji’s Natural Choice Farmers Market on Saturdays. They also raise sheep and chickens.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.

The program is headed by Dr. Julie Etterson, Distinguished McKnight Professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth’s Swenson College of Science and Engineering.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said. “Something like 10 million trees are needed every year at a minimum. And we have a lot of forest disturbance, whether it’s fires or wind events.”

Ingmire figures he has about 30,000 tree seedlings on his farm, and about two-thirds of them will be available for purchase this fall. Online orders can be placed at climatesmarttrees.com . He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.

New North Farm is one of 24 members of the cooperative. Ingmire is growing several varieties, including red oak, burr oak, yellow birch and silver maple. All are collected from about 200 miles south and then started up north.

“I can tell you where their parent tree came from,” Ingmire said. “They should be able to handle the changes in temperature extremes. We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes. These trees should have the genetic ability to deal with that kind of extreme.”

The need for reforestation was certainly exacerbated in the Bemidji area after the June storm. It is estimated that Beltrami County lost nine million trees, and many were also downed in parts of Hubbard and Cass counties.

“That number exceeds a lot of the nursery capacity that we have,” Ingmire said.

Trees that are purchased this fall should be planted right away to ensure their survival.

“Most of our sales will be done for spring planting,” Ingmire said, “but I would like to see as many available in the fall as possible. I think the trees do better when they're planted in the fall. But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes. Some years you've got a month to get all that done, and some years you've got two weeks.”

He said trees that are not sold this fall will be kept in cold storage at UMD and will be available in the spring.

Listening to Ingmire talk about the seedling program, his gardens and forest ecology, it’s clear to see his passion for science and the environment.

""In a lot of ways it’s a spiritual thing for me,"" he said. ""You either set everything aside and you take a preservationist mindset where nature's best left without man touching it, or you recognize that we as humans have a unique role and responsibility to participate and be part of the natural world. There's really no separation between the two of them.""

He noted that the impacts humans have are global, but that these impacts start on a local level.

""One tree at a time, or one farm that's growing vegetables that feed people. So you can choose to participate in a lot of different ways,"" Ingmire said. ""The way that I choose to participate is to imagine and envision what it could be, and then work to model that and make it happen. And help other people do the same.""

Ingmire's full-time job is with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as a water certification specialist. It’s a position that allows for flexibility, especially during the growing season, and it also allows him to visit with farmers throughout the region.

He has a degree in natural resources and environmental maintenance from Ball State University in his native Indiana. He did graduate work at Western Kentucky University and Indiana University before becoming a science teacher at the junior college and high school level.

After that, he managed water quality programs for the Environmental Protection Agency and spent 13 years as a conservation planner and trainer with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The Ingmires moved to Minnesota nearly four years ago after he started his current position with the MDA. But finding the right place to live was a bit of a challenge for Brian and Trina.

“It was right in the middle of COVID,” Brian said. “Interest rates were starting to go up. Everybody was racing to get a place.”

The couple had planned to visit five properties in the Bemidji area, but by the time they arrived, three of them had been sold.

“The first one we looked at was just a nightmare,” Brian said. Even the farm they bought didn’t look right when they pulled into the snow-covered driveway.

“It looked horrible,” Brian said. “We didn’t have any photos of the inside of the house. The doors were open on the sheds when we pulled in. It hadn’t been plowed. But then we got into the house and it had a bank of south-facing windows and all the sun was shining through. We thought, ‘This is it. We can do this.’”

Fast forward four years, and Brian and Trina have created a pristine and productive farm, with a lot of sweat equity and a little help from their hungry sheep.

“I was looking at soil maps and thought it should be good,” Brian said. “It’s prime agricultural land. We had a lot of little surprises when everything thawed. There were piles of trash, it was all grown over and full of boxelder. Kind of daunting, but I was ready for it. I was just ready to have my own piece of land, and I had ideas I wanted to try out.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6270a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F20%2Fa80e09dd49a3ae86822b44a6ae3b%2Fingmire2.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:39.440485

We continue to work towards this ambition.” Likewise, Google's Data Centers Sustainability webpage also maintains the net-zero carbon by 2030 pledge is still in place at the firm.

The internet titan has silently removed its goal to ""pursue net-zero emissions"" across all operations by 2030 from its Sustainability webpage, as first spotted by Canada's National Observer.

An update to Google Sustainability's ""Operating sustainably"" landing page, now renamed to ""Our operations,"" has removed its first headline broadcasting Alphabet Inc.'s long-stated goal to achieve net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. The new page adds details on Google's sustainability goals in recent hardware releases, but shirks any mention of a net-zero climate policy or a carbon footprint beyond the aluminum used in constructing Google Pixel phones.

After the National Observer first reported on the change, a spokesperson from Google clarified the company's carbon emission policy. ""Our most recent environmental report shows a 12% reduction in data center energy emissions in 2024,"" reads the press statement. ""This was achieved by bringing new clean energy online, even amidst increased energy demands. In 2021, we set out an ambition to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We continue to work towards this ambition.”

Likewise, Google's Data Centers Sustainability webpage also maintains the net-zero carbon by 2030 pledge is still in place at the firm. But the wording around it has now shifted to framing the goal as more of a moonshot than a guarantee. This was seen as inevitable by many as in 2023 and 2024, Google transitioned away from its practice of buying carbon offsets to achieve a ""technically carbon neutral"" status, now striving for a more robust and substantial carbon effort.

Possible Reasons Behind the Change

Still, seemingly hiding the net-zero verbage from view on its flagship sustainability website is a noteworthy choice by Google. Two major shifts in 2025 may have something to do with the decision: Google's spiraling AI energy costs and the U.S. government's crackdown on climate change initiatives.

Google and other AI hyperscalers have been continually purchasing and building data centers to meet perceived AI demands since the field opened wide last year. As a result of Google's major strategy shift towards AI, the company announced that its greenhouse gas emissions climbed by 48% in the past year, noting then that this boom would make the 2030 goal a challenge.

On the other hand, the Trump administration has been advancing its strategy on climate action and carbon emissions. After taking down a number of government websites discussing climate change upon coming into power, the U.S. government has begun championing the use of ""incredibly clean"" coal power plants.""

Now that Google seems to be officially considering its climate plans as a long shot more than a real commitment, what its path forward looks like will likely be somewhat in flux.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZBz8tMdiR9FaRK5xeafByT.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:07.771924

The production changes come on the heels of partial shutdowns at the electric vehicle manufacturing plant Factory Zero, in Detroit-Hamtramck.

General Motors' Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee is planning several weeks of downtime in the coming months, according to a memo obtained by the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Additionally, the Detroit automaker told the Free Press on Sept. 4 that it is adjusting future production plans at its Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, and at its CAMI Assembly Plant line in Ontario, Canada.

Spring Hill makes the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and Vistiq, while Fairfax is currently closed as the facility prepares to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV. CAMI produces the BrightDrop electric delivery van.

“General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand by leveraging our flexible ICE and EV manufacturing footprint,” GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in a statement.“ GM's U.S. manufacturing footprint remains our strength, and we are in the process of investing nearly $5 billion over the next two years to further increase domestic vehicle production, enabling the ability to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S.”

Spring Hill will close the week of Oct. 6 and the week of Thanksgiving, as well as the full month of December, according to the memo sent to employees Sept. 3. The change will impact vehicle assembly as well as the teams that assemble battery packs for EV batteries, GM confirmed. Ultium Cell employees will not be affected.

Separately, Fairfax Assembly, which ended production earlier this year of the Cadillac XT4 and the Chevrolet Malibu, is no longer planning to add a second shift once construction ramps up on the Bolt. GM said this summer it plans to begin assembly of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox in Fairfax by mid-2027.

Plans were to start with one shift in November, according to the company website, but now GM says it will wait on market conditions before making the decision to expand to a second shift.

Meanwhile, the production pause at CAMI will be extended through Nov. 17. CAMI Assembly had run two shifts while producing Chevrolet BrightDrop vehicles, but GM said in April that the plant would initiate temporary layoffs. Unifor said those layoffs would last through October. During this downtime, GM says it plans to complete retooling work to prepare the facility for production of the 2026 model year of commercial electric vehicles.

When production resumes, the plant will operate on a single shift for the foreseeable future — a reduction expected to impact 450 workers.

Factory Zero also altering plans

The production changes come on the heels of partial shutdowns at electric vehicle manufacturing plant Factory Zero, in Detroit-Hamtramck.

Last week, GM told employees that the plant would partially shut down some first- and second-shift production starting after Labor Day and that it would resume Oct. 6. Meanwhile, the temporary layoff in place for second-shift production that GM announced in April was extended until Oct. 6. The move impacted production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ and approximately 360 employees were laid off.

The strategic adjustments at Spring Hill also include a temporary reduction in staffing levels, the memo also said.

About 700 employees will be laid off at Spring Hill, GM confirmed.

Spring Hill Vehicle Assembly and the battery operations on site expect to be running on first shift only from January to May 2026, per the memo. Impacted employees will be placed on layoff status and may be eligible for sub-pay and benefits in accordance with the National UAW/GM contract.

“We understand this is difficult news. At the same time, it's important to remember Spring Hill has a bright future ahead,” the memo said. “We've earned multiple product allocations, including the next-generation Cadillac XT5 and the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer, thanks to your strong business performance, high engagement and track record for launch excellence.”

EV sales are strong, but uncertain

Electric vehicle sales soared in July and August as buyers tried to take advantage of up to $7,500 in federal tax credits before the Sept. 30 deadline.

Automakers preparing for a slowdown are starting to make production announcements now, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry.

“Given the situation with the tax credits going away at the end of the month, cars that would have been bought in the fourth quarter are being bought now,” he said. “Automakers are going to adjust their production in accordance with what they're selling.”

GM said Sept. 2 that sales of more than 21,000 EVs combined from Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC set an all-time record for the automaker.

Still, the company is bracing for an EV sales falloff, and Duncan Aldred, GM senior vice president and president of North America, said in a statement the company would be mindful of its EV production plans.

“We’re expecting strong demand once again in September. The question, of course, is what’s next? There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end Sept. 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,” Aldred said. “We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

On Sept. 3, Ford Motor reported gains in August U.S. retail sales, driven in a large part by EV sales. It's unusual because EV sales had been muted, given that demand for them had not been as strong as the industry had predicted it would be a few years ago. A lagging charging infrastructure and high price tags for EVs had hampered sales just 12 months ago.

According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new EV across all brands for July was $55,689. By comparison, the average transaction price in July for a new car in general was $48,841.

Still, Ford reported its retail EV sales skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August. But for the first eight months of the year, Ford's EV sales are down 5.7% at 57,888 sold compared with the year-ago period.

Analysts said any EV sales gains are not sustainable this year. That is why GM is making adjustments to production now.

Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iseecars.com told the Free Press that the EV sales spike will continue through the end of September across all EV models, “followed by a whipsaw” in the other direction as EV sales evaporate in the fourth quarter.

“It’s a predictable pattern, one we see whenever large purchase incentives are removed from the marketplace,” Brauer said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2023/03/16/PDTF/0ec0d5ca-19cc-4f6a-b7da-a0b535b551f0-IMG_Cadillaclyriqevent05_1_.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y152&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-06 12:05:15.712906
