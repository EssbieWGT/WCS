A bunch of automakers have announced plans to stop shipping or drastically cut back on EV shipments to the US (Honda, Mercedes, others). So yes, the ones remaining might lower their prices, but you'll have much less choice, and much less financing offers.

The hidden part is that the CAFE penalties are also disappearing and that's going to have weird effects on the market. Automaker fleets have to meet minimum mpg goals, so selling EVs boosts those figures up so that they can sell gas guzzlers that bring the numbers down. So let's say the target MPG for 2025 is 40mpg for example, if you sell an EV with 100mpge and a gas guzzler at 20mpg, then your fleet mpg would be 33.3MPG, and then you pay Tesla ~$2000 for 133 credit units and you're up to the 40MPG fleet compliance amount.

If you didn't sell the EV at all, and paid Tesla only, and sold that 20mpg car, you'd have to buy 20k credits, or $3000. But the problem is that if all the manufacturers do this, Tesla only has so many credits, so the math isn't simply 'oh, well then just pay the extra $1000 rather than taking a $10k loss on an EV'. If all the manufacturers did this, not only would Tesla run out of credits, but also the price would go through the roof.

It's hard to put a precise dollar number on it, but this offsetting is a huge benefit to some manufacturers like Ford that pretty much only sell gas guzzlers (outside the Mach E and the Maverick). There is no longer an incentive for manufacturers to produce these EVs to lower their fleet mpg.

I think this might actually be the bigger story. Between the two effects, it's not unreasonable that manufacturers might lose the $7500 as well as let's say a $10k benefit per EV for CAFE compliance, and that would hugely sway the decision making on something like a $50-70k Ford Mustang Mach E for example.

I think we might very quickly see that new choices are going to dwindle real fast.",,N,,2025-09-24 04:58:29.569346

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/CCT/images/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71/20241126T221110/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 03:00:29.330905

For clean energy proponents, the message is a clear and concerning one.","In his sprawling address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attacked both climate change initiatives and clean energy. He called into question the scientific consensus on the topic and the economic viability of clean energy programs. The speech marks one of his most forceful rejections of climate policy since returning to office.

Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” declaring that many predictions by the UN and other international bodies were wrong, made “by stupid people that have cost their country’s fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.” He derided renewable energy as ineffective, expensive, and a financial drag, calling it a “joke”.

The President zeroed in on Europe and wind turbines in particular, claiming the continent was being “devastated by energy and immigration”. He described windmills as “pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate” before referring to them as ""the most expensive energy ever conceived.""

His rhetoric stood in sharp contrast with international trends and the UN’s broader stance on clean energy. Secretary-General António Guterres, among others, has repeatedly urged nations to accelerate investment in renewables. Meanwhile, wind and solar power are becoming more cost-competitive and are major drivers of new electricity generation worldwide.

Critics say Trump’s claims about renewable energy are misleading. Independent fact-checkers note that while renewable energy infrastructure does require upfront capital, long-term costs have been declining, and many regions have already seen meaningful returns and emissions reductions. They also point out that calling climate science predictions “stupid” and describing green energy as a conspiracy ignores the mounting empirical evidence of climate change and its impacts.

From an oil and fossil fuel perspective, Trump’s speech underscores a clear policy orientation: to re-prioritize traditional sources such as oil, gas, coal, and even nuclear power over clean energy.

Clean energy stocks and ETFs traded lower following the speech, reflecting concern about regulatory and policy headwinds. For countries leaning heavily toward green energy, the warning from the U.S. may add political uncertainty, especially in sectors where technology, subsidies, and regulatory support are key.

The energy market observers, this latest speech confirms the Trump administration's commitment to put traditional energy at the center of its energy policy. For clean energy proponents, the message is a clear and concerning one.

A Turning Point for U.S. Nuclear Fuel Recycling?
Momentum for nuclear recycling has soared in recent months, driven by explicit federal policy shifts, including the May 2025 executive orders.","Advanced nuclear technology firm Oklo has broken ground on its inaugural 75-MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor at an Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site. The project—one of three awarded to the company under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) newly established Reactor Pilot Program—is targeting operations between late 2027 and early 2028, though that timeline is contingent on regulatory approvals and construction progress.

Oklo on Sept. 22 celebrated groundbreaking for its INL project—which it now calls “Aurora-INL”—noting the milestone stems from a concerted effort spanning five years. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo.

The milestone follows Oklo’s Sept. 5 announcement that it will design, build, and operate America’s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. As part of that effort, the company is also exploring a pioneering collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the federal utility’s used fuel inventory. If realized, that initiative could mark the first time a U.S. utility has pursued recycling its own spent fuel into new clean electricity.

Aurora-INL—Oklo’s First Commercial Reactor—Breaks Ground

Santa Clara, California–headquartered Oklo’s efforts are embedded in its vertically integrated approach, which includes advanced nuclear power generation through its Aurora powerhouses—a 50 MWe to 75-MWe liquid metal-cooled, metal-fueled fast reactor technology—fuel recycling, and radioisotope production. The company has recently reported gains toward first commercial deployments across all three business segments.

Construction activities at its first commercial reactor project—Aurora-INL—follow substantial preconstruction work, including site mobilization, early procurement, and groundwork, and are ongoing, set under a master services agreement with Kiewit, its lead constructor.

The Aurora-INL features a 50-75 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor that builds directly on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which operated successfully at the same Idaho site from 1964 to 1994. The powerhouse will use liquid metal sodium coolant and metallic fuel in a fast neutron spectrum design that enables inherent and passive safety features to significantly reduce the number of safety-grade systems required compared to traditional light water reactors, Oklo has said.

The design philosophy, notably, allows the reactor to utilize a diverse fuel portfolio including fresh high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), downblended government stockpiles of uranium and plutonium-based materials that don’t require enrichment, and eventually recycled nuclear fuel. Oklo has said the reactor leverages over 400 reactor-years of proven liquid metal fast reactor operating history worldwide.

While the Aurora-INL is effectively Oklo’s first build, the company has also noted that the project will focus on cost efficiency and speed of deployment through strategic supply chain choices. “Roughly 70% of our powerhouse components are sourced from non-nuclear supply chains, industrials, energy and chemicals, for example,” said DeWitte during the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 11. “These sectors offer mature, scalable manufacturing capabilities that we can tap into today at lower cost and with shorter lead times than traditional nuclear fabrication.”

Oklo has structured the project around “standardized shippable components like the reactor module, steam generators, and power conversion system” to “simplify installation, support parallel builds and minimize on-site construction complexity,” while designing for “inherent and passive safety” to reduce “the number of safety-grade systems” and “streamline procurement,” DeWitte said. He pointed to the company’s “preferred supply agreement with Siemens Energy” as “a great example of this strategy in action,” noting that Oklo continues to expand the supplier ecosystem “with more partnerships to come as those deals reach commercial readiness.” The company has also tapped engineering giant Kiewit under “a master services agreement” covering “the full scope of design, procurement and construction for the Aurora-INL project,” he said.

Several more reactor projects could follow. Oklo recently broadened its 14-GW pipeline with a partnership with Liberty Energy to launch an integrated gas-to-nuclear power solution, a Notice of Intent to Award from the U.S. Air Force for the first advanced fission deployment at a military installation, and agreements with Vertiv to co-develop data-center power and cooling systems, as well as with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to explore global project development.

The Regulatory Road

So far, Oklo has made substantial regulatory progress across multiple fronts, including to complete Phase 1 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC’s) readiness assessment for Aurora-INL’s combined license application (COL) under Part 52. Unlike the traditional Part 50 approach that involves two steps: the filing and approval of a construction permit followed by the filing and approval of an operating license, the company is pursuing Part 52 licensing because it “enables greater deployment speed and repeatability for companies like Oklo that plan to design, construct, and operate their own facilities,” with “the first combined license application serv[ing] as a reference, which can then be reused to reduce the scope of subsequent applications,” the company says in a regulatory dashboard on its website.

“Oklo is pioneering this approach in the advanced nuclear industry: it remains the only advanced reactor company to submit a combined license application and the first to have that application accepted for review,” it notes.

In August, however, the DOE selected the company for three projects of 11 selected under its new Reactor Pilot Program—two awarded directly to Oklo and one to its radioisotope arm, Atomic Alchemy—which seek to reach criticality of at least three advanced reactor concepts outside national laboratories by July 4, 2026.

A key facet of the program is that it allows private developers to build and operate reactors using DOE-issued permits rather than NRC licenses. The program leverages the DOE’s authority under the Atomic Energy Act to exempt reactors built “under contract with and for the account of” the department from traditional NRC licensing requirements.

DeWitte in August noted that President Trump’s May 2025 executive orders are “setting the stage for completely different licensing pathways” where “there is a path potentially to having a regulatory review done under the DOE, build the plant, turn it on,” which could “accelerate timelines considerably” as an alternative to the traditional NRC route. For Oklo’s Aurora-INL project, that aspect potentially creates optionality while the company continues pursuing its NRC combined license strategy.

Notably, the NRC recently revised its Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) milestones to align with the 12- and 18-month periods cited in Executive Order 14300 (Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), establishing 18 months for all reactor licenses under Part 52. (The measure, which took effect on May 23, also set various 12-month targets for license amendments, renewals, and other regulatory activities.)

In tandem, the company is also progressing on the Aurora-INL Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F), which is currently funneling through the DOE’s safety analysis process—including completion of its conceptual safety design and ongoing development of the preliminary safety analysis. The facility will fabricate fuel for Oklo’s Aurora-INL powerhouse, which requires high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Oklo plans to source five metric tons of HALEU from the former EBR-II reactor.

“The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F,” Oklo noted on Monday.

Oklo Unveils Nation’s First Private Nuclear Fuel Recycling Facility, Eyes TVA Used Fuel Partnership

The Aurora-INL groundbreaking, meanwhile, comes on the heels of Oklo’s plans unveiled on Sept. 5 to design, build, and operate America’s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The company said the initial phase of that facility had secured $1.68 billion in investment, which would bolster its construction and potentially position it to begin producing fuel in the early 2030s.

Earlier this month, Oklo also noted it is in early discussions with the federal corporation TVA to recycle the utility’s used nuclear fuel at the new facility, while also exploring potential power sales from future Aurora powerhouses into TVA’s service territory. If realized, the collaboration could mark “the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, turning a legacy liability into a resource while creating a secure fuel supply for the future,” Oklo said.

The Tennessee nuclear fuel recycling facility, which is slated to mark the first commercial-scale deployment of electrochemical recycling technology in the U.S., will “recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors,” including fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouses. “This process can reduce waste volumes for more economical, clean, and efficient disposal pathways,” the company said.

Oklo has made some gains in demonstrating its pyroprocessing technology, including a successful end-to-end recycling process with Argonne National Laboratory in July 2024. Essentially, Oklo’s pyroprocessing process will involve converting spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from light water reactors (which is in the form of ceramic oxide) to a metallic form. The initial preparation step removes the oxygen and prepares the fuel for the electrochemical separation. The metallic spent fuel is then placed in the molten salt environment, to which an electrical current is applied. The electrorefining process selectively separates the different components of the spent fuel, including the uranium, transuranic elements (such as plutonium and minor actinides), and fission products, including a range of radioisotopes.

In tandem, Oklo has been investigating the potential to harvest the valuable radioisotopes through its strategic subsidiary, Idaho-based Atomic Alchemy. Atomic Alchemy—also a selection under the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program—has already begun site characterization work on a commercial isotope production facility at INL and has submitted a materials license application to the NRC for its demonstration facility, which will produce revenue-generating isotopes as an early step toward commercial operations. The subsidiary is also developing the Versatile Isotope Production Reactor (Viper), which it says is designed as a cost-effective approach to radioisotope production. DeWitte has compared the technology to “a Ford F-150 version of a reactor that does the job” rather than “a custom Formula 1 race car.” It will allow the company to “make neutrons more cheaply than maybe anything else to irradiate these materials and produce them,” he said.

A Turning Point for U.S. Nuclear Fuel Recycling?

The launch of the Tennessee facility signals a major shift for the U.S. nuclear policy and industry, which has grappled with an impasse on SNF disposal alongside a looming shortage of HALEU fuel needed for advanced reactors. According to the DOE, over 95,000 metric tons of SNF are safely stored across 79 sites in over 30 states.

As POWER recently reported, while nuclear fuel recycling is not new, previous efforts to establish nuclear fuel recycling in the U.S., dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, faltered owing to regulatory, political, and economic hurdles and suffered a setback when President Carter indefinitely deferred commercial reprocessing in 1977. Momentum for nuclear recycling has soared in recent months, driven by explicit federal policy shifts, including the May 2025 executive orders.

At the same time, recycling prospects are looking more attractive, underpinned by soaring demand for HALEU from advanced reactors, billions in private-sector investment in new demonstration plants, technological advances that cut recycling costs and enhance proliferation resistance, and active NRC engagement on regulatory pathways. Generally, recycling prospects are also riding on a reframing of SNF as a high-value resource capable of supplying vast energy while slashing waste volumes are collectively driving nuclear fuel recycling forward in the U.S.

U.S. Spent Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing May Be Making a Comeback—Here’s Why. A look at the history, economics, and evolving strategies shaping reprocessing efforts in the U.S.

In August, DeWitte noted that recycling offers a “massive reserve of material” since “used fuel is effectively 90-plus percent unused fuel. “ When combined with Oklo’s fast reactor technology, it enables “a very cost-transformative” approach where “the actual fuel produced from recycling will be a much lower cost than fresh fuel, like considerably less,” he said. Government stockpiles of downblended uranium and plutonium-based materials alone “could be made into fuel for more than 3 GW of powerhouses” without requiring additional enrichment, he said.

“Fuel is one of the most important inputs for advanced nuclear, and it’s one of the areas where Oklo has built a significant strategic advantage,” he explained. “Our design enables a differentiated fuel strategy built around three complementary sources: access to government stockpiles, commercial supply partnerships, and long-term recycling capabilities. This approach provides greater flexibility, cost control, and resilience than traditional fuel models.”

While the DOE in 2019 awarded the company 5 metric tons of HALEU for its first INL powerhouse, “we’re uniquely positioned to utilize additional government fuel stockpiles made available under recent executive orders, including enriched uranium and plutonium-based materials that don’t require further enrichment,” DeWitte said. “These stockpiles, effectively waste materials that would otherwise be destined for costly disposal programs can instead be turned into a productive asset for clean energy by Oklo.”

Second, Oklo is “working with enrichers such as Centrus and Hexium to meet both near-term and long-term commercial HALEU needs,” DeWitte said. The company has a signed memorandum of understanding with Centrus, which is “currently the only domestic producer of HALEU,” to supply Oklo powerhouses for early deployment. At the same time, Oklo is collaborating with Hexium to explore a laser-based enrichment method—atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS)—that DeWitte said “has the potential to significantly change cost curves” and enable “lower cost scalable production over time.” He also noted that advances in laser technology over the past 30 to 40 years make this “an interesting time now for this” approach, which could deliver “significant improvements in efficiency, cost, and operational characteristics” compared to centrifuge enrichment.

And third, “Our fast reactors can use recovered nuclear material from both today’s nuclear fleet and future advanced reactors, positioning us to recycle fuel over time and build a vertically integrated long-term supply model,” he said. “Together, these efforts form a comprehensive and resilient fuel strategy, one that supports near-term deployment, while building long-term supply independence.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/oklo-snow-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 04:59:36.200306

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/09/trump-moves-to-gut-us-power-to-regulate-greenhouse-gases/,"WASHINGTON — Cutting against overwhelming scientific evidence, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate the legal foundation that empowers the U.S. government to regulate greenhouses gases, which warm Earth to a perilous degree.
The agency this week closed the public comment period for the proposal, which is not finalized and will likely face legal challenges in federal court.

If the legal authority is revoked, federal administrations would be blocked from using that law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
“It is clear that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, both now and in the future.","WASHINGTON — Cutting against overwhelming scientific evidence, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate the legal foundation that empowers the U.S. government to regulate greenhouses gases, which warm Earth to a perilous degree.

The Environmental Protection Agency this summer moved to revoke its own authority to regulate the six primary heat-trapping gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, a highly potent gas that seeps from natural gas infrastructure. The agency this week closed the public comment period for the proposal, which is not finalized and will likely face legal challenges in federal court.

This attempt is the first time the EPA has tried to roll back the authority, called the “endangerment finding,” since its establishment in 2009 after

“For over a decade, the EPA has acknowledged that greenhouse gases are irreparably warming our climate and harm our communities,” New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said Monday. “We will fight this dangerous action and protect our communities.”

Platkin and 22 other attorneys general, plus cities and counties, submitted a letter Monday to EPA, arguing the agency’s move is illegal and built on bad science.

In a separate request, all 11 Democratic members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation urged EPA to drop its “dangerous” proposal

request.

A repeal of the 2009 legal authority, which allows EPA to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, would deal a punishing and expansive blow to federal efforts to limit emissions from power plants, automobiles and industrial sources of carbon pollution.

Under presidential administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the EPA invoked the finding, saying that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and could be regulated under the Clean Air Act, to limit emissions from vehicles, power plants and industrial sites.

If the legal authority is revoked, federal administrations would be blocked from using that law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

“Repealing the endangerment finding would go against science and EPA’s core mission to protect public health and the environment,” Callie Sharp, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a nonpartisan environmental law group, told EPA officials in August at a hearing.

“It is clear that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, both now and in the future. Those dangers will worsen if the EPA chooses to destroy its own policy tools to meaningfully address climate change,” the Democratic lawmakers said, noting New Jersey’s exposure to extreme flooding due to sea-level rise.

“New Jerseyans know all too well the devastating impacts of the worsening climate crisis to our cities, coastlines, and communities,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th), while Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) said EPA should “reverse course on this dangerous proposal” and recommit to doing the important, science-based work that the American people rely on, protecting all of us from worsening natural disasters, extreme heat, and floods.”

Both men sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has EPA jurisdiction. Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th) is also a committee member.

On Sept. 17, the National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a study that found the scientific proof that humans are placing current and future life at risk by burning fossil fuels — the core scientific fact of climate change — is rock solid.

“This study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA, following its call for public comments, as it considers the status of the endangerment finding,” said Shirley Tilghman, professor of molecular biology and public affairs, emeritus, and former president, Princeton University, and chair of the committee that wrote the report.

When he announced in July the move to attempt to rescind the finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from Long Island, called the decision “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in July as he announced the proposal at an Indiana car dealership.

President Donald Trump has for years cast doubt on established climate science, and his administration has proposed deep budget cuts for the EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA — 55%, 27% and 24%, respectively. Together, those departments perform some of the world’s most advanced climate science.

The Trump administration and Republican allies in Congress have taken a series of steps to weaken climate programs and pollution regulation, including allowing two New Jersey medical plants to pollute more, scores of industrial sites to release more hazardous air pollutants and to block New Jersey vehicle rules.

To bolster its case to end the 2009 holding, the result of a 2007 ruling from the Supreme Court that forced the U.S. to regulate carbon dioxide and other pollutants, the Trump administration has leaned on a recent Energy Department report that found human climate change is “less damaging economically than commonly believed.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, an executive from the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, industry — a section of the oil and gas business — picked the authors of that report, which dozens of scientists debunked.

In their rebuttal, more than 85 scientists, including Pamela McElwee of Rutgers University, said “key assertions – including claims of no trends in extreme weather and the supposed broad benefits of carbon dioxide—are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.”

“As someone who works on biodiversity and ecosystems, a glaring omission of the report is the complete absence of any review of the data indicating our natural world is rapidly changing in response to climate change,” McElwee said in a statement. “Rising temperatures and more frequent extreme events like marine heat waves, among other impacts, are changing where species live, their population sizes, and when they hibernate or migrate.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2021/04/Chimney-pollution-smog-climate-change-greenhouse-gas.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 00:58:34.279351

The Horse Heaven Hills project was initially permitted by then-Governor Jay Inslee for up to 222 windmills, more than 5,000 acres of solar panels, and large battery storage facilities across 24 miles of mostly farmland from Finley to Benton City in the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, the conjoined cities of Kennewick, Pasco and Richland in southeastern Washington.

Last year, EFSEC reduced the scope of the Horse Heaven project to protect endangered ferruginous hawks and their habitat by creating a buffer zone around their nests. EFSEC also aimed to address other public concerns, such as visual impacts on the Tri-Cities skyline, wildlife migration corridors, and impacts to cultural resources.

Then-Gov. Jay Inslee then requested EFSEC to revisit these mitigation requirements to allow for a larger project, prioritizing clean energy needs over the stricter safeguards.

EFSEC approved most of the original project, nixing only about three dozen proposed turbines.

As reported by The Center Square, in December, a citizen group called Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S., Benton County and the Yakama Nation filed separate lawsuits against the project.

Fast-forward to a meeting last week in which EFSEC members, who are mostly state agency employees, indicated they are inclined to prevent Scout Clean Energy from putting windmills, solar panels, or batteries within two miles of five ferruginous hawk nests within the center of the project zone. EFSEC has agreed on 1-kilometer buffers for 39 additional nests.

On Tuesday, Paul Krupin with Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S. told The Center Square that while it’s encouraging to see EFSEC again potentially scaling back the project, he has not seen details of exactly what that will look like. He contends EFSEC has not addressed many of the additional concerns raised by community members, including quality of life and the anticipated loss of property values in the region.

“We don’t know what the council’s going to do. How many turbines, and where are they? They have not told us, and so we don’t know what the council is voting on, and we don’t have any way to really evaluate the true impacts,” he said. “It’s a [mysterious] process.”

Krupin added that EFSEC has failed to address firefighting concerns.

“Between Benton City and Kennewick and up in Canyon Lakes, we have fires here. We need these 727s and DC-10s, so that’s what we’re fighting for,” he said. “And if Scout gets to put those turbines on the ridgeline for 25 miles, there’s 100,000 people within four to six miles of the visual site of all these, and experts predict a 20 to 30% drop in real estate value, which will be devastating. They [EFSEC] are only listening to the governor, and the company talk about economic viability without taking economic harm into account.”

Krupin also raised concerns about a recent change by EFSEC during a June meeting. Members agreed to give Director Sonia Bumpus sole authority to approve nearly two dozen plans and projects overseen by EFSEC.

“Implementing this policy will contribute to timely completion of the plan review process and is consistent with EFSEC’s past practice of delegating certain review and approval authorities to the EFSEC Director. The adoption of this policy formalizes the delegation of this authority to the EFSEC Director and specifies the type of plans to which this delegated authority extends,” noted EFSEC Policy 16-01 document dated June 25.

“You can’t do that without going through official rulemaking,” Krupin said. “The Legislature needs to give you the authority. You can’t give that authority to yourself.”

In August, Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S. and Friends of the Columbia Gorge filed a petition for judicial review against EFSEC over its policy change, which Krupin argued was made to expedite projects before federal tax dollars evaporate.

“President Trump came out with directives to minimize wind turbines and solar nationwide, and it basically says you have to begin construction by July 4th, 2026. You have to begin construction in order to get the tax credits that these companies need to build and operate, so they’re racing to get these things going,” Krupin said. “Now EFSEC has this new policy, and how do you think they are going to approve all these permits without any oversight whatsoever, and without any public knowledge and engagement whatsoever? I’ve never seen a process like this. I mean, never on earth did I ever imagine that I would see something like this.”

Chad Thompson, Scout Clean Energy’s media contact, emailed a July response letter sent to EFSEC, which said in part, “While ferruginous hawks are listed as endangered in Washington, they are fairly common across their range, which encompasses the western U.S. and Canada. Their rarity in Washington is a function of geography as much as anything, as they are only in the state during the breeding season, and migrate to other parts of their range during the non-breeding season.”

EFSEC responded to a question about the modified site proposal following initial publication of this article.

“Following Council discussion, staff indicated a draft resolution will be developed that the Council can discuss and vote on at a future meeting. These steps may impact the project proponent’s site map. We have not received updated site plans to reflect this discussion,” Karl Holappa, EFSEC public information officer, emailed The Center Square.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/80/f8082e7a-ced7-11ef-9444-7ba83e62af6d/67804dfa2d7ed.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 00:58:40.841439

Air Force Roofing founded by Joel Alcocer announced that it is now one of the few roofing contractors in South Florida qualified to install the Tesla Solar Roof a premium code ready roof replacement that generates clean electricity while delivering hurricane grade durability. The advancement positions Air Force Roofing to help Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach residents replace aging tile or shingle roofs with a Tesla Solar Roof that can cut energy bills while protecting homes to the highest industry standards.

Data backed savings made for Broward County. Fort Lauderdale households pay about $0.16 per kWh and use roughly 20,256 kWh per year. A properly sized Tesla Solar Roof can offset most or all of that usage. At today’s local rates offsetting 20,256 kWh equals about $3,240 in annual bill avoidance. Even a 10 kW Tesla Solar Roof that produces about 15,000 kWh per year would avoid about $2,400 annually before incentives. These figures reflect local EnergySage data for Fort Lauderdale and typical South Florida solar yield of about 1,500 kWh per kW year.

Federal Incentive. The Residential Clean Energy Credit (Internal Revenue Code Section 25D) provides a 30% federal tax credit for qualified residential clean energy systems including solar panels and solar roofing tiles such as the Tesla Solar Roof. This credit applies only to the solar portion of the project (panels or tiles inverters wiring and batteries if paired) and does not apply to unrelated non solar roofing materials or structural costs. The credit remains at 30% through 2032 then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring in 2035 unless extended by Congress.

Florida Incentives. While Florida does not have a state income tax credit it does provide:

100% property tax exemption on the added value of solar systems

Sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases

This means installing a Tesla Solar Roof in Florida qualifies for both the 30% federal tax credit on the solar portion and Florida’s state tax exemptions maximizing return on investment for homeowners.

Net metering support from Florida utilities. Florida’s statewide net metering rule enables customers of investor owned utilities including Florida Power & Light FPL to receive bill credits at the retail rate for excess solar generation with FPL applying a customary 115% sizing guideline relative to past usage. Credits typically roll over monthly with annual true up practices defined by utility tariffs. These policies are important levers in achieving the projected savings from a Tesla Solar Roof.

Hurricane ready performance and Class leading ratings. Beyond energy savings a Tesla Solar Roof gives a South Florida home a fully integrated new roof replacement with Class A fire Class F wind and industry leading impact ratings supported by a 25 year product and power warranty. For homeowners replacing aging clay tile or asphalt shingles this means fewer roof penetrations than conventional rack mounted panels and a single envelope designed to handle severe weather common to Broward County.

Why now for Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach. Florida households use more electricity than the US average due to heavy air conditioning loads making the Tesla Solar Roof a targeted way to rein in long term energy costs while modernizing curb appeal. With strong sun (NREL PVWatts and Project Sunroof datasets show robust output across South Florida) and stable incentives a roof replacement that also generates power has become a financially and functionally compelling upgrade for the region.

Leadership and service. Joel Alcocer emphasized that the team’s mission is to combine precision roofing with modern energy engineering so homeowners receive one coordinated project one warranty stack and one dedicated installer. By pairing Tesla Solar Roof installation expertise with local permitting know how Air Force Roofing helps Broward County homeowners navigate product selection interconnection and utility paperwork with fewer handoffs and faster time to energy savings.

Since 2019, the US has been a net exporter of energy, with 2023 marking a record year for energy exports and peak oil production levels. But sustaining this independence in a reliable and affordable way remains a challenge.

A new report from the Committee for Economic Development (CED), the public policy center of The Conference Board, warns that rising permitting delays, global clean tech competition, regulatory imbalances, and uncertainty around tax credits could jeopardize America's energy advantage.

""Energy independence isn't just about production—it's about building a resilient, diversified energy system that can power new technologies, support exports, and meet growing demand,"" said David K. Young, President of CED. ""By modernizing infrastructure, balancing fossil fuels and renewables, and letting markets guide the way, we can keep the US secure and competitive.""

The report urges policymakers and business leaders to adopt a pragmatic, market-driven approach to energy—one that supports innovation, maintains regulatory neutrality, and leverages the full spectrum of US energy resources to strengthen long-term economic leadership.

Policy Recommendations for a Sustainable Energy Strategy

To sustain US energy independence and promote energy transmission and energy resilience, policymakers and business leaders should recognize that:

Both fossil fuels and renewables are important parts of energy independence.

The power of markets should drive energy policy as much as possible, and government should seek to interfere with or skew markets as little as possible.

Regulation should be based upon sound science, promote fair competition, and be as source-neutral as possible to permit markets to work.

As tax credits for clean energy are sunsetted, states will have an increasingly important role in promoting US clean energy industries, which preserves US jobs in these industries.

Permitting reform is essential for the modernization and expansion of the electric grid, including adding new capacity from all sources.

US business has an active and urgent role to play in leading energy innovation and growing exports of both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and clean energy products as well as promoting emissions reductions in their business interest.

TC Energy will focus on ramping up US investments to meet soaring power demand despite signals Canada is showing a more energy-friendly stance.

“The returns we can earn in the United States are significantly more attractive than they are in Canada,” Chief Executive Officer and President Francois Poirier said in an interview during the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York. “I expect that the US will continue to be where we’ll invest.”

The pipeline company is seeking to tap into a push by US President Donald Trump, who recently signed executive orders aimed at boosting artificial intelligence development in the US by loosening regulations and expanding energy supplies for data centers, amid a broader desire for US energy dominance.

TC Energy recently announced plans to invest $8.5 billion into US energy infrastructure projects planned over the next five years. Poirier also pointed to Mexico as a priority for new investment.

“We have quite a few projects on the drawing board in Mexico, which would include getting natural gas from West Texas into the Northwest part of Mexico,” Poirier said. “There’s definitely the potential to expand” the company’s Topolobampo pipeline and “connect that line to West Texas.”

Still, TC Energy remains bullish on Canada with Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to speed construction of a major expansion of LNG Canada, a large-scale liquefied natural gas export project on the country’s west coast.

The project, known as LNG Canada’s Phase 2, would require doubling TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink pipeline’s capacity by adding five to six compressor stations. The capital investment would total several billion dollars, according to Poirier.

Clean energy capacity alone does not guarantee resilience — trust and transparency require policy coordination and governance capability.","ASEAN’s clean energy boom is taking shape. But without coordination, the region risks being locked into low-value roles in the green economy. China has emerged as ASEAN’s largest clean energy financier and now dominates regional electric vehicle and battery markets. Yet beneath the investment momentum, policies, standards, skills development and knowledge transfer remain fragmented. A China–ASEAN clean energy–industrial mechanismcould fill this gap.

Across the region, operations such as nickel processing in Indonesia and mining in the Philippines have drawn criticism for unsafe labour conditions, community displacement and habitat loss. US tariffs of up to 3500 per cent on ASEAN solar exports imposed in April 2025 exposed how fragile regional supply chains are. Without a framework to align industrial policy, workforce upgrading and environmental safeguards, Southeast Asia risks remaining a low-cost assembly hub, dependent on external capital but unable to shape the rules of the energy transition.

For Beijing, deeper clean energy engagement with ASEAN aligns with strategic priorities such as diversifying export markets, embedding outbound manufacturing in emerging industrial hubs and locking in supply chains for critical minerals and green technologies. For ASEAN, China offers capital, technology, and scale.

ASEAN already has platforms such as the ASEAN-China Clean Energy Cooperation Centre and the ASEAN+3 Clean Energy Roundtable Dialogue, but they lack the mandate and focus to align investment, industrial upgrading and governance on a regional scale. What is missing is a dedicated mechanism to link clean energy cooperation with industrial policy — one that embeds environmental, social, and governance (ESG) safeguards from the outset.

A China–ASEAN clean energy–industrial mechanism could anchor cooperation in labour and skills development. The mechanism could convene thematic working groups, support regional training hubs and co-design curricula with industry and academia to match labour upgrading with institutional commitment to build a capable workforce with structured training programs.

The mechanism could bridge the disconnect between capital and capacity. While investment is pouring into electric vehicles and renewable projects, enabling environments remain uneven. Drawing on models such as Singapore’s FAST-P and Indonesia’s Danantara, the mechanism could link Chinese policy banks, ASEAN state-owned enterprises and global financiers to develop ESG-anchored green industrial zones that pair infrastructure with manufacturing. A curated pipeline of bankable regional projects would turn capital inflows into strategic industrial capacity.

The mechanism can also create the institutional alignment required to move from one-off projects to enduring partnerships. Clean energy capacity alone does not guarantee resilience — trust and transparency require policy coordination and governance capability. The mechanism could host Track 1.5 dialogues, enabling joint procurement reforms, decarbonisation case studies and ESG compliance workshops.

Verifiable sustainability safeguards must be continuous and enforceable, not just contractual at project outset. Improving ASEAN’s environmental record will require Chinese corporates to adopt higher operational standards, ASEAN ministries to embed clear ESG regulations and local authorities to enforce them consistently — with the mechanism serving as the channel to align and monitor these efforts.

Initial participation could focus on ASEAN members with significant clean energy and industrial cooperation with China, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, before expanding as political and market conditions allow. A smaller coalition of willing states sidesteps ASEAN consensus paralysis and gives proof of concept.

But it would need a clear ministerial mandate spanning industry, labour and environment portfolios. The mechanism could be co-chaired by a standing Chinese lead ministry and a rotating ASEAN co-chair aligned with the ASEAN Chair, ensuring continuity on China’s side and regional ownership on ASEAN’s.

Private businesses’ roles would go beyond consultation. As conveners, firms could commit capital and expertise to joint research and development, ESG compliance and local partnerships on supply chains, helping translate government frameworks into tangible industry practice and durable benefits.

For ASEAN, such a mechanism would operationalise centrality by aligning national strategies with regional goals and enabling coherent engagement with external partners. For China, it would provide a structured channel to address ESG concerns, reduce friction and ensure investments generate long-term goodwill and influence.

While the mechanism centres on China given its economic gravity, it would not operate in isolation. Japan and South Korea remain important partners whose engagement could be channelled through the existing roundtable dialogues. This would allow the mechanism to remain focused on aligning cooperation with China, while still complementing and reinforcing wider regional partnerships.",https://eastasiaforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2024-03-26T152237Z_345151988_RC2LT6AGXEA4_RTRMADP_3_TOTW-SOLAR-1024x694.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 20:59:13.378085

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Ninety-eight years ago, the nation’s largest power grid operator was founded here by utilities serving Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro threatened to pull his state out of the coalition.

“It is time to get serious about making significant reform,” Shapiro said, at a conference he convened with representatives from all 13 states now in the grid to “chart a new course” for operator PJM Interconnection.

“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction,” he said.

Pennsylvania is the largest energy producer in the grid. Its absence would impact electricity consumers across the region, which stretches from Illinois to North Carolina.

Data centers built to fuel artificial intelligence technology are driving huge increases in electricity demand—and in prices for consumers. Shapiro and other elected leaders like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin blame PJM for delays in approving new power projects, creating a bottleneck that is making the situation worse. Shapiro, a Democrat, and Youngkin, a Republican, want states to have a say in PJM’s decisions; right now, government officials do not have a voice on PJM’s board.

Speaking at the conference later in the day, PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is stepping down at the end of this year, said that “fingerpointing” wasn’t helpful.

“There’s an element of responsibility on both sides,” he said, meaning the states and PJM. All parties need to work together and ask, “‘How do we solve this?’” he said.

At the end of the conference, 11 of the states’ governors’ offices—all but Kentucky and West Virginia—announced they had formed a collaborative to continue to work together on the energy issues discussed at the meeting.

Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the joint criticism of PJM by multiple state governors “very unusual” and “the highest level of state engagement with PJM I’ve ever seen.” He said in an email that he thinks there’s a strong chance for governance reforms.

Shapiro’s statements come two months after nine governors in the PJM region demanded in a letter that PJM reserve two board seats to be filled with nominees by the states. Last month, those nominees surfaced as former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements.

PJM, which has conducted a months-long effort with a consultant to propose candidates, initially responded that it would consider the recommendations. It is expected to make a decision this Thursday.

“PJM is mired in a crisis of confidence,” Christie said at the conference. “Consumers have lost confidence in the people who run their grid.”

Christie said PJM needs a “new constitution,” one that reimagines the organization in a way that changes its governance structure to reflect the fact that PJM is a “policy-making body.”

Shapiro said PJM has “months, not years” to make changes, or Pennsylvania will take steps to leave the organization. “We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects, and we’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” he said. Shapiro did not provide details about what this new arrangement would look like.

New Jersey lawmakers have already taken up the issue. In June, the state Assembly passed a bill directing its Board of Public Utilities to work with other states and study alternatives for addressing skyrocketing electricity prices—including the option of leaving PJM altogether. A companion measure has been introduced in the state Senate but has not yet been assigned to a committee.

In remarks delivered remotely to the conference, Youngkin confirmed that he and his allies are working on bills that seek to do the same.

“The bottom line is that when PJM succeeds, we all succeed together. But if reforms stall, we will act and do what is needed to protect the families and businesses who depend on us,” Youngkin said.

In his recorded message for the conference attendees, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said, “Thirteen governors have united with a single urgent message for our regional grid operator, and it underscores the seriousness of the crisis that we now face. The path forward requires real transparency and accountability from PJM and a truly collaborative role for states in the governance process.”

Maryland, as a net importer of electricity, is frustrated by PJM’s delays connecting new clean-energy sources to the grid and opaque governance rules that Moore repeatedly said are disrupting the state’s climate targets and hurting households and businesses.

On Monday, ahead of his recorded message, Moore huddled with state Senate leadership in Annapolis to announce $200 million in direct energy bill rebates for low-income households to counter the rising prices.

Without commenting on how PJM should be governed, the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM and states should require data center developers to “pull their own weight” by investing in new energy generation—a policy push during the meeting colloquially tagged as “bring your own generation” or B.Y.O.G.

“The big message today was that prices are unsustainably high and PJM needs to do a better job protecting customers,” Rutigliano said. “The truth is that this crisis was caused by data centers and nearly all the money is going to old power plants.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said that “meeting the demands of a rapidly changing energy landscape will require solutions that extend beyond any one institution.”

“It will require PJM, the industry and especially our states all working in concert,” he said.

Asthana, PJM’s CEO, emphasized the scale of change that will be necessary to meet the challenges of powering AI now and in the future, not just at PJM but across the country. “If we’re going to win this race, I think we need to think differently,” he said.

What’s not clear is whether, or how, states leaving PJM would lead to a more affordable or reliable system.

Most of the power plants in PJM compete on an open market as a result of decisions by lawmakers in various states in the 1990s and 2000s to introduce more competition into the electricity sector. This restructuring meant that regulated utilities were limited to providing the delivery of electricity, while independent power producers would build and operate power plants.

Representatives of independent power producers said on Monday that they can understand the frustration with PJM, but they don’t see how it solves anything for states to leave.

“While we continue to stand in favor of common-sense reforms that will improve power market functionality, grid reliability, and consumer affordability, the actions taken by some elected officials do nothing more than disrupt PJM’s ability to do its job,” said a statement from Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group whose members include independent power producers.

Jon Gordon, director at Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents advanced generation technologies, said despite PJM’s high prices, participation within the regional grid provides more efficiency and competition for electricity sales, which keeps costs lower for ratepayers. The regime used prior to PJM’s shared marketplace allowed utilities to overbuild with less incentive to keep prices in check.

“I don’t think anybody wants to go back to that. … We just need to make improvements so we get all the benefits of competition but none of the inefficiencies,” Gordon said, adding that a PJM departure may mean state agencies could have to negotiate contracts with producers. “If these studies are fair and unbiased, I think they’re going to show it’s pretty risky to leave PJM and there’s probably not enough benefit to justify the potential risks.”

The challenge with PJM is the political diversity of the region that includes Republican West Virginia and Democratic New Jersey, compared to more ideologically homogeneous New England, Gordon added. The governors in the PJM region have now realized they don’t have much influence over decisions affecting how new generation sources get onto the grid.

“I think the states are completely different on whether it’s fossil or renewables generation,” Gordon said. “But they all agree that they want a voice, and they want lower prices.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gov-Josh-Shapiro-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 01:57:56.008722

Earlier today, spy photographers snapped the brand’s electric crossover out testing, yet the company is abandoning plans to go electric-only. This is yet another about-face for Bentley, which was originally aiming to only sell EVs by 2030. The ultra-luxury brand then pushed that date back to 2035 and now, who knows.

Speaking to Autocar, Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser appeared to blame the change on Audi and Porsche. The three brands are closely related as they share platforms, powertrains, and components. As a result, their decision to continue offering internal combustion engines has impacted Bentley.

Gas Still On The Menu

That means we can expect gas-powered versions of the next-generation Bentayga, Continental, and Flying Spur. This is said to be a concession to North America and the Middle East, which aren’t keen on ultra-luxury EVs. As Walliser explained, “There is a dip in demand for luxury electric vehicles, and customer demand is not yet strong enough to support an all-electric strategy.”

Despite the change, Bentley is still embracing electrification and is planning to launch a new plug-in hybrid or electric vehicle every year starting in 2026. This kicks off with their electric Urban SUV and will presumably continue with a greater emphasis on plug-in hybrids.

Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.
Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.
She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.
“With our abundant resources and outstanding potential, Montana can and should play a key role in unleashing American energy,” Gianforte said.","Electricity demand in western states is projected to increase 20% during the next decade — double what has been expected, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Monday.

“It’s clear we’ve got to meet this challenge head on to secure affordable, reliable energy for Montana families and businesses,” Gianforte said.

At their initial meeting Monday, the governor asked members of his newly formed energy task force to “dig deep, be creative, cast a wide net.” He asked the group to explore groundbreaking technologies for the state, including nuclear.

Gianforte created the Energy Advisory Council in a Sept. 10 executive order to provide him with short- and long-term recommendations to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy.

In general, Gianforte said he was tasking the group with providing “actionable” recommendations to “unleash American made energy.”

He said Montana has an “historic opportunity” to make progress with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The task force, a group of 20 industry representatives, energy experts, large consumers, and legislators, asked how much more energy generation Montana needs, how much transmission capacity is available, and how to turn the page on “negative press” about data centers.

Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.

It has more energy capacity but less generation, with the closures of two coal fired plants at Colstrip and opening of “more variable resources,” such as wind, according to her presentation.

Data in the presentation said since 2019, wind capacity has increased 162% and wind generation has increased 93.6%.

But Nowakowski said demand is up even as generation is down — “We need to do something about that.”

And she said not much has changed with transmission in recent years.

Nowakowski said the group had significant expertise, it would have hard conversations during the next year, and she encouraged members to continually think about pushing the Treasure State forward.

“How can we make Montana first? I’m competitive. I want Montana to be first,” Nowakowski said.

She also said she wanted U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and others at the national level “to know Montana is ready and open for business.”

In response to a question from state Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, about whether reducing demand was part of the discussion, Nowakowski said “everything is on the table,” including energy efficiency.

“The cheapest electron is the one we save,” Nowakowski said.

Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.

The person said they thought the makeup of task force members leaned toward those who favored fossil fuels and asked the group to consider including representation from the Montana Environmental Information Center.

Nowakowski, however, said the group’s charge in making recommendations included “fuel neutrality,” and she said the governor also had promoted an “all of the above” strategy for energy.

She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.

The themes all three subgroups would consider are consumer perspectives, governance, regional markets, and best practices and innovation.

Gianforte said Montana already is a leader when it comes to energy resources and generation, and it’s ready to do more for producers and consumers, and for affordability and security.

They’re concerned about the situation and the possible effects that this pipeline would have on their families.

The letters came from Enbridge, dated Sept. 10th. In the letter, is a request for landowners to authorize a CO2 sequestration facility (called “The Project” throughout the letter) to perform survey activities for the project.

Survey types include civil, environmental, and cultural resources, according to the letter from Enbridge.

The letter reads, in part:

You are receiving this letter because your property has been identified as being potentially affected by the Project’s CO2 pipeline route. To further assist in analyzing and refining the proposed routes, civil, environmental, and cultural survey information is needed.

The Project is requesting your authorization to access a portion of your property for the

limited purpose of performing certain survey activities in connection with the Project. These civil, environmental, and cultural resource survey activities are necessary to thoroughly evaluate the proposed routes. Project surveys will be conducted in a minimal amount of

time with the goal of little to no inconvenience to you or to other landowners.

Survey work is scheduled to begin in your area within the next few weeks.

The survey activities planned along a portion of your property within the proposed routes, and any minimal impacts that may result, are more fully described in the enclosure entitled “Description of Survey Activities.” While we do not anticipate any damage to your property

because of these surveys, please be assured that you will be compensated if damage to your property or crops occurs as a direct result of these activities. Granting us authorization to access your property for the purpose of conducting these surveys does not grant any other rights to the Project, such as easement or construction rights. Your consent to survey and

cooperation would be sincerely appreciated.

On Sept. 10, 1PointFive and Enbridge Inc. announced the formation of a joint venture to develop the Pelican Sequestration Hub and transportation infrastructure in Louisiana. 1PointFive is responsible for developing the facilities that will store carbon dioxide underground, and Enbridge will build and operate pipelines from customer facilities to this hub, according to a press release.

“The hub enables vital investments in manufacturing and energy production to increase Louisiana’s ability to export its products globally,” the press release states.

District 8 Councilman Dean Coates is concerned about the situation, and is frustrated that he was unaware of this project until constituents began reaching out to him regarding these survey letters late last week.

“I’m just trying to find out what’s going on and find out what concerns the people have so that I can try to get some answers,” Coates said to UWK.

Coates is meeting with a company representative on Wednesday, Sept. 24, before holding a public meeting at 6 p.m. the same day in the Livingston Parish Council Chambers (20355 Government Blvd., Livingston). The town hall will allow people to find out more information about the proposed project and ask questions.

He said he has spoken with the project’s company about attending the town hall meeting, too, but is unsure whether any representatives from the company will be present for the public to speak with.

“This is just me trying to give people an outlet to vent to us about what’s going on and educate us as well as maybe I can give them some information,” Coates said.

One of the things Coates is aiming to find out more about is whether this project utilizes eminent domain and meets state requirements. In June 2025, the Louisiana Legislature updated language regarding eminent domain or “expropriation” for carbon storage.

Coates said that people have called him about the survey letters, saying they are feeling pressure from the company to permit them to conduct the surveys.

“They’re telling me, ‘I can’t tell them no.’ I said, ‘Tell them, No.’ If you don’t want them on your land, tell them no,” he said.

Coates said it’s important for all residents—not just in the area of this current project—to remain aware and informed. He said that “getting in the fight early” is important for those who want to stop projects from moving forward so close to home.

“Just because it’s not on your doorstep right now does not mean it will not be on your doorstep. You need to attend these meetings and get involved before it ends up there, because once they start pumping this stuff, we’re not gonna be able to stop it.”

The letter from Enbridge includes a “Project Hotline” number for questions or concerns: 1 (866) 315-9447.

However, a recent study has revealed much more immediate benefits that are measured in human life, the Guardian reported.

According to a study led by Princeton University, efforts to switch to clean energy and reduce the production of heat-trapping air pollution in the U.S. have already produced palpable benefits in every state and, more than that, in almost every county in the country. Climate action has led to improved health nationwide.

Not only that, but we can continue to reduce the death toll caused by particle air pollution. Within the next five years, we could see 6,000 fewer pollution-related deaths per year, or we could see an increase, depending on how we approach air pollution now. Other analyses have revealed that this would save our economy billions of dollars.

""Climate actions not only reduce carbon emissions but also bring significant air-quality improvements to regions with historically high pollution levels,"" said lead author Xinyuan Huang, according to the Guardian.

""Under ambitious climate policies, states like West Virginia and Kentucky could see deaths from particle pollution decrease by over 19% in 2030, demonstrating the substantial health benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels.""

To achieve this, we would need to turn to clean, renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, and away from dirty energy sources like oil and coal. Switching to electric cars and freight trains would also reduce the use of dirty fuels and further clean the air.

""Figuring out how to leverage and combine actions to maximize local benefits will be important to promote widespread public support for this transition,"" said Dr. Wei Peng, per the Guardian.

The U.S. energy storage sector is poised to grow significantly now that federal policy on incentives has been finalized and the impacts of trade tariffs are becoming clearer, according to a report from law firm Troutman Pepper Locke published Tuesday.

The versatility of energy storage resources has “untethered it from the fate of wind and solar to a meaningful degree,” report co-author and Troutman Pepper Locke partner Vaughn Morrison said in a statement. Renewable resources saw federal tax credits cut by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted in July, but storage incentives were left in place.

Price arbitrage is an increasingly popular use case for utilities adding energy storage resources, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday. In 2024, two-thirds of all utility-scale battery capacity had arbitrage among its uses, and 41% of the total capacity was primarily used for arbitrage.

Dive Insight:

The Troutman Pepper Locke report does not make specific predictions about the energy storage market, but paints a narrative of optimism across the sector.

“Power prices are going to rise dramatically,” said Andrew Waranch, CEO of Spearmint Energy and one of several energy executives interviewed for the report. The company has 20 storage projects, totaling more than 13 GWh of capacity, under development in 10 states.

Waranch sees the post-OBBBA clarity, and the rising cost of electricity, as drivers of the storage market.

“So much of the power market and power price is set by expensive and old generators that only need to operate for the narrowest of windows during ramp times in the morning and evening,” Waranch said. “In contrast, batteries can solve that quickly and cheaply with extremely high reliability.”

Following arbitrage, EIA says frequency regulation is the most common use case for utility-scale storage.

Frequency regulation was the primary usage for 24% of battery capacity last year, EIA said.

“In previous years, operators had reported that frequency regulation was the most common use case for their battery systems,” it said.

While energy storage fared better in OBBBA than wind and solar incentives did, there are still challenges, the Troutman Pepper Locke report warned. The bill included Foreign Entities of Concern provisions for storage projects that limit access to tax credits when components coming from adversarial nations, particularly China, are used in batteries.

OBBBA’s impact on energy storage “is less severe than some feared,” John Leonti, partner and chair of the energy department at Troutman Pepper Locke, said in a statement. However, the FEOC provisions “issue significant supply challenges for the industry moving forward.”

The FEOC rules are “really handicapping the industry pretty significantly,” said Prevalon CEO Tom Cornell in the report. “There’s just not enough time to move the supply chain that quickly, especially around the battery cells, so that’s really our big concern.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/exLkb2bqraMCEvDcZPpKF3ggYMSb5rnXpiILvIIm_js/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMDQyNTQ3MjY5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-23 20:01:50.819297

But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.
EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars.
With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.
And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models.","(CNN) — Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1, leaving automakers and car buyers wondering where prices will go.

The tax credit, which was passed in 2022 as part of the Biden administration’s legislative push to support EVs and green energy, is going away as part of President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill that passed in July. The move came after US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

The end of the tax credit means demand for EVs is expected to fall, which means prices in real terms will rise — a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September. But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.

With fewer people buying EVs in the coming months, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand. But it’s not clear how much savings that will provide buyers, and it likely won’t make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US electric vehicles rose more than three times as fast as the 2% rise in non-electric passenger vehicles, according to data from the BTS.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

“If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms or cash-back offers for buyers.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

“I think we’ll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,” Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won’t kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they’ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey from Cox found that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment, were all more important factors than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models. It’s not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won’t necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a “moving target,” said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

“I think there’s going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,” Green said.",https://ktvz.b-cdn.net/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWZ2bTJ5MWEwMDAyM2I2bjJrcDc0cmlr-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZnZtMnB1dDAwMHkyNnFxNnc4ODQwd2g-300-860x637.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:01:02.731098

The list below shows the largest CO2 polluters in the U.S. in the Carbon Mapper database, as of August 2025.","On September 2, 2023, a specially equipped aircraft flew to Colstrip, Montana. On this fine late summer morning, the plane flew over the Colstrip coal-fired power plant, one of the largest and dirtiest in the U.S. The plant was generating about 1,500 megawatts of electricity per hour that day. The airplane flew back and forth in tidy parallel paths, making 12 passes over the power plant and its surroundings.

The airplane is called the Global Airborne Observatory, and it measures climate-warming pollution in pinpoint detail. Data from the flyover revealed a billowing plume of carbon dioxide coming from Colstrip’s twin smokestacks, with concentrations reaching beyond 100,000 parts per million. These measurements showed the power plant was emitting about 1.7 million pounds of CO2 an hour, which is what you’d get from burning 4.4 railcars full of coal.

The result of the flyover is a visual representation of climate-warming pollution that conveys something that numbers cannot. Most readers already know that a coal-burning power plant is a major source of CO2 emissions. But it strikes a different chord to see a plume of pollution emerging from a power plant and spreading silently over the landscape.

As the Trump administration moves to cancel greenhouse gas reporting by major polluters, a constellation of satellites and aircraft is already taking up the slack. Scores of instruments are peering down through Earth’s atmosphere, finding pollution all across the globe, every day. These programs are run by private companies, nonprofits, and governments, and most of them display their data for free so anyone can see it.

Read part one of this series: Climate polluters may be allowed to stop reporting their emissions. That doesn’t mean they can hide them.

Carbon Mapper shines a light on CO2 and methane

Carbon Mapper is one of the easiest-to-use tools for observing greenhouse gas pollution. One of the strengths of Carbon Mapper is that it combines data from multiple sources, both government and privately operated missions. Carbon Mapper uses data from three aircraft, its own satellite called Tanager-1, and NASA’s EMIT instrument on the International Space Station. The findings are displayed in a free mapping tool.

Snapshots from above capture a different view than EPA reporting

EPA reporting can be based on direct measurements at some facilities, or a calculation called an “inventory.” An inventory is simply the sum of the amount of fossil fuel burned, multiplied by an average emissions factor for the type of fuel, such as coal, gas, or oil.

Riley Duran, CEO of Carbon Mapper, said that inventory-style measurements don’t capture the full picture. For example, if a power plant generates the same amount of power on two different days, one might reasonably calculate the same rate of emissions. But that’s not necessarily true, said Riley. For every megawatt of power generated, the emissions can vary due to the efficiency of the power plant’s combustion. Riley said that a standardized emissions calculation doesn’t capture these variations, and “outliers can dramatically change the emission rate.”

Riley expects satellite monitoring will generate more accurate measurements of CO2 and methane pollution than inventory calculations, and satellites can fill in gaps in countries with no emissions reporting. This data will become more robust as more satellites are added to the fleet. Carbon Mapper plans to launch three new satellites by the end of next year, and Carbon Mapper is just one of several programs that are finding and mapping climate-warming pollution.

Coal plants are the largest CO2 super-emitters in the U.S.

In the U.S., the largest plumes of CO2 pollution are all coming from coal-burning power plants. In fact, the map of the country’s worst emitters looks exactly like a map of the places that still rely on coal to generate electricity.

It’s left them unsure when they’ll be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars they’re passing on to customers for each EV sale.","In just a few days, the federal tax credit for electric vehicles — which knocks several thousand dollars off the price of many new or used EVs for qualified buyers — will be history.

A few years ago, Democrats in Congress and former President Joe Biden expanded the credits. But the GOP tax and spending bill President Trump signed over the summer terminates them on September 30.

That’s caused a surge in EV sales over the past few months as consumers try to get in on the credits before they end. EV sales in the U.S. hit a record in August, according to Cox Automotive. But just as dealers try to handle the influx of buyers, many say they’re running into new hurdles from the IRS.

Dealers who specialize in EVs say business has been booming ever since the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July.

“July, August, September, have all been just tremendous months,” said John Foley, who runs Recharged, a dealership in Richmond, Virginia.

“I'm getting five times the normal traffic,” said Dan Eldoueihi, owner of 1A Auto Sales outside of Boston.

Jesse Lore, owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, New Hampshire, said August was his company’s “best month ever. We helped 69 families go electric in our communities.”

And Alex Lawrence, who owns EV Auto, a dealership with locations in Utah and Tennessee described the past few months as “a very steady stream of super busy.”

All of these dealers run companies that sell used electric vehicles, which were made eligible for a $4,000 federal tax credit under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, if they’re sold for under $25,000.

Ever since January of 2024, buyers have been able to claim that credit at the point of sale. So, instead of waiting until they file their taxes, a customer can apply the credit to the cost of the car upfront. Customers attest that they’re qualified for the credit, dealers input sale information into an online portal administered by the Internal Revenue Service, and the federal government sends the funds straight to the dealer.

Scott Case, the CEO of Recurrent, a company that keeps track of the EV market and works with hundreds of dealers around the country, said until recently, this system worked pretty seamlessly.

“The dealer makes the sale, uploads the information into the IRS portal, and within a couple of days, they get paid out from Treasury,” Case said.

But in mid-September, Case and all four dealers quoted in this story said that process changed without warning.

First, the IRS portal suddenly required new information for each sale, including a photo of each vehicle’s proof of purchase document held up next to its vehicle identification number in the car’s door jamb.

“You kind of have to do it in a proof-of-life-style picture,” Case explained.

Then, dealers said, the IRS began marking every sale they submitted as “pending.”

“Rather than getting accepted and processed and then paid out in a timely way, they're all getting, sort of like by default, shifted into this pending status,” Case said.

After previously receiving nearly immediate approvals through the IRS portal and payments within days, dealers were surprised by this change. It’s left them unsure when they’ll be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars they’re passing on to customers for each EV sale. Some fear they might not see the money for months — or at all. And they’re frustrated.

“We're being asked to do all these things during the last two weeks of the credit when it's going to be the craziest and the busiest,” said Alex Lawrence at EV Auto. “What a horrible time to change your process.”

An IRS spokesperson reached by “Marketplace” did not provide comment after multiple requests.

In August, the IRS published an FAQ stating that EVs “acquired” by September 30 will be eligible for the tax credits, meaning a buyer doesn’t necessarily need to have the vehicle in their possession, but must have submitted a payment and have a written binding contract by the end of the month to claim the credit.

Dealers are now weighing just how many more tax credit-eligible cars they’re willing to sell.

“I'm pretty sure I'll get reimbursed, but how long it takes — that's the question,” said Dan Eldoueihi of 1A Auto Sales. He plans to cut off sales when the IRS owes him $100,000 worth of tax credits. As of Monday, he said he had four cars to go to hit that number.

“It's our livelihood too,” he said. “So, if there's $100,000 I have to chase for six months, I mean, that's not easy for anyone.”

If the tax credit payments don’t come through soon, Jesse Lore at GreenWave Electric is worried about a cash crunch.

“$4,000 is a lot of money,” he said “It is higher, larger than the profit margin that we make on any one of these vehicles.”

Lore said he buys his inventory of used EVs using a line of credit which he has to repay every time he sells a car. But if that federal money doesn’t come through, “It goes from being a sale that helps us continue our work and our mission to a sale that costs us money to complete.”

Meanwhile, John Foley of Recharged plans to sell as many cars as he can in the tax credit’s final days.

“Is it frustrating that I'm going to have to rely on the IRS to make good on all of this? Yes. But I think that's just a risk I'm willing to take,” he said.

In part, because he thinks his business will keep thriving after September 30. All of the new EVs sold over the past few years, he said, mean the supply of used EVs will stay strong. He thinks demand will hold up well too.",https://img.apmcdn.org/d00526febdafc2899d1664cb79da252b387616ed/widescreen/68df47-20250923-cars-on-display-at-an-outdoor-dealership-2000.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:32.356664

King Rails, rare in North Carolina, have returned to nest in the restored marshes.
""Eastern North Carolina has incredible potential with large tracts under single ownership,"" emphasizes Lucas.
Since 1992, North Carolina has enrolled 54,800 acres in the WRE program, with 50,000 acres fully restored.","Morning mist rises off 6,000 acres of restored wetlands at North River Wetland Preserve in eastern Carteret County, one of the largest wetland restoration projects in the nation. This massive transformation from farmland back to forested, freshwater, and tidal wetlands demonstrates how partnerships between the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the North Carolina Coastal Federation, and multiple agencies can achieve landscape-scale conservation.

The project exemplifies how federal programs, state funding, and local expertise combine to create lasting environmental and economic benefits. Central to this success is the collaboration between conservation leaders like Bill Edwards, NRCS Wetlands Reserve Easement Manager for North Carolina, whose decades of experience have shaped the state's approach to wetland restoration, and Todd Miller, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Federation.

""Bill's enthusiasm is contagious when you see what's possible,"" says Josselyn Lucas, Working Lands for Wildlife Coordinator at the University of Georgia's River Basin Institute, after touring one of the partnership's restored wetlands in eastern N.C. ""Complete hydrology restoration, invasive species control, freshwater and saltwater improvements, living shorelines. They're using every tool. The site is a model of cross-cutting strategies and multi-stakeholder collaboration, integrating a broad suite of practices into a cohesive project that benefits both the landowner and the ecosystem.""

North River: Partnership at Scale

The North River Wetland Preserve represents unprecedented collaboration. Starting in 1999, the North Carolina Coastal Federation worked with the N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund, NRCS, various agencies, volunteers, and members to restore 6,000 acres of farmland to its original wetland state.

The N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund, established by the state legislature in 1996, provides funding to protect and restore water quality throughout North Carolina. This state program complemented federal conservation efforts, particularly through NRCS's Wetlands Reserve Easement (WRE) program, which offers landowners financial incentives to restore and protect wetlands while maintaining ownership of their property.

""For years, we were working with piecemeal funding, acquiring tracts here and there,"" explains Bree Charron, PE, Water Quality Program Director at the North Carolina Coastal Federation. ""Then WRE came along and allowed us to roll these pieces together into something much larger and more impactful.""

The primary goal was to improve water quality in degraded downstream estuaries and reopen waters for shellfishing. The recreated wetlands now retain, filter, and naturally treat agricultural runoff from upstream farmland. They're restoring watershed hydrology, trapping sediments, converting nutrients, and preventing pollutants from reaching coastal waters.

""The partnership between NRCS and the Coastal Federation brings all programs into one seamless process,"" Lucas observes. ""Bill Edwards at NRCS and Todd Miller at the Coastal Federation bring decades of experience. It's special but easily replicable.""

The ecological response confirms the success of this approach. King Rails, rare in North Carolina, have returned to nest in the restored marshes. Pintail and black duck populations have soared. The diversity extends beyond game species, with remarkable butterfly populations and wading birds that attract researchers from across the nation.

Lux Farm: Landowner-Driven Innovation

While North River demonstrates large-scale restoration, the Lux Farm project in Hyde County illustrates how partnerships enable individual landowners to transform marginal lands while maintaining profitable agricultural operations.

Here, NRCS collaborated with the Coastal Federation, drainage associations, and neighboring producers to address a complex challenge: maintaining necessary agricultural drainage while reducing nutrient runoff that affects downstream oyster beds.

""We redesigned entire water flow patterns,"" explains Edwards. ""Working with drainage associations, we moved pump stations and outfalls to route water through restored wetlands that naturally filter nutrients before reaching sensitive waters.""

For participating landowners, WRE provides compelling benefits. ""Landowners maintain ownership and access to their property while receiving direct payment for permanent conservation easements,"" emphasizes Charron. ""NRCS covers the full cost of restoration work."" This approach keeps productive farmland in production while transforming marginal, flood-prone areas into wetlands that generate income from hunting leases. The restored areas provide flood control for neighboring properties and filter nutrients that previously damaged downstream fisheries.

Multiplying Impact Through Program Integration

Both projects illustrate how integrating multiple NRCS programs amplifies conservation benefits. WRE provides the foundation with easement payments and restoration funding for private landowners. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) supports ongoing management, including the control of invasive species and the maintenance of water control structures. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) enables landscape-scale improvements, evidenced by the $16.8 million investment in the Lake Mattamuskeet watershed.

""We're combining WRE easements with EQIP practices for water control structures, dikes for freshwater management, and living shorelines,"" explains Lucas. ""These aren't exotic techniques. They're bread and butter conservation practices that work across many aquatic landscapes.""

Technical innovations stretch funding further. NRCS pioneered the incorporation of 22-mil landfill liners into dike cores, thereby reducing excavation costs. Natural seed banks eliminate replanting expenses. Water control structures enable seasonal management without costly pumping systems.

""We design management plans around producer objectives,"" notes Edwards. ""Our technical assistance ensures you achieve your goals while meeting conservation standards. It's your land, your vision, our support.""

Scaling Success Through Collaboration

North River and Lux Farm demonstrate how different partnership models deliver results:

Large-scale restoration by conservation organizations achieves watershed-level impacts by aggregating multiple properties into contiguous conservation areas, maximizing ecological benefits while simplifying management.

Individual landowner participation through WRE enables farmers to convert marginal lands to conservation use while maintaining profitable operations on their best agricultural acres, creating win-win scenarios for production and conservation.

Collaborative watershed management through drainage associations balances agricultural needs with environmental protection by coordinating water management across property boundaries, ensuring both farming viability and downstream water quality.

Each approach serves specific needs while contributing to landscape-scale conservation.

""Eastern North Carolina has incredible potential with large tracts under single ownership,"" emphasizes Lucas. ""The shared vision among NRCS, FSA, conservation districts, and partners makes landscape-scale conservation possible while serving individual producer needs. All of this is scalable.""

Since 1992, North Carolina has enrolled 54,800 acres in the WRE program, with 50,000 acres fully restored. Current funding of $1.5 million annually supports the acquisition of approximately 500 acres of new easements per year. Edwards estimates $5-10 million would allow the program to meet current landowner interest.

""Start at your local NRCS Service Center and connect with the WRE manager,"" advises Edwards to interested producers. ""Be patient. The program is competitive because it's so popular. But for those who qualify, it's truly transformative.""

The success at North River and Lux Farm proves that strategic partnerships achieve what no single entity could accomplish alone. Water quality improves. Wildlife thrives. Shellfishing waters reopen. Landowners profit from marginal lands. Communities prosper.

As these North Carolina projects demonstrate, when federal programs, state resources, local knowledge, and landowner commitment align, the results ripple across entire watersheds, proving that conservation at scale isn't just possible, it's already happening.

Nvidia announced Monday that it plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would give the ChatGPT maker a major leg up in the AI race — access to 10 gigawatts worth of the high-powered GPUs it needs to satisfy its mushrooming growth strategy.

What the deal can't guarantee — and what neither company mentioned — is how OpenAI will access the enormous amount of electricity needed to fire up those chips.

""It is a huge hurdle to get access to power,"" said Benjamin Hertz-Shargel, head grid expert at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Monday's deal announcement, he added, is ""a far cry"" from a finished data center.

The deal, which the companies committed to in a letter of intent, highlights a growing constraint of the AI race: Access to electricity. The US power grid is already strained by an explosion of data center construction. Adding another 10 gigawatts of demand would amount to adding a power load nearly equivalent to New York City at its summer peak.

""Nationally, utilities are reporting the need for about 60 gigawatts of new power — six large cities' worth — to serve new data centers by the end of the decade,"" said Rob Gramlich, an energy policy consultant and founder of Grid Strategies.

OpenAI declined to comment for this story, but its deal with Nvidia underscores the physical and financial challenges required to develop and commercialize AI. Beyond cutting-edge software, leaders must have access to chips, data centers, and the electricity needed to power that infrastructure.

""Infrastructure is critical to everything we do,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a joint interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on CNBC on Monday. ""Without doing this, we can't deliver the services people want.""

The 'silent bottleneck'

Limited access to power amid rampant data center growth is ""the silent bottleneck"" slowing the pace of Big Tech's ambitions for AI, said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology.

Data centers access electricity the same way everyone else does — by connecting to the power grid through public utility companies and paying them for service. However, connecting to the power grid can come with a slew of regulatory and financial hurdles that are only increasing as utilities struggle to keep up with skyrocketing demand.

The surge in new service requests from data centers is so unprecedented that it has overwhelmed the country's major utilities and sparked a mad dash to build new infrastructure — a complex process that requires years of planning and regulatory approval.

As more data centers line up to connect, new development is being curbed. Commercial real estate services firm CBRE said that roughly 5.2 gigawatts of new data centers were underway in prime US markets in the first half of 2025, a 17.5% decline in the industry's construction pipeline from the same period a year prior, and that the limiting factor was power to light them up.

An additional 10 gigawatts of new demand adds even more pressure to an already strained system — and it represents only a slice of the electricity OpenAI will ultimately need to power its AI plans.

In July, OpenAI and Oracle announced they'd finalized plans to develop 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity, including a site in Abilene, Texas, that was announced in January as part of Stargate, a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank.

Nvidia declined to comment on whether an official contract had been signed, but a spokesperson for the company said that the 10 gigawatts of demand announced Monday is new and is not accounted for in any of OpenAI's previously announced plans.

While the media focuses on stock market fluctuations and the inner workings of tech companies, ""the industry is worried about power,"" said Gastwirth.

Big Tech needs to 'get creative'

It's against this backdrop that access to electricity is gaining in value. One of the year's largest merger and acquisition deals in the data center sector has been imperiled because shareholders believe the takeover target is worth more, in part because of its access to power.

The US power grid, as it stands today, was built in the 1950s and 1960s. It was due for major upgrades before the data center development boom, but the AI race has made new power plants and power lines — and a lot of them — a more urgent necessity. The US Department of Energy has warned that the number of blackouts in the US could increase by 100 in 2030 if new power infrastructure is not built.

Some data center operators have taken matters into their own hands, bypassing public utilities and going ""off grid"" to build their own on-site power plants. The first Stargate site in Abilene has done this with on-site natural gas turbines. Elon Musk has been powering his xAI data center in Memphis with natural gas generators for months, drawing ire from environmental and community activists who say they are a risk to air quality and public health.

The tech industry will have to ""get creative"" to solve the power problem, Gastwirth said. ""This is going to become a bigger and bigger issue as each year progresses.""

Big Tech companies have significantly ramped up investment in the energy sector, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into emerging technologies like hydrogen fuel cells and nuclear fusion. Amazon and Microsoft have signed deals to buy electricity from major industrial nuclear plants. Altman himself is a major investor in Oklo, a small modular reactor company that has, despite its pending regulatory approval, has already signed deals to power data centers.

Despite the current challenges in accessing power, experts largely see OpenAI's deal with Nvidia as a smart strategic move, cementing the status of both companies as AI's leading players.

Sean Farney, executive director of data center strategy and innovation and Jones Lang Lasalle, said that Nvidia is the ""lead horse"" in the development of cutting-edge AI processors and that OpenAI's deal to secure that equipment was ""brilliant.""

""It's the two leaders getting together to ensure that they will continue to be the leaders,"" Farney said.

The power problem, said Farney, will work itself out.

""They will find or self-source the power to make this happen. There's too much interest and dollar signs on this deal,"" he said.",https://i.insider.com/68d1ab4e57d362d375e8a3e7?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:12.668639

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

People who want cleaner air have criticized Trump for going after car pollution rules.
The EPA said under Biden that the rules car companies now want to change would cut carbon dioxide by about 7 billion metric tons over the program’s lifetime.
Automakers face tough decisions Automakers have dealt with big changes in environmental rules every time a new president comes in.
Used electric car sales jumped 59% in the same period, according to Cox Automotive.","Automakers across America are asking the Trump administration to roll back tough pollution rules that force them to make more electric cars, saying the targets set by the previous president are impossible to meet.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation filed papers on Monday telling regulators that emission standards for cars made between 2027 and 2032 “are simply not achievable.” The group speaks for almost every big car company in the country, including General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., and Volkswagen AG.

The automakers say the rules put in place under President Joe Biden were based on wrong guesses about how fast people would start buying electric cars. They point to slow sales, not enough charging stations, and high prices as major problems.

“Growth in consumer demand for EVs has stalled, and changes in government policy are expected to further depress EV market potential,” the Alliance said in their filing.

The pushback comes as the US Environmental Protection Agency thinks about getting rid of a key legal rule. This rule says that gases from cars and other sources hurt public health. Without this rule, the federal government would lose its main legal reason for making strict pollution limits, including those for cars.

President Donald Trump has been cutting support for electric vehicles since taking office. Earlier this year, Trump signed a law that stopped California from making its own rules about car pollution. His big tax and spending bill also ends the $7,500 tax break that people get when they buy new electric cars. That tax credit goes away on Sept. 30.

People who want cleaner air have criticized Trump for going after car pollution rules. Cars are one of the biggest sources of gases that warm the planet. The EPA said under Biden that the rules car companies now want to change would cut carbon dioxide by about 7 billion metric tons over the program’s lifetime. That’s more than the whole United States puts out in one year. The rules would also save drivers about $6,000 on average in gas and repair costs.

Automakers face tough decisions

Automakers have dealt with big changes in environmental rules every time a new president comes in. These changes affect billions of dollars in business plans. The Alliance wants the EPA to replace the current rules with standards that automakers can actually meet.

Meanwhile, people are rushing to buy electric vehicles before the federal tax credits disappear next week. The tax breaks – $7,500 for new cars and $4,000 for used ones – started in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is ending these credits along with other clean energy tax breaks over the next few months.

With one week left before the tax credits end, customers are crowding into car lots to get the deals. Electric vehicle sales hit a record high in August. New electric vehicle sales went up 17.7% compared to the same time last year. Used electric car sales jumped 59% in the same period, according to Cox Automotive.

“As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August’s elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,” Cox Automotive said.

Cars Commerce, which owns Cars.com, found similar trends. Their data shows a 33% jump in demand for electric vehicles since last year as shoppers hurry to use the tax credits. The company also found that used electric vehicles stay on dealer lots for 46 days on average, almost 30% less than last year. This shows more people want used electric cars.

Car dealers want to clear out their electric vehicle stock before new models arrive in November. They’re offering their own deals, including monthly lease payments as low as 1% of the car’s full price.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Automakers-1.webp,N,,2025-09-23 19:02:32.308737

These entities must redirect their food waste from landfills to sustainable solutions such as food recovery services, composting, and anaerobic digestion – turning organic waste into renewable energy.
""These results illustrate how our food waste ban is protecting the environment while helping businesses,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple.
""The food waste ban is a critical piece of our strategy to reduce waste.
As more businesses engage with food collection programs, awareness about food waste issues continues to grow, promoting initiatives for food rescue, donation, and waste prevention.","BOSTON — A recent report quantifies the substantial economic impact of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s (MassDEP) ban on commercial food waste disposal. This initiative is a significant contributor to the state’s economy, generating jobs and revenue.

Key report findings include:

Creating 1,676 well-paying jobs, resulting in $143 million in labor income;

Generating $194 million in economic value (in addition to the labor income and intermediate inputs); and

Cumulatively generating more than $390 million in industry activity.

""Massachusetts is a leader in reducing food waste,"" said Governor Maura Healey. ""Our state’s businesses and institutions have stepped up to innovate and reduce their waste, and this report shows that the long-term impacts are positive. Finding an alternative to throwing away good food is a boost for our communities, our economy, and our environment.""

""This report reaffirms our commitment to reduce, reuse, and recycle here in Massachusetts,"" said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. ""Massachusetts has created the necessary infrastructure to ensure good, healthy food does not go to waste. For our cities and towns, this means getting food to those who need it first and foremost. It means jobs for our residents, and it conserves resources and supports local budgets.""

The disposal ban targets businesses and institutions that produce over half a ton of food waste weekly, including supermarkets, colleges, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants, and food service providers. These entities must redirect their food waste from landfills to sustainable solutions such as food recovery services, composting, and anaerobic digestion – turning organic waste into renewable energy.

The number of facilities participating in food waste services has notably increased from 1,350 in 2014 to an estimated 4,150 by 2024. This growth has stimulated economic activity in related sectors, benefiting communities across the state.

""This report confirms what we’ve long known that banning food waste is not just an environmental win but also an economic one,"" said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. ""By reducing waste, creating jobs, and lowering costs, this policy helps build stronger communities and a more resilient economy.""

""These results illustrate how our food waste ban is protecting the environment while helping businesses,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. ""The food waste ban is a critical piece of our strategy to reduce waste. But it does so much more. The program lowers disposal costs, reduces methane emissions, creates clean energy, produces nutrient-rich fertilizer for our farms, supports jobs, strengthens the economy, and helps get good food to people in need. We’re proud of this success and excited to build on it.""

As more businesses engage with food collection programs, awareness about food waste issues continues to grow, promoting initiatives for food rescue, donation, and waste prevention. Additionally, MassDEP funds RecyclingWorks in Massachusetts, which is a resource for businesses providing free technical assistance and online resources to support their recycling and diversion efforts. RecyclingWorks has helped divert more than 325,000 tons of material from disposal since 2013. For more information on RecyclingWorks, visit their website.

This mirrors what’s happened in other markets when EVs have gotten cheaper than gas vehicles.
Generous government programs in Norway made electric cars too good to resist, propelling the country’s EV sales share to nearly 90% in 2024.
In 2018, just 10% of electric cars sold in the country were cheaper than their ICE equivalents, according to the International Energy Agency.
In large part, surveys show, this is because Americans simply can’t afford electric cars.","Price parity between electric and combustion vehicles has launched electric-vehicle sales into the stratosphere in the few markets that have reached that elusive milestone. The logic is simple: Electric cars may be cleaner, cheaper to refuel and punchier from a stop than gas vehicles, but none of that carries much weight for a buyer who can't afford one in the first place.

Show consumers that EVs cost the same or less up front, though, and mass adoption can really take off.

Oddly enough, that critical turning point happened this summer in the U.S. during a time of massive uncertainty for the country’s clean-car industry. But don’t expect the trend to last.

In both July and August, the average transaction price for an EV dipped below that of a combustion-powered vehicle, according to data from JD Power shared with InsideEVs.

Last month, the average new EV cost an estimated $44,908, about $600 less than the $45,521 going rate for gas vehicles. In January 2023, before Tesla went on a price-cutting spree, the average EV cost roughly $62,500, some $16,000 more than a gas vehicle, according to JD Power's data

Today's $600 gap may be small, but it's an enormous shift when you consider the huge premium EVs have historically demanded. High battery costs, limited economies of scale for manufacturers and a focus on luxury models have kept EV prices stubbornly high in the U.S., limiting their appeal among mainstream buyers.

“It is fairly recent and rare that we're actually seeing EV transaction prices fall below ICE,” Tyson Jominy, the firm’s senior vice president of data and analytics, told InsideEVs, using the industry lingo for vehicles with internal combustion engines.

The Clock Starts Ticking

It’s no coincidence that July and August were the two months immediately following the passage of the Republicans’ sweeping policy agenda, which started running the clock on great EV deals.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act set a Sept. 30 expiration date for the EV tax credits that have been supporting sales of cleaner cars for years. Now, amid a mad scramble to sell down EV inventory before the rug gets yanked out, manufacturers have been lathering on incentives to help move cars off of dealer lots, Jominy said.

“Once we hit October, the clock strikes midnight on Oct. 1, a lot of these EVs turn into pumpkins, and they become a lot more difficult to sell,” he said.

Combine that pile of cash on the hood with an EV tax credit worth up to $7,500 and you’re left with EVs that—for a short window, at least—are cheaper to buy than conventional cars.

“You put those two together, and the deals that can be found on EVs are pretty tremendous,” Jominy said.

In August, the average manufacturer incentive spend per EV hit nearly $7,500 (compared to around $2,500 for combustion cars), JD Power said. The firm put the average discount from the EV tax credit at around $5,000, a figure that has also grown lately.

Through something of a loophole, all EV leases can benefit from the entire $7,500 credit. For EVs purchased outright, however, rules surrounding assembly location, battery sourcing and personal income mean that only a fraction of models qualify. As a result, since the latest tax credit policy took effect in 2022, EV leasing has exploded, hitting 70% of EV transactions in July.

Federally funded discounts have risen in parallel. JD Power estimates that consumers buying or leasing a new EV saved $5,124 thanks to the federal tax credit in 2024, up from $4,302 in 2023 and $1,629 in 2022.

'Back To Gas'? Not So Fast

Why not just cut EV production and supply, rather than flooding the market with cars and dumping on incentives? That will happen down the line—we’ve already seen numerous companies cut back production plans or new models due to slowing demand growth—but it’s not that simple. Automakers have long-term commitments with suppliers, and they can’t just change production on a dime, Jominy explained.

“It's more like trying to pull a U-turn in an aircraft carrier,” he said. “A lot of these EV plans were set in stone before the legislation changed.”

The hefty discounts—plus a tax credit-fueled buying frenzy—have created a booming EV market. In August, the electric share of U.S. vehicle sales hit a record high of 9.9%, according to Cox Automotive.

This mirrors what’s happened in other markets when EVs have gotten cheaper than gas vehicles. Generous government programs in Norway made electric cars too good to resist, propelling the country’s EV sales share to nearly 90% in 2024. China, by far the global leader in both EV sales and production, is another prime example.

In 2018, just 10% of electric cars sold in the country were cheaper than their ICE equivalents, according to the International Energy Agency. By 2024, that proportion rose to two-thirds. As costs plummeted, annual EV sales in China grew eightfold during that six year period, from 800,000 units to 6.4 million.

Compare that to what’s happening in the U.S. In 2024, just one in five electric SUVs and pickup trucks was sold at a lower price than the average gas-powered equivalent, the IEA says. And just two electric models were priced below $30,000, compared with 50 options in the combustion segment. One culprit, according to the research firm BloombergNEF, is America's obsession with large trucks and lots of driving range. Both require big battery packs that drive up costs.

Battery-powered vehicle sales have skyrocketed over the last several years in the U.S., but the pace of growth has slowed notably. In large part, surveys show, this is because Americans simply can’t afford electric cars.

Between steadily falling battery costs and the gradual introduction of lower-cost options like the new Nissan Leaf and upcoming Slate truck, the U.S. EV market is bound to hit price parity with gas vehicles someday. But this summer’s pricing was likely more of a blip than a milestone.

With various tailpipe emissions regulations weakened or eliminated by the new Republican administration, automakers are already under far less pressure to sell cleaner cars. Soon, the EV tax credits will stop being a factor too. Over time, automakers will dial back supply, likely leading to lower incentives. Without the carrots and sticks prodding car buyers and sellers to move in a zero-emission direction, it will take longer for car companies to build the scale they need to sell electric models profitably.

JD Power expects that EV prices will rise above ICE prices again next year, and that electric sales won’t go anywhere fast in the near term.

“In the short term, EVs will probably, at best, go sideways,” Jominy said. “But over the long term, we are still optimistic about EVs. We do not believe that this is the end.”",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbMYMQ/s1/tesla-model-y.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:02:37.434374

And the agency may be moving in the same direction with a finalized PFAS drinking water limit rule (details below).
The move to defend the Biden-era Superfund regulation came as a surprise, as the new administration has loosened PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
The settlement adds to $13.7 billion that DuPont and 3M have paid specifically to impacted municipal drinking water systems.
They say companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams.","Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has upheld a Biden administration rule designating two PFAS—PFOA and PFOS—as hazardous substances. The Superfund law, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), requires manufacturers and other generators to report the release of these toxic chemicals; authorizes EPA to initiate cleanup projects; and holds generators accountable for remediation costs. The law also allows parties to seek reimbursement for cleanups.

While the rule was finalized in April 2024, its fate has been in question, especially lately, as the new administration has loosened a slew of regulations around various toxic chemicals. And the agency may be moving in the same direction with a finalized PFAS drinking water limit rule (details below).

But uncertainty, specifically around Superfund details, began before the administrative shift, triggered by a lawsuit brought by the National Waste & Recycling Association and other industry groups. At the root of their concerns is that the rule’s language does not ensure waste managers are exempt from liability when PFOA and PFOS ultimately end up at their sites.

The EPA stated it does not intend to pursue these “passive receivers”—namely, landfills, water treatment plants, and airports that deal with the waste but do not produce it. But as written, the policy could be reversed. And it does not prevent third-party lawsuits.

In a statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the Trump administration will seek a balance between holding polluters accountable and not unduly burdening passive receivers. But striking that balance is a challenge yet to be contended with.

“EPA intends to do what we can based on our existing authority, but we will need new statutory language from Congress to fully address our concerns with passive receiver liability,” Zeldin said.

Some provisions yet to be worked out are the criteria for determining who will be protected from liability, the scope of those protections, and other details to prevent unintended consequences and costs of the regulations.

The move to defend the Biden-era Superfund regulation came as a surprise, as the new administration has loosened PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. And Trump’s EPA has pushed back deadlines, holding manufacturers and other industrial generators responsible for what they produce.

While the agency says it will ultimately uphold drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, it has rescinded regulation of four other PFAS: GenX, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFNA.

And now some conservatives in Congress have proposed to delay a ban on PFAS-laden firefighting foam that was to take effect in 2026, cut cleanup funding, and reverse a rule prohibiting incinerating the foam. Research shows incineration does not destroy the chemicals and can release PFAS and toxic byproducts into the air.

By June 2024, the Department of Defense (DoD) had found most of its 718 installations potentially released PFAS, mainly from firefighting foam. In some cases, it has been detected in drinking water at three times to over 15 times the maximum contaminant level of 4 parts per trillion set by the EPA.

The use of PFAS in firefighting foam was originally to end by 2024, but new legislation would reportedly push that deadline to 2028.

Nationwide, these “forever chemicals” linked to cancers, infertility, compromised immunity, and other health issues are found in about 45 percent of the population’s tap water.

Some states are not waiting for federal laws to kick in. Many of them are advancing their own PFAS regulations, particularly targeting biosolid use and wastewater discharges.

Maine was the first to prohibit land application of sludge generated by wastewater treatment plants. Since then, Connecticut, Michigan, and New York have imposed laws of their own targeting PFAS-laden biosolids, as have Virginia and Maryland, which require some operators to test for PFAS before discharging wastewater or biosolids. And in New Hampshire, wastewater treatment plants can require dischargers to test for PFAS.

About 10 states have set their own maximum drinking water level limitations.

Meanwhile, states, water utilities, and ultimately ratepayers have footed cleanup costs. And some of them are going after the producers to recoup those costs.

In August 2025, New Jersey was awarded just over $2 billion to clean up PFAS leaking from four of DuPont’s industrial sites.

DuPont and two of its spinoff companies will pay $1.2 billion to remediate the four sites. Another $875 million will go into a state fund earmarked to restore natural resources and for abatement projects, including to treat PFAS-contaminated drinking water.

The settlement adds to $13.7 billion that DuPont and 3M have paid specifically to impacted municipal drinking water systems.

States, as well as municipalities and public water systems in Pennsylvania, Washington State, New York, New Mexico, and Colorado, have also been awarded compensation from chemical companies for damage from PFAS.

As pending enforcements loom, both generators and passive receivers are on alert for what is to come, as tackling these forever chemicals will be an astronomically expensive endeavor. The EPA forecasted the nationwide compliance costs at around $1.5 billion annually—that’s between investments in new treatment technology, operator training, and consulting fees.

For now, attorneys at Alston & Bird advise that companies and stakeholders follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels.

They say companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams.

According to a new report by the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab (NZIPL), since 2022 alone, overseas investments by Chinese firms have surged past $220 billion.

These investments have spanned across 54 countries and include sectors such as batteries, solar, wind, new energy vehicles (NEV) and green hydrogen. The scale of investments has surpassed the US Marshall Plan ($200 billion in current 2024 dollars) and, importantly, is strategically positioning the Global South within the global energy transition — with 75 per cent of these projects being located in emerging markets.

This analysis is based on the China Low Carbon Technology foreign direct investment (FDI) database, which catalogues 461 projects from 2011 to mid-2025. The database is hosted by NZIPL at Johns Hopkins University and the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, and will be incorporated into a broader Global Low Carbon Technology FDI database in the coming year.

Unprecedented pace & scale

The report points towards a dramatic rise in Chinese overseas green technology investments beginning in 2022. Over 80 per cent of the total 461 projects tracked by the database were launched after 2022, accounting for over $210 billion — or 88 per cent of all pledged capital. A record 165 projects were announced in 2024 alone.

Further, there has been a rise of megaprojects, with over 60 ventures exceeding $1 billion each in committed investment. This indicates a move toward establishing deep-rooted, long-term and large-scale industrial assets of energy transition technologies in host countries. The report suggests that these megaprojects are likely to exert increasing economic, industrial and environmental impacts on local development.

The investment strategy has evolved from its initial solar-focused approach to encompass the entire clean technology value chain. Battery materials manufacturing now represents the single largest investment category, with commitments exceeding $62 billion, underscoring China’s strategic priority to secure upstream supply chain control. These investments have been largely concentrated in Southeast Asia, but Chinese firms are also moving upstream in Latin America’s Lithium Triangle (Chile, Bolivia and Argentina).

Other prominent sectors include battery manufacturing, where investments crossed $49 billion and are heavily concentrated in Europe, solar manufacturing with a portfolio of $57 billion spanning across 135 projects, and green hydrogen where investments reached $27 billion (with an average project size of around $2 billion) and were anchored in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

Both, EV manufacturing and wind projects show a balanced spread across geographies but exclude the United States, reflecting a cautionary strategy due to trade disruptions.

The report categorises China’s investments motivations into three categories:

• Access to raw material inputs: Indonesia's nickel reserves have made it the top location for battery material processing.

• Access to host countries’ markets: Hungary attracts downstream battery production investments, reflecting its role as a key battery manufacturer in Europe.

• Access to third country markets: Morocco has emerged as a major investment hotspot, leveraging its duty-free access to the European Union market, while Southeast Asia benefits from its re-export hub status.

Evolving strategies & future implications

The initial rapid pace of investments is now giving way to more nuanced strategies as companies navigate an increasingly complex global environment. The data suggests a downward trend in new projects — with 68 projects announced in the first half of 2025, pointing towards a phase of consolidation and recalibration.

Geopolitical concerns, particularly trade barriers and the threat of secondary sanctions, are actively reshaping investment flows. In response, a growing number of firms are pivoting towards ‘light-asset’ strategies, opting for technology licensing, contract manufacturing, and Original Equipment Manufacturer partnerships. This allows companies to safeguard their market access while limiting the fixed-asset exposure. As a result, headline construction numbers may falter even as commercial engagement expands.

For host governments, such heavy investment flows represent a major opportunity to attract green capital. However, according to the report, this will require providing tailored incentives to firms, leveraging resource endowments to anchor themselves in Chinese supply chains, and planning for the scale of infrastructure necessary to keep pace with large investments. International partners, too, will need to understand the dynamics of China’s outward manufacturing drive in order to respond with adequate trade policies, supply-chain resilience programmes and climate finance initiatives.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-23%2F2vtuhj52%2FChina-capital-Global-South-clean-tech?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-23 20:59:18.449668

Sila expects to employ up to 500 people in Moses Lake when it ramps up to full capacity.","Battery materials startup Sila is starting operations today at its automotive-scale manufacturing facility, located in Moses Lake, Wash.

The plant is producing a silicon-carbon anode material that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries like those used to power electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer devices. Batteries using Sila’s Titan Silicon can hold 20% more energy than traditional batteries.

The new plant measures 600,000 square-feet and is situated on a 160-acre site in the arid, Eastern Washington location.

Sila’s operations will start at a relatively modest capacity, producing enough anode material for 2 to 5 gigawatt hours of battery capacity. Depending on how much of the graphite is replaced by Sila’s product, that initial volume is enough to power tens of thousands of EVs or millions of mobile devices.

The plan is to scale to 250 gigawatt hours of material by the end of the decade, which would make the Sila plant the largest anode production facility in the world, the company said. Sila has shared news of partnerships with Mercedes-Benz and Panasonic, and expects to start shipping material to customers as soon as next year.

The opening of the site comes at a time when the U.S. clean energy sector is battling economic headwinds as the Trump administration has canceled funding and initiatives supporting many climate-related projects.

The Biden administration created programs to bolster domestic battery production to compete with China, who is the global lead in manufacturing the energy cells. Sila won a $100 million U.S. Department of Energy grant in 2022 as part of that effort.

“This is not just about building a factory. It is about closing the gap between innovation and manufacturing in America,” said Gene Berdichevsky, Sila’s CEO and co-founder, in a statement.

“If we do not execute, innovation will flow to places that can,” he added. “We have to build here in the United States to create a self-sustaining innovation economy, ensuring that our advancements in next-generation battery technology, like silicon-carbon anodes, are not only conceived but also produced domestically at a global scale.”

The company broke ground in Moses Lake less than two years ago and last year raised $375 million to help fund the completion of the plant. Sila has netted more than $1.3 billion from investors. The company launched in 2011 and is based in Alameda, Calif. It has 400 employees, with 100 working at the manufacturing plant.

“This new facility is a prime example of the domestic innovation needed to end our dependency on foreign countries for advanced battery technology and produce high-quality, cutting-edge technologies that protect our supply chains here at home,” said U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., who represents Moses Lake.

Sila competitor Group14 Technologies is building nearby, but earlier this year laid off an undisclosed number of employees and delayed its manufacturing start date. Group14 this summer secured $463 million from investors.

California-based OneD Battery Sciences shuttered its pilot manufacturing facility in Moses Lake this past spring, and appears to have ceased all operations.

Other Pacific Northwest battery materials startups include Ecellix and Emerald Battery Labs, which are based in Seattle, and Oregon’s Skip Technologies and ZincFive.

The report comes a week before the three-year anniversary of the launch of Duke’s Climate Commitment. It’s the product of almost two years of discussions among students, faculty and staff, setting interim targets for growth across each of the Climate Commitment’s five pillars: education, research, sustainable operations, external engagement and community partnerships.

Toddi Steelman, vice president and vice provost for climate and sustainability, explained that the report is “anchor[ed]” by 2030 because the year represents a major deadline in the broader scientific community — a target set by the Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 43% to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Steelman added that the University set three-year targets because five years can feel like “a long way away,” especially when undergraduate students cycle every four years.

The report also reaffirms Duke’s Climate Commitment at a time when the path to achieving the University’s long-term climate plan remains in flux — and as climate action has largely fallen off the federal agenda.

“I would say the most common question I have these days is ‘what’s happened to the Climate Commitment?’” Steelman said. “And my reply is, ‘nothing’s happened to the Climate Commitment.’ We get to wake up every day and do this work, and there are a lot of peers and friends — university peers and friends — that are not going to be able to do this work.”

The Chronicle broke down several key takeaways from the report and its implications for climate work at Duke.

Working to lead the pack

Since assuming her position at the helm of the University’s Climate Commitment, Steelman has cemented her vision for Duke to become a global leader on climate action. That sentiment was a major throughline of the new report.

The report identifies climate policy, health and oceans as three fields of study where Duke already has “distinct advantages,” which Steelman said is largely aided by research teams across the health system, Marine Lab and schools like the Sanford School of Public Policy and Nicholas School of the Environment.

Duke also plans to leverage its alumni network as part of increasing investments in research on environmental and climate justice, community resilience and technology.

“We have literally an army of people who have gone on to do this kind of work who are very well situated to kind of help facilitate this societal and economic pivot that we know we need to make,” Steelman said.

As for tangible steps toward those goals, the report points to enhancing seed grant programs, developing a climate research inventory and dashboard, and supporting early-career faculty and researchers who can “bring new energy and perspectives” to emerging fields.

The University then hopes to display its work and become a model for other institutions. The report sets goals for Duke to participate in more national and international climate gatherings, such as Climate Week NYC, and to create a new “Climate Engagement Exchange” that would make opportunities for participation more accessible to students and faculty.

Long-term approach still in progress

After reaching carbon-neutral status for the first time last year, Duke reframed its strategy for making campus operations more sustainable around a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Although the new report outlines some general steps toward that target, the University’s broader approach remains somewhat unclear.

Per the report, Duke aims to develop and implement plans to reduce GHG emissions across three categories by 2028. First on the agenda are scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which come from direct campus operations and purchased electricity, respectively. Scope 3 emissions are trickier, since they come from activities along Duke’s supply chain that the University has less control over, like transportation and food procurement.

Duke is also including the health system in its 2050 goal, necessitating a separate plan to account for the system’s large physical footprint and different energy needs.

According to Steelman, Duke has hired consulting firm Buro Happold to help flesh out these strategies, but a couple new developments over recent months have complicated matters.

Administrative turnover has been a significant factor. Vice President for Facilities John Noonan stepped down last spring after 14 years in the role, and Steelman explained that ensuring his replacement, Thomas Morrison, is up to speed and involved in discussions about campus operations has been a top priority. A similar situation recently arose on the health system side after Craig Albanese, chief executive officer of the Duke University Health System, announced his Sept. 30 departure.

Meanwhile, Duke Energy — one of the largest utility companies in the United States and the source of much of the University and health system’s electricity — reversed course on its pledge to cut carbon emissions 70% by 2030 and delayed its deadline to develop a carbon neutrality plan. That means electricity used on campus will likely remain more carbon-intensive for longer.

“Our commitment to this 2050 net-zero plan hasn’t changed, but the dynamics are fierce,” Steelman said.

In the meantime, Duke is still determining whether to maintain its carbon-neutral status while it pursues net zero. An ad hoc committee of students and faculty was established last year to help decide whether the University should continue buying carbon offsets until it reaches its net-zero goal, or if those funds could be better used as investments in campus decarbonization efforts.

According to Steelman, the committee recently submitted its recommendation to Duke administrators, and it is now under review.

Adjusting to a new federal landscape

The report comes at a time when many federal incentives for climate action have disappeared, creating an uncertain backdrop for such work at Duke.

This summer, Congress rolled back a slate of tax incentives for clean energy development as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In the ensuing months, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to rescind the finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health and to stop requiring industrial facilities to track their greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the agency reportedly directed some of its employees to stop publishing scientific research.

Steelman noted that although the rollbacks have been “demoralizing,” they have pushed climate leaders at Duke to become more mindful about balancing “affordability, accessibility and sustainability goals” in their work. She affirmed that at Duke, the work will continue.

“Our president, our provost, our Board of Trustees continues to be highly supportive of the work that we’re doing,” Steelman said. “I think we have to do it in a little bit of a different way now than we did before, but it hasn’t dampened our enthusiasm.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dtc/c92c3b38-b566-42d9-9785-8cef02eaba2b.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&ar=16%3A9&crop=faces%2Cedges,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:18.320039

She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.","The race to replace coal in Indonesia, the world’s largest coal exporter, has become a contest between the U.S. and China. At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a new model

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

US gas could lock Indonesia into fossil fuels

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

Other top scorers included the 2025 Lucid Air Pure Sedan (runner-up Vehicle of the Year) with 372 miles of range and advanced hands-free driving, and the 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack Track Package bringing moody styling and performance flare.

Why does this matter right now?

The U.S. EV incentive landscape shifts sharply on September 30. For buyers, that deadline means tens of thousands in savings depend on whether a model qualifies. Vehicles like the IONIQ 9 that combine federal credit eligibility, practical range, and usable space are enormously advantaged.

Also, given growing concern over charging infrastructure, battery life, and family usability, this award shows what markets really want: not just style or zero emissions, but usable, comfortable, long-distance capability.

How does it compare to rivals?

Compared to the Lucid Air Pure, which scores range and refinement, the IONIQ 9 adds a dimension of versatility. The Dodge Charger Daytona EV is emotional and loud; the IONIQ 9 is commanding and composed. In hybrids and ICE, Toyota’s GR Corolla Premium Plus wins on spirited performance, Hyundai’s Santa Fe Hybrid Calligraphy AWD on family-friendly efficiency.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

For family haulers, long-distance travelers, EV early adopters, and buyers who demand premium touches without sacrificing day-to-day comfort, the IONIQ 9 will serve well. If you seek raw sound, lightweight track thrills, or a minimal footprint, other options may better suit.

Also, buyers sensitive to cost or those in areas with weak charging infrastructure may want to weigh whether the added luxury trims and range justify the price.

What is the long-term significance?

Hyundai’s dominance suggests the family EV formula is no longer optional; it’s essential. Long range, charger compatibility, and utility are becoming standard expectations, not extras. Manufacturers who fall short may find themselves playing catch-up.

At the same time, recognition for hybrids like the Santa Fe and ICE cars like the GR Corolla reminds us that the road to electrification will be varied. Diversity in powertrains isn’t merely transitional; it’s strategic.",https://www.cenlanow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2025/09/2025_Drive_Revolution_by_Doug_Berger-1661-e1758653960370.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:59.304532

Unless governments set boundaries, AI could accelerate energy demand beyond what grids and climate policies can bear.
Geopolitics of AI’s hunger The AI revolution is redrawing the global energy map.
What is clear is that the AI revolution cannot be separated from the energy revolution.","Artificial intelligence is hailed as the defining technology of the 21st century. Large language models, generative tools and conversational chatbots dominate the public imagination, promising to transform entire industries and daily life. However, behind this excitement lies a less glamorous truth: AI is hungry for electricity. Without abundant, reliable power, the much-heralded AI revolution risks stalling.

The numbers are stark. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global data centers consumed around 415 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, equal to 1.5% of total global use. The United States and China alone accounted for 70% of that demand, underscoring how AI power is already concentrated in a handful of geographies. By 2030, global data center demand could nearly double to 945 TWh, more than Japan’s current consumption. And unlike earlier waves of digitalization, AI workloads are the dominant driver of this surge. So at this point, the challenge is clear: how can states remain at the forefront of AI while meeting climate commitments and avoiding energy crises? That dilemma is fast becoming one of the central geopolitical questions of our time.

AI’s spiraling appetite

AI’s electricity needs dwarf those of traditional digital services. A single ChatGPT query can consume 10 times the energy of a Google search. Training a cutting-edge model can require megawatts of continuous power for weeks. In the U.S., data centers consumed 176 TWh in 2023, or 4.4% of national electricity, a figure projected to rise to 6-12% by 2028. China’s demand, growing 15% annually since 2015, has reached 100 TWh and now represents a quarter of the world’s total. Together with Europe, these giants account for roughly 85% of global consumption.

Of course, we must understand that this is not just about servers overheating in Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. It is about entire grids being reshaped. In Ireland, where hyperscale centers already use nearly a fifth of the country’s electricity, the country’s energy operator has restricted new data center connections. Similar concerns are emerging in the Netherlands, Singapore and even parts of the U.S. The question policymakers face is not whether AI will consume more power, because it will, but whether grids can adapt quickly enough without breaking climate pledges or raising public backlash over rising bills.

Search for power

Where will this electricity come from? For now, AI data centers draw from the same fossil-heavy grids that power the rest of the economy. Coal, oil and gas still make up more than 80% of primary energy worldwide. In the U.S. and Europe, this dependence is politically unsustainable. Both Washington and Brussels are pushing tech firms to sign long-term contracts for renewables. The EU’s Green Deal and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act are designed not only to decarbonise transport and industry but also to green the digital sector.

Elsewhere, however, the picture is different. China and India still rely on coal, but both are experimenting with nuclear expansion and record renewable deployment to match AI’s growth. The Gulf states are seizing the moment, tying digital investments directly to massive solar and nuclear projects. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), for instance, is marketing itself as a hub for ""green compute,” hoping to export AI services powered by clean electricity.

However, it is understandable that renewables alone cannot shoulder the burden. Wind and solar are cheap and fast to deploy but intermittent. The IEA expects natural gas generation to increase by 175 TWh by 2030 just to cover new data center demand, locking in fossil infrastructure at the very moment when it should be phased out. Furthermore, nuclear is being revived as a low-carbon baseload option. U.S. tech giants from Google to Amazon are already signing power purchase agreements with nuclear plants, while policymakers bet on small modular reactors to arrive by the early 2030s.

And then comes fusion. Long ridiculed as ""always decades away,” it is suddenly attracting billions. Google’s 2025 deals to back and eventually purchase fusion power signal a belief that AI will require entirely new energy paradigms. Furthermore, China is spending $1-1.5 billion annually on its fusion program. While commercialisation is far from certain, the mere fact that fusion is now on the agenda shows how AI is bending the energy imagination of states and companies alike.

Can AI solve its energy use?

There is a paradox: AI is not only an energy guzzler, but it could also be an energy saver. Advanced machine learning can forecast demand, balance renewable supply, and manage distributed storage far more efficiently than traditional systems. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI-enabled tools could cut global emissions by up to 10% by 2030, equal to the EU’s annual output. To provide a specific case, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company offers a glimpse: its AI-driven energy management saved $500 million and avoided emissions equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road.

But efficiency carries risks. Jevons’ Paradox, the idea that efficiency gains drive greater overall consumption, looms large. Cheaper, smarter computation encourages more of it. Unless governments set boundaries, AI could accelerate energy demand beyond what grids and climate policies can bear. This tension, between AI as both savior and stressor, lies at the heart of the policy debates lately.

Geopolitics of AI’s hunger

The AI revolution is redrawing the global energy map. The ability to train and deploy frontier models is no longer determined only by chips, data or talent. It increasingly depends on something more basic: who controls enough reliable electricity to run them. In this sense, AI has transformed energy security from a traditional question of keeping the lights on into a strategic question of sustaining digital dominance, and therefore into a national security issue.

China understands this better than most. Its AI strategy is inseparable from the state-led expansion of coal, nuclear and renewables. By securing electricity at scale, Beijing ensures that its firms can train the next generation of models without interruption, even if the grid faces wider strains. The U.S. is pursuing a distinctive strategy that intertwines digital industrial growth with its broader decarbonization agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act delivers substantial incentives, such as grants, tax credits and loans, to stimulate clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing. Meanwhile, the CHIPS & Science Act provides targeted subsidies and tax credits to secure semiconductor and AI hardware production on U.S. territory. Together, these policies aim to anchor digital and high-tech growth within a domestic, low-carbon industrial base, although significant project delays some policy implementations have occurred.

The Gulf states are trying to leapfrog, branding themselves as providers of ""green compute” through solar megaprojects and nuclear capacity. By doing so, they aim to shift from oil exporters to data exporters, selling not barrels but compute cycles powered by clean energy. Europe, meanwhile, once again, risks being caught in the middle. Its strong climate rules may restrict AI deployment unless it can scale renewables even faster or import clean electricity from neighbours.

The likely outcome of these developments is a fragmented world of AI-energy zones. Energy-intensive training may be offshored to countries with cheap and abundant power, Iceland with geothermal, Canada with hydro, or the UAE with subsidised solar. Inference, which requires lower latency, might remain closer to consumers. But this division of labour introduces new dependencies. Just as oil once shaped strategic alliances, access to clean compute could dictate future diplomatic ties. Who hosts whose data centers may become as politically sensitive as who hosts whose military bases.

This raises a deeper danger: a widening digital divide rooted in energy inequality. Advanced economies that can subsidise clean energy for AI will race ahead, while middle and low-income states risk being left behind, unable to both decarbonize and compete in AI simultaneously. The political fallout could mirror past energy politics, such as resentment, dependency and vulnerability, only this time revolving around electricity rather than oil.

Türkiye’s opportunity

For middle powers, the challenge is magnified, but so too is the opportunity. Türkiye offers a vivid example. Its current data center capacity is still being built, with around 250 MW, consuming less than 0.5% of national electricity. But President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s 2025 AI strategy sets an ambitious target: 1 GW of capacity by 2030, supported by over $10 billion in investment.

This is no small bet. In early 2024, renewables already provided 53% of Türkiye’s power. Solar alone doubled in just over two years to nearly 20 GW, surpassing the government’s 2025 target ahead of schedule. The Akkuyu nuclear plant, with four reactors set to generate 35 TWh annually, will soon cover 10% of national demand. This combination of abundant renewables and nuclear baseload gives Türkiye a unique chance to power its digital economy with low-carbon electricity.

Crucially, Türkiye’s geography adds leverage. At the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East and the Caucasus, Ankara could market itself as a regional computing hub. Low-latency, low-carbon AI services could be exported to three continents, positioning Türkiye not just as a consumer of digital tools but as a provider of critical infrastructure.

AI is changing the energy question from one of supply security to one of strategic advantage. The race for AI is becoming, at its core, a race for energy, who can marshal the watts to fuel the weights of AI models. For leading powers, it means aligning industrial policy, climate strategy and digital ambition. For middle powers like Türkiye, it means seizing the window to turn geography and energy transition into geopolitical leverage.

What is clear is that the AI revolution cannot be separated from the energy revolution. Those who treat them in isolation will fall behind. Those who connect them, politically, technologically and strategically, will shape not just the future of AI but the future balance of power itself.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2025/09/23/thumbs/800x531/402885.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:00:14.717084

Then, officials take the maximum possible build-out of all those areas and analyze the flood risk, stormwater runoff, and other hazards based on that.

The city of Sacramento, for instance, has created a flood insurance model that essentially does this, he says.
You cannot depend solely upon the government, and you certainly can’t depend solely on flood insurance or even FEMA flood insurance.","The city of Roseville, 19 miles northeast of Sacramento, regularly sits at the top of California’s “best places to live” lists. The traffic is reasonable, the weather sunny, and the homes comparatively affordable. There are bike paths and well-ranked schools and, on one recent morning, even an outdoor step aerobics class cheerfully underway in a downtown park.

But there is another reason this railroad town now with some 160,000 residents gets such high accolades. After two decades of careful municipal planning, it has no problem with flooding.

To outsiders, this might seem like a strange claim to fame for a city in California’s Central Valley, away from the coasts and rising sea levels. But as people here know, the Sacramento Valley sits in a highly vulnerable flood plain. During the 1980s and ’90s, this city made national news when its creeks overflowed due to heavy rain. Hundreds of homes were destroyed. President Bill Clinton came to console. And Roseville began a full-scale reimagining of how to protect itself from water.

Now, a quarter century later, the city is regularly held up as a model as other municipalities across the United States increasingly focus on the risk of inland flooding. This summer’s flash flooding in Texas Hill Country was a stark reminder that floods away from the coasts are one of the deadliest, and most financially costly, severe weather events in the U.S.

“Roseville is one of those communities that is ahead of the curve,” says David Feldman, professor emeritus with the department of urban planning and public policy at the University of California, Irvine. “They definitely get it.”

Its approach is not flashy. Talk to Brian Walker, Roseville’s senior engineer and flood plain manager, and you’ll hear a lot about flood plain mapping and storm drainage, funding mechanisms and development ordinances. But this measured and deliberate approach has worked, he and others say.

Roseville was the first city in the U.S. to receive the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) top rating for flood preparedness; residents still receive discounts on home insurance policies because of it. Mr. Walker also works closely with businesses in town. New residential neighborhoods are booming across the city, and last year Bosch announced a $1.9 billion upgrade to its Roseville site, where it plans to produce and test semiconductors.

“Hazard mitigation has real-world implications for families and for businesses,” Mr. Walker says. “If we’re prepared, people can maybe hose out their garage that got a little bit wet and then get back to business.”

Growing awareness in local communities

Earlier this year, the National Weather Service predicted that 2025 would well surpass the annual average of 4,000 flash flood warnings. The reasons for this vary from location to location, but often include a growing number of extreme rain events, as well as infrastructure challenges. More inland flooding means an increased likelihood of tragedies, such as in Texas earlier this year and the destruction from Hurricane Helene in the mountains of North Carolina last year. Monetary strain on cities and towns from New Mexico to New Jersey, from Kentucky to Vermont, is also growing.

“Local communities are becoming more aware of [floods] for a number of reasons,” Dr. Feldman says. “The cost of flooding, and the ultimate costs on residents and local governments, is increasing.”

Some of these costs are direct, such as for emergency response during a crisis. But there is also infrastructure repair, lost tax revenue, and the expense of future mitigation projects.

And there is always the issue of insurance.

Homeowners who live in high-risk flood areas must have flood insurance to get a mortgage. But those policies are expensive. Many researchers also point out that FEMA maps do not consider future development or climate change, so they tend to underestimate flood risk.

“FEMA’s flood maps are based on a historical average, but we know that with climate change, the past isn’t going to be like the future in terms of the type of flooding that we see and the extent of flooding that we see,” says Joel Scata, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This is why Roseville has long viewed federal flood maps as a minimum standard, says Mr. Walker.

“I think that FEMA’s maps are a huge asset for the country,” he says, adding that he and others in Placer County work regularly with FEMA to update maps and use them as a baseline. “FEMA doesn’t want to require communities to do what Roseville does. Roseville elected to say, ‘FEMA maps are great, but we want to do better.’”

Roseville analyzes flood risk by looking ahead to future development plans, both residential and commercial, in addition to assessing current development, he says. Then, officials take the maximum possible build-out of all those areas and analyze the flood risk, stormwater runoff, and other hazards based on that. With that information, the city creates its own maps and hazard ratings for citizens to access.

Those areas alongside Roseville’s 78 miles of creeks, for instance, tend to be open space, which can help manage the fierce bouts of rain that happen when an atmospheric river drops a fire hose of water on this city.

That means more restrictions on development, Mr. Walker acknowledges. But it also means space for a vast network of bike trails and parks that have become one of the big draws of the city. Additionally, it has prevented the situation facing Florida and other states where pricey businesses and homes are built in those places most likely to flood.

“If there’s one thing that I would say that is the most beneficial for mitigating flood risk, I’d say it is Roseville’s choice to define our flood plains more conservatively,” Mr. Walker says. “So, we define the risk, and then we keep structures and development outside of those risky areas.”

From containing water, to working with it

Across the street from Roseville’s city government offices, over a pedestrian bridge covering both a bike path and a creek, Mr. Walker points out the high-water marker from the city’s 1995 flood. It’s almost as tall as he is.

This park was under several feet of water, he says – and planners here do not forget it. When they renovated the pedestrian bridges, they made sure to make them extra high so that even a flooded creek would rush under them.

“We were very mindful about not inducing any flood risk to the area,” he says. “In all of our projects, we strive for having zero flood impact.”

This, says Dr. Feldman, is what cities will increasingly need to do. Historically, municipalities created infrastructure to try to contain water. (And after its flooding, Roseville, too, built levees.) Now, they must try to work with it.

“There’s a growing awareness of the fact that so-called structural measures to alleviate floods, that is to say, building of dams, levees, fortifications of various types, are not a panacea,” he says. “You have to be more imaginative.”

Individuals and businesses also need to take more responsibility, Dr. Feldman argues. If developers build in an area at risk of flooding, they should have to bear a greater share of the wider costs of flood mitigation and repair. The city of Sacramento, for instance, has created a flood insurance model that essentially does this, he says.

“I think what we’re beginning to learn ... is that you do have to take action locally,” he says. “You cannot depend on the cavalry coming to the rescue after a flood disaster. You cannot depend solely upon the government, and you certainly can’t depend solely on flood insurance or even FEMA flood insurance. The risks are too great.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/09/0922%20NFLOODSAFETY%20open%20space%20LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:44.672774

Viewed from the bottom line, however, Ivanpah is anything but.

The solar power plant, which features three 459-foot towers and thousands of computer-controlled mirrors known as heliostats, cost some $2.2 billion to build.

Construction began in 2010 and was completed in 2014. Now, it’s set to close in 2026 after failing to efficiently generate solar energy.

In 2011, the US Department of Energy under former President Barack Obama issued $1.6 billion in three federal loan guarantees for the project and the Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, hailed it as “an example of how America is becoming a world leader in solar energy.”

But ultimately, it’s been more emblematic of profligate government spending and unwise bets on poorly conceived, quickly outdated technologies.

“Ivanpah stands as a testament to the waste and inefficiency of government subsidized energy schemes,”Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, an American energy advocacy group, told Fox News via statement this past February. It “never lived up to its promises, producing less electricity than expected, while relying on natural gas to stay operational.”

When Ivanpah began operating in 2014, it ranked as the world’s largest solar plant. It seemed like a viable solution to California’s renewable energy goals of employing affordable and efficient technology to reduce the need for fossil fuels.

Located near the California-Nevada border, 65 miles southwest of Las Vegas, the plant’s glowing towers are as striking as some casinos on the Strip.

The facility’s five-square-miles of desert were covered with some 173,500 heliostats, adjusted via computer to catch maximum rays. The computer-controlled mirrors can reflect light from the sun at temperatures that can reach 1,000 degrees in part of the installment.

“The idea was that you could use the sun to produce a heat source,” alternative energy consultant Edward Smeloff told The Post. “The mirrors reflect heat from the sun up to a receiver, which is mounted on top of the tower. That heats a fluid. It creates steam [that spins] a conventional steam turbine. It is complicated.”

Though it sounds like a bit of a Rube Goldberg contraption — and looks like an art installation — Ivanpah was a cutting edge idea for a while. But, as the market changed, it couldn’t compete with newer and less less expensive forms of creating solar power.

“It simply did not scale up,” said Smeloff. “It’s kind of an obsolete technology [that’s] been outpaced by solar photovoltaic technology.”

That tech uses semiconductor material to transform sunlight into energy in a streamlined process. The solar energy panels you see on many residential rooftops or lined up in endless rows across the desert rely on the technology.

A statement from NRG Energy, the Texas based company that was an Ivanpah partner and the largest investor, having put up $300 million, agrees with Smeloff’s view.

“When the power purchase agreements were signed in 2009, the prices were competitive, but advancements over time … have led to more efficient, cost effective and flexible options for producing reliable clean energy,” a company statement read.

Ivanpah hasn’t just been inefficient and expensive, it’s also been deadly for wildlife.

According to the Association of Avian Veterinarians, the power plant “is believed to be responsible for at least 6,000 bird deaths each year.”

They get fried “if they fly in the area where the reflection is going up to the tower,” Smeloff explained

But maybe it didn’t have to be that way. A report published by World Economic Forum earlier this year noted that private investors can be more nimble with new technologies than the government.

“Unlike public market investors, private equity firms can implement transformative changes through hands-on management and aligned incentives,” the report read.

Steven Milloy, senior fellow at the Energy & Environmental Legal Institute and former Trump EPA transition team member, agrees.

“No green project relying on taxpayer subsidies has ever made any economic or environmental sense,” he said. “It’s important that President Trump stop the taxpayer bleeding by ending what he accurately calls the Green New Scam.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/111992415.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:39.767837

A national clean energy grid will help us reach our potential to be a clean-energy superpower, directly benefiting our steel, aluminum and advanced manufacturing industries at a time when they’re under threat.","OTTAWA | TRADITIONAL, UNCEDED TERRITORY OF THE ALGONQUIN ANISHINAABEG PEOPLE (September 23, 2025)

On September 24 and 25, 17 allied organizations will meet with more than two dozen members of Parliament to demonstrate clear support for the federal government to build Canada’s east-west electricity grid with renewable energy, while upholding Indigenous and workers’ rights.

The coalition is wide-ranging, with labour unions, Indigenous clean-energy leaders, doctors, faith groups, climate activists, electrical workers and municipal councillors from across Canada working together for the first time to prioritize building renewable electricity across the country.

The coalition agrees that the federal government’s recent announcements on major projects signal missed opportunities. Collectively, they agree that an east-west electricity grid powered by renewable energy meets this moment and requires federal and provincial funding.

An east-west electricity grid with renewable energy will bring health, employment and economic benefits across Canada. This is especially true when it upholds workers’ rights by using made-in-Canada components and union labour. Beyond the health benefits of mitigating climate change, renewables and electrification would also bring billions of dollars in health-care system savings.

All projects must uphold the legal and inherent rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples in Canada. The federal government should also recognize the leadership of Indigenous communities by prioritizing Indigenous-led electricity projects.

Today, Provincial electricity systems are significantly more interconnected with the United States than with one another, and Canada’s electricity needs are projected to double or even triple before 2050 due to increasing electrification of industry, transportation and heating. Building interprovincial electricity connections solves multiple problems, with studies showing it will reduce energy costs and improve reliability by connecting regions to low-cost renewable power.

Most people in Canada want to see these projects built, with 77 per cent saying they support upgrading Canada’s grid by connecting provinces and territories with new transmission lines, and 72 per cent supporting federal funding for new transmission lines. When given the choice, Canadians prefer a connected east-west electricity grid to help power Canada’s economy with renewable energy over a new pipeline to transport oil to either the East or West Coast for export.

Melina Laboucan-Massimo – Founder and Executive Director, Sacred Earth, Lubicon Cree

“In an era of wildfires and floods, Indigenous communities across the country are disproportionately facing the burdens of the climate crisis and fossil fuel extraction. Sacred Earth urges political leaders to prioritize critical transmission linkages between the provinces and territories through progressive energy policy and project investments that align with climate science, prioritize public and Indigenous ownership and uphold the rights of workers and Indigenous Peoples. Through these actions, we can advance energy sovereignty, self-determination and climate resiliency, creating a just future for all. The Canadian government must pick a path: injustice and environmental destruction, or a legacy of climate leadership, ecological balance and true economic reconciliation.”

Brandon Dyck – Government Affairs, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)

“IBEW members across Canada are geared up and ready to build out a truly national electrical network from generation to end user. We share a long history of electrifying Canada through private and public endeavours with a highly skilled and diversified workforce. This renewed focus on clean, affordable power, easily shared across provincial borders, will provide long-term energy for homes and industries while also creating well-paying union jobs. Governments throughout the country should support the initiative for expanding renewables and transmission, with the participation of First Nations, to benefit the communities in which these workers live, creating more opportunities beyond fossil fuel extraction.”

Stephen Thomas – Clean Energy Manager, David Suzuki Foundation

“We are united in our call for the federal government to prioritize funding an east-west electricity grid with renewable energy that upholds workers’ and Indigenous rights. The effects of an east-west grid will be felt widely across the country, creating thousands of jobs, improving energy security and saving people money on energy bills. Building pipelines is a waste of time and money that only benefits fossil fuel billionaires in the long run. This moment in Canada calls for real solutions to the overlapping crises we face. We need jobs that are here to stay, affordable energy and to make sure our kids have healthy air to breathe. This will only be possible through building Canada’s east-west grid with renewables.”

Helen Hsu – Physician, Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE)

“The health of the environment is the health of the people. We cannot thrive in isolation. Climate change and extreme weather harm physical and mental health. A national east-west renewable energy grid would reduce air pollution, improving Canadians’ health in the short term, and cut carbon emissions, protecting long-term health.”

David Miller – Co-Chair, Elbows Up for Climate

“This summer, communities throughout the country were seriously affected by wildfires, smoke and evacuation orders — caused or made worse by climate change. Canada needs to do its part to help the world avoid climate breakdown. A national clean energy grid will help us reach our potential to be a clean-energy superpower, directly benefiting our steel, aluminum and advanced manufacturing industries at a time when they’re under threat. It needs to be the government’s first priority as we continue to nation-build.”

AEIdeas

The Wall Street Journal’s USA250 series asked a group of economists to make a long-term forecast: What will American capitalism look like in 2075? Good luck. As the saying goes, predictions are hard, especially about the future.

I would guess that back at the Bicentennial, plenty of experts likely saw anything but a future where capitalism would be severely constrained by resource limits. It was a time of stagflation, oil shocks, and a productivity slowdown that seemed to herald permanent sclerosis. Surely many economists would have predicted more of the same.

Of the economists queried by the WSJ, Harvard economist Gregory Mankiw probably answered the question most expansively in a futurist style:

Thanks to advances in technology, the income of the average American, adjusted for inflation, will be about twice what it is today.

Substantial inequality will persist, and populist agitators will continue to argue that the elites have rigged the economy. Partly as a response, the social safety net will become more robust, including a modest universal basic income.

Taxes will be higher to fund the expanded safety net, and because people will have learned that government debt relative to GDP cannot rise forever. Like most of the world today, the US will have a value-added tax.

Workweeks will be shorter due to both the disincentive effect of higher taxes and the desire of most people to use their greater prosperity to enjoy more leisure.

Manufacturing employment will have nearly disappeared, but manufacturing output will remain strong with robots doing most of the work. Service jobs will expand, and entirely new jobs we cannot now imagine will emerge.

Acknowledging past mistakes, the government will eschew most heavy-handed interventions in competitive markets, such as industrial policy, tariffs, minimum wages, rent control and Nimby zoning.

What might I have written if asked by the WSJ? Here are a few things I for sure would have mentioned (as I do in my 2023 book “The Conservative Futurist: How To Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised”), especially if I were in a techno-optimistic mood:

American capitalism will become more explicitly pro-growth, helped along by tailwinds like rapid technological breakthroughs and geopolitical competition, as well as a bipartisan push to build being reflected in public policy.

Cheap, clean, and reliable energy from solar, fusion, advanced fission, and geothermal will provide the foundation for powering AI, robotics, and an overall far more productive economy.

A wave of general-purpose technologies—artificial intelligence, genetic editing, reusable rockets, and advanced energy—will generate myriad new industries and jobs both here on Earth and in orbit.

Cultural optimism will become a productive force, as solutionist thinking replaces dystopian fatalism and society once again celebrates building over blocking.

While AI will have continued to advance to a state that certainly qualifies as artificial general intelligence or superintelligence, it will not have killed us all (as some are currently predicting).

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

U.S. power demand is forecast to hit record highs this year and next, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Independent power companies have argued against the idea of regulated power generation in deregulated states, saying utilities would pass the cost down to customers and further raise bills.","By Laila Kearney

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Major U.S. electric utility plans to step up its push to own power plants in its Mid-Atlantic service area next year, where electricity bills are spiking in the face of rising demand and new supplies are slow to be added, CEO Calvin Butler told Reuters this week.

Exelon’s effort comes as PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest grid providing electricity to over 65 million people in the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic, faces supply shortfalls amid surging demand from data centers and the electrification of industries like transportation.

Chicago-based Exelon said in July that it was considering its options for building and owning regulated power generation, which electric utilities are legally barred from in about half of U.S. states.

In those states, regulated utilities generally own power lines, while independent power producers own and operate power plants to diversify market power, which can help prevent anti-competitive behavior.

Butler said allowing electric utilities like Exelon to build new regulated power supplies, which is currently barred by state laws in much of PJM’s territory, would ease the grid’s power crunch and bring down prices.

Regulated power generation in the region where Exelon operates would require a series of changes to state law, which Butler said his company is laying the groundwork for by talking to lawmakers and governors ahead of next year’s lawmaking meetings.

""I believe the 2026 legislative sessions are going to be an opportunity for us,"" Butler told Reuters at a meeting in New York on Monday. ""We’re going to be advocating for it.""

About half of U.S. states are considered deregulated, generally, meaning that electric utilities that own transmission and distribution lines cannot also own regulated power generation. The deregulation effort began in the 1990s in response to rising electricity costs.

As power bills rise again, some of the 13 states in PJM, like Maryland and New Jersey, have considered amending their laws to allow regulated power generation.

""I’m one of the staunchest supporters for competitive markets when they work, but we are seeing that the competitive marketplace in PJM is not working,"" Butler said.

U.S. power demand is forecast to hit record highs this year and next, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

FIGHTING RISING BILLS

If allowed by the states, Butler said he would seek to build community solar in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods, which he said would reduce power bills.

Some 80% of recent household electricity bill increases are power supply costs, Butler said, as opposed to utility charges.

With nearly 11 million customers, Exelon is one of the biggest power utilities in the country and covers some of the most impoverished urban communities, including those in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Atlantic City. Some of those cities have also seen the biggest power bill increases over the summer.

Independent power companies have argued against the idea of regulated power generation in deregulated states, saying utilities would pass the cost down to customers and further raise bills.

Butler said regulated utilities can often build power supplies with a lower impact on bills. They have lower borrowing costs and cost of capital and a speedier permitting process because utilities like Exelon already own substantial land and easements to develop new power generation, he said.

Exelon’s overall return on its assets is about 9.5%, or roughly half of what he said independent power producers earn.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEL8M0V1_L.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:04:46.325106

Greenhouse-gas driven climate change is driving extreme weather, flooding, erosion, sea-level rise, heat waves, drought, catastrophic wildfires, famine, smog pollution, and other disasters.
Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.
But scientists have known for over a century that greenhouse gases drive climate change.
In addition to Murphy, Whitehouse and Schumer, the letter was signed by the entire Senate Democratic Caucus, including U.S.","WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) joined U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and the entire Senate Democratic Caucus in demanding the Trump Administration withdraw its legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding that allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control greenhouse gas emissions. The rollback, if finalized, would constitute a formal denial by the EPA that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare—a position that defies decades of scientific evidence, agency precedent, and Supreme Court rulings. The 47 Senators called the repeal of the climate and public health protection a “dereliction of duty” and a “blatant failure to protect the American people.”

The endangerment finding is a 2009 scientific determination by EPA that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare and is the legal basis for U.S. climate policy. It is grounded in extensive peer-reviewed science and confirmed by successive National Climate Assessments and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Twice, EPA’s scientific finding has withstood challenge at the D.C. Circuit, and both times, the Supreme Court declined to revisit the decision. Repealing the endangerment finding would ignore overwhelming scientific evidence and set the stage for rolling back air quality standards for power plants, airplanes, and more, making it easier to pollute.

“Scientists, financial experts, international governments, and the American public agree that climate change is a looming crisis. Greenhouse-gas driven climate change is driving extreme weather, flooding, erosion, sea-level rise, heat waves, drought, catastrophic wildfires, famine, smog pollution, and other disasters. These effects drive illness, hospital visits, and deaths, as well as displacement, asset loss, infrastructure damage, rising insurance premiums, declining home values, and long-term destabilization of the national economy …. And yet, in this proposal, EPA proposes to abdicate all responsibility to address this dangerous pollution,” wrote the Senators.

Not only do EPA’s actions fail to protect the American public from well-documented harms, but the agency’s justifications “are directly at odds with Supreme Court precedent, Congressional directive, and the facts.”

“The Court in [Massachusetts v. EPA] found that ‘[c]arbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt’ air pollutants under the Clean Air Act’s definition, and that ‘[t]he statute is unambiguous’ on this point,” wrote the Senators. And “[u]nder the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid [making an endangerment finding] only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.”

To justify the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has relied on a Department of Energy pseudoscientific report written by known climate deniers with close ties to fossil fuel and polluting industry actors. Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.

But scientists have known for over a century that greenhouse gases drive climate change. “In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities contribute to a global “greenhouse effect”, driving global warming. One hundred and twenty-nine years later, the reality of human-caused climate change is not up for debate,” wrote the Senators.

“Congress established the Clean Air Act to protect the public health and welfare, and the Supreme Court confirmed that this includes EPA’s obligation to regulate greenhouse gases to the extent they endanger the same. The science is clear that they do so. We ask that you withdraw this proposal and reverse your decision to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding,” concluded the Senators.

In addition to Murphy, Whitehouse and Schumer, the letter was signed by the entire Senate Democratic Caucus, including U.S. Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

A nearly 5,000-acre solar panel/battery storage facility is operational near Las Vegas.
At Teesside, NatPower officials have some interesting plans for the battery project.","Teesside may sound tranquil, but it's about to become supercharged, according to Interesting Engineering.

Startup NatPower reported that it is investing more than $1.1 billion into a giant 32-acre battery energy storage facility near Middlesbrough that will store renewable energy for later use, allowing more clean power to supplement the grid.

The Teesside Gigapark will be located at the energy and utility service Sembcorp Utilities' site. It will be the largest and longest-duration storage facility of its kind once completed in 2028, Interesting Engineering and NatPower reported.

""The Teesside Gigapark is more than a storage project. It combines large-scale batteries with industrial electrification … setting a new standard for the U.K. energy sector,"" IE's Sujita Sinha wrote.

NatPower touts the privately funded project as a money-saving grid support that could conserve $4.1 billion in efficiencies annually by saving typically wasted renewable energy. It will use lithium-ion batteries that can store electricity for four hours, per IE.

Holding the cleaner power is crucial for using it during peak demand times, such as early evening hours when the sun goes down, but power use remains high. NatPower plans for the Teesside facility to eventually be able to provide electricity over an impressive eight hours, IE's report added.

Battery storage is being developed in the United States, too. In Texas, Tesla Megapacks are key grid contributors. A nearly 5,000-acre solar panel/battery storage facility is operational near Las Vegas.

It's a concept that can be realized at home, as well. Rooftop solar panels combined with batteries can generate and store free solar energy that can reduce or eliminate your utility bill. EnergySage is a free resource that can help you secure tax incentives while they last, compare quotes, and find a timely professional installer. It's advice that can save you up to $10,000 if you buy the panels before rebates expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

The cleaner energy, at homes and at larger facilities, also limits planet-warming pollution produced when dirty fuels are burned to generate power. Air pollution impacts nearly everyone on the planet, according to the World Health Organization. And Earth's overheating is even hurting academic performance, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At Teesside, NatPower officials have some interesting plans for the battery project. Around 200 construction jobs will be created. Looking forward, officials intend to work with colleges and environmental groups on training programs for future clean-energy jobs. A focus of the project will be powering ships at a nearby port, allowing the vessels to turn off dirty diesel engines, all according to IE.

""Teesside, our most advanced Gigapark, will be the blueprint for combining large-scale storage with electrification of ports and industry, transforming Teesside into a net-zero economic powerhouse within five years,"" NatPower UK CEO Stefano D.M.

Davidson acknowledges an “adjustment period” for staff, industry and the public but says the goal is more transparent, predictable processes.

That's below the U.S. average of 30%.

Why it matters: The numbers indicate some success in reducing emissions to curb climate change, but the Trump administration's pro-coal, anti-wind-and-solar attitude could jeopardize that progress as it gets harder to start new clean energy projects.

Between the lines: The nationwide emissions decline was primarily a result of less coal being burned to generate electricity.

An uptick in natural gas use, plus clean wind and solar energy, ""offset the decrease in coal generation,"" per the EIA.

Zoom in: Oregon has set aggressive targets — close to net-zero emissions by 2050 — for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change. The state recently reinstated a policy capping emissions and enforcing penalties for violators.

Broken down by sector, transportation and commercial utilities emit the largest share of carbon.

The state has also set a goal of generating 100% of its power from renewables by 2040.

How it works: The agency's state-by-state data reflects where power plants are located (even if their energy is sent to other states) and where transportation fuels are sold (even if vehicles burn those fuels to cross state lines).

The parties should act responsibly in the vote,” Mr. Lira said during Macro Day, an event hosted Monday (22) by BTG Pactual in São Paulo.
Hours earlier, at the same event, House Speaker Hugo Motta said he planned to schedule a vote on the tax exemption for next week.
Mr. Motta defended the bill approved by a special committee, with a favorable report by Mr. Lira, and said it could pass in the plenary.
Once it’s ready, I want to bring the income tax bill to a vote next week,” Mr. Motta added.","The rapporteur for the bill granting income tax exemption for those earning up to R$5,000 a month, Congressman Arthur Lira, predicted a “tough debate” when the measure goes to a vote in the Lower House and warned that the government “must be prepared” for possible changes. Mr. Lira said there was “unanimity” on creating a tax-free bracket, but that there would be “a lot of discussion” over compensation measures.

There will be a very intense debate in the plenary about form, values, and conditions, on how to offset the measure. The government must be prepared. The parties should act responsibly in the vote,” Mr. Lira said during Macro Day, an event hosted Monday (22) by BTG Pactual in São Paulo.

Hours earlier, at the same event, House Speaker Hugo Motta said he planned to schedule a vote on the tax exemption for next week. Mr. Motta defended the bill approved by a special committee, with a favorable report by Mr. Lira, and said it could pass in the plenary.

Both confirmed that Mr. Lira would present his report to party leaders in the House on Tuesday (23). Mr. Lira said he would outline the main points of the document and then seek dialogue with other party leaders, civil society, and representatives of productive sectors.

“The atmosphere, as you all know, was not easy. The House floor is an environment of great political and ideological diversity, with more conservative and more liberal views, and the climate was not calm for a project like this, which is important both for lower-income groups and for those already burdened by heavy taxation,” he said, referring to the search for negotiated solutions.

According to Mr. Lira, it is necessary to balance the social and fiscal goals of the bill, which benefits the poor, with the concerns of “those who produce, who generate jobs, who carry Brazil on their shoulders,” so that “they are not hit with yet another tax in a harsher way.”

Certainly, the debate will emerge about implementing a new tax, whether it involves dividends or not, and whether to tax individuals as corporations,” he said. “The productive class—entrepreneurs, people who create jobs and income—is still working through some issues in the text. We have not closed the door. We are listening to everyone,” Mr. Lira added, reaffirming his expectation that the House will review the bill next week. “When it comes to tax issues, we all know the debate becomes more intense and rigid because everyone considers the needs and challenges of each sector.”

The lawmaker observed that the special committee, where the report was approved in July, “is a much more controlled environment” than the House floor. Despite the tense atmosphere in Congress, he called for a “technical, independent, harmonious, and responsible” discussion so that the issue is not influenced by other interests or strategies for the 2026 elections.

Mr. Lira said he believed he had fulfilled his role so far, “with all the difficulties the matter requires.” He agreed that the exemption “in some way brings tax justice,” a theme emphasized by President Lula’s government.

Mr. Motta said he does not believe the compensation measures for the exemption, proposed by the government, will be removed from the bill to be voted on. Still, he emphasized that lawmakers must act responsibly and avoid approving measures that increase spending and threaten public finances.

“The plenary is sovereign, but the work of the special committee was well built,” the House speaker said. “Arthur Lira’s meeting with party leaders will be crucial to explain the reasoning behind the report.

The project expands the company’s Restore Fund, which now supports two dozen conservation and regenerative agriculture efforts across six continents.

Scaling Nature-Based Carbon Removal

The Gualala River Forest is part of California’s coastal redwood region, home to hundreds of wildlife species and a source of livelihood for local communities. Through the partnership, The Conservation Fund will manage the forest while Apple receives carbon credits from its growth. These credits will help Apple reach its Apple 2030 goal of becoming fully carbon neutral.

Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, said:

“Forests are one of the most powerful technologies we have for removing carbon from the atmosphere. Our global investments in nature are leveraging that technology while supporting communities, stimulating local economies, and enhancing biodiversity.”

Protecting U.S. Forests

Larry Selzer, president and CEO of The Conservation Fund, warned, “America’s forests are under immense pressure, with 13 million acres at risk of vanishing by 2050.” He called the Apple partnership “a powerful model for protecting working forests” that can be replicated nationwide.

Apple has already surpassed 60 percent of its global emissions reduction target and, together with suppliers such as TSMC and Murata, aims to remove 9.6 million metric tons of carbon annually by 2030.

Global Commitments

Beyond the United States, Apple funds projects worldwide. These include mangrove restoration in India, support for the Jane Goodall Institute’s Roots and Shoots program, and new collaborations with The Nature Conservancy to improve climate monitoring tools.

The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

The Company is offering the Notes pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The initial purchasers of the Notes will offer the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or outside the United States to certain persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

CARLSBAD, Calif., Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natural Alternatives International, Inc. (""NAI"") (Nasdaq: NAII), a leading formulator, manufacturer, and marketer of customized nutritional supplements, today announced a net loss of $7.2 million, or ($1.20) per diluted share, on net sales of $33.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to a net loss of $1.9 million, or ($0.32) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 included non-recurring non-cash charges of $1.4 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter and a $4.8 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Excluding these charges, our net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 would have been $1.0 million.

Net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2025, increased $4.4 million, or 15%, to $33.9 million compared to $29.5 million recorded in the comparable prior year period. During the same period, private-label contract manufacturing sales increased 15% to $31.8 million. Private-label contract manufacturing sales increased primarily due to increased orders from several of our existing customers and orders from new customers, partially offset by reduced orders from one of our larger customers.

CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing and raw material sales revenue increased 14% to $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, as compared to $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The increase in CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing, and raw material sales revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to increased raw material sales to existing customers and royalty income.

Our net loss for fiscal year 2025 was $13.6 million, or ($2.28) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or ($1.23) per diluted share, for fiscal year 2024. Our net loss for fiscal 2025 included non-recurring non-cash charges of $1.4 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter and a $4.8 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Excluding these charges, our net loss for fiscal 2025 would have been $7.4 million.

Net sales during the year ended June 30, 2025, increased $16.1 million, or 14%, to $129.9 million as compared to $113.8 million recorded in the comparable prior year period. During the year ended June 30, 2025, private-label contract manufacturing sales increased 16% to $121.8 million, as compared to $105.4 million in the comparable prior period. CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing and raw material sales revenue decreased 4% to $8.1 million during the fiscal 2025, as compared to $8.4 million for fiscal 2024.

While we grew sales during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2025, we experienced a net loss primarily due to underutilization of our available factory capacities, a valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred income tax assets and the accrual of a litigation settlement. Although our overall sales forecast for fiscal 2026 includes a significant increase in sales as compared to fiscal 2025, we currently anticipate we will experience a net loss in the first half of fiscal 2026, net income in the second half of fiscal 2026, and net income for the full fiscal 2026 year.

As of June 30, 2025, we had cash of $12.3 million and working capital of $30.5 million, compared to $12.0 million and $38.1 million respectively, as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, we had $9.9 million of borrowing capacity on our credit facility of which we had outstanding borrowings of $1.9 million.

Mark A. Le Doux, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NAI stated, “The results achieved in our final quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by non-cash charges associated with accounting treatment of deferred tax assets and a litigation settlement, however, the net results were still a disappointment. The fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 showed increases in revenues and our preliminary outlook for this next fiscal year shows some ‘green shoots’ emerging in renewed growth in current and new customer relationships. Our team remains focused on client expansion, channel diversity and process improvements to increase revenues and profitability. We remain hopeful we will emerge from fiscal year 2026 profitable with expanded client relationships and revenues. We continue to focus our attention on adoption of the remarkable benefits associated with our highly bio-available form of CarnoSyn® beta-alanine known as TriBsyn™ and continue our human research in various settings around the world to bolster scientific support for this remarkable molecule – especially in light of the concerns associated with the millions of global consumers utilizing pharmaceutical agents to control weight. This molecule also addresses key concerns for addressing good health in the aging demographics by addressing issues like sarcopenia, mental function, skeletal integrity, cardiovascular function and immune responses to external challenges. We remain committed to maintaining the integrity of our balance sheet in our renewed dedication to secure profits in the near future.”

The state also created tax incentives for data centers in 2019.
When asked whether more should be done by lawmakers to ensure affordable electric bills, Braun said ratepayers need a voice.
Applications to be on the IURC will be open until October 14th.","Governor Mike Braun announced applications are open for three vacant seats on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — an agency that has a big impact on Hoosiers' electric bills.

The IURC decides whether a utility can recover the costs of things like power plants — something several utilities are looking to build as data centers drive up energy demand.

Braun said the state needs to keep rates in check while also growing Indiana's economy.

""We're seeking entrepreneurial individuals who are going to think out of the box and have a special attention to rates Hoosiers bear in general,"" he said.

Google recently withdrew its proposal for a one in Marion County after facing public backlash. Braun said data centers may not be for every community, but tech companies can also do a better job of highlighting the benefits.

""Met with a rural county just last week that would love to have a data center, because they don't have enough population to support a ton of employees, but they sure could use the [capital expenditures], the assessed value,"" he said.

In other words, they could use the tax revenue for things like schools and roads.

To fill those IURC seats, Braun appointed Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski, former Republican state representative Dollyne Sherman and Floyd County business executive Cory Cochran to the IURC nominating committee.

They'll review applications with four committee members appointed by the legislature and forward their suggestions to Braun.

The consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition has criticized Braun, calling his statements ""hollow.""

The group said Braun has pushed for expensive nuclear, natural gas and coal instead of more affordable solutions like energy efficiency and community solar.

Consumer advocates have said that the legislature has often tied the hands of the IURC by allowing utilities to approve more kinds of costs and more quickly. The state also created tax incentives for data centers in 2019.

CAC Executive Director Kerwin Olson said Gov. Braun has a chance to lead.

""The rate hikes Hoosiers have endured in recent years are just the tip of the iceberg. We need decisive action to reverse the policies that got us here in the first place and embrace energy solutions that will lower bills and ensure long-term reliability without sending costs through the roof,"" Olson said.

When asked whether more should be done by lawmakers to ensure affordable electric bills, Braun said ratepayers need a voice.

""I will be that voice and I think the legislature's got eyes and ears — and they've been listening to and watching regarding utility prices,"" he said.

Thailand’s Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) announced that the country’s first pilot project for the Direct Power Purchase Agreement (DPPA) is in its final stages of review and is expected to launch by the end of this year. Authorities hope the scheme will attract international data center developers to invest in Thailand. If industry response is strong, ERC may lift the current 2GW trading cap.

Third-party access rules still under discussion

ERC Secretary-General Poonpat Leesombatpiboon said officials from the Ministry of Energy and the Board of Investment (BOI) have been involved in discussions, with the Third Party Access Code being one of the main issues. ERC has previously stated that if power companies use the national grid in line with the code, related transactions would incur wheeling charges.

As more industries move toward low-carbon and net-zero goals, the government faces increasing pressure to liberalize the green electricity market. Foreign data center developers have explicitly told Thai authorities that they would consider investing if a clear DPPA policy is in place.

Naruechon Dhumrongpiyawut, CEO of Thai clean energy developer Gunkul Engineering, also urged the government to keep pace with other Asian countries such as the Philippines and Taiwan, noting that countries adopting DPPAs are more successful in attracting foreign investment—something she herself prefers when expanding business opportunities abroad.

Thailand’s National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) currently caps DPPA transactions at 2GW. Poonpat said the cap may be raised in the future to meet growing demand.

LNG imports decline for the first time since 2014

Electricity supply and demand in Thailand remain closely tied to the economy and weather. Government data shows that as of July this year, gas-fired power generation dropped 12%, the steepest fall on record, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports also contracted for the first time since 2014. Natural gas accounts for 56% of Thailand’s total power generation.

Raksit Pattanapitoon, an analyst at Norway-based consultancy Rystad Energy, noted that weather has been the key driver of Thailand’s electricity demand this year. Frequent rainfall in recent months reduced instances of extreme heat, lowering the demand for air conditioning.

Meanwhile, the World Bank projects Thailand’s economic growth will slow to 1.8% this year and further to 1.7% next year, citing weak exports, slower-than-expected tourism recovery, and political instability. These factors are also dampening electricity demand.

Still, Pattanapitoon expects demand to rise in the long term, driven by transport electrification and the expansion of data centers.",https://www.reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1758605095971116110.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 20:01:45.153935

For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.
So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in.
EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.
""This deal is absurd and it's never gonna happen again,"" Philip De Jong, the marketing director at Emich, told CBS MoneyWatch.
A chart below from Cars.com shows which vehicles are still eligible for the federal tax credit, based on information from Environmental Protection Agency.","For car buyers interested in electric vehicles, the clock is ticking to take advantage of federal tax credits on new and used EVs before they expire on Sept. 30.

Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits — $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used — are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also ending a series of other clean energy credits over the next several months.

With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.

""As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,"" Cox Automotive said in its report.

The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce — whose holdings include Cars.com — that shows a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.

Deals to be had

Anxious to clear out EV inventory before the arrival of new models in November, dealerships have been offering their own incentives, such as monthly lease rates that are are as little as 1% of the car's sticker price.

The Emich Volkswagen dealership in Denver has lowered EV lease rates to $40 a month. ""This deal is absurd and it's never gonna happen again,"" Philip De Jong, the marketing director at Emich, told CBS MoneyWatch.

One customer at the Denver dealership, Stephen Hynes, told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that that he would save as much as $400 a month compared with his last car payment.

""I'm getting an electric vehicle now; it's because of this tax credit,"" said Hynes.

A chart below from Cars.com shows which vehicles are still eligible for the federal tax credit, based on information from Environmental Protection Agency.

What will happen after the tax credit ends?

September 2025 could end up being the ""single biggest EV month in history,"" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.

""It is the concern,"" Horvick said. ""It could be challenging.""

As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.

But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.

EV sales ""can't fall off a cliff because they're not very high,"" Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy, told CBS News' Van Cleave. ""They're gonna fall off a small hill because that's as high as they got.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/23/8a73a78f-25f1-48a9-bac9-bbf7ba2d924f/thumbnail/1200x630/f553829bc0fec873d43f2f429ece00bd/ap22294698044558.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:04:17.778113

If finalized, oil and gas facilities, suppliers, and injection sites wouldn’t have to report emissions data to the EPA after 2024.
In this case, the administration’s target is greenhouse gas reporting for oil and gas producers, processors, and operators mandated under “Subpart W” of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which was revised by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
Based on 2023 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data, oil and gas producers are the second-largest contributors of CO₂ emissions behind power plants (Figure 1).
Figure 1 The change to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program reporting requirements and other climate actions under the Biden administration were seen as a step forward.","Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule in the Federal Register that would eliminate reporting requirements for 46 types of sources under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. If finalized, oil and gas facilities, suppliers, and injection sites wouldn’t have to report emissions data to the EPA after 2024. While the action aligns with the administration’s efforts to undermine climate action and ease regulations for corporations, it is facing pushback from an unexpected source: the oil and gas companies.

EPA’s move ties back to an executive order in January, titled “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,” that aimed to reduce the costs for companies in complying with federal regulations. In this case, the administration’s target is greenhouse gas reporting for oil and gas producers, processors, and operators mandated under “Subpart W” of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which was revised by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Congress initially created the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule with the passage of the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which stated that “greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are causing average temperatures to rise at a rate outside the range of natural variability and are posing a substantial risk of rising sea-levels, altered patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and increased frequency and severity of floods, droughts, and wildfires.” Data collection was made official under section 114 of the Clean Air Act. Later, the Inflation Reduction Act amended the Clean Air Act to add reporting requirements for “methane emissions and [a] waste reduction incentive program for petroleum and natural gas systems.”

Dealing with emissions from oil and gas production has been a challenge in achieving both US and international climate goals, especially as countries try to transition to cleaner energy. Based on 2023 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data, oil and gas producers are the second-largest contributors of CO₂ emissions behind power plants (Figure 1).

Figure 1

The change to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program reporting requirements and other climate actions under the Biden administration were seen as a step forward. But like in other areas of the government, the Trump administration is removing the data to hide the problem. One potential snag in Trump’s plan is the oil and gas producers themselves. According to Politico, no major trade associations have requested that the EPA end the reporting requirement. That’s because beginning in 2027, companies importing gas into the European Union will be required to provide the very same emissions data.

To comply with the EU’s new policy, the emissions data must be verified by a third party, which in the past has been the EPA. Without EPA monitoring, companies will have to rely on outside certification through third parties, which will increase costs for those looking to transport oil and gas on global markets, as well as for climate-conscious purchasers within the US. Ironically, the new EU policies are linked to Trump’s pressure on European nations to stop importing Russian gas, instead favoring US suppliers.

Ultimately, oil and gas companies could be the ones to stop the EPA’s plan to end reporting requirements, even though their goals are different from a clean energy transition. That’s because, much like with his tariffs, Trump’s actions will end up costing these companies more, highlighting the complex and often counterintuitive consequences of deregulation. While ultimately an environmental justice movement should be based on the dismantling of the fossil fuel industry, we’ll take what we can get right now.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETH_Emissions.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:10.559720

This agreement will enable the collaboration between the entities to evaluate site-specific characteristics for a potential advanced nuclear power plant, as well as explore the Natrium plant’s technical design and ability to support Evergy’s customers. Site selection will be based on an evaluation of a variety of factors including community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability of the site to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.

""My administration has always supported an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach when meeting the energy needs of Kansas citizens and businesses,” Governor Laura Kelly said. “We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state, and I'm pleased we're using innovative methods to do just that.""

“Our Natrium technology features a next-generation reactor with enhanced safety and efficiency, paired with utility-scale storage to ensure grid resilience,” said TerraPower president and chief executive officer Chris Levesque. “The TerraPower team is excited to advance conversations with Evergy, state leaders and local communities on the opportunities that the Natrium reactor and energy storage system brings to Kansas.”

“Nuclear energy has been part of Evergy’s generation mix for decades, and this next step will allow us to explore the opportunity to add reliable, non-carbon emitting advanced nuclear energy in the state of Kansas,” said David Campbell, Evergy’s chairman and chief executive officer. “This agreement supports our all-of-the-above energy strategy and will allow us to evaluate the cost, technology, and feasibility of potentially deploying Natrium advanced nuclear plants.”

“Expanding the use of nuclear energy strengthens U.S. energy independence while bringing down electricity costs for Kansas rate payers,” said U.S. Senator Jerry Moran. “TerraPower’s decision to collaborate with Evergy and invest in our state is a testament to the skill, opportunity and capabilities found in Kansas, and this partnership will help to advance energy innovation, bolster the Kansas workforce and make certain our state remains a place where business and talent can thrive.”

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” said U.S. Senator Roger Marshall. “Nuclear produces reliable, clean power—and a lot of it. I’m excited about the prospect of welcoming TerraPower’s Natrium reactor to Kansas and look forward to helping bring this project to fruition so that Kansans can have safe, reliable, and affordable energy.”

“In order to continue our state’s phenomenal surge in economic activity that benefits Kansas residents and communities,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said, “we need to consider all innovative options that strengthen our competitive position while driving down costs for consumers. This project could do both.”

The Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MW of power when needed as it is designed to keep base output steady, ensuring constant reliability, and can quickly ramp up when demand peaks — it is the only advanced reactor design with this capability.

TerraPower broke ground on the first Natrium project in 2024 in Wyoming and is positioned to be America’s next commercial-scale nuclear power plant.

‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

During the conference, Wagner told Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox that America is in the middle of a nuclear renaissance and Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of building and permitting new nuclear reactors for the first time in 50 years to help meet the country’s increasing energy demands.

To tackle the challenge and lead the renaissance, Idaho will need a robust workforce with a variety of skills, Wagner said.

“When you think about your path, fast forward, and we’re building out many reactors in the West and beyond. It’s not just about nuclear engineers anymore,” Wagner said in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun. “It’s about welders. It’s about all the different crafts. It’s about nuclear operators.”

Idaho National Laboratory director says Launch program can help state’s workforce pipeline

Wagner said Little’s Idaho Launch program, which provides up to $8,000 for Idaho students to receive career-technical training or enroll in eligible higher education programs tied to in-demand careers, is an excellent program that he supports.

“Making that easier to get first-generation college graduates into the pipeline is fantastic,” Wagner told the Sun. “I myself am a first generation college graduate, so l love that. That’s a great example of what can be done.”

Little has continuously championed the Idaho Launch program, but funding has come under fire over the past two years by conservative Republican legislators looking to reduce state spending.

Wagner also said new workforce training initiatives need to be launched. He suggested Idaho legislators could look to the Navy Nuclear Power School for ideas and best practices to replicate in Idaho. The Navy Nuclear Power School is a technical training program that helps train enlisted students and officers in math, physics and other disciplines to prepare students to work in nuclear power for the Navy.

Wagner did not have a specific proposal to put forward, but suggested Idaho elected officials could leverage the state’s existing higher education institutions like the College of Eastern Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, University of Idaho and more to develop a workforce training program to prepare students to work at Idaho National Laboratory or in the nuclear industry.

Wagner said he has met with leaders in Utah and Idaho about creating the equivalent of a nuclear power school located in the West.

“How do you leverage what’s there, adjust the curriculum, and provide that sort of package?” Wagner said. “I would love to see us do something like that.”

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell also emphasized the importance of developing a competent and reliable workforce when he spoke Monday during the Energy Superabundance conference at INL.

“My biggest concern I shared with (Govs. Little and Cox): the highest hurdle to success, going forward, is workforce,” Crowell said Monday. “That’s workforce both for trade and scientists and engineers, et cetera. In the private sector, there’s not enough there – they are hiring actively. And on the government side, in the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) we have serious current workforce shortcomings that are going to be exacerbated going forward.”

Idaho National Laboratory has hired 700 to 1,000 employees per year recently

As one of the state’s largest employers, Idaho National Laboratory will continue to need a robust and skilled workforce, Wagner said.

The INL has experienced significant growth in the past seven years, Wagner said. It increased its workforce from about 4,000 employees roughly seven years ago to about 6,000 employees today.

Over the past couple of years, the Idaho National Laboratory has hired between 700 and 1,000 people a year, Wagner said. Although he does not see that level of growth continuing now that he views INL’s staff as “right-sized,” Wagner said the lab will need to continue to hire staff due to attrition, retirement and the need for specialized skills and positions.

“Which is still significant when you’re talking about 6,000 people,” Wagner said. “So we will continue to have those needs.”

Wagner said Idaho National Laboratory employees have not been subject to workforce reductions, early retirement buyouts and deferred resignations that have affected the federal government this year, because INL employees are not federal employees. The U.S. Department of Energy owns the laboratory, but it hires a contractor, Battelle Energy Alliance, to operate and manage the lab. Instead of being federal employees, the Idaho National Laboratory’s workforce are Battelle Energy Alliance employees.

According to Type One, Infinity One will verify important aspects of the Infinity Two fusion pilot plant design and operating efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and affordability.
“We are proud that the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion project could be developed in Oak Ridge, creating high-quality jobs and driving continued economic growth and opportunity for Tennesseans.”","According to the companies, the LOI advances their collaboration in support of a 350-MW baseload fusion power plant, called Infinity Two, at the site near Knoxville, Tenn., using Type One’s stellarator fusion technology.

The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce. The companies hope to have the pilot fusion power plant operational by the mid-2030s.

Infinity One: Project Infinity was born out of a triparty memorandum of understanding signed in 2023 among TVA, Type One, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At the time, the three parties noted “that fusion has the potential to become an attractive carbon-free power generation technology” and had “an interest in the successful development and commercialization of economic and practical fusion energy technologies.”

In February 2024, Type One announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Madison, Wis., to the Bull Run site, which was selected as the location for building the company’s first in situ stellarator testbed, Infinity One.

According to Type One, Infinity One will verify important aspects of the Infinity Two fusion pilot plant design and operating efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and affordability.

Infinity Two: Earlier this year, Type One and TVA signed a cooperative agreement to jointly develop plans for the Infinity Two power plant, and in July the companies signed the first set of commercial contracts related to Project Infinity.

Under the contracts, TVA, through its Power Service Shops facility in Muscle Shoals, Ala., and with support from other locations, will assist in the development of tailored welding and fabrication techniques for the Infinity One stellarator testbed. The manufacturing and construction methods developed for Infinity One will then be applied to the building of Infinity Two.

Type One said that Infinity Two is being developed using today’s existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support the near-term deployment of the stellarator technology.

Quotables: “TVA is a leader in pursuing advanced nuclear technologies we need to power America’s economic prosperity and fuel artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO. “We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies, and I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley.”

“TVA is a best-in-class energy utility that knows how to build, operate, and maintain complex power generation technologies,” said Christofer Mowry, Type One Energy’s CEO. “This LOI with TVA, and the role it establishes for Type One Energy as the fusion technology provider for their Infinity Two project, is therefore fully aligned with our goal of pursuing the lowest-risk approach to commercializing fusion energy.”

“Tennessee is ready-made to lead America’s energy independence, and today’s announcement further strengthens our position as a leader in safe, clean, and reliable energy,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. “We are proud that the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion project could be developed in Oak Ridge, creating high-quality jobs and driving continued economic growth and opportunity for Tennesseans.”",https://www.ans.org/file/21695/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:02:19.046618

The law establishing the new department, Act 458 of the 2025 Regular Session, not only renamed the department but overhauled its structure, powers and permitting processes.
Former Deputy Secretary Dustin Davidson, who worked closely on the reorganization, took over as secretary earlier this month following the resignation of Tyler Gray.
Davidson said the agency’s new structure is designed to modernize operations and bring it in line with today’s industry and environmental needs.
“In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago.","Louisiana will complete a sweeping reorganization of its natural resources agency next week, formally transitioning the Department of Energy and Natural Resources into the newly named Department of Conservation and Energy.

The change, effective Oct. 1, comes after nearly two years of legislative work, public stakeholder input, and internal planning triggered by an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry and a 227 page law passed in June.

The law establishing the new department, Act 458 of the 2025 Regular Session, not only renamed the department but overhauled its structure, powers and permitting processes.

Former Deputy Secretary Dustin Davidson, who worked closely on the reorganization, took over as secretary earlier this month following the resignation of Tyler Gray. Davidson said the agency’s new structure is designed to modernize operations and bring it in line with today’s industry and environmental needs.

“Throughout this effort, we have worked to craft an approach that is guided by the core principles of transparency, balance between economic growth and environmental stewardship, and technology-driven solutions,” Davidson said. “In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago. Technology, industry, and environmental best practices have changed a great deal over those decades, and it’s time this agency caught up.”

The reorganization replaces the department’s four-office structure with six divisions that separate strategic management, administrative services, permitting, enforcement, resource leasing, and energy planning into distinct functions.

Davidson said the new framework is meant to break down information silos and eliminate duplicative processes by creating a single permitting system for coastal and noncoastal areas and establishing a centralized enforcement arm to handle inspections and compliance.

Act 458 also expands the secretary’s authority to issue rules, require financial security for plugging orphan wells, and create expedited permitting programs with defined review timelines

Davidson said there will be “an adjustment period for some time to come – for our staff, as we break decades worth of old habits and workflows that were inefficient but familiar; for the regulated community, who we hope to see embracing the changes we are making to create understandable and predictable processes; and to the people we serve, as we make the changes needed to set and maintain modern standards for environmental protection and resource management.”

The law reorganizing the department functioned as a container for several policy changes, including provisions on expedited permitting, groundwater protections, financial security for well plugging, and expanded rulemaking authority over pipelines, enforcement, and waste disposal.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/09/2.-Depositphotos_Louisiana-state-capital.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:49.654436

“And EPA cannot simply repeal its own standards based on a political whim.
Instead, CARB countered, the document relies on flawed, disproven assertions and data taken out of context.
Instead of standing up for everyday people and businesses, Trump’s EPA is cannibalizing itself to dodge its responsibility to protect health, safety, and the economy.
That is fundamental to the sound development of environmental regulations, CARB said, and is illegal since it turns a blind eye to the EPA’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.","The California Air Resources Board (CARB) on Monday submitted comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) push to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding, noting that the EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.

“Let’s just say the quiet part out loud: EPA’s proposal is a stunningly sloppy and amateurish effort to sow doubt where there is no doubt,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “And EPA cannot simply repeal its own standards based on a political whim. The agency owes the American people straight, honest answers as to why it is proposing to carelessly risk their health, lives and property.”

In a separate comment, California Governor Gavin Newsom called the proposal ""not just putting politics over evidence, it is bad policy, a dereliction of duty, a moral abdication, and a betrayal of the very mission entrusted to (the EPA).""

The EPA has for almost 20 years required medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles to use Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) and aftertreatment systems to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. In July, the Trump administration targeted the endangerment finding for repeal, which has allowed presidential administrations to regulate six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) since 2009.

""Small-business truckers make up 96% of trucking and could be regulated out of existence if this nonsensical rule were to be implemented,"" said Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) President Todd Spencer, whose organization also filed comments in support of the repeal. ""Mom-and-pop trucking businesses would be suffocated by the sheer cost and operational challenges of effectively mandating zero-emission trucks. Vehicle reliability and affordability are top priorities for OOIDA members, and we have yet to see proof that electric commercial motor vehicles are a practical option for most trucking businesses considering the price tag and lack of charging infrastructure.""

CARB’s comments note that the U.S. Department of Energy report on which the EPA is relying was assembled by ""a small group of self-described climate skeptics and is almost totally devoid of scientific evidence to support or explain how they reached their conclusions.""

Instead, CARB countered, the document relies on flawed, disproven assertions and data taken out of context. In addition, CARB said, the EPA acknowledges that it is relying on the DOE report because it does not trust its own analysis, ""shamelessly ceding its responsibility to another agency whose current mandate is to prop up fossil fuels at any cost, including public health,"" according to CARB.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claims rescinding the endangerment finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more ""in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.”

The proposal, if finalized, would remove all Biden- and Obama-era greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines, starting with EPA’s first greenhouse gas regulations set in 2010 for light-duty vehicles and those set in 2011 for medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, which includes off-cycle credits like the start-stop feature on most new cars.

""The Trump Administration wants you to believe that this is a battle about gas-powered cars versus electric ones. That’s a lie,"" said California's Secretary for Environmental Protection Yana Garcia. ""California is fighting for lives. Decades upon decades of science show that climate-warming gases produced by cars, trucks, power plants, and gas facilities are killing people. The proof is clear—more smog, more asthma, and more emergency room visits. Instead of standing up for everyday people and businesses, Trump’s EPA is cannibalizing itself to dodge its responsibility to protect health, safety, and the economy. There’s nothing patriotic about abandoning Americans.""

CARB charges the EPA with ignoring ""the tragic and painful experiences of thousands of Americans who’ve been severely harmed by more intense wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters made worse by climate change. The proposal also discounts the billions of dollars in economic loss sustained each year by the country and the people who live here.""

In 2023 alone, according to Newsom, the United States endured 28 separate climate-driven weather disasters exceeding $1 billion in damage each — the highest number ever recorded — claiming more than 400 American lives and causing $92 billion in damages.

CARB further points out that the EPA leaves no obvious paper trail leading to the environmental impacts of its proposal and therefore provides no opportunity for informed public comment on those impacts. That is fundamental to the sound development of environmental regulations, CARB said, and is illegal since it turns a blind eye to the EPA’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/09/adobestock-3340656.jdFRbFuOhH.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-09-23 16:01:49.524445

This comes after the U.S. Department of Transportation announced plans last month to reinstate the funding, which was paused in February pending review.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the review was necessary to streamline the program and allow states to actually move forward with building chargers. States did have to re-submit their plans.

“The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,” Duffy said. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

The NEVI program is a national initiative funded by the federal 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and dedicates $5 billion to build a nationwide network of public EV charging stations.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has led the charge for the NEVI program. The state joined 19 others in suing the Trump administration when it announced its pause of the program earlier this year.

Polis, a Democrat, expressed great concern with the pause.

“Electric vehicles are saving people money and protecting our air,” he said of the suspension. “The Trump administration is trying to put Colorado EV drivers in a pothole.”

Colorado even went so far as to announce plans in August to invest $5 million of its own money into electric chargers to continue with its clean energy goals, despite concerns about federal funding.

Federal changes to NEVI

The U.S. Department of Transportation said in its announcement of the program's reinstatement that the changes to NEVI were necessary.

“The updates streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape left by the Biden-Buttigieg Administration,” it said. “This will ensure charging stations are actually built, and federal funding is spent effectively and efficiently.”

When the program was paused in February, 84% of NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated. The department said that was a “clear signal of the program’s failure.”

Under the new guidelines for the program:

• Applications will be streamlined.

• The approval process will be simplified.

• States will have more flexibility with where chargers are placed and how the money is used.

Overall, the department said this will “accelerate project delivery.”

NEVI in Colorado

The NEVI program is expected to fund 168 new fast charging ports at 29 locations across Colorado in multiple rounds, with the state itself investing $48 million through the first three rounds.

Though the program was first funded in 2021, it took years for Colorado to open any stations.

Just this year, Colorado opened its first few NEVI-funded electric vehicle charging stations. Ten are currently open throughout the state, while another 50 have been conditionally awarded, according to the NEVI Awards Dashboard.

The NEVI program is part of a broader plan by Colorado to move toward electric vehicles.

Longterm, the state hopes that light-duty electric vehicles will make up “nearly 100%” of the market share by 2050.

“The state envisions the large-scale transition of Colorado’s transportation system to zero emission vehicles,” said Colorado’s 2023 Electric Vehicle Plan.

In 2017, a brand-new Nissan Leaf carried a price tag of about $35,000; today, that same car is yours for less than $6,500. This story repeats across the market. A Hyundai Kona that rolled off the showroom floor in 2021 for more than $43,000 has fallen below $16,000. Even newer models aren’t spared from this kind of depreciation. Take the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: it debuted with a sticker close to $62,000, but after 8,000 miles and less than 12 months on the road, at least one is selling for around $37,000. The drops are even starker in the luxury segment. An Audi e-Tron GT supercar that cost about $124,000 just three years ago is now offered at $52,000. All of this is before government incentives that could bring costs even lower.

In August, plummeting prices sparked a 59 percent year-over-year surge in used EV sales, according to the research firm Cox Automotive. But the trend also begs the question whether even well-priced used EVs are a bad investment in an asset that will continue to depreciate at an alarming rate. Experts say that depends on the car, and on how the buyer would use it.

“I would buy one now,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. In August, used electric cars typically cost about $900 more than similar gas-powered ones, she added, which is the lowest gap on record. It’s a premium that is likely easily made up in gas savings and far lower maintenance costs because electric won’t need, say, oil changes. “There’s a really strong value proposition to buying a used EV,” Valdez Streaty said.

But even a deep discount may not be enough for some people to shake off their earlier experiences, or perceptions, about electric cars, said John Helveston, an engineer and professor at George Washington University who studies technology adoption. As he put it, “if you bought a used Leaf even a few years ago, your experience was likely not great.”

That’s because, until recently, batteries often deteriorated rapidly, which led to untenable driving ranges and often regrettable purchases. But Helveston said the landscape has changed dramatically, with a trend toward more efficient technologies and bigger packs that don’t degrade as fast. Still, most warranties only kick in once the capacity has fallen below 70 percent. So, Helveston said, the car’s original range remains critical and is one of the best indications of how quickly it might depreciate.

“If you’re sub-200 miles as your new starting range, they don’t hold their value very well,” he said. Conversely, that’s why Teslas — with ranges in the 300 or 400 mile realm — have historically depreciated considerably more slowly.

The other piece of good news is that, although research, by Helveston and others, has shown that EVs depreciate much more quickly than gas-powered vehicles in the first two to three years; after that, the rates of decline converge and all cars lose value at a similar pace.

Incentives are another factor to consider. Right now an income-qualified buyer can get up to $4,000 federal tax credit on a used EV costing under $25,000, or as much as $7,500 for a new one. Many states, municipalities and utilities offer rebates as well. But the federal credits go away at the end of month, which could cause electric car prices to inch upwards. On the other hand, a loophole in those incentives led to a glut of leased electric vehicles, more than a million of which are set to hit the used market within the next few years -— which could exert downward pressure on prices. It’s unclear how all those elements will interact.

“There’s no crystal ball on this,” said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at website CarGurus, via e-mail. “But given recent trends, we don’t expect to see the price volatility in used EVs that we’ve seen in the past.”

The bad news is that shopping for used EVs can be a bit of black box.

“With a gas car, between age and mileage you know a lot about that car. In the EV, people have no clue,” said Helveston. Battery health, he explained, is more linked to how the car was used than its age or mileage. If, for example, an owner only used super-fast Level 3 chargers, the battery would take much more of a beating than someone who primarily charged in their garage. Plus, even with recent improvements in battery tech, it’s still hard to predict exactly how a battery will perform five or 10 years out.

“There is this huge gap of information and because of that there’s a hesitance to buy it,” said Helveston. There are, however, some things people can do to mitigate those concerns. The first is to ask the dealer, or seller, to charge a car to 100 percent capacity before the test drive. Then compare the range on the dashboard to the manufacturer’s stated figure when the car was new. That should provide a rough approximation of remaining battery capacity. After a few years, the pack should retain 90 to 95 percent of its rating.

Valdez Streaty, at Cox, said that it’s not uncommon for dealers to either not have, or not know, how to access battery health information, though that process may become more standardized in coming years. In the meantime, she says, the used car auction that Cox operates — Manheim — rates batteries on a scale of 1 to 100. It’s the largest auction network in North America and is used by many dealers, which may be able to pass along any information they receive about the battery.

“Definitely you want something that’s going to be above 80 percent,” she said.

The other option is to ignore range or depreciation and buy the cheapest car possible and drive it into the ground. This works well for people who only need a car for around town — most people don’t drive more than 40 miles a day — and don’t care about features. This is what Helveston did when he bought a ten-year-old Leaf off Facebook Marketplace for $5,000. It had a remaining range of just 60 miles, but he drives no more than 30 per day.

“The miles are double what I need,” he said, and he doesn’t pay for gas or oil changes either. “If it dies on me, I only invested five grand in it and I’ll buy another one.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Jip5RJmoY_ZqaokbNY0CPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/grist_112/c2283f6856827dd4e63d9de99b91e592,N,,2025-09-23 16:02:45.426604

The IURC decides whether a utility can recover the costs of things like power plants — something several utilities are looking to build as data centers drive up energy demand.

Braun said the state needs to keep rates in check while also growing Indiana’s economy.

“We’re seeking entrepreneurial individuals who are going to think out of the box and have a special attention to rates Hoosiers bear in general,"" he said.

Google recently withdrew its proposal for a one in Marion County after facing public backlash. Braun said data centers may not be for every community, but tech companies can also do a better job of highlighting the benefits.

“Met with a rural county just last week that would love to have a data center, because they don't have enough population to support a ton of employees, but they sure could use the [capital expenditures], the assessed value,"" he said.

In other words, they could use the tax revenue for things like schools and roads.

To fill those IURC seats, Braun appointed Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski, former Republican state representative Dollyne Sherman and Floyd County business executive Cory Cochran to the IURC nominating committee.

They’ll review applications with four committee members appointed by the legislature and forward their suggestions to Braun.

The consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition has criticized Braun, calling his statements ""hollow.""

The group said Braun has pushed for expensive nuclear, natural gas and coal instead of more affordable solutions like energy efficiency and community solar.

Consumer advocates have said that the legislature has often tied the hands of the IURC by allowing utilities to approve more kinds of costs and more quickly. The state also created tax incentives for data centers in 2019.

“The rate hikes Hoosiers have endured in recent years are just the tip of the iceberg. We need decisive action to reverse the policies that got us here in the first place and embrace energy solutions that will lower bills and ensure long-term reliability without sending costs through the roof,” Olson said.

When asked whether more should be done by lawmakers to ensure affordable electric bills, Braun said ratepayers need a voice.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Edward Markey sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Tuesday saying he is concerned U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is working in the interest of nuclear power company Oklo, of which he used to be a board member.

Markey, a Democrat, noted that the administration is moving ahead with plans to allow Oklo to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant and transfer government-held plutonium from nuclear weapons to use as fuel in planned reactor projects.

“Oklo stands to benefit financially and Secretary Wright is acting in his former company’s interest,” Markey said.

The White House referred a request for comment to the energy department, which did not respond immediately. Oklo said it had no comment.

Oklo said this month it plans to build and operate a plant in Tennessee to reprocess nuclear waste as the first phase of a nuclear fuel center costing up to $1.68 billion.

Reuters reported in August the government plans to make available 20 metric tons of plutonium to nuclear companies. Oklo has not said it wants to use the plutonium and the department has not announced plans on the material.

But an energy department source said Oklo has been in touch with the agency about using the radioactive metal and that top energy officials were having conversations with the company about it.

Markey asked Trump questions about Wright’s connection to decision making and the Republican secretary’s financial interest in Oklo.

Trump in May ordered the government to halt much of its existing program to dispose of plutonium, and instead provide it as a fuel for reactors.

The idea of using surplus plutonium as fuel and extracting it from nuclear waste has concerned nuclear safety experts who say it could increase risks of proliferation and make it hard for the U.S. to tell other countries not to pursue similar technologies.

How Can We Build the Battery Supply Chain in Alabama?
This could provide a more predictable and timely development process for new battery industry facilities across the country.","As the global market for batteries continues to accelerate, American companies and communities are building out the supply chain to grow this industry across the nation. In the emerging “Battery Belt,” which includes much of the Southeast United States, the industry benefits from a unique advantage to cluster raw materials production, midstream manufacturing, and the final assembly of large grid-scale and electric vehicle batteries.

The opportunity to develop across the full value chain shines in Alabama, which has a history of mineral production, a natural graphite deposit, and is already a major player in the automotive industry.

This September, C2ES cohosted a roundtable event with the Alabama Mobility and Power (AMP) Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as our first of three state specific conversations across the southeast United States. Participants included innovative startups and large multi-national companies, academia and research institutions, economic development professionals, and local and national non-profits. Together, these stakeholders led a conversation on how Alabama can leverage its competitive advantages to boost economic opportunity across the state.

Participants engaged in group discussions around common challenges in the industry and a strategic policy workshop to develop big picture goals and actionable next steps to accelerate the emerging sector’s growth here in America. Participants also had the chance to tour the AMP Center’s new advanced Power Research Lab, the Alabama Materials Institute, and the site of the upcoming Battery Research Lab. These labs, in partnership with the private sector, are supercharging battery research and innovation needed to meet growing demand for these technologies.

Why talk battery supply chain in Alabama?

Alabama offers a solid foundation for new battery supply chain development.

The state has a mature industrial base in several key sectors that would be compatible with new battery industry entrants, including defense and aerospace technologies and automotive manufacturing.

State agencies have been hard at work developing innovative strategies to attract and support new businesses in Alabama. The Economic Development Partnership of Alabama launched the Site Evaluation Economic Development Strategy (SEEDS), which offers a matching grant program for new facilities’ site assessment and development. Often a major barrier for new business, this program can help accelerate site development timelines by reducing financial hurdles.

To support companies as they grow their presence in Alabama, the s Alabama Department of Commerce’s workforce development, the Alabama Industrial Development Training (AIDT), offers customized training for companies at no cost. This includes construction of a new $30 million training hub for EV manufacturing and related battery industries. In an emerging industry, ensuring workers have the skills they need to succeed will help new facilities get up and running quickly and efficiently, while helping to build a long-term talent pipeline.

Driving these efforts are ambassadors from the state’s economic development, utilities, workforce training, and research institutions. This battery team, which includes the Alabama Mobility and Power (AMP) Center, aims to identify, recruit, and convene innovative companies, investors, and industry leaders in the state as Alabama looks to push the battery sector forward.

How Can We Build the Battery Supply Chain in Alabama?

During the roundtable conversation in Alabama, a key question emerged: How do companies address the cost of manufacturing at scale to meet the needs of a consumer market? With so many first of a kind factories looking to build in the United States, achieving economies of scale is critical to this nascent American industry.

Several supportive foundations emerged from the conversation to help reach this scale in Alabama, across the region, and country. Participants agreed that supportive and stable federal policy frameworks provide the certainty needed to unlock private markets to invest in new battery businesses. At the state level, workforce development and site preparedness, an area where Alabama leads nationally, is paramount to new business development.

Yet even with these supportive frameworks in place, one large barrier remains for companies looking to build their facilities in Alabama and across the region — access to private capital. Companies building these new first of a kind facilities in a highly technical field are hard pressed to find investors with the knowledge and patience to back capital-intensive business with long return timelines.

What’s Next?

To address these challenges and build out Alabama’s work on creating a supportive business environment for new battery supply chain companies, participants in the roundtable engaged in a policy and strategy workshop. Through this effort we collectively developed recommendations and experiments to move the industry forward, which will be shared in upcoming conversation takeaways and ultimately formal policy recommendations from C2ES.

Other near-term opportunities include upcoming federal legislation for permitting reform. This could provide a more predictable and timely development process for new battery industry facilities across the country.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1442852776-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:48.810791

Closing the EV confidence gap through remanufacturing As the EV market continues to evolve, battery remanufacturing represents a sustainable, cost-effective approach to extending battery life and building consumer confidence.","Trust is the foundation of the most fulfilling relationships. And when it comes to EVs compared to internal-combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles, range anxiety, a lack of national charging infrastructure, and costs, among other general misconceptions, are not helping consumers confidently choose electric.

However, a recent white paper, “Closing the EV Confidence Gap: The Role of Battery Remanufacturing,” from UK-based Autocraft EV Solutions, a part of the Autocraft Solutions Group, offers new perspectives on the subject. “This report aims to start an evidence-based conversation on why now is the time to embrace EV battery repair,” author Sara Ridley, engineering and quality director of Autocraft Solutions Group, told Battery Technology. “To prevent waste, we must maximize the use of every healthy cell. Our data underscores why this is essential—and why the success of electric vehicles depends on it.”

The economics of EV battery remanufacturing: 50% cost reduction

While still a fraction of overall vehicle manufacturing, the growth trajectory for EVs remains robust, even amid US rollbacks of tax advantages and environmental regulations. S&P Global Mobility has revised projections for US BEV sales by 2030 downward from more than 6.5 million vehicles annually to 5 million—still growing but facing significant headwinds. This would mean BEVs would account for about 30% of the US market.

Resolving uncertainty about battery performance would go a long way toward growing that number. The challenge lies in the complexity of safely identifying and fixing EV battery failure causes in modern vehicles, leading many industry experts to dismiss battery repair technology as a viable option. Awareness of potential EV battery remanufacturing options remains critically low.

“All too often, manufacturers are handling in-warranty failures by simply recycling the pack and replacing it with a new one,” Ridley writes. “Meanwhile, for out-of-warranty vehicles, the mere possibility of battery failure undermines consumer confidence, particularly given the high cost of replacement.”

Key battery repair statistics

The comprehensive dataset in Autocraft's report is based on a specific sample of 559 commercial EV battery repairs conducted in 2024. The packs contained an average of 13.5 modules each. “This work was delivered alongside extensive development work on other pack types, where we tested thousands of additional packs to consolidate our understanding of why EV batteries fail and how to fix them,” the report says.

One result the data reveals is that restoring in-warranty battery packs to optimal condition requires replacing just 1.1 modules on average: In other words, whole batteries don’t fail, individual cells do.

This reveals that there’s no benefit to scrapping largely healthy batteries and relegating them to recycling: “On average, 92% of modules within battery packs that have failed within the warranty period remain functional,” the report details. “These modules can be used in repairing other packs at a fraction of the environmental and financial cost of full replacement.

By addressing the specific root cause of failure, batteries can be repaired in the most targeted, cost-effective, and carbon-efficient way possible. In contrast, replacing an entire battery pack for what is essentially a localized issue is excessive and expensive, discouraging EV ownership.

One OEM’s experience: Battery remanufacturing in action

The white paper includes a revealing case study of a major vehicle manufacturer facing rising warranty costs for EV batteries. Even with relatively low failure rates, recycling all failed units to replace them with new ones was becoming financially unsustainable. The manufacturer initially believed there was no reliable method to detect battery failure causes and cost-effectively return units to service.

Following an initial pilot study with Autocraft's OptEVizer dynamic testing protocol—an advanced battery diagnostics system—test results on three failed battery packs were analyzed and cross-referenced with Autocraft's digital twin containing data from thousands of previous repairs. This technology enabled quick and precise identification of the root cause of pack failure at a cellular level and facilitated the identification of suitable replacement modules from batteries already designated for recycling.

The results exceeded expectations:

For the OEM, these results exceeded expectations, giving them the confidence to shift their warranty strategy, prioritizing EV battery remanufacturing over the costly replace-and-recycle approach. The environmental impact of a single repair was substantial, saving 10,500kg of CO2 per battery on their main running vehicle model.

Scaling sustainable battery solutions

Autocraft is now collaborating closely with the manufacturer to implement battery remanufacturing at scale from its dedicated EV battery repair center in the Netherlands. The facility handles batteries ranging from 30 kWh to 90kWh capacity. While specific repair cost data remains commercially sensitive, this approach achieves cost reductions exceeding 50% compared to traditional replacement and recycling methods.

When factoring in monthly carbon emissions reductions for just one customer—exceeding 500,000kg per month—the scale of this opportunity for the broader automotive industry becomes evident. Battery life extension through remanufacturing represents a critical pathway to sustainable transportation.

Closing the EV confidence gap through remanufacturing

As the EV market continues to evolve, battery remanufacturing represents a sustainable, cost-effective approach to extending battery life and building consumer confidence. By focusing on data-driven repair solutions rather than wholesale replacement, manufacturers can effectively address the EV confidence gap while significantly reducing environmental impact.

The evidence from Autocraft's study demonstrates that targeted battery repair technology not only makes economic sense but also substantially contributes to sustainability goals. For consumers concerned about battery longevity and replacement costs, the emergence of sophisticated battery diagnostics and repair options offers reassurance that EV ownership can be both practical and affordable over the vehicle's lifetime.

Industry adoption of remanufacturing practices will be essential to building a truly sustainable EV ecosystem that maximizes the value of every battery component while minimizing waste and environmental impact.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt855efe32b6734593/68d2e8dd1dbf262a8f4fb727/REVIVE_Mobile_lifting_module_from_pack_(3).jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-23 16:01:22.865675

Gov. Mike Braun is seeking “entrepreneurial” candidates to fill three vacancies on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and take on rising customer bills.

“If you’re interested in protecting ratepayers, ensuring Indiana has a stable energy supply … and if you can bring objectivity and fairness to the table, we want to hear from you,” Braun said.

“We will ensure that energy progress doesn’t come at the expense of Hoosier ratepayers’ ability to afford their energy bills,” he added, speaking during a Tuesday news conference.

Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett are leaving in October — months before their terms were set to end — and Chair Jim Huston’s term lapsed in April, but he will remain until a replacement is chosen.

Braun finalized a nominating committee, which will conduct interviews after the application period ends Oct. 14.

He named three appointees: Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzie Jaworowski; former state Rep. Dollyne Sherman; and Cory Cochran, an executive at commercial construction firm McRae Enterprises.

They join four appointees by the Indiana General Assembly:

Indiana Senate Republicans: Jim Merritt, president of JWM Consulting Corp. and a former state senator.

Indiana House Democrats: Grant Smith, a senior energy policy adviser at the Civil Society Institute.

Indiana House Republicans: Bill Champion, of corrugated pipe manufacturer Fratco.

Indiana Senate Democrats: Lindsay Shipps Haake, a government affairs specialist who has lobbied for utility customer advocates.

Asked if the nominating committee already has candidates in mind, Jaworowski said, “No, a lot of people have expressed interest, but we don’t know who will apply yet.”

The group will make recommendations, but final decisions are up to Braun.

Indiana is in the minority of states that gives the executive branch complete control over utility regulator selection.

In 13 states, they’re elected — mostly by voters, but also by lawmakers or political parties, according to research by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility customer advocacy group.

In 33 states, regulators are appointed but must be confirmed by the legislative branch. Appointed regulators in Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada and New Hampshire aren’t.

Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. It is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website.

But Braun suggested it has leaned too far in one direction.

“Ratepayers, I think, have taken the brunt of it,” he told reporters — and called the affordability uproar “very analogous to what we went through on property taxes.”

Braun asserted that, just as taxpayers didn’t have high-powered lobbyists representing them in the property tax debate, “probably ratepayers don’t” when it comes to utilities.

“That’s where someone’s got to be a voice for it,” he said. “And I will be that voice.”

Braun also named a new leader for the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor this month. Counselor Abby Gray’s first public action was to recommend denial of one utility company’s proposed hike — and endorse reductions in its current rates.

“Utility companies … had legitimate cost increases,” Braun said. “But whenever you go beyond covering your costs and it looks like you’re trying to do more, then you’re taking advantage of a system that needs to be a little more attentive.”

The application announcement came as Citizens Action Coalition launched a utility affordability campaign targeted at Braun — dubbed “Stop Mike’s Hikes.” It includes digital, outdoor and radio advertising, according to a Tuesday news release.

“Hoosiers are hurting, and Governor Braun has the chance to lead. He’s inherited an energy landscape that’s been carefully designed to benefit utilities and big industry,” Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson said. “The rate hikes Hoosiers have endured in recent years are just the tip of the iceberg. We need decisive action to reverse the policies that got us here in the first place and embrace energy solutions that will lower bills and ensure long-term reliability without sending costs through the roof.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/p9233803-1024x7681758658658.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=CXx0uS4O,N,,2025-09-23 17:06:49.056079

Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit , the benefit provides a tax discount of up to $7,500 for a new electric car and up to $4,000 for a used one. It expires on Sept. 30.

The tax credit was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and initially set to last through 2032. That timeline was cut short, however, by Congress’ recent tax and spending-cut law, known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades .

The electric vehicle credits are income-based. For a new car, the benefit applies to people whose adjusted gross income is no more than $150,000 or $225,000 for heads-of-household. For joint tax filers, they must make no more than $300,000 to use the credit.

For used vehicles, the income thresholds are $75,000 for individuals, $122,500 for heads-of-household, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The vehicles must also meet certain requirements. For new cars, that includes having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and having undergone final assembly in North America. For used vehicles, the car’s sale price cannot exceed $25,000, not including taxes or title and registration fees, along with other requirements.

While the federal incentive ends on Sept. 30, Colorado will continue offering a state-level tax credit for electric vehicles, though the benefit will be considerably smaller next year.

Our designers, along with their sustainability experts, are exploring applicable design, sustainable practices and feasibility.","Prior to joining UNC Charlotte in 2022, Cheryl Walker, an architect and project manager, already was a trailblazer for sustainable construction and planning in North Carolina. She spearheaded the first LEED project in Mecklenburg County, ImaginOn, which spurred several other sustainable firsts for the city of Charlotte and institutions for higher education.

As a member of the advisory committee for the Triangle J Council of Governments, she was part of a team to develop a construction and demolition waste management specification. This tool, funded by a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency, was adopted nationally to help owners, designers and contractors implement waste management practices on all projects. She worked with the firm that designed the Center City Building, now The Dubois Center at UNC Charlotte Center City. Their efforts enabled the facility to obtain LEED gold certification.

Today, as a planner in facilities planning, design and construction, she coordinates with campus leadership, facilities management, the Office of Sustainability, the design consultants, commissioning agents and contractors to integrate sustainable goals and practices near the start of project planning.

In this Q&A, Walker explains her move from the private sector to the University, how sustainability is integrated into the planning process and the long-term benefits of thoughtful design for the campus community.

What inspired your transition from private architectural practice to working at UNC Charlotte?

Most of my private practice has been designing civic and municipal projects and projects for higher education. I have a long history working with universities in North Carolina. I thought, instead of being the designer that’s hired by a university, what would it be like to be on the other side of the table where the planning happens?

I find this work really rewarding, being tasked with the responsibilities of helping the whole team — the university, the designers, technical consultants — make informed environmental decisions that have lasting impact on the quality and operations of campus buildings.

How do you integrate sustainability into campus planning and construction projects?

It starts in the advanced planning phase where you have the maximum engagement with the constituents: academic units, University leadership and facilities groups, including sustainability, engineering, maintenance and grounds. I coordinate University working groups that meet regularly with the designer to establish the project mission, goals and programmatic needs for each project and develop strategies to attain these. Sustainable goals and enabling strategies are reviewed at every phase of the project. This process is essential in how I make sustainability an integral part of the project.

As meetings continue throughout every phase of a project, it’s important to keep participants engaged. The Office of Sustainability has a lot to offer, so I invite them to the table. Our engineering group has an enormous capability in sustainable strategies that can be applied to a project. Our maintenance and operations folks are invested in ongoing performance and operation of buildings.

Unless sustainable goals are brought up early and consensus achieved, we lose sight of the maximum opportunities.

Twenty-five years ago, few firms in our area were knowledgeable and committed to delivering sustainable solutions for their clients. A cohesive framework for applying sustainable strategies was lacking. Fast forward to today and the landscape is very different. Firms and contractors are well schooled in recognized green strategies. A variety of rating systems exist to hold us accountable to our stated goals. Fortunately, UNC Charlotte has many people that see the value that this brings to the University over time.

What are some projects you’re working on that emphasize sustainable design?

One that’s about to begin construction is the Burson renovation and expansion project. In the advanced planning stage, the University wanted us to look at what was possible to achieve in terms of sustainability.

We decided to look at it through the lens of the LEED system. We had a design team that featured sustainability experts and commissioning agents who focused on achieving better energy efficiency and air quality. One criterion for higher a construction manager is their track record on delivering sustainable projects.The Charlotte facilities team is invested in realizing these goals. The project is registered with LEED, and we’re shooting for gold status.

I’m currently leading the advanced planning for the Smith Comprehensive Renovation. Our designers, along with their sustainability experts, are exploring applicable design, sustainable practices and feasibility.

What long-term benefits do sustainable buildings offer to students and the University?

Constructing a well-designed building that uses less energy and conserves water, improves indoor quality of learning spaces and introduces natural daylighting will have environmental benefits. The University can see improved performance, less costs and easier maintenance.

I’m always interested in the benefits for the users, the students. Students viscerally experience air quality within the classroom from its temperature to its smell. With good indoor air quality and good energy management, the learning conditions can vastly improve. Well-chosen construction materials have a lot to do with the indoor air quality of a room.

Another aspect that impacts students is lighting. Low energy cost lighting, particularly natural lighting, can greatly improve the experience of sitting in class and doing work.

There are lots of studies that try to tie high-level sustainable buildings to productivity and learning outcomes. Researchers also are looking at single elements such as self-sustaining green wall systems. And you can take it a step further, integrating the air flows from a wall system with the HVAC system to study the microbiome.

Some very talented professors, researchers and students are starting to track outcomes, and it will take time to gather data. These kinds of innovations, especially if it’s very visible to the student, can have more impacts and create a conducive learning environment.",https://inside.charlotte.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1289/2025/09/Cheryl-Walker.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:53.090074

The agreement will see Ontario work toward supplying tritium, a critical fuel for nuclear fusion, to support the UKAEA’s research and development projects.
The MOU will also support fusion energy development projects in Ontario and Canada, opening new opportunities for local industries and supply chain partners.
“This historic agreement cements Ontario’s long-standing role at the forefront of next generation nuclear energy,” Lecce said.
The UKAEA leads the world’s largest publicly funded research and development program focused on making fusion energy commercially viable.","Ontario has signed a new partnership with the United Kingdom to advance nuclear fusion energy research and innovation.

At the International Tritium Conference in Ottawa on Monday, Minister Stephen Lecce announced that Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) Group have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The agreement will see Ontario work toward supplying tritium, a critical fuel for nuclear fusion, to support the UKAEA’s research and development projects.

The province said the deal leverages Ontario’s nuclear advantage to expand export opportunities, create jobs, and build a more competitive and resilient economy in the face of U.S. tariffs. OPG will provide a secure and reliable tritium supply to fuel UKAEA’s facilities, further establishing Ontario as a leader in the international nuclear energy sector. The MOU will also support fusion energy development projects in Ontario and Canada, opening new opportunities for local industries and supply chain partners.

“This historic agreement cements Ontario’s long-standing role at the forefront of next generation nuclear energy,” Lecce said. “From building the G7’s first Small Modular Reactor to powering breakthroughs in fusion and medical isotopes, Ontario is leading the world’s clean energy future. We’re exporting our expertise, creating jobs at home and showing the world what energy security looks like.”

Ontario’s tritium is sourced from CANDU reactors, extracted from heavy water during routine operations. As tritium decays, it produces helium-3, a rare and valuable isotope used in quantum computing and with potential as a future fuel for fusion reactors.

The UKAEA leads the world’s largest publicly funded research and development program focused on making fusion energy commercially viable. Tritium supplied by Ontario could play a significant role in projects such as the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production, a prototype fusion power plant expected to prove the viability of fusion technology by the early 2040s.

“Ontario Power Generation is proud to build on our world-class leadership in producing life-saving medical isotopes and our 50-plus year history of operating safe, clean and reliable nuclear power generation,” said Kim Lauritsen, OPG’s Senior Vice President of Enterprise Strategy and Growth. “This agreement demonstrates how OPG is leveraging Ontario’s isotope and nuclear expertise to support and power the promise of nuclear fusion.”

Steve Wheeler, Executive Director of Fusion Technology at the UKAEA, said the agreement strengthens the partnership between the two jurisdictions. “OPG has played a critical part in enabling the fundamental fusion research that has become a foundation for the international fusion community,” Wheeler said. “This MOU strengthens UKAEA’s strategic relationship with the Government of Ontario and OPG to drive progress toward delivering future fusion powerplants.”

The province said the initiative is a key part of Energy for Generations, Ontario’s long-term plan to deliver reliable, affordable and secure energy to support the economy. Officials said the plan is protecting jobs, supporting workers and driving growth for the future.

Nolan Quinn, Ontario’s Minister of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security, said the agreement positions the province as a global hub for clean energy and nuclear research. “Ontario’s world-class researchers are driving our economy and cementing the province as an epicentre of clean energy and nuclear innovation,” Quinn said. “This monumental agreement will accelerate cutting-edge energy developments, advance the production and commercialization of crucial clean energy and expand Ontario’s role in the global energy market.”

Ontario noted that its nuclear reactors also produce isotopes used worldwide in health care, energy and industrial applications. OPG has previously supplied tritium for the Joint European Torus fusion experiment in the U.K.",https://sydenhamcurrent.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/cropped-SYDENHAM-CURRENT-LOGO-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-23 18:02:03.560627

“It requires a strong network of pipelines and infrastructure to move natural gas efficiently and ensure reliable power for end users.

The pipelines carrying 6.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas in the region can only transport so much of it to meet the congested field of customers.","ODESSA, Texas (AP) — Big data centers that power the artificial intelligence industry demand an abundance of energy.

West Texas — known for producing 40% of the nation’s crude oil — also has an extraordinary amount of natural gas that could power those data centers. But the region lacks adequate infrastructure to convert the gas, a byproduct of pumping oil, into electricity and transmit it to the growing industry, experts said.

“Meeting this unprecedented demand takes more than production alone,” said Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, a trade group. “It requires a strong network of pipelines and infrastructure to move natural gas efficiently and ensure reliable power for end users. In Texas, expanding this network has never been more important to keep pace with growth.”

The lack of infrastructure puts the Permian Basin region at a major disadvantage compared to other oil and gas producing regions, said Jason Jennaro, CEO of FrontierGen, a business analytics company that helps industrial developers secure land.

Oil and gas companies in West Texas will need to compete with those in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales, two other major oil basins in southern and eastern Texas, for customers on the hunt for remarkable amounts of natural gas.

Further complicating the matter is the number of companies with high energy needs, including cryptocurrency facilities, Jennaro said, who authored a report in September, evaluating different Texas oil basins and their potential to bring energy to AI. The oil and gas industry itself is also increasingly needing more energy.

“The demand for generation, particularly in high voltage transmission, is going to have to be spread across a number of different industries looking to pursue it,” Jennaro said.

Jennaro said the United States will need to add roughly 400 terawatts — enough energy to power France for a year — in five years to satisfy AI demand. His study relied on estimates from McKinsey and the Energy Information Administration, a government analysis agency.

Texas is also expecting more demand. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s main grid operator, may have to nearly double in size by 2030, according to its own forecasts. The demand is mostly coming from data centers and the oil and gas industry.

The dearth of ways to carry gas that surfaces along with crude oil in the Permian Basin is not just lost revenue; it’s a money pit. Earlier this year, oil companies were paying other companies to take the gas. Supplying that gas to data center companies would mean West Texas producers could turn the financial drain into profit.

Among the first steps to realizing that goal, the region needs gas plants to generate electricity. Longanecker said oil companies are spending billions of dollars in West Texas for such projects.

But it won’t be so simple as building facilities. More pipelines are also needed. The pipelines carrying 6.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas in the region can only transport so much of it to meet the congested field of customers.

The oil fields of Eagle Ford and Haynesville, on the other hand, are better equipped with transmission lines, less congestion of industries and proximity to liquefied natural gas hubs. The two also have a more robust fiber optic network.

Longanecker said that the federal government should reform pipeline permitting to shorten the approval process, which can take up to seven years.

Jennaro said he’s bullish about a state plan in Texas to build transmission lines capable of transmitting higher voltages of electricity. The Permian Basin Reliability Plan, passed by lawmakers in 2023, is set to be built by 2030.

“In our opinion, we are entering America’s Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution will be defined by the creation of large industrial nexus points where substantial amounts of electricity, transmission, natural gas, water, and fiber optics converge,” Jennaro said. “Texas and its energy basins are a great place for this.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group representing nearly all major automakers asked the Trump administration Tuesday to roll back aggressive vehicle emissions limits that seek to force the industry to build a rising number of electric vehicles.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and other major automakers, said in a filing with the Environmental Protection Agency that legislation signed by President Donald Trump in June will increase the effective price of EVs and could lead to a near-term decline in EV market share.

They argue rules finalized last year under President Joe Biden are no longer feasible.

“The 2027 and later standards are simply not achievable in light of significant market, charging infrastructure, supply chain, affordability, and other challenges as well as recent policy changes enacted,” the group said.

The 2024 Biden rules aim to cut passenger vehicle fleetwide tailpipe emissions by nearly 50% by 2032 compared with 2027 projected levels. The EPA forecast between 35% and 56% of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would need to be electric.

On Sept. 30, the $7,500 EV tax credit expires and automakers warn that “a significant portion” of automakers may lose a battery production tax credit for EVs typically worth $3,000 per year next year under the law.

“This harms not only the automotive manufacturers that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars investing in electric vehicle technology, but also the entire supply chain that has supported these initiatives,” the group said.

In July, the EPA proposed rescinding the long-standing finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health, removing the legal foundation for all U.S. greenhouse gas regulations, a move that would end current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from vehicle tailpipes.

Democrats in Congress and environmental groups have called on the EPA to drop its plan and retain the rules.

Automakers argue the EPA should still rewrite the Biden rules, saying they “still need to be revised to feasible levels to provide certainty for the industry.” The group said “such a contingency plan will be critical if motor vehicle GHG standards are retained or reinstated in some way.”

“If we look past the noise, the facts show a world aligning with the Paris agreement,” he said.
The impacts of the climate crisis were also accelerating, he added, so progress needed to be much faster.
Governments are obliged, under the Paris agreement, to produce fresh national plans – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – on curbing greenhouse gases.
Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris agreement.","Harnessing artificial intelligence will help the world to tackle the climate crisis, but governments must step in to regulate the technology, the UN’s climate chief has said.

AI is being used to make energy systems more efficient, and to develop tools to reduce carbon from industrial processes. The UN is also using AI as an aid to climate diplomacy.

But concerns over the vast and increasing energy requirements of large datacentres must prompt governments to act, said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change.

“AI is not a ready-made solution, and it carries risks. But it can also be a gamechanger. So we now need to blunt its dangerous edges, sharpen its catalytic ones, and put it astutely to work,” he said. “If you run a major AI platform, power it with renewables, and innovate to drive energy efficiency.”

He added: “Done properly, AI releases human capacity, not replaces it. Most important is its power to drive real-world outcomes: managing microgrids, mapping climate risk, guiding resilient planning.”

Stiell gave an upbeat assessment of the state of global climate action, saying the world was “aligning with the Paris agreement”, with renewable energy booming, and governments set to produce fresh commitments on cutting carbon.

Speaking on Monday on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, where world leaders have gathered amid stark geopolitical tensions, conflict and economic strains, he made a robust defence of climate diplomacy, in the face of outright hostility from Donald Trump’s White House.

“If we look past the noise, the facts show a world aligning with the Paris agreement,” he said. “Investment in renewables has increased tenfold in 10 years. The clean energy transition is booming across almost all major economies, and hit $2tn last year alone.”

China has led the global clean energy boom, but others – including the EU, India, African nations and Latin America – are also seeing widespread uptake of clean options. Investment has hit obstacles in the US, where Trump has ordered the dismantling of federal efforts to tackle the climate crisis, but many state governments and companies are continuing with their commitments.

Companies are seeing economic opportunities in the shift to a low-carbon world, but more finance is still needed. According to research published on Monday by the Industrial Transition Accelerator, of more than 700 low-carbon industrial installations in planning and development around the world, only 15 a year were gaining the finance necessary to go into full production. This represented a $1.6tn (£1.2tn) opportunity for investors, the group said.

Citing the research, Stiell said: “We’re not waiting for miracles. The economics are on our side. Over 90% of new renewables cost less than the cheapest new fossil option. The technologies and solutions already exist.”

But he said the benefits of the race to a low-carbon economy were not yet being felt “in living rooms”, though companies were seeing the difference. “This boom is uneven. Its vast benefits are not shared by all,” said Stiell.

The impacts of the climate crisis were also accelerating, he added, so progress needed to be much faster. Governments are obliged, under the Paris agreement, to produce fresh national plans – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – on curbing greenhouse gases. They were due in February, but Stiell extended the deadline to this month ahead of the crunch Cop30 climate summit in Brazil in November, where the next decade of climate action will be discussed.

Many major economies – including the EU, China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia – have yet to formally submit their national plans. Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris agreement.

Stiell, who in a recent interview with the Guardian called for more emphasis on the positive economic opportunities of the climate crisis, said: “Every Cop has its challenges. And there are always naysayers. But they are only the story if we make them the story.

“Right now we need to reaffirm, sending a stronger, unmistakable signal: the world is still rock-solid behind Paris, and fully onboard for climate cooperation – because it works, and together we will make it work faster.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de65968274b441ea71a2fca7623809f86ae08587/809_0_6870_5493/master/6870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed9db385c90001c5e51a0bb099363bb8",N,,2025-09-23 16:01:40.454328

With support from companies like Schneider Electric, Microsoft, Zurich, and Arcadis, the coalition aims to fortify the U.S. power grid before current federal clean energy incentives expire.

The initiative arrives at a pivotal moment. Experts forecast that by 2028, the U.S. power grid could hit a tipping point, where electricity supply may no longer meet peak demand. This strain—driven by rising energy needs, extreme weather, and cybersecurity risks—already contributes to economic losses estimated at $150 billion annually from power outages.

To help offset these risks, the coalition is mobilizing $7.5 billion in identified funding to support infrastructure projects at critical facilities like schools, hospitals, airports, water treatment plants, and municipal campuses. This capital is designed to make resilience upgrades financially viable, even for budget-constrained organizations.

Financing models like Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) and Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) are central to the strategy. These tools allow organizations to bypass large upfront investments by funding upgrades through long-term savings or operational budgets—unlocking access to cleaner, more reliable power without financial strain.

Localized Energy Systems Drive Real-World Results

The coalition’s technical approach centers on distributed energy resources (DERs)—a mix of systems that reduce dependency on the centralized grid. These include solar panels, battery storage, EV charging infrastructure, and geothermal systems, often integrated into microgrids that can function independently during outages or peak load events.

Technology providers like AlphaStruxure, Sunrock, and Schneider Electric are supporting project deployments with scalable microgrid systems. Schneider’s EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex and Energy Control Center are being used to optimize and manage distributed assets, while their national EcoXpert partner network delivers on-the-ground implementation.

In Maryland, Montgomery County has installed AlphaStruxure microgrids at two bus depots, powering electric buses with a 6.5 MW system. In Piscataway, New Jersey, a comprehensive microgrid project supports eight municipal buildings and includes battery storage with five days of backup power, 2.9 MW of solar, and 28 EV chargers—all expected to reduce the township's carbon footprint by over 50% by 2026.

Longview Independent School District in Texas has also adopted solar infrastructure across 10 schools, projecting $450,000 in annual utility savings and a reduction of roughly 9 million pounds of CO₂ emissions.

Beyond sustainability goals, these projects provide real operational benefits: energy cost stability, improved outage resilience, and long-term fiscal savings.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250919-102554-139-getty-images-jEB8A9l7ffQ-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:26.906117

Jason Bordoff: Following the rollback of key climate provisions from the inflation reduction Act, the debate over America’s energy future feels very contentious. The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has eliminated or at least cobbled many of the clean energy incentives that were centerpieces of Biden-era climate policy. This week, climate policymakers, business leaders, investors and advocates are converging in New York City for Climate Week. With so much happening and many questions around the pace of the energy transition, it’s a crucial moment in US energy policy.

When we told it around the family table, we started a little earlier that in 1970, well I was born in ‘71 … in 1975 my dad testified before the Senate on the bill that would become PURPA and founded a company that ultimately came Trigen Energy that was the largest district energy company in the United States. They built the third qualifying facility in the country in Trenton, New Jersey. That was a couple of Detroit diesels recovering waste heat, and then providing steam and chilled water to the municipal buildings in Trenton. Little fun fact, the plant manager of that facility was a guy named Don Leibowitz whose son Jon would change his last name to Stewart and go on to have a celebrity career outside of that. And so suffice to say, I kind of grew up thinking PURPA was a word, thinking QF was a word and thinking that ConEdison usually had an expletive in front of it.

Jason Bordoff: Hence for FERCalicious and nerding out on energy policy in a way few members of Congress can. And it sounds like we have a lot in common, not only being almost exactly the same age, but we have a house down the Jersey shore and spend a lot of time in areas not far from there. And in all the extensive preparation I do, I see that if you were going to do anything else, it would be to be part of the E Street band, which I think I have two photos in my office other than family. One is with President Obama and the other is Springsteen.

Rep. Sean Casten: Oh wow. I’ve only got one of those pictures, but I’d like the other one.

Jason Bordoff: And before we finish the hour together, given that you represent Chicago and I’m a born and raised New Yorker, you’ll need to explain to everyone listening why New York pizza is better than Chicago, which I also discovered in all of my research about you.

Rep. Sean Casten: I mean the answer to that one. And you get into politics and you’re supposed to provide things with political answers, but I got a degree in biochemistry and biochemical engineering when something is just factually true, you don’t want to get into the politics of whether you should suggest something to the contrary. And I did grow up in New York for what it’s worth. So it’s my formative pizza years.

Jason Bordoff: This is the sort of honest truth telling we want on this podcast. Okay. So now talk about the challenges of doing this kind of work in Congress at this moment. I mean, it’s hard enough to sit in a place like Columbia where I am and teach PURPA to people. These are really complicated issues. How do you view the engagement level of knowledge across all of these issues on the hill generally maybe these days? And then maybe talk a little bit about what it’s like to try to work in any sort of bipartisan fashion if that’s even possible these days?

Rep. Sean Casten:

I guess the first thing I’d note is that energy policy as much as nerds like you, and I think it’s really important and really critical and is at the core of everything we do. I mean arguably, I mean, energy policy, ag policy and healthcare policy, if we get those three right, we’ll be healthy, wealthy and wise, right? And I’ll throw in education policy, voters by and large don’t care a lot about energy policy. They care about it when there’s a blackout, but it’s something that people just assume is going to be there. And I say that because there’s not a lot of political pressure for people to come up to speed on energy policy before coming to Congress, and that’s not criticizing my colleagues. It’s just what are the things that you’re incentivized to spend your limited time learning about? And one of my biggest frustrations is that there’s no real appreciation of the value chain of the energy system.

And if you think about, suppose that the Senate was confirming an agricultural secretary and somebody said to the proposed nominee, what are you going to do about food insecurity in America? And that person said, I’m going to plant more corn. We would all hear that and say, okay, you’re obviously a shill for the corn lobby, but that’s not actually an answer to the question. And yet when you ask someone who’s being considered for energy secretary what they’re going to do about energy insecurity in America, they say drill, baby drill. And that’s an acceptable answer. And trying to get Congress writ large, and this isn’t partisan, but congress writ large to say the purpose of energy policy should be to make sure that consumers have access to reliable, affordable energy. The purpose of energy policy should not be to make sure that producers are making a lot of money except in so far as they need to be generating enough profit, all the things that has to happen to provide that energy.

And we just don’t get to that point. And I mean, I’ve had this conversation on a bipartisan basis with folks in the Biden administration as well as in the Trump administration. When you simply ask people, “should energy policy serve primarily to benefit consumers or producers?” you get a long pause and that shouldn’t be hard. And yet if you look at how our energy policy has been structured through the years, we’ve spent a lot of effort making sure that we provide tax subsidies for people to drill coal, environmental liability waivers for whatever you might have at an oil well, guaranteed cost recovery for utilities. And we spend almost no time saying, “well, what should we do to make sure that you, Jason, have the opportunity to put something on your house that will reduce your energy loads?” Not only do we not do that, but if you do that, your utility might come and say, well, if you do that, I’m going to have to spread my cost set over more rate payers and raise the rates. So I need to get a right of first refusal on that investment. And so we don’t do things that benefit consumers and that is both depressing but also an enormous opportunity.

Jason Bordoff: Do you think that’s a function of the fact that the history of energy policy back to World Wars and the 1970s was very much about energy security, security and supply availability, price. And in the last few decades there’s been an appropriate significant focus on sustainability and decarbonization, but people took energy security and affordability mostly for granted. We had a lot of abundant energy. It hasn’t been that expensive without some exceptions here and there. That might not be true going forward. And we can talk about where the world is headed and rising power demand, but do you think that’s where that comes from?

Rep. Sean Casten: I think it goes back deeper than that. I was having a conversation with a European parliamentarian. We were at the Glasgow COP. And we were talking about the fact that the UK generates almost twice as much GDP per unit of energy as the United States does, which is a shocking number. And by the way, the Danes generate even more and the Swiss even more than the Danes. And so I asked him what he thought was the primary difference and he laughed and he said, we have the same form of government. It was created by the same people. It was Ben Franklin and John Locke and Rousseau and all these people who were bouncing around. And in our case, the people had already spread it over the land and we had to figure out how to efficiently use finite resources. In your case, you’d killed all the Natives.

And so you built a pressure relief valve of “go extract more resources.” And because we are geographically blessed with all these resources, we have a long history in our country, not just an energy policy. The Homestead Act: go out, take a bunch of land, seize it. We do things in the United States that sound crazy in the rest of the world. If you buy a house, you own the mineral rights underneath the house. Go to Mexico, they don’t do that. The mineral rights are the right of the state. You own the property above that. And so we’ve built, our democracy is based on to some degree incentivizing extraction. And we’ve never totally got beyond that. We have made a lot of progress. The progress we’ve made has primarily been because at the end of the day, people preferred cheap energy. Why did coal collapse in the United States by 50%? Not because we got woke because gas was cheaper and renewables was cheaper than that and people liked the cheaper stuff. We could go faster if we didn’t have all the policy barriers, but those opportunities wouldn’t have existed but for the fact that historically we prioritized resource consumption over efficient resource utilization.

Jason Bordoff: Can you talk just about setting the scene and then we’ll come to some specific issues and the Big Beautiful Bill on other things about just this moment we’re in not just politically, but when it comes to the issue of climate change and energy, and not just in the US but in other countries, parts of Europe as well, a sort of broad sense that maybe it’s still there for some political parties or administrations maybe not even there at all, but it’s taken a backseat. You look at the corporate world, the financial institutions, it’s not sort of prominent in the way it was. The conversation today focuses on pragmatism and realism and there are calls for more of that. I’m just wondering what the words like that mean to you and what you make of this moment we’re in and how we move forward on all of our energy policy goals, security, affordability, and sustainability.

Rep. Sean Casten: My general thought is Winston Churchill that we’ve entered an era of consequences in the time of baffling half-measures has come to a close, but we’ve got an awful lot of baffling half-measures going on right now. We’ve already exceeded one and a half degrees of warming. That’s not actually what the IPCC report says, but the IPCC report says that we’re darn close. And then the fine print says we’ve got a half a degree of cooling that’s baked in because of all the soot in the air. And as that soot comes out, the warming’s going to accelerate. So we’ve already overshot, we have already locked in just in the United States that sea levels on the Gulf Coast are going to be two feet higher in 2050 than they are right now. That is not that far from now. That is within the life of a 30-year mortgage. We’ve baked that all into the system. And of course, whether it’s European wildfires or Australian wildfires or all of that is going on, and I don’t mean to be overly gloom and doom, but you can sit in this moment and say, well, it’s politically easier for me to not prioritize that issue right now. Or you can lead. That’s a choice.

I take the optimism that I have on this from the fact that in spite of certainly a political retrenchment in the United States and some other countries, in spite of a real failure, I think of a lot of our corporate leaders to say, I’m going to get people to follow me, not just I’m going to go where I think is easy in this moment and hedge my bets in spite of all that. Electric vehicles are the fastest growing vehicle class in the country. Renewables continue to surge even during the Trump administration. We now generate more power from non-hydro renewables than we do from nuclear, than we do from coal.

You go to Europe and what Norway is now, 90% of the vehicles that are being sold in a year are electric. These are all being driven for economic reasons in the wake of the war in the Ukraine or in Ukraine, I’m sorry, the Europeans have made massive investments that they don’t have to depend on Russian gas that is in their own self-interest to invest on that efficiency and conservation. And now we’re having a conversation around, is Germany too dependent on Chinese BYD vehicles? Is the United States solar industry too dependent on Chinese solar panels? And that’s a good conversation around do we want to own the technologies of that transition? But you only have that conversation if you’ve acknowledged that the transition is well underway.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah. Well, I mean that raises a number of issues I want to come to. So what lessons do you take? I mean much of what you just said and the urgency of moving faster to reduce emissions, bring them to net zero. We’re already at one and a half or just about there. I suspect if we’d had this conversation a few years ago, you would’ve said something like that. So I’m wondering, when you reflect on the federal climate policy that you played such an important role in helping to pass in the last several years, in the early 2020s, the focus on carrots rather than sticks. We’ll take an IRA subsidy approach rather than a carbon tax or cap and trade approach. But again, coming to this moment where it feels like there’s a retrenchment or something about the urgency of the problem you described as not resonating with people and tell me if that’s wrong and your interactions with all of your constituents. What lessons do people who want to pursue that agenda need to learn as we look forward?

Rep. Sean Casten: So I would argue that subject to the degrees of freedom we had, we did a really, really good job in the IRA, the putting carrots in place creates constituencies who want to maintain those laws. And it’s been difficult for some of my Republican colleagues to justify trying to repeal those laws because so many jobs came to their districts using sticks creates a constituency to get rid of laws. The other big piece of logic in the IRA was this recognition because all those trends that I told you about, about the surge in renewables, the collapsing coal, that all happened before the IRA was passed. We also were well aware that if you have a solar panel on the roof of your house, you stop paying for electricity. You can’t get the solar panel on the roof of your house unless you own a home and you have the discretionary income to make that capital investment.

It’s a good investment, but you have to have the capital to make the investment. And so a lot of what we did in the IRA was to try to say let’s use tax policy to make it possible for larger numbers of American people to access cheap energy. And that was successful and went through, I said at the start subject to the degrees of freedom we had, the biggest limitation we had in the IRA was the structure of the Senate. Because under senate rules, it takes 50 votes to change government spending or government revenues under the Byrd Rule, but it takes 60 votes to change the incentives for the private sector to deploy capital. And so all of the things that we had recommended on the climate committee from the house, I mean I think we had 700 recommendations and 350 of ’em became law mostly in the IRA, some in the infrastructure bill.

Jason Bordoff: This was the report of the committee, the climate committee climate crisis.

Rep. Sean Casten: Yeah, so we’re batting 500, which is pretty good. If you look at those things that didn’t get into the final bill, most of it were issues where the Senate parliamentarian said those are issues of energy policy, not of fiscal policy, and therefore it would take 60 votes. And they didn’t have 60 votes in the Senate. It was a straight party line vote. And so that the Senate, because of the filibuster and the Byrd Rule, the Senate is, as structured right now in this moment, is incapable of doing energy policy. And that’s a choice by the Senate. They could change their rules, but under their rules they can’t do energy policy. And so a lot of the structural pieces that we had, I sort of described the IRA as saying, we put, you had a car that had no gas in the tank and had the emergency brake on. We put gas in the tank and the car started driving, but we still had the emergency brake on because we couldn’t change the energy policy pieces that discouraged private sector actors from doing things that would lower the cost of energy for the American people with their own capital. We could only use federal money to do it. Make me king. I can fix those problems as it is subject to,

Jason Bordoff: Are you talking about things like permitting reform, make it easier to build infrastructure…

Rep. Sean Casten: Things like that. Permit reform, change the incentives of the way that utilities make money. There’s no reason. Why do we continue to tolerate a world where if your utility lowers your cost of energy, the utility doesn’t make as much money.

Jason Bordoff:

And the solutions to that are not even necessarily the federal level at all. It’s not just 50 or 60 votes, right?

Rep. Sean Casten: Many of those are state level. We could certainly change those rules for the federally jurisdictional utilities, the BPAs and the TVA’s, we could change those for transmission. I’ve got bills to do all these things, by the way. Stay tuned on all this. There were provisions in, I want to say I think it was the 2006 Energy Act for FERC to develop performance-based ratemaking that fer has never done and Congress hasn’t pushed ’em to get it done. But why don’t we have rules that say if you reduce the congestion charges on your grid, if you help your state meet their RPS targets, if you lower the cost for your consumers, let’s give you a little higher return on equity. Right? We could do that if we are in George Bush’s words making the pie higher. Let’s make sure everybody gets a slice.

Jason Bordoff: So I want to come to several of the policy proposals you put on the table, and I have a list here of the bills related to climate change you’ve introduced. Reading, it would take up the entire podcast, so I won’t do that. But I want to just before getting to the specifics, sort of ask how you think about moving forward with those things. Because as you said, the idea that.. is it still possible to work across the aisle to get to 16 nevertheless more? I discovered before this something else we have in common. My first exposure to government was as a college intern for Senator John Chaffee of Rhode Island who was a Republican. I’m not sure it would be today. And I think you had said in an interview how around the same time you had a cast a vote for George HW Bush, a sort of inclination to try to engage across the aisle and find common ground. And I just had Carlos Curbelo on this podcast too, who obviously was involved in creating the Bipartisan Climate Caucus. We have a bunch of problems as a country, we need to address climate being one of them. But even leaving that aside, we need a lot more energy. We need power. We need to meet rising power demand, things are changing. Do you see a possibility to move forward in ways that are not purely partisan on some of the issues you just talked about?

Rep. Sean Casten: It is difficult. I’m not going to lie about that. There are small bore issues that you can work on that are more geographically specific. As an example, Randy Feenstra from Iowa and I were working to try to get the SOO Green line installed that would bring cheap wind from Iowa into higher price markets in Chicago, would lower the cost for my consumers and would help businesses in his district. So you find those situational opportunities. I think the challenge we face is only coincidentally a partisan challenge. And I got to give some numbers on what I’d said about the UK before. Take the US GDP, divide it by our total primary energy use. We generate a little over $200 of economic activity for every MMBT of primary energy. The Brits generate $360. The Danes generate over $500. The Swiss generate over $600 that suggests on its face, since they have access to the same technologies comparably – leave the Swiss out, their economy is weird. But certainly the Danes and the Brits have similarly structured economies that suggests that we could either double or triple the size of our economy without using any more energy. Or if you prefer we could cut our energy use and therefore emissions by a factor of two or three or maybe even more since the stuff we displace is the expensive stuff and have the same standard of living. That’s a hell of an opportunity. But if we were to do that, think about the massive wealth transfer that would happen from those parts of America that depend on coal mining, that depend on oil extraction to those parts of America that benefit when the price of energy goes down. And once upon a time you could have a senior Democrat like Tom Dashell representing the Bakken Shale. Now that’s John Thone representing the Bakken Shale. Once upon a time you could have districts like mine in the Chicago suburbs where decent amount of industrial activity really wants the price of energy to be cheap.

You could have that represented by someone like Henry Hyde who used to have my seat. Now it’s represented by me. And so a commitment to a consumer focused energy policy. If we do nothing else, decimates Appalachia, decimates the Gulf Coast because those parts of the country are dependent on industries that can’t compete against clean energy. And one of the things that we tried to do in the IRA was make sure we were prioritizing those transition communities so that we didn’t leave them behind. And so you saw a preferential investment in battery facilities in those communities and solar manufacturing facilities. And when you look at those stats out of the Biden administration that so many of the projects, the majority of the projects were in red parts of the country. That wasn’t because it was a political decision. It was because we wanted to make sure that we didn’t leave people behind who otherwise are left behind.

That challenge doesn’t go away if all of a sudden we have a Democrat representing the Dakotas. Again, there still is this question of equity between extractive America and consumptive America in our own Democratic party. We don’t want to lose any more seats than the Republicans are already causing us to lose in Texas. So what sorts of things should we be doing to make sure that the people who represent those communities don’t feel like they’re at odds with their party’s energy policy? These are solvable problems, but they’re big meaty problems we have to talk through and we have to think about, do we want to live in a world where energy is cheap? Sure. Do we want to live in a world where there are large numbers of men in New Orleans and Texas and Kentucky and West Virginia and Wyoming who are now unemployed and angry at the government? No. Right. And we can do both, but we have to be intentional about it and I think more thoughtful than we’ve been as a nation so far.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah. It’s an important point. And we have a very significant effort underway with resources for the future and the Bezos Earth Fund and some others on this question of economic activity and fossil fuel dependent economies. And it is a hard challenge in the same way that 30 years ago when we talked about expanding trade and globalization and there are winners and losers and as long as policy helps the winners compensate the losers, everyone can end up better off. We didn’t necessarily do a great job with that compensating the losers part. And I think that’s generally true,

Rep. Sean Casten: And I think there’s some optimism there because global trade, I think a strong case can be made that we brought cheap stuff into the United States, but we didn’t think at all about what was going to happen in those communities and we lost a lot of the high margin into the value chain. In this case, if we bring cheaper energy to America, sure, I’d love to be manufacturing the solar panels, but I’d vastly prefer to be the country that has access to cheap electricity because of all the things downstream that are going to happen if you have that. So I think this transition is a much easier one to manage that political pressure. We just have to be intentional about it and have to be honest that there’s nothing there is dignity in being a coal miner. Doesn’t mean we should keep doing it, but let’s honor that dignity and make sure that those people are treated with the dignity that they’ve earned.

Jason Bordoff: And you talked about the adverse impacts on those communities and not even from trying to move to zero carbon sources of energy, but you’ve talked several times already in the discussion about making energy cheap, thinking about affordability for people. And so how would you respond to someone who says energy is really cheap in a world where we’re focused on energy security and affordability and now there’s growing concern about the dominant position China has in a lot of these supply chains, but gasoline’s not that expensive. What is it, three 20 or something? National average natural gas is really cheap here compared to other parts of the world. There’s a sense in which America’s fortunate to have all of this abundant hydrocarbons be the largest producer in the world. And so I often hear people, so to say, wait, why are we switching to all this other stuff? Climate might be one super important reason I think it is. But if you’re just talking about affordability and security, why does being the largest oil and gas producer in the world not give us that?

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, I would submit to you that 90% of the country doesn’t give a damn what it costs to buy a standard cubic foot of natural gas or a rail car full of coal because it’s not particularly useful to them. They want to know how much of my paycheck goes to keeping my home warm, keeping my beer cold, getting me to work every day, which is that downstream end of energy. And all of those fossil fuel sources cannot compete with free if you upgrade the efficiency in your house. I don’t think there’s anybody who would argue that a well insulated home has a higher energy cost than a poorly insulated home. There’s nothing different there than if you have an electric vehicle in your driveway that doesn’t consume gasoline in a solar panel on the roof so that you don’t have to pay for the electricity to generate it.

You have to have the capital, but you also have to have the capital to build a coal plant. And what we’ve seen in the market dynamics over the last two decades is that investors have said, I like the return on a capital investment that produces a lower cost energy source that makes money during more hours of the year than making the investment in a gas plant in a coal plant that’s going to have a lot of hours of the year when it’s getting squeezed out of the market because the wind, the solar, the geothermal, the nuclear is all cheaper. So clean and cheap are the same thing here. And whether or not our energy costs are cheaper than the Europeans has something to do with differential tax policy has something to do with differential resource access. It’s an entirely separate question of have we designed our energy policy to make sure that energy prices are as low as possible for energy consumers? And the answer to that is a resounding hell no.

Jason Bordoff: And how do you respond with someone who hears that and says, wait a minute, if this stuff is so great, it’s so cheap. Why is pulling back these IRA tax credits so problematic? Why does it change the trajectory – as the Rhodium Group just said it will – for how much solar and wind we’re going to deploy? Why does it need all that support?

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, number one, the surest way that you can tell that somebody has never spent any time in the energy industry is that they think energy markets efficiently allocate capital, right? We have massive distortions on what we subsidize. I’ll give you just a quick example because some of the subsidies are less explicit. April, 2020, middle of COVID, well, the start of COVID, everybody stopped driving gasoline prices collapsed in the United States because there wasn’t demand. The price of oil collapsed, and that was a huge challenge for domestic oil and gas producers. Donald Trump responded to that by calling the Saudis and saying, we are going to take military aid out of Saudi Arabia unless you curtail production to raise the price of oil because our oil producers need the price of oil to be higher. The Saudis flinched, the price of oil went up the cover of Bloomberg Business the next day, Fox Business the next day praised Trump, the deal maker for protecting our oil industry.

Fast forward two years later when we’re in the peak of all the inflation rebound, Biden is now in the White House, and a number of us, myself, Congressman Tom Malinowski, Congresswoman Susan Wilde, put together a bill and called on the Biden administration to say, do exactly what Trump just did with the Saudis and pressured them to bring it down and we could not get the Biden administration to do what Trump had proven worked. And a part of their concern, they didn’t say this explicitly, but the subtext was, we’re looking at midterms coming up and we can’t afford to lose the members that we have in those extractive parts of the country.

And so there you have a direct example where our government directly intervened to raise the price of energy to benefit producers and our government directly chose not to intervene to benefit consumers. And that was a Republican who I do not celebrate, who I do not venerate, who I can’t wait to have out of office again, who understood that United States policy can have a direct impact on the price of energy and a government who I have a lot of respect for president have a lot of respect for who chose not to use that tool. And their common interest was that they had to be very careful about the economic interests of energy producers rather than consumers.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah. It is a bunch of ways in which I think we haven’t quite wrapped our heads around. We’ve spent 50 years obsessing about what it means to be an import-dependent consumer country, and other considerations come up when you realize you’re the largest producer in the world.

Rep. Sean Casten: Yeah. Yeah. And I say that in response to your question of, so now, well, why aren’t people deploying these without subsidies? Because they can’t count on our government to prioritize the consumer. I would also point out on the subsidy side, most of the subsidies that fossil energy receives are designed to lower the marginal cost of production for fossil fuels. You get away from some of your environmental compliance obligations that would raise your marginal cost where you have tax subsidies tied to how much you extract. The overwhelming majority of subsidies for clean energy are to lower the cost to make the initial investment. How do I make it possible for you to have an EV? How do I make it possible for you to have a solar panel? Because I don’t have to worry about the fact that once you have the solar panel, it’s always going to make sense for you to run it as long as the sun is shining.

I do have to worry about the fact that once you have a coal plant, there are a lot hours where it may not make sense for you to run that. And so we subsidize both, but we subsidize them in very different ways. And when we build those clean energy assets, which maybe we have to subsidize to bridge the capital gap, you don’t have to subsidize it anymore. The fossil sector, you have to keep subsidizing it all the time as long as we have competitive markets that keep innovating and keep providing technologies that are providing better value, better service, and lower pollution.

Jason Bordoff: And the other question that I often hear come up in response to some of what you just said is, especially in a world of great power competition and rivalry and fragmentation and issues like economic, national security, economic security are front and center now in even a bigger way, why are we going from all of this domestic energy? We’re a net exporter, we produce more than we need, to being heavily dependent, particularly on China in supply chains. You talked about solar and EVs and batteries and obviously where all the critical mineral refining and processing is. So how do you address that concern? And you hear it on the Hill all the time, we don’t want to go from dependence on the Middle East to dependence on China, that sort of sentiment.

Rep. Sean Casten: It is a interesting conversation. It’s also a category error. I spent a lot of time in the energy industry. I built a lot of steam turbines. I don’t ever remember any policymaker being upset about the fact that we don’t have any casting plants in the United States that are making castings for steam turbines that are used in our nation’s coal plants and gas plants and steam plants. I don’t recall anybody raising concerns about the critical minerals that get used in electrostatic precipitators on the back end of coal plants or in the catalytic converters of our cars. Right. I’m not saying that to say both sides thing. I’m saying that because I think in we didn’t have that conversation because we understood that the value of the energy was the energy, not the thing that you build. So it can then operate and provide you with energy for 30 years.

So yes, if I could have everything, I’d like to have all of that value added in the United States, but if I had to choose between what country will control the manufacturing of an asset that will take a year to build and a year to permit and get commissioned, and what country will extract the 2030 years of value out of that asset once it operates, I’ll take door two every time. And so the reason I say it’s a category error is if we are concerned about extracting oil from countries with shady human rights records and all sorts of other foreign policy concerns where we have to extract that oil every second of every minute of every hour of every day to keep our economy running, we can’t say “and I’m also concerned with the fact that we might have to mine something once and ship that on a truck so that we never have to do that oil thing again.” It’s orders of magnitude of different volumes.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, I think that’s a point well taken. And I’m just wondering whether you think in addition to, well, I hear everything you just said and that struck me. We didn’t really talk too much about how the steel for oil and gas pipelines was heavily dependent on imports as well, but we’re talking about a lot of things differently now, semiconductors and chips and a whole range of things. So I’m wondering if part of the answer to your question, do you think might be the world has changed and people are not thinking in the same way about in China in an era of today as they did unlike a more copacetic geopolitical era. Might that explain part of it or not?

Rep. Sean Casten: My initial pushback is that I think there’s a lot of false equivalents that if your goal is to protect expensive energy from competition, the Chinese minerals is a useful argument. You don’t have to believe it to make the argument. You just have to persuade people. And so I think it’s important to shut down the argument as a completely separate matter. Should we generally be concerned where there are parts of our economy that depend on critical minerals where the geological deposits are more or less exclusively located in countries that we have some geopolitical concerns with? Sure we should. That’s an appropriate conversation. It was certainly a conversation we had in the twenties when the oil industry was being built out and it’s no less relevant today. So we can have that conversation while at the same time recognizing that we’re talking about orders of magnitude differences, which in some cases doesn’t matter.

If that’s a critical mineral that you can shut down one entire economy by limiting their access. It doesn’t matter that there’s not a lot of it. It’s critical. So yes, that’s an important foreign policy question. Like I said, it’s orders of magnitude difference. And if we can solve that issue, whether with statecraft or foreign policy, et cetera, et cetera, then I think our next focus should be are we the country that’s got the highest margin part of the value chain and on balance, I’d rather be the country that’s turning those rare materials into high value products that’s turning the electricity they generate into even higher value products than the country that’s running a mine.

Jason Bordoff: Well, and that’s a sentiment that’s shared in lots of countries and emerging markets and elsewhere, which is both sensible but potentially a risk, right? If every country puts export restrictions on everything to say, we’re not going to export nickel or copper, you got to build the batteries here and do the refining and processing here, it does start to get expensive and lead to some geopolitical conflict. But do you think you mentioned sort of the statecraft responses to that. The idea that we see this administration taking equity stakes and setting price floors in a rare earth, mine MP materials or both sides of the aisle have a sense that we’re in an era of where it seems there’s support for the state being more involved in private enterprise to try to deal with what are broadly seen as national security risks, although they’re not always incredibly well-defined. How do you feel about that trend we’re seeing?

Rep. Sean Casten: Deeply uncomfortable. I think there’s a healthy conversation to have around what parts of the value chain would we like to have in the United States. We certainly had this with all of the solar tariffs. Is it more important that we can rapidly deploy solar energy in the United States, or is it more important that the panels be manufactured in Ohio, even if that means we’re going to pay more for them? Do we like slave labor in China? Of course not. Do we benefit from having cheaper stuff? Yes. How do we think through that trade? What is the role of the state in bridging that? And is that in the healthy version of that conversation is that’s a very targeted tariff policy, human rights policy, statecraft, all the rest of that stuff. There’s a real dangerous conversation we’re having now of let’s just have taxpayer money invest in these companies and try to control them. And that’s a slippery road to a lot of things that have not worked well for a lot of countries in the Soviet block. Not to put too fine a point out. And as recently as a year ago, my Republican colleagues were making a lot of noise about how we had to ban any ability for the US government to contract with state-owned enterprises. That was a very direct assault on Chinese involvement in various parts of the global supply chain. And now I guess Intel is a state-owned enterprise

Jason Bordoff: And is that different in kind from say, the CHIPS Act or the idea that government needs to support these companies? You’re particularly talking about having an ownership stake, having the potential to influence decisions, push companies to be less DEI or more environmental or something like that. That’s the risk you’re identifying?

Rep. Sean Casten: Totally different. I mean, the CHIPS Act was basically saying, how do we get the private sector to invest in projects in the United States, and we will give them some form of leverage. We’ll give you a tax credit, you’re going to have to put up a lot more money than we put up. If I give you a 30% investment tax credit, you’re going to have to come up with 70% of the money. But how do we leverage tax policy to bring that back and how do we think through, if I can manufacture something in El Paso with $10 an hour labor and you can move that plant to Ciudad Juarez and do it with 80 cents an hour labor, how much is lost for the community in El Paso that loses that plant? And is that worth the $9.20 cents that manufacturer got to their bottom line? Would it be worth a tax policy that gave them $8.20 cents to incentivize ’em to keep that plant to the United States and then they could build it? That’s a healthy trade.

I realize I should have picked numbers that were easier to subtract in my head, but you get my point. So that’s healthy trade. That’s very different from saying we want to put federal money into these companies where we’ve got some kind of a governance stake. We’ve got some kind of ability to directly affect your equity going forward, because if I decide to suddenly sell down my position, it’s going to put you in a horrible position and might I use that to extract some political favors? That’s so far down the road towards crony capitalism. I think the closest we ever got to that prior to this intel deal, at least in my memory, was in the GM bailout. But in the GM bailout, the government gave preferred equity that had a stipulated repayment schedule that was baked into certain milestones. So we saved GM, but markets knew that GM sources of cash going forward we’re going to have to involve this repayment obligation. And so it didn’t introduce uncertainty into the thesis of an investment in gm. I think we’ve just invested massive uncertainty into the investment, not just of Intel, but what do you do if you’re Samsung right now? Do you come asking for your 10%? Do you say, I can’t invest in the United States anymore because they’re going to try to force me to take 10%? I don’t know. Right? But none of that is good for having a vibrant dynamic US economy.

Jason Bordoff: A conversation like this about affordability, energy security, energy geopolitics, I think for a long time was mostly about global oil markets, concerns about the Middle East, opec much more focused now on the power sector and concerns about affordability seem more focused on electricity prices sometimes than oil and gasoline prices. So I’m wondering how you think about the coming challenge of rising electricity demand, how real it is? Is it exaggerated and overstated and sort of what the right policy responses to it are?

Rep. Sean Casten: The demand rise is real. Our economy is electrifying. If you look, oil use in the United States is basically the same as it was 15 years ago. In spite of rising population, in spite of rising economy, I mentioned coal use is down. Gas is increasingly an export commodity in the US. Yes, gas demand is up, but on the margin, new gas goes to export markets, not to domestic use. And some of that’s because we invested in efficiency. Some of that’s because really energy intensive manufacturing moved to,

Jason Bordoff: I mean, we’re still consuming a lot of gas, right? I mean, exports are growing, but…

Rep. Sean Casten: Yes, no, we are. But gas is the only fossil fuel where domestic consumption is still growing. Domestic consumption for oil is not growing. Domestic consumption for coal is shrinking drastically and demand for energy is rising dramatically. It’s just that we’re increasingly consuming electricity and we’re increasingly using non-fossil sources to generate that electricity. And some of that is investments in efficiency. Some of that’s deindustrialization, some of that’s reindustrialization bringing some of these manufacturers on plant back on shore or near-shoring that use electric loads, of course AI, electrification of vehicle fleets. And on the power side, we had this very, and I’ve still never seen, maybe you’ve seen a good explanation of why for basically a hundred years with a couple little wiggles in the line, power demand grew by two to 3% a year in the United States, and then it totally flatlined from 2008 to 2020.

I’ve seen lots of explanations. None of them are totally intellectually satisfying to me. And now of course it’s shot up again. And because the electric industry is so capital intensive and because we still regulate the electric utility industry for the most part in a way that says if you deploy capital, I will give you a guaranteed return of your capital. That means that when we were in this anomalous period where demand wasn’t growing and therefore you didn’t need to build a lot more capital, you were amortizing all those investments out and there was no upward pressure. Now that we’re suddenly having to build all this new capacity, if we’re going to build it in that regulated paradigm, you’re forcing rates to go up. And from a lot of perspectives, that’s a good thing. I’d like to be in an economy that’s growing, and I like that it’s growing in ways that are less carbon intensive than the way it used to grow.

But we still need that physical plant. And that’s true if you’re building a coal plant. It’s true if you’re building a wind farm, someone’s got to build something and no one’s going to build that something unless they have a reasonable expectation, they can get their capital out of it. And so that dynamic is real. We also have such massive opportunities to cut it down. We’ve woefully underdeployed all these grid enhancing technologies that would slash our line losses by as much as 50%, which means we can use those wires more. We’ve done an atrocious job at building transmission wires that would lower the cost of power. Virtually all the transmission we build in this country is for reliability. Virtually none of it is for cost reduction. That’s a choice that falls out of policy decisions. But if we make the opposite choice, then all of a sudden we could be deploying capital that exists to lower people’s cost of energy instead of deploying capital that must be amortized and raise your price of energy. So we’ve got a real opportunity if we’re smart about it, but the demand growth is real, and the consequences of building capacity to meet that demand growth follows naturally from that. We just have to decide what it is we’re going to build.

Jason Bordoff: And the consequences of not meeting that demand growth, particularly for some of these massive tech companies, who view the leadership in AI as existential, is enormous and they have a lot of capital to spend. And there’s a what, five, six year backlog for new gas turbines, a lot of excitement about nuclear, but even optimistically, that’s still kind of far away. So I’m wondering how much of a headwind, how much sand in the gears you think pulling back the IRA support in the Big beautiful bill actually, how different is the outlook for renewables now given that the power’s got to come from somewhere? And as you said, it still looks pretty attractive in terms of an economic investment?

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, and I haven’t looked at this chart recently, but I’d be amazed given how sticky it is, if it’s changed much. But at the end of ‘24, there were about 2000 gigawatts of generation that was trying to get interconnected to the grid. And for your listeners, we have, what, about 1100 gigawatts of generation? So 2001 to connect, which would roughly three x increase in our grid capacity. Not all of that will go through, but there were 2000 that was sitting there waiting to get approval to interconnect of that 2000 gigawatt, one was coal, 85 was gas, and the balance was all solar, wind and storage. And so the market was telling us, and those trends, again, the IRA accelerated them, but the basic trends that would also have been true if we looked before the IRA, what markets want to build is the stuff that doesn’t have a marginal cost because it’s got a better investment thesis.

I am, I’m concerned about the equity impacts of repealing the IRA because when you take away the ability to provide tax credits, refundable tax credits to people who don’t have disposable capital, then we’re saying only wealthy people can access cheap energy. On my bigger concerns with what the Trump administration has done is things like shutting down the offshore wind plant that was 80% complete off the coast of Connecticut because that sends a signal to capital people who are willing to write billion dollar checks that you should not invest in the United States unless you’re willing to bribe the president. Doing things like shutting down the loan guarantee to the grain belt express that in energy was going to build that would’ve brought cheap energy from the plain states into Southern Illinois. Those decisions to shut those down are being driven by an anti-competitive motivation, not an anti unclean motivation, an anti-competitive motivation because the biggest threat to the domestic gas industry, the domestic coal industry is cheap energy. And so those pieces, some of which were accelerated by the IRA, some of those were just general policy of a more thoughtful administration. Pulling those back doesn’t stop us from building new generation, but it overtly preferences that we will build the most expensive stuff.

Jason Bordoff: If there, in your view, it’s still economically attractive, you’re bringing up these issues of can you get permits to build? Can you rely on permits to build? And so at a broad level, there seems to be support on both sides of the aisle abundance movement to make it easier to build. What do you think the prospects for that are the ability for maybe something to happen in Congress on permitting? What does that look like? And I assume it’s necessarily some sort of compromise that is about oil and gas as well as clean energy and all of the above.

Rep. Sean Casten: The dynamics of the compromise that was there at the end of the last term are a little harder to come by now because virtually everything that the Republicans wanted in exchange for the compromise, which was a weakening of environmental enforcement, don’t consider the climate impacts of LNG export and production. They’ve basically given themselves all those things through other either administrative or legislative actions that they’ve gotten with their majority. So at this point, what is there to compromise on? There were the other pieces that we wanted to go out there and get done. We’ll see, but it’s going to be, let’s just say this has not been a Congress that has seemed predisposed to compromising with Democrats. Having said all that, there are things we could do very much in an abundance construct that we should have done years ago. In any given year in the United States, we build 10 to a hundred times as many miles of high pressure gas distribution as we build of high voltage electric transmission.

The primary reason is because FERC has sole source authority for gas pipelines and nobody has sole source authority for electric transmission. So if we just gave FERC the same permitting authority that they have for gas, all the same laws would apply, all the same interveners could still petition. You can’t just lose at one county level and then petition the county next door. And if you lose their petition, the county next door and gum up the whole process, you want to do that in the name of abundance. You want to do that in the name of cheap energy. You want to do that in the name of making it easier for corporations to build these. I don’t care. But that’s the right policy to do, right? And yes, I’ve got bills for that as well, and we’ll be bringing ’em forward. But these sorts of things shouldn’t be partisan except for the fact that I keep coming back to those are the things you do if you want to prioritize cheap energy for consumers. And that’s in the current moment is a very partisan idea.

Jason Bordoff: How likely do you think it is and do you think there should be a government shutdown? And this probably is not top of the list of implications, but for people thinking about energy and climate and what should they be thinking about in terms of the implications of that?

Rep. Sean Casten: Do I think there should be a shutdown? Absolutely not. Do I think there should be the amount of pain imposed on the American people that’s implicit in the proposal that Mr. Johnson has just put out as the condition of a shutdown also? Absolutely not. So we’re going to have to see how the next few weeks play out. I am more uncertain about the prospect…

Jason Bordoff: And when I say, do you think there should be, I sort of meant is it the view that it’s time for Democrats to stand up and not sort of concede to in the way people perceive Schumer and others did last time?

Rep. Sean Casten: I think the single stupidest thing we can do is to view this through a partisan lens of who would be blamed for causing pain. I just don’t want to vote for causing pain. And if we’re going to vote for a bill that’s going to strip people’s healthcare away, that’s going to make everyone sicker. That’s not something that we can vote for. There’s a way through there. What I was starting to say about my nervousness, the moment is more that the Congress is no different from anybody else’s office. Ultimately, the currency is trust. And when we’re sitting there saying, watching the Trump administration choose not to disperse funds consistent with law, consistent with congressional intent, not be pressured by the Republicans to defend the prerogatives of Congress, it’s a lot harder to say what exactly are we fighting for? What concessions would we make that would actually be enforced in the absence of some commitment on oversight or others? And I can imagine ways to solve that, but I think it’s difficult for a lot of us in Congress to think about if you don’t have that trust, how certain can we be that in the next two weeks, there’s not going to be a tremendous amount of pain imposed on the American people because the White House can’t be trusted with the American People’s Bank account.

Jason Bordoff: I’m going to bring it to a close. You’ve been very generous with your time, but I can talk to you for hours. But is there anything in particular we haven’t talked about that you just wanted to make sure to touch on or lead people with? We’ve covered a lot.

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, I always feel like I hate ending these, particularly when we’ve dealt with such heavy topics without some note of optimism. And I would just point out that we’ve had plenty of times in our history when we’ve been close to losing this republic. We’ve had plenty of times in our history when we prioritize the robber barons over the man and woman in the street. And what’s always striking now, being a member of Congress, traveling abroad is a little bit of a different vibe than when I was a civilian, shall we say. And what other countries are most jealous about of the United States is not the leaders we elect, but the character of the American people that we’ve gone through stresses like the Civil War that would’ve broken other countries. And we survived it as a union and we survived it and held fast, ultimately messily and completely. But ultimately, we held fast to those principles that the rest of the world’s jealous about. And so I think in this moment as well, the optimism is if Americans simply express the character that we know they have, we’re going to be fine.

Jason Bordoff: It’s a great note to end on. I’ll just in closing, say, as someone who’s built an institute that views our mission as providing expertise and analysis to help decision makers and policy make the best decisions they can, I always appreciate people who are such active consumers of that and take energy and climate policies as seriously as you do. And thanks for your leadership on all those issues, and thanks for spending so much time with us today.

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, thank you for breeding voters who think that energy policy is their top issue. It’s my surest path to higher office.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.",https://media.newswest9.com/assets/CCT/images/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71/20241126T221110/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 16:03:13.659266

This trend underscores a pivotal moment for investors: high-performance EV platforms are no longer niche but central to the future of mobility. The Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack, a flagship example, exemplifies how electrification is redefining performance—and why now is the time to invest in EV-capable OEMs and their supply chains.

The Charger Daytona: A Case Study in Electrified Performance

The 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack, with its 670-horsepower all-electric system, has shattered stereotypes about EVs lacking the visceral thrill of traditional performance vehicles. Capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds and completing the quarter-mile in 11.5 secondsElectric Attitude: Dodge Charger Daytona Earns 2025 Wards 10 Best Engines & Propulsion Systems award[ 2 ], it challenges the dominance of internal combustion engines (ICEs) in the muscle car segment.

The 2025 Wards 10 list reflects broader industry dynamics. Hybrid systems dominate, with five hybrid or PHEV powertrains among the winners compared to four all-electric systemsElectrification in Full Force - wardsauto.com[ 1 ]. This balance highlights automakers' cautious approach to electrification, prioritizing affordability and flexibility. Yet, the awards also spotlight technological innovation, such as the Charger Daytona's patent-pending Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust systemElectric Attitude: Dodge Charger Daytona Earns 2025 Wards 10 Best Engines & Propulsion Systems award[ 2 ], which mimics the auditory appeal of ICEs.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acted under its Clean Air Act (CAA) statutory authority to safeguard the long-term availability of the chemical Halon-1301 that is a critical fire suppression agent for commercial aviation, defense, and energy. Without it, critical infrastructure and civilian safety is at risk. EPA is issuing CAA 114 information requests to three companies—the American Carbon Registry, Wesco, and Tradewater—seeking to gather information about projects involving the destruction of Halon-1301 in exchange for carbon offset credits.

“EPA is deeply concerned that companies are destroying critical lifesaving fire suppression products for carbon credits. Doing so not only deprives our country of this critical chemical, needlessly putting public safety at risk, but could also make the United States dependent on other countries like China,” said EPA Assistant Administrator Aaron Szabo. “This is yet another example of companies prioritizing short term financial gains over real, lifesaving products.”

Halon-1301 remains indispensable to protecting public safety and human health because of its unmatched ability to extinguish fires quickly in confined spaces without leaving corrosive or harmful residues. Halons are class I ozone-depleting substances regulated under CAA Title VI, and new production of the chemical was banned under the Montreal Protocol in 1994. However, America’s recycling industry has successfully managed existing stocks for more than three decades, and EPA has worked closely with the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of War, and others to ensure safe and reliable supplies of recycled halons for the civil aviation industry and other critical applications.

This careful stewardship and management is under threat due to entities attempting to destroy perfectly usable halon in exchange for carbon offset credits, undermining the United States’ long-term availability of this strategic chemical. The latest example came in July 2025, when an entity attempted to destroy 30,000 pounds of the United States’ Halon-1301 supply in France in exchange for these credits. After receiving information that the Halon-1301 could be reclaimed, EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation stepped in to prevent the destruction.

If America’s reclaimed and recycled stocks are needlessly destroyed, the United States could be forced to secure Halon-1301 from China or one of the other few countries that still produce Halon-1301. EPA’s action makes clear that the agency will not allow short-term financial incentives in carbon offset markets to jeopardize the United States’ long-term safety and security. Simultaneously, EPA is exploring other avenues to both safeguard the supply and find suitable alternatives.

The American Carbon Registry, Wesco, and Tradewater have 21 days following the receipt of EPA’s letters to respond to the agency’s mandatory request. To view the letters, please visit EPA’s Halons Program website.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Ninety-eight years ago, the nation’s largest power grid operator was founded here by utilities serving Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro threatened to pull his state out of the coalition.

“It is time to get serious about making significant reform,” Shapiro said, at a conference he convened with representatives from all 13 states now in the grid to “chart a new course” for operator PJM Interconnection.

“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction,” he said.

Pennsylvania is the largest energy producer in the grid. Its absence would impact electricity consumers across the region, which stretches from Illinois to North Carolina.

Data centers built to fuel artificial intelligence technology are driving huge increases in electricity demand—and in prices for consumers. Shapiro and other elected leaders like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin blame PJM for delays in approving new power projects, creating a bottleneck that is making the situation worse. Shapiro, a Democrat, and Youngkin, a Republican, want states to have a say in PJM’s decisions; right now, government officials do not have a voice on PJM’s board.

Speaking at the conference later in the day, PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is stepping down at the end of this year, said that “fingerpointing” wasn’t helpful.

“There’s an element of responsibility on both sides,” he said, meaning the states and PJM. All parties need to work together and ask, “‘How do we solve this?’” he said.

At the end of the conference, 11 of the states’ governors’ offices—all but Kentucky and West Virginia—announced they had formed a collaborative to continue to work together on the energy issues discussed at the meeting.

Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the joint criticism of PJM by multiple state governors “very unusual” and “the highest level of state engagement with PJM I’ve ever seen.” He said in an email that he thinks there’s a strong chance for governance reforms.

Shapiro’s statements come two months after nine governors in the PJM region demanded in a letter that PJM reserve two board seats to be filled with nominees by the states. Last month, those nominees surfaced as former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements.

PJM, which has conducted a months-long effort with a consultant to propose candidates, initially responded that it would consider the recommendations. It is expected to make a decision this Thursday.

“PJM is mired in a crisis of confidence,” Christie said at the conference. “Consumers have lost confidence in the people who run their grid.”

Christie said PJM needs a “new constitution,” one that reimagines the organization in a way that changes its governance structure to reflect the fact that PJM is a “policy-making body.”

Shapiro said PJM has “months, not years” to make changes, or Pennsylvania will take steps to leave the organization. “We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects, and we’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” he said. Shapiro did not provide details about what this new arrangement would look like.

New Jersey lawmakers have already taken up the issue. In June, the state Assembly passed a bill directing its Board of Public Utilities to work with other states and study alternatives for addressing skyrocketing electricity prices—including the option of leaving PJM altogether. A companion measure has been introduced in the state Senate but has not yet been assigned to a committee.

In remarks delivered remotely to the conference, Youngkin confirmed that he and his allies are working on bills that seek to do the same.

“The bottom line is that when PJM succeeds, we all succeed together. But if reforms stall, we will act and do what is needed to protect the families and businesses who depend on us,” Youngkin said.

In his recorded message for the conference attendees, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said, “Thirteen governors have united with a single urgent message for our regional grid operator, and it underscores the seriousness of the crisis that we now face. The path forward requires real transparency and accountability from PJM and a truly collaborative role for states in the governance process.”

Maryland, as a net importer of electricity, is frustrated by PJM’s delays connecting new clean-energy sources to the grid and opaque governance rules that Moore repeatedly said are disrupting the state’s climate targets and hurting households and businesses.

On Monday, ahead of his recorded message, Moore huddled with state Senate leadership in Annapolis to announce $200 million in direct energy bill rebates for low-income households to counter the rising prices.

Without commenting on how PJM should be governed, the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM and states should require data center developers to “pull their own weight” by investing in new energy generation—a policy push during the meeting colloquially tagged as “bring your own generation” or B.Y.O.G.

“The big message today was that prices are unsustainably high and PJM needs to do a better job protecting customers,” Rutigliano said. “The truth is that this crisis was caused by data centers and nearly all the money is going to old power plants.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said that “meeting the demands of a rapidly changing energy landscape will require solutions that extend beyond any one institution.”

“It will require PJM, the industry and especially our states all working in concert,” he said.

Asthana, PJM’s CEO, emphasized the scale of change that will be necessary to meet the challenges of powering AI now and in the future, not just at PJM but across the country. “If we’re going to win this race, I think we need to think differently,” he said.

What’s not clear is whether, or how, states leaving PJM would lead to a more affordable or reliable system.

Most of the power plants in PJM compete on an open market as a result of decisions by lawmakers in various states in the 1990s and 2000s to introduce more competition into the electricity sector. This restructuring meant that regulated utilities were limited to providing the delivery of electricity, while independent power producers would build and operate power plants.

Representatives of independent power producers said on Monday that they can understand the frustration with PJM, but they don’t see how it solves anything for states to leave.

“While we continue to stand in favor of common-sense reforms that will improve power market functionality, grid reliability, and consumer affordability, the actions taken by some elected officials do nothing more than disrupt PJM’s ability to do its job,” said a statement from Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group whose members include independent power producers.

Jon Gordon, director at Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents advanced generation technologies, said despite PJM’s high prices, participation within the regional grid provides more efficiency and competition for electricity sales, which keeps costs lower for ratepayers. The regime used prior to PJM’s shared marketplace allowed utilities to overbuild with less incentive to keep prices in check.

“I don’t think anybody wants to go back to that. … We just need to make improvements so we get all the benefits of competition but none of the inefficiencies,” Gordon said, adding that a PJM departure may mean state agencies could have to negotiate contracts with producers. “If these studies are fair and unbiased, I think they’re going to show it’s pretty risky to leave PJM and there’s probably not enough benefit to justify the potential risks.”

The challenge with PJM is the political diversity of the region that includes Republican West Virginia and Democratic New Jersey, compared to more ideologically homogeneous New England, Gordon added. The governors in the PJM region have now realized they don’t have much influence over decisions affecting how new generation sources get onto the grid.

“I think the states are completely different on whether it’s fossil or renewables generation,” Gordon said. “But they all agree that they want a voice, and they want lower prices.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gov-Josh-Shapiro-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 15:01:53.336845

Nationally, by the end of 2024, the US had approximatel 11 GW of grid-scale battery capacity with arbitrage as the top use case.
These evolving applications underscore the increasing versatility of battery energy storage systems and their expanding role in grid stabilization.","The latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirms that arbitrage – the practice of buying electricity when prices are low and selling it when prices are high – remains the dominant use case for utility-scale battery energy storage systems in the US.

In 2024, operators reported that 66% of all utility-scale battery capacity included arbitrage among its applications, while 41% of total capacity was used primarily for arbitrage.

The next most common application was frequency regulation, which was the primary use for 24% of battery capacity. Frequency regulation plays a critical role in maintaining the grid’s stability by keeping it operating at a steady 60 cycles per second.

While this breakdown is similar to 2023 – still with arbitrage leading the way – it’s a notable shift compared to earlier years, when frequency regulation was the most commonly cited primary use of battery systems.

This transition reflects a broader trend seen in mature energy storage markets, such as the UK. As ancillary services markets tend to be relatively shallow, a shift from frequency regulation to energy arbitrage is a natural evolution as battery deployment scales.

The most significant change in the US is occurring in Texas, where battery operators are increasingly depending on energy arbitrage as their main revenue stream, rather than ancillary services.

According to Modo Energy, in 2023, 85% of BESS revenues in Texas came from ancillary services. By 2024, that number had dropped sharply, with nearly 60% of revenues coming from arbitrage – a clear signal of market maturation and shifting economics.

Growing fleet

The majority of the US utility-scale battery capacity is concentrated in California and Texas, within the CAISO and ERCOT markets.

As of the end of 2024, CAISO reported 11.7 GW of installed battery capacity, 43% of which was primarily used for arbitrage. Meanwhile, ERCOT reported 8.1 GW of capacity, with 50% primarily used for arbitrage.

That’s up from 8 GW in CAISO and 3.9 GW in ERCOT at the end of 2023. Despite the rapid growth, the share of capacity primarily used for arbitrage remained consistent year-over-year.

Nationally, by the end of 2024, the US had approximatel 11 GW of grid-scale battery capacity with arbitrage as the top use case. Around 6.5 GW primarily dedicated to frequency regulation.

Beyond arbitrage and frequency regulation, utility-scale batteries in the US are also being used for a growing number of grid-support applications, including: absorbing excess wind and solar energy, system peak shaving, load following, co-located renewable firming, ramping/spinning reserve, voltage or reactive power support, load management, backup power, and transmission and distribution referral.

These evolving applications underscore the increasing versatility of battery energy storage systems and their expanding role in grid stabilization.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-180.png,N,,2025-09-23 15:01:50.450949

The interest-free and unsecured contribution will be provided by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and delivered by The Economic Development Agency of Canada for Quebec Regions (CED), under the Regional Economic Growth Through Innovation Program. It will finance 75% of the eligible costs for the pit extension at the mine to support continued production.

LDI, located about 150 km northwest of Montreal, produces approximately 15,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually, from an installed capacity of 25,000 tonnes per year.

The funding will help the company avoid putting LDI on care and maintenance at the end of 2025 and allow it to immediately begin work on extending the existing pit.

The goal is to break ground as soon as possible to ensure a continuous flow of material to the plant. First production from the new zones could start in around 6-8 months. In the meantime, Northern will continue supplying customers by processing ore from existing pit and ore stockpiles through the third quarter, and will then fulfill orders from inventory.

The pit extension is based on a resource estimate published in January 2024, which shows potential to extend the life of the mine. It supports Northern Graphite’s plan to meet rising demand by permanently moving the LDI mill to daily operation.

“This support from the Canadian government will help keep the mine in operation and allow us to continue to supply our customer base in industrial markets as well as to pursue our goal of becoming a key supplier to growing defense and battery markets in North America and further afield,” said Northern Chief Executive Officer Hugues Jacquemin. “We are in conversations with other parties to finance the remaining cost of the mine extension and hope to be able to announce something soon.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-12.29.24-PM-copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 14:01:27.339511

To take advantage of the tax credit, you only need to have ordered an EV by the deadline.","This story was originally posted on MyNorthwest.com

Thinking of an electric vehicle? You’ve only got a week left before federal tax credits end, or you’ll have to pay full price.

The $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles (EV) ends Sept. 30. Steven Hershkowitz is the managing director for clean transportation for the Washington Department of Commerce. He expects the loss of this incentive will hurt EV sales in the short term.

“There is going to be a bit of a drag on the growth rate that we have seen,” Hershkowitz said. “We’ve already seen the market growth slow down in 2024 and into 2025.

Washington got rid of its tax exemption for EVs earlier this year. The legislature and Governor Ferguson are deciding to use those dollars elsewhere, but Herskowitz said the state’s commitment to electric vehicles and clean energy isn’t going away.

“The commitment is still there, and the prioritization is still there,” Herskowitz said. “These consumer-facing incentives that were quite popular are not, unfortunately, but there’s progress being made in terms of making sure that, hopefully, we can get the incentives back at some point.”

Climate Commitment Act to fund clean energy projects

The state will continue to use funds from the Climate Commitment Act to push clean energy and expand EV charging around the state.

Herskowitz believes electric vehicles are the future, and the demand will eventually return.

“The automakers know that this is where it’s going,” he said. “The global competition is further ahead in many major markets now internationally for EVs, and so this is where we’re going. It’s just about the pace at which we get there.”

The pace also includes finding ways to improve the pricing for electric vehicles.

The average price for a new EV is over $55,000. The average price for a new gas car is $49,000. You can certainly find new EVs for much less. Some only run about $30,000.

Now might be the time to get in, if you want to take advantage of the tax credit.

“It’s a good opportunity for people who have been considering getting an electric vehicle to really bring that consideration up to a higher level, perhaps go into dealerships, test drive, see what the prices are,” Herskowitz said. “This could be a good opportunity to get deals depending on which model you’re looking at.”

But expect a lot of company. You won’t be the only person trying to squeeze in before the deadline.

To take advantage of the tax credit, you only need to have ordered an EV by the deadline. You can take delivery later and still get it.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/kiro_cox_articles_720/2f91fe97eb37c8ee70fd8a3b886e529f,N,,2025-09-23 14:02:57.311987

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced last week it will prioritize reviewing new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act, designated for use in data center projects or manufacturing covered components for the facilities’ computing machines and hardware equipment.

The action aims to streamline the permitting process as well as support President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at boosting data center infrastructure and accelerating the development of new artificial intelligence systems in the United States.

The actions are part of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative that aims to create more jobs and grow the U.S. economy.Those efforts include streamlining permit processing as well as expanding the U.S.’s artificial intelligence and data center global footprint, which involves TSCA pre-manufacturing chemical review.

Under the TSCA law, manufacturers and processors are required to submit pre-manufacture notices, or PMNs, for new chemicals. They are also required to submit a significant new use notice, or SNUN, if they plan to use existing chemicals for new uses.

However, in December 2024, the agency under the Biden administration finalized an amendment under TSCA requiring manufacturers to submit advance federal notice before adding any new chemicals, particularly PFAS, or other toxic substances into their production processes.

The rule, which went into effect Jan. 17, aligns with the chemical safety amendment enacted in 2016 under TSCA, known as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.

The TSCA amendment gives the EPA additional testing authority, helping the agency to gather information on new chemicals. This allows the EPA to determine if the material poses a health or environmental risk, if there is sufficient information about the chemical, any risks associated with the manufacturing process and the amount that will be produced.

From this evaluation, the EPA is then required to take action against any risks the toxic substances may pose, such as issuing a rule to limit or ban the chemical’s amount used in manufacturing, processing or distribution.

The effort comes days after the agency held an AI roundtable with C-suite executives including from Hitachi Americas and the Data Center Coalition. Zeldin said in the Sept. 18 press release that the EPA inherited a “massive backlog” of new chemical reviews from the Biden administration, hindering data center and AI-related projects.

In January, the Government Accountability Office released a report that found the EPA’s new chemical review process is taking longer than the expected 90 days, harming manufacturers’ customer relations and prompting them to introduce and make new products outside the U.S.

“The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin.

Bottom Line The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment.","The federal tax credits that helped make electric vehicles attainable for millions of Americans are winding down. For many, that raises the question: will adoption stall without that $7,500 headline incentive? At Cox Automotive, we believe EV adoption will continue, but not automatically. To maintain momentum, automakers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders must stay focused on three critical levers: cost, confidence, and convenience.

Cost: The Affordability Test

Even as battery costs decline, EVs remain a premium purchase. In August 2025, the average EV sold for $57,245, which is $9,066 more than a comparable gasoline model. Incentives narrowed that gap, but with federal credits ending, mainstream buyers will feel the pinch.

Automakers and the government alike have been offering plenty of sales incentives on EVs, with the typical incentive package reaching a record 17.5% of average transaction price in July before dropping to 16% in August. They have also been increasingly leaning on leasing. Since 2023, more than 1.1 million EVs have been leased, with lease share holding above 50% for eight straight months. Leasing lowers monthly payments, keeps technology fresh, and builds the pipeline of used electric vehicles that will define the next stage of adoption.

As government-backed incentives fade away in October, the biggest near-term challenge to the industry and automakers will be how to manage costs and ensure that EVs are within reach of more consumers. Price parity remains elusive. Until that happens, EV growth will be challenged.

Confidence: Making Battery Health Visible

Price alone won’t close the deal. Electric vehicle buyers need confidence, especially when it comes to battery life. That’s why the industry is converging on a new metric: State of Health (SoH). SoH reporting, tied to each vehicle’s VIN, is becoming essential for consumers, lenders and insurers alike. As it becomes as routine as an odometer reading, battery health measures will ease buyer anxiety, stabilize pricing, and unlock the used EV market at scale.

Convenience: Charging Shapes the Map

Between January and August 2025, the U.S. added more than 21,000 charging ports, bringing the total to 228,701. DC fast chargers alone grew nearly 19%. Still, reliability and availability vary by region, meaning geography matters more than ever. States with rebates, utility programs, and National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) funded corridors, like those in California, Colorado, and Washington, are creating adoption hotspots. As we have noted before, the gasoline infrastructure in the U.S. has been under development for more than 100 years. A charging infrastructure to support the wide adoption of EVs still has a long way to go.

The Used EV Wave Is Coming

Lease returns and trade-ins are boosting the supply of used EVs, making them more affordable than ever. In August, the price difference between a used EV and a used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fell to just $897 – the lowest on record – as used EV sales climbed to nearly 41,000 units, lifting market share to 2.4%.

For mainstream buyers, EV affordability in the used-vehicle space is finally within reach. At the same time, hybrids and plug-in hybrids continue to appeal to shoppers who value fuel economy and the convenience of familiar refueling. But the long-term trajectory favors full electrification: Falling cell costs, the rise of new battery technology and chemistry, and a domestic battery supply chain supported by the 45X credit (the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) all point in that direction.

Consumer intent to purchase an EV reinforces this outlook. Recent Morning Consult research found that 65% of EV Intenders still say they would consider buying an electric vehicle despite the phasing out of the Inflation Reduction Act tax rebates. Access to charging, vehicle performance, cost savings and environmental concerns all ranked higher in purchase consideration than rebates.

Together, these forces suggest a solid foundation for future EV market growth. As the price gap narrows and the total cost of ownership becomes more compelling, intent can translate into used EV sales, but only if transparency keeps pace. Without VIN-level battery health data, deals stall and margins compress. Delivering clarity and confidence will be critical to unlocking scale in the used EV market.

What Next For EVs in the U.S.: Outlook and Action

Without fresh federal support, the U.S. EV share is likely to hover below 10% in 2025. However, we still believe the EV mix of sales can climb to near 25% by 2030, well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the “niche” category. That slower climb carries real consequences for emissions, competitiveness, and industry planning.

What the Industry Must Do Now: With $7,500 incentives eliminated, the case for EVs now rests on performance, technology and total cost of ownership, rather than subsidies. Making data understandable, with SoH reporting standardized at the VIN level across listings, appraisals and financing, is essential.

The industry also needs to follow demand as closely as policy, concentrating inventory and marketing in the regions where state and utility incentives, as well as charging density, align to support adoption.

And it’s not just about consumers: fleets remain a critical lever. Electrified fleets – especially those with predictable routes and centralized charging – are well-suited for early adoption. As these vehicles transition out of commercial service, they help seed the used EV market, expanding access to more affordable electric options for secondary buyers

Cox Automotive’s Role: Cox Automotive is helping scale EV adoption by making data and tools more accessible.

Autotrader’s EV Hub and Kelley Blue Book provide valuable educational resources.

EV Battery Health brings VIN-level battery data into listings and valuations.

Manheim is certifying locations and technicians across three tiers of EV readiness – adding infrastructure, safety protocols, and state-of-charge monitoring tools – to help dealers confidently store, service, and remarket used EVs.

Through EV Battery Solutions, Cox Automotive extends the life and protects the value of EV batteries through repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling, helping OEMs, fleets, and consumers get more from every battery.

Bottom Line

The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment. This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further. Growth moving forward will be slower than many advocates hoped, though continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism. The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue.",https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EVIncentivesArticle2400x1260-Facebook.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 14:01:53.028519
,Detroit Environment,2025-09-23 16:51:19+00:00,Kresge Foundation,Ten years of Live6: A neighborhood alliance continues place-based growth and impact,David Carrig,,,,,https://kresge.org/news-views/ten-years-of-live6-a-neighborhood-alliance-continues-place-based-growth-and-impact/,"“When Live6 started, we were a team of one,” says Executive Director Caitlin Murphy.
Live6 hosts these workshops, community meetings and programs out of its headquarters, Neighborhood HomeBase, which is located at 7426 W. McNichols.
“Success in the next 10 years looks like more active commercial real estate on the corridor and longer hours for existing businesses,” Murphy says.
“Everyone seems to have ties to this neighborhood,” Murphy says.
“The strategies we are putting in place will spur more growth, more opportunities, and more retention of existing businesses and residents.","When Live6 Alliance was founded in 2015, its mission sounded straightforward. Serve as a bridge between institutions, businesses and residents along Detroit’s Livernois and McNichols corridors.

The reality was complex.

Vacant storefronts lined McNichols, which is also known as Six Mile. Historic homes needed repair. Longtime residents, the people who carried Detroit through its hardest times, often felt overlooked as investment skipped past their blocks.

A decade later, progress is visible.

Restaurants, clothing boutiques and art galleries are bringing new life to a stretch of Livernois called the Avenue of Fashion. New streetscapes, updated lighting and bike lanes have reshaped public infrastructure on Livernois and West McNichols. Pocket parks and public art signal pride and momentum. Most importantly, neighbors are showing up and leading.

“When Live6 started, we were a team of one,” says Executive Director Caitlin Murphy. “Our focus was on listening and convening. We were advocates. Today we are stewards of place. We are working closely with block clubs and neighborhood associations to implement projects, manage assets and align partners and dollars so that the entire district moves forward.”

That shift from planning to doing shows up everywhere.

Live6 supports home repairs and tangled title work through its Heirs Property Program. It offers more concerted business support, from retention and attraction to workshops with lenders and local partners, including the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, Small Business Administration, and the Detroit Neighborhood Entrepreneurs Project out of the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Businesses. Live6 hosts these workshops, community meetings and programs out of its headquarters, Neighborhood HomeBase, which is located at 7426 W. McNichols. HomeBase is a flexible community space that doubles as the Alliance’s primary office.

“HomeBase serves as one of our key neighborhood gathering spaces,” Murphy says. “On a weekly basis, block clubs meet here free of charge. We host workshops with the local service providers, home repair information sessions, and even art shows from time to time. We are also a tech hub and a Connect313 site so residents can drop in to use computers and Wi-Fi and get support from one of our Digital Navigators or Community Tech Consultants in order to pay bills online, or get help with their websites or social media if they are local entrepreneurs.”

The results include both physical improvements and social fabric. “There has been an uptick in civic life and participation,” Murphy says. “People pop into HomeBase every day to ask what we do because they notice the visual difference on the corridor. New businesses are coming along, and people want to learn more and get involved.”

For Murphy, the proudest moments are in the everyday scenes. “The bike lanes can be controversial, but I smile when I see kids rollerblading in them or an older resident riding to run errands,” she says. “I love driving down Prairie and seeing a full basketball game in action with dozens of teenagers on the sidelines waiting to play. There is real vibrancy in the public realm, and that matters for social connection and mental wellbeing.”

Live6’s anchor partnerships have been foundational. “If it was not for University of Detroit Mercy (UDM) at the beginning, we would not be the healthy organization we are today,” Murphy says. “They provided back-office support and helped us get started. With Marygrove, it has been powerful to see the campus transform into a cradle-to-career community asset. Residents tell us their children just started at the early childhood center or enrolled in the high school. It is becoming the community’s campus.”

Over the years, trust has deepened by putting residents at the center of implementation.

“We are in a moment of planning fatigue,” Murphy says. “To combat this, we started bringing people in weekly to work alongside us. We hire local caterers and lawn crews. We help entrepreneurs form LLCs (limited liability company) so they can be permanent vendors. Most of our staff were born, raised or live here now. We are investing in people as we grow the place.”

Looking ahead, Live6 has clear goals. “Success in the next 10 years looks like more active commercial real estate on the corridor and longer hours for existing businesses,” Murphy says. “We want to complete more home repairs and help more families secure the resources necessary to preserve and build wealth. We were just designated a select-level Michigan Main Street community, a five-year partnership with the MEDC (Michigan Economic Development Corporation) that will accelerate our stewardship of our commercial corridors. Expect more business crawls, facade improvements and interior supports along with outdoor patios that bring energy and customers to the street.”

The vision is block-by-block, node-by-node. “We started with a micro-district on West McNichols,” Murphy says. “Now we are pursuing a few key sites to activate both sides of the street and create another node of retail closer to Wyoming, directly across from the Marygrove Campus. Retail likes retail across the street. When we do that, the rest can fill in more organically. This is long-game, multi-generational work.”

For many residents the work is generational and personal.

“Everyone seems to have ties to this neighborhood,” Murphy says. “My grandfather had a hair salon on Livernois in the 1960s. My grandma graduated from Immaculata High School. My mom has worked at University of Detroit Mercy for 40 years. I graduated from UDM’s Master of Community Development program and did my capstone project with Live6’s first executive director. I have been part of this from the start, and I am grateful to be afforded the opportunity to lead the organization today.”

If she had to choose one word for the next decade, Murphy does not hesitate. “Catalytic,” she says. “The strategies we are putting in place will spur more growth, more opportunities, and more retention of existing businesses and residents. We are excited to implement and to bring as many people with us as possible and our team is equipped and ready to partner.

Ten years in, Live6 is not just a neighborhood nonprofit. It is a steward of the promise of Detroit’s neighborhoods , showing how residents, anchor institutions, small businesses, and a fully thought out public realm can add up to a place where Detroiters are proud to want to live, work, learn, play and lead.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/live6-800.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 13:01:35.949944

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump's administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries ... they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GVx_1cje3RRJKIcocfm0Pg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp_finance_889/a197f89e633515b0e8197b4dd5896077,N,,2025-09-23 17:04:35.736390

The organization supports the rollbacks of MATS regulations and the primary proposal to eliminate GHG regulations entirely on fossil fuel-fired power plants.
MOG supports the complete rollback of the 2024 MATS rule and the EPA’s primary proposal to eliminate all GHG regulations for fossil fuel plants.
Now, Ameren Missouri joins the chorus of polluters calling for weaker monitoring and lower MATS standards for its remaining Labadie and Sioux coal plants.
Ameren previously requested and received an exemption from the heightened MATS rules for its coal plants from the Trump administration.","Utilities, fossil fuel companies, and aligned groups filed public comments last month supporting a pair of Trump administration proposals to repeal EPA limits on harmful emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases from power plants.

One of the Trump administration’s proposals would reverse a Biden-era EPA rule that strengthened Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), Clean Air Act regulations limiting oil- and coal-fired power plants’ emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, arsenic and lead. Under the proposed reversal, the EPA would revert to enforcing weaker standards that were previously in place, and the EPA’s tools to enforce the standards would be limited.

Another Trump proposal would repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, based on the Trump administration’s proposed determination that they “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” It also includes an alternative proposal to repeal GHG limits on existing power plants and requirements to utilize carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at new and modified fossil fuel-fired plants, leaving in place only dramatically weakened standards for new methane gas and oil plants. Either proposal would entirely eliminate GHG regulations for coal-fired power plants.

The public comments are just the latest volley in the fossil fuel and utility industries’ long-running efforts to undermine U.S. environmental and climate standards.

The Trump administration expects to move swiftly to finalize both the GHG and MATS rule repeals in December 2025.

Utility front groups and trade associations push for deregulation

Electric utility industry groups that commented in support of the weakened federal pollution standards included the Edison Electric Institute (EEI); National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA); American Public Power Association (APPA); Alliance for Fuel Options, Reliability, and Diversity (AFFORD); Midwest Ozone Group (MOG); and Power Generators Air Coalition (PGen).

Edison Electric Institute

EEI is the trade association for U.S. investor-owned electric utilities. It has used front groups to undermine climate science and delay climate action. Utilities knew as early as the 1960s and 1970s that the climate risks of burning fossil fuels could ultimately require a transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of electricity. Despite this knowledge, utilities backed misinformation campaigns to sow doubt about the causes and harmful impacts of climate change, and delay climate action. EEI previously fought the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which sought to regulate GHG emissions from power plants for the first time in the U.S., through its backing of the Utility Air Regulatory Group.

EEI supported an earlier determination by the first Trump administration that a lowered MAT standard would be“protective of human health with an adequate margin of safety.” EEI also said that the first Trump administration’s determination was “consistent with those of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in a pair of June 2018 reports” in its comments on the MATS reversal. EPRI research is largely funded by its electric utility members, who generally pass on the cost of their EPRI dues to their customers.

Numerous medical organizations dispute the Trump administration’s adequate safety claim, including the American College of Physicians, American Lung Association and American Heart Association.

EEI also argued for looser compliance and monitoring in its MATS comments.

In its comment on the GHG rule, EEI stopped short of fully endorsing the Trump administration’s elimination of GHG regulation, instead supporting the more targeted rollback in the EPA’s alternative proposal. As part of its rationale, EEI cited case law that enables utilities to avoid federal common lawsuits where they could face liability for their climate pollution as long as the EPA retains its Clean Air Act authority to regulate GHGs. In other words, EEI wants the EPA to retain weak limits on GHG emissions from new fossil fuel plants, in part so its members can’t be sued in federal courts for their contributions to harmful climate change.

EEI also argued that CCS “has yet to be demonstrated at the levels of operation required for broad-scale deployment, and the cost of such technologies remains an additional barrier to widespread deployment.” This mirrors the argument EEI made in a 2024 lawsuit attempting to block the Biden-era GHG rule requiring CCS that Trump wants to repeal. EEI and member-utilities have long used their voluntary (and largely taxpayer and ratepayer-funded) CCS and “clean coal” research and development programs as a reason to delay transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner power sources like wind and solar power, and list CCS among their decarbonization strategies.

National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA)

NRECA is the trade association for electric cooperatives. The organization supports the rollbacks of MATS regulations and the primary proposal to eliminate GHG regulations entirely on fossil fuel-fired power plants.

Along with EEI, NRECA previously opposed the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. In addition, NRECA ran a public relations campaign in 2021 to promote coal in Illinois. NRECA touts prior and current membership in front groups that regularly fight clean air standards, including the Utility Air Regulatory Group and Power Generators Air Coalition.

American Public Power Association (APPA)

APPA is the trade association for publicly-owned utilities, such as the Salt River Project in Arizona, the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, Austin Energy, the Nebraska Public Power District, and hundreds of others.

APPA’s comments on the proposed MATS rule fully supported the rollback. Its comments on the GHG proposal, like EEI, supported the alternative proposal’s rollback, and declined to weigh in on the primary proposal beyond agreeing that a finding of significant contribution to dangerous air pollution is necessary.

APPA also previously opposed the Clean Power Plan and touted membership in the now-defunct Utility Air Regulatory Group.

Alliance for Fuel Options, Reliability, and Diversity (AFFORD)

AFFORD, previously known as the Climate Policy Group, is a trade association that bills itself as a “coalition of not-for-profit electric utilities,” though the organization does not appear to have a website and did not list its members in its comments on the proposed rules.

The group supports the repeal of Biden-era standards for MATS, arguing that coal is necessary for grid reliability, and opposes stronger regulation of the pollution-heavy fuel that might make it even more uneconomical. In its comments on the proposed GHG rule repeal, AFFORD again cites reliability as an argument for undoing regulation, ignoring the outsized costs of coal and the reliability of renewables paired with energy storage. AFFORD agrees with the primary proposal for the GHG rule and the Trump administration’s assertion that coal plants’ don’t contribute significantly to climate change, arguing that their “contribution to total global warming is negligible.”

AFFORD’s chairman is James Fuller, who is also president and CEO of MEAG Power, a generation and transmission cooperative utility in Georgia. Terry Torrens, a senior lobbyist with the Orlando Utilities Commission, is listed as a program director. Previous AFFORD leadership includes James Dickenson from JEA — the municipal utility that serves Jacksonville, Florida, Timothy Grove from Omaha Public Power, Patrick Pope from Nebraska Public Power District, and Dave Lock from the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, according to IRS filings.

AFFORD’s comments on the proposed GHG regulatory rollback were submitted by Robert Talley, a lobbyist whose client list includes AFFORD and MEAG, as well as several other municipal utilities and generation and transmission cooperatives, according to OpenSecrets. Of Talley’s listed utility clients, all still have active coal plants.

Midwest Ozone Group (MOG)

Midwest Ozone Group (MOG) is a front group comprised of utilities including Ameren, Duke and American Electric Power (AEP); steel and other heavy industry interests; and fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil and Marathon Petroleum. MOG supports the complete rollback of the 2024 MATS rule and the EPA’s primary proposal to eliminate all GHG regulations for fossil fuel plants.

The group states that its primary goal is “to work with policymakers in evaluating air quality policies by encouraging sound science.” MOG previously sued the EPA to prevent the implementation of the GHG and MAT standards that the Trump administration is now pushing to repeal.

Power Generators Air Coalition (PGen)

PGen was created around late 2020 or early 2021, as the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG) disbanded amidst a Congressional investigation, which had for years represented utilities in litigation and regulatory opposition against EPA Clean Air Act rules. PGen is operated through the same lawyers as UARG, and many of its members are the same. PGen’s founding directors included investor-owned utilities like American Electric Power, Arizona Public Service, Consumers Energy, DTE Energy, Southern Company, and Vistra.

The group commented in support of the Trump Administration plan to repeal the MATS standards. Its comments on the proposed GHG rule endorsed the alternative proposal to eliminate most regulations if coupled with an additional weakening of the few regulations remaining.

While PGen is openly engaged in the federal regulatory process, its website states that it does not lobby or litigate. However, PGen’s lawyers are active in lawsuits through other front groups with similar membership.

PGen’s comments were written and submitted by Allison Wood and Makram Jaber, attorneys at the McGuire Woods law firm. Wood and Jaber represent a separate utility group – Electric Generators for Sensible Transition – in an earlier lawsuit seeking to block the same EPA regulations now under consideration for repeal. Wood and Jaber also represented the now-defunct UARG, which had many of the same members as PGen.

PGen, APPA, and MOG all based their GHG rule comments, particularly around the issue of CCS, on an analysis by J. Edward Cichanowicz and Michael Hein. Both Hein and Cichanowicz repeatedly served as consultants for UARG — the front-group predecessor to PGen — as early as 2004. In 2011, Cichanowicz testified to Congress that “probably 75 percent” of his income comes from utilities.

Ratepayers subsidize utility advocacy

In many states, utilities are able to embed the costs of their membership in these trade associations, typically including litigation costs, into ratepayers’ electric bills. As a result, ratepayers subsidize the network of front groups filing anti-regulation litigation and advocacy. In the case of public and non-profit power, ratepayers and taxpayers are left on the hook for APPA’s, AFFORD’s, and NRECA’s pro-pollution advocacy.

Utilities supporting climate and environmental obstruction

In addition to affiliated front groups and trade associations, some utilities themselves commented in support of rolling back pollution regulations. Ameren, American Electric Power (AEP), and Cleco all filed comments last month in support of both proposed rollbacks. Duke, Arizona Public Service (APS), and FirstEnergy commented in support of the rollback of the GHG rule.

Ameren supports looser standards in the wake of excess pollution and Clean Air Act violations, fights GHG regulation

In December, federal authorities required Ameren Missouri to spend $61 million on projects to mitigate harms from Clean Air Act violations at its now-retired Rush Island coal plant, including 14 years of sulfur dioxide emissions in excess of what the law allows. Now, Ameren Missouri joins the chorus of polluters calling for weaker monitoring and lower MATS standards for its remaining Labadie and Sioux coal plants. Ameren previously requested and received an exemption from the heightened MATS rules for its coal plants from the Trump administration.

In its comments supporting the full repeal of GHG regulations for power plants, Ameren argued that electric utilities do not “contribute significantly” to climate change. In its comments, Ameren publishes an 18-page debunking of CCS as a plausible means for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but continues to plan to use CCS in its sustainability reports and integrated resource plan as a justification for building out its methane gas-fired generation fleet while maintaining corporate climate targets.

Duke Energy adds to its extensive history of climate obstruction

In a January letter, Duke, along with 9 other utilities, requested that then-nominee for EPA administrator Lee Zeldin repeal the GHG regulations at issue in the current proceeding, as well as regulations related to coal ash. Duke’s comments build on its extensive history of opposing GHG regulation, though Duke does support a standard that requires new methane gas turbines to be more efficient in its comments.

Beginning in the 1990s, Duke backed disinformation campaigns that denied the science that showed human causes and harmful impacts of climate change. Since then, the utility has opposed limits and regulations on GHG emissions. This includes supporting efforts by EEI and UARG, as well as the State Policy Network and American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, discussed below.

The Town of Carrboro, North Carolina, last year sued Duke for its “decades-long role leading a nationwide climate deception scheme that has worsened the climate crisis, harmed the community and cost the town millions of dollars.”

Like EEI, Duke argues that CCS capturing 90% of emissions is “not adequately demonstrated” and “its costs are not reasonable.” This argument comes months after Duke’s request for $10 million from ratepayers for a feasibility study on installing CCS to curb 95% of emissions at its Edwardsport coal gasification plant was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

Coal interests are also pushing regulatory rollbacks

In addition to the utility industry and its front groups, coal companies and their trade associations support the regulatory rollbacks, continuing a long history of fighting climate and environmental regulation.

As coal industry groups represent coal interests broadly, their membership can include utilities. In many cases, utilities seek to charge these membership dues to customers, forcing their ratepayers to subsidize pro-coal and anti-environmental advocacy.

America’s Power

America’s Power, formerly the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), is a trade association that represents a coalition of industries involved in producing electricity from coal, though its membership is no longer publicly shared, and utilities fled the group under pressure from investors. America’s Power has consistently opposed regulation of coal power and its polluting byproducts, including air toxins and greenhouse gases, and has perpetuated outright climate denial. America’s Power supports both the rollback of the EPA’s MATS standards and GHG regulations.

As part of its support of the Trump administration’s rollback of GHG regulations, America’s Power insists that CCS is “not economically achievable” and “not adequately demonstrated.” This comes despite ACCCE previously touting CCS as a technology that could make coal “clean” and “control pollutants regulated by federal clean-air statutes.”

American Coal Council

The American Coal Council is another coal trade association that represents the coal industry supply chain, including mining, transportation, and coal-burning utilities like AEP, Dominion, DTE, Duke, Xcel, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In its comments, the group encouraged the EPA to gut both the MATS and GHG regulations.

Like America’s Power and ACCCE, the American Coal Council has opposed environmental regulation and downplayed or denied the effects of climate change — it has called carbon dioxide the “environmental boogeyman of the day” and posted climate denial claiming that carbon dioxide emissions are actually advantageous. An American Coal Council communication kit for climate change and carbon dioxide provided the coal industry with a talking point: “bottom line on climate change: Coal equates to fewer deaths, lower medical costs, and more food.”

Also like America’s Power, the American Coal Council previously pointed to carbon capture and sequestration as the solution to coal’s greenhouse-gas pollution and a way to justify coal as clean. Now, however, the organization objects to requiring carbon capture as a best system for emissions reduction, arguing that the system is technologically and economically impractical.

Lignite Energy Council

The Lignite Energy Council is a regional trade association that represents North Dakota’s coal industry and its customers, like electric utilities. The Lignite Energy Council conducts pro-coal public relations campaigns and lobbies for coal-friendly legislation, including spending millions of dollars in attempts to block Minnesota clean energy policies. The group commented in support of both proposed rollbacks.

North American Coal

North American Coal, a coal mining company that “operates surface coal mines across Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and North Dakota,” submitted comments in support of rolling back MATS regulations. North American Coal was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to restrict the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. That suit was eventually consolidated with West Virginia v. EPA, which substantially limited the EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants in the Clean Power Plan.

Koch-funded right-wing groups supporting GHG regulation repeal

State Policy Network

Multiple affiliates of the State Policy Network (SPN) advocated for the elimination of GHG regulations on fossil fuel generation, including the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Buckeye Institute, John Locke Foundation, and Texas Public Policy Foundation. SPN serves as the central hub of a network of affiliated think tanks located in all 50 states, and is funded by right-wing and corporate donors that include fossil fuel interests and petrochemical billionaire Charles Koch’s network of conservative donors.

The network has long backed opposition to clean energy and climate policies, and at the start of 2024 listed opposing renewable energy as a top legislative priority for the coming year.

Heritage Foundation

The Heritage Foundation — the primary organization behind Project 2025, the right-wing playbook for Trump to consolidate power and pursue a right-wing agenda including environmental deregulation — also commented in support of eliminating GHG regulations for electricity generation. The group has a long record of funding from the fossil fuel industry and the Koch network.

Prime Mover Institute

The Prime Mover Institute (PMI) filed comments supporting both the rollback of MATS regulations and the elimination of greenhouse-gas emission regulations for fossil fuel plants. PMI is a new think tank created and directed by Russell Greene, who is a senior fellow with the Stand Together Foundation, founded by Charles Koch. Brian Hooks, the director and CEO of Stand Together is also a director of the Charles Koch Institute and Charles Koch Foundation, according to IRS filings.

In its comments supporting the rollback of greenhouse-gas regulations, PMI relies entirely on an analysis by Always On Energy Research, the project of Isaac Orr, Mitch Rolling, and Amy Cooke. Both Rolling and Orr previously served as policy fellows at the Koch– and Lignite Energy Council-backed Center of the American Experiment, Minnesota’s SPN affiliate, where they authored and spread disinformation intended to discredit renewable energy. Cooke is the former CEO of the John Locke Foundation and Executive Vice President of the Independence Institute, both SPN affiliates. She was also part of President Trump’s 2016 EPA transition team and a visiting energy policy fellow at SPN, where she led the organization’s Energy Policy Working Group.

American Enterprise Institute

In addition, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) — a pro-free market and anti-regulation think tank — commented in support of both proposed rollbacks. AEI has a history of climate denial, and previously offered to pay scientists to dispute climate science.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed fundamental shifts to how it conducts risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemicals already in use and already on the market. TSCA, the nation’s main chemical safety law, requires EPA to evaluate chemicals used in everyday products — from shower curtains and children’s toys to paint strippers and degreasers. EPA is touting the move as increasing efficiency, but the proposed changes undo important provisions that would better protect public health. EPA is giving the chemical industry much of what they have asked for — a promise that EPA will downplay the risks of toxic chemicals, so that industry can continue to put them in our homes and workplaces.

“Yet again, we’re seeing Trump’s EPA prioritize industry profits over the health, safety, and wellbeing of people.

Under TSCA, EPA is required to evaluate chemicals in commerce to determine whether they pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment.

""Despite Republican efforts to repeal this tax credit, 25C is still the law of the land through 2032, and families should keep getting the savings they were promised.
The 25C credit, which reduces the amount of taxes owed, is capped at $3,200 a year, with lower limits for specific equipment and improvements.","Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), saying the OBBBA cited the wrong subsection, in Section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code, in canceling the credit. The IRA had moved the provision for 25C's expiration from subsection (h) of Section 25C to subsection (i).

The letter argues that the credit remains in effect through 2032 and calls on the IRS to affirm that. ""Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families,"" the letter says, in part.

""Democrats argue that because the termination clause was no longer in subsection (h), Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill amending subsection (h) to end the credit in 2025 was legally ineffective,"" wrote Alex Ayers, vice president of government affairs at Heating, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI), in a blog post.

However, Ayers' take is that the technicality on which the Democrats are pinning their hopes does not in fact exist and that 25C will almost certainly expire at the end of the year. Ayers doesn't want the Democrats' efforts to mislead consumers or contractors into thinking they'll be able to use 25C after this year. HARDI and other HVACR trade groups are aligned on the issue, he said.

""We would love to see incentives,"" Ayers said during a recent interview. ""We don't want a consumer to feel they've been hurt by a contractor based on a press release.""

Ayers said that, for reasons that are unclear to him, the change in the IRA that moved 25C's subsection (h) — the expiration date provision — to subsection (i) had not been written into ""positive law"" at the time the OBBBA was adopted in July. At that point, he said, the change remained in what's called ""slip law,"" which, while valid, does not have the authority of positive law.

""At the time the law (OBBBA) was passed, subsection H contained the expiration date, and that's what was amended,"" Ayers said.

A Congressional source said Democrats were seeking clarification on the issue from the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC). The OLRC is in charge of accurately maintaining the U.S. Code.

The IRS, Ayers said, has issued guidance that says that 25C can be claimed only for equipment that is installed and put into service before the end of the year. The IRS is unlikely to change its position, he said. ""The only out that we see is for House Democrats to try and file a lawsuit,"" which is also unlikely, he said.

""Time is running out for homeowners to take advantage of the credit, and (HARDI) members should encourage contractors to schedule qualifying projects as soon as possible to avoid installation delays in December,"" Ayers wrote in his blog post.

But Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., one of the leaders of the Democrats' effort to preserve 25C, said he'll keep working to protect it.

""I wrote the Home Energy Savings Act, which was signed into law through the IRA, because working families deserve to get real savings on their energy bills,"" Gomez said in an emailed statement. ""Despite Republican efforts to repeal this tax credit, 25C is still the law of the land through 2032, and families should keep getting the savings they were promised. I led the fight to create this credit, and I'll keep leading the fight to protect it.""

The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.

The 25C credit, which reduces the amount of taxes owed, is capped at $3,200 a year, with lower limits for specific equipment and improvements. The credit for a qualified heat pump, for example, is $2,000, while the credit for a qualified central a/c unit is $600.

Daniel Raimi: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I'm your host, Daniel Raimi. Today, we talk with Dr. Sheila Olmstead, professor at the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy, Atkinson scholar, senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, and a university fellow here at RFF.

Along with a group of colleagues, Sheila recently published an opinion piece critiquing the way that the United States incentivizes the deployment of carbon capture and storage, or CCS. Specifically, they argue that current policies could actually lead to more pollution, deter the deployment of alternative energy sources, and cost a whole lot of money. In this conversation, Sheila will make the argument for why the current policy design is flawed and offer some suggestions for how to make it better. Stay with us.

All right, Sheila Olmstead from Cornell and RFF. Welcome back to the show.

Sheila Olmstead: Thank you, Daniel. Thanks for having me.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, of course. I was looking back at our records and noticed that the last time you were on the show was almost five years ago. It was December 2020 and you were talking about a totally different topic—the Clean Water Rule with my colleague Kristin Hayes. So, I'm wondering if you can remind us how you got interested in working on environmental issues in your career.

Sheila Olmstead: Yeah, of course. I like to tell this story to my students because it shows, in a way, that life is long, and you can follow a twisted journey to your ultimate destination.

I actually was in my master's program in public policy at the University of Texas at Austin. I was doing foreign policy stuff, and I had an internship lined up at the US embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, between my two years in my master's program. Then, my dad got sick, and I ended up deciding I needed to stay in Austin for the summer.

So, there I was in the era of the bulletin board. Literally, the internship office had paper opportunities posted with tacks on a bulletin board. The only one left at the time, which I realized was going to be an important change for me, was an internship at the state environmental regulatory agency—at the time, it was the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and has now become the Texas Council on Environmental Quality.

I took that internship, and it was delightful. It was in the Office of Border Affairs. I started working on understanding the water and wastewater infrastructure needs of communities called colonias—very low-income communities on the Texas side of the border that had inadequate sanitation, drinking water supply, roadways, and services like trash and schools. I was hooked after working on that and realizing, “Hey, we are in a wealthy state, in a wealthy country, and it's amazing that there are these environmental challenges that have such profound implications for human health. And here they are, right in our backyard.” So, that was it. I started taking environmental policy classes and studying economics, and then here I am today.

Daniel Raimi: That's so interesting. I don't think we've ever talked about this, because I had a similar experience when I was doing my master's program at Duke. I wanted to get a job or an internship in education policy, and I didn't get one. The only one that I got offered was an environmental job at the state environmental regulator.

Sheila Olmstead: We have that in common.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah. So, I took that internship, and the rest is history.

Sheila Olmstead: That's so great. I love that.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah. Cool. As I mentioned in the intro, we're going to talk today about carbon capture and storage, or CCS. The federal government's been subsidizing CCS since 2008, I believe. The policy's called 45Q, because that's the relevant section of the tax code that codifies the subsidy. Can you get us started by giving us a sense of how much deployment of CCS the current policy landscape might actually lead to, and how much it might cost in the years ahead?

Sheila Olmstead: Sure. Yeah, it's interesting. The subsidy for CCS, in contrast to subsidies for some other climate-friendly tech, has been remarkably generous and persistent over administrations of many different political flavors. As you noticed, it has been around since 2008. It's really only gotten richer since then. And that's, again, quite different from subsidies for wind and solar, for example, and electric vehicles, which have gone up and down. The wind and solar subsidy has been canceled, so there's been a lot of uncertainty, really for a long time, over those.

But, for CCS, it's been quite bulletproof. And it's hard to know. As you know, there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much deployment is going to happen as a result of any policy. But for this one, there are some pretty good recent estimates looking at the total fiscal cost of the Inflation Reduction Act's increase in the 45Q subsidy, suggesting that it'll exceed $100 billion through 2031.

Unlike some of those other climate-friendly subsidies that I just mentioned, the CCS subsidy was not reduced by the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), or the law that was passed by Congress with the budget and signed by the president. I would anticipate that that cost number is probably still about right. There are some changes we may talk about later that have maybe made it even more appealing for firms to take, so it's possible that those costs could even be higher.

Then, we can think about how, at the level of an individual deployer of CCS for a single 500-megawatt coal-fired power station, studies suggest that payments could amount to $3 billion to $4 billion over 12 years. The subsidy has a 12-year lifetime, basically from the time the firm begins taking it until it expires. If we think about deployment overall, its current level is $85 per ton. That's the 45Q tax credit that could certainly lead to more rapid US deployment of CCS than what we've seen under lower versions of the subsidy.

There's some models suggesting that total predicted carbon dioxide storage could reach 200 million to 800 million tons annually just because of the increase that happened under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—which, as I mentioned, is continuing even under the new rules and budget.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Okay. So, definitely large dollar numbers we're talking about here. Tens of billions of dollars a year, potentially.

Sheila Olmstead: Yes.

Daniel Raimi: You mentioned that the OBBBA changed the 45Q subsidy. That's been a little controversial. We've talked about it a little bit on the show before, but can you just remind us, What was the change? How do you think about that change from an economic perspective?

Sheila Olmstead: This is a great question, and it's one we hear a lot of conversation about. But, I feel like there's been some fogginess with how we talk about it, maybe because we haven't thought that much as economists about carbon capture and storage and the structure of the subsidies for it.

It used to be the case in the IRA and before (so, basically, all versions of the 45Q subsidy) that firms would get a smaller subsidy for capturing carbon dioxide right from their flue gases and storing that by using it for enhanced oil recovery. So, it's a process in which firms will take carbon dioxide, pump it into an aging oil and gas field, and then stimulate and reduce the cost of production from those fields.

This process, called EOR or enhanced oil recovery, does store carbon. Most of the carbon dioxide that is pumped down into the well, into the formation that the firm is getting oil and gas from, does stay underground. So, it is a form of storage, but it used to be the case that it got a smaller payment from the federal government than did what's called geologic storage—in which firms take carbon dioxide from, say, a refinery or a power plant, and then purely store it deep underground. And that could be a saline aquifer, an old oil and gas field, or something like that.

What the OBBBA did is it created parity between those payments, so the EOR subsidy went up. Now, if I'm storing carbon dioxide by stimulating new oil and gas production, I get the same payment as if I just took carbon dioxide from a power plant or a refinery and then stored it geologically without stimulating new production. There's some controversy to this, because just thinking through—wait a minute. If what we're trying to do is decarbonize and shift away from fossil fuels, then why would we be making equal payments for using carbon dioxide to generate more oil production or cheaper oil production?

It's a fair question, but there are three things to think about as we consider whether, from an economic perspective, providing equal payments for these two forms of storage seems right or not.

The first is the source of carbon dioxide. So, if I took emissions—from a power plant or refinery—and used them for enhancing oil recovery by storing most of that carbon underground or geologically in some other fashion, as long as both of those emissions are coming from the same types of anthropogenic sources that would otherwise (or, counterfactually) have been released to the atmosphere, then the two technologies, the two approaches shouldn't differ and shouldn't get different levels of payment. The 45Q subsidy is designed really only to provide payments for that kind of emissions capture—so, for anthropogenic emissions that would otherwise have been released. On that basis, I think we can say parity seems to make sense unless that changes.

In the past, a lot of firms have used naturally sourced carbon dioxide from deposits underground for EOR. So, in a way, if they're switching and using anthropogenic carbon dioxide, that could even be better than we were before.

The second thing that you'd want to think about is, Is there a difference between the long-run storage security you get if you inject carbon dioxide underground to enhance oil production, or if you just inject it purely for storage?

I haven't seen any evidence that those are not equal mechanisms in these particular cases, but that would, I think, require some further study and some investigation. And, if they are different on those bases, then having a different payment might make sense, or having an equal payment might not make sense.

The thing that's, I think, biggest, and maybe the one that a lot of folks have missed, is whether any oil production that you get from this injection of carbon dioxide is actually additional. So, if it's not expanding global oil production, then parity seems reasonable to me. I hate to go out on a limb here, because I like to see studies that look at this, but if new oil produced using enhanced oil recovery by injecting carbon dioxide in the United States simply displaces a barrel of oil that would've been produced elsewhere by not storing carbon dioxide, then I see these approaches as fundamentally equivalent to injecting carbon dioxide for deep storage purposes without the enhanced oil recovery.

But again, I think that needs some further study. And I think a lot of folks that are critical of making these payments equal are very focused on this idea that it's going to increase oil production. It's possible, in the long run, that it could do that if US production is a large enough share of global production and this subsidy makes a big enough difference that we get more production than we would otherwise have done, or at a lower price, or both. But I don't think anyone can answer the question of whether that's true or not. And so, until we can, I don't think we can confidently say whether this change under the OBBBA really makes sense from an economic perspective.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, really interesting. I feel like that's a good study that our colleague Brian Prest might be able to run with some of his oil and gas modeling.

Sheila Olmstead: Yes.

Daniel Raimi: One quick follow up to that: I was talking with Jen Wilcox from the University of Pennsylvania about this, and one thing that she pointed out to me (which, I'm curious to hear if this changes your thinking at all) is that the expansion of the 45Q credit wasn't just for enhanced oil recovery—it was actually for any use of the captured carbon dioxide.

Sheila Olmstead: Yeah.

Daniel Raimi: So, she was a little bit more positive about it, because she was excited that maybe the carbon was going to get used in new advanced materials or for other applications that don't involve extracting fossil fuels. Does that change how you think about it at all?

Sheila Olmstead: It also contributes. This is an area where I think we're in much earlier days than we are with pure storage, in a geologic sense. I would say two things.

One, I agree 100 percent that if this stimulates more research into how to embody carbon dioxide within concrete or cement or other materials that have seemed to have some significant prospects in that direction, I think that's a great thing that could be very useful. The only caveat to that is, for utilization purposes and given the scale of carbon dioxide storage that people talk about, if you look at models of what's necessary to meet either national or global decarbonization goals and avoid, say, two degrees of sea warming, the scale of that amount of storage is just enormous, and I don't think we're ever going to be in a position where demand for things like carbon dioxide for cement or other materials is going to eat up enough of that necessary storage to make a huge dent in the problem.

But, I do think we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and I think this is exactly the kind of technology that's nascent and really needs support before it could be deployed at any scale. It would make a lot of sense to subsidize that work.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, really interesting. Let's get back to the analysis that you ran with your colleagues. So, one of the key points that you make is that, unlike renewable energy projects like wind or solar—which are expensive to build, but very cheap to operate—CCS is expensive to build, and it's expensive to operate. Why does that matter in a policy context?

Sheila Olmstead: I'm so glad you asked this because, again, I think it's something that we haven't necessarily thought through very well when we think about carbon capture.

I think, if you look at the package of subsidies that the United States has had, and certainly which were enriched under the IRA, we think about them as all roughly equivalent. There's either subsidizing some capital, such as the construction of new stuff, or they're subsidizing production of climate-friendly stuff. Some are big, and some are small, and they're going to induce some carbon dioxide emissions reductions, hopefully. CCS is completely different from something like subsidizing the production of electricity from wind turbines or solar panels. To capture carbon from a coal-fired power plant is a very different endeavor.

Why is it different? It's different because the cost of generating electricity from the sun or the wind will come down over time. And what are we producing with those technologies? We’re just making electrons, or sending electrons through a transmission system, and that's eventually being used as electricity in homes and businesses. So, the cost of that comes down over time, and it competes with other ways of generating electricity in the marketplace, including coal and gas. And that's true in the United States and many other places with abundant renewable resources. New onshore wind or solar photovoltaic both compete with the cost of a new natural gas power plant, even without subsidies, in many parts of the country.

In contrast, the government payment per ton of carbon dioxide is the market for CCS. There is no other market, though there are some small exceptions in the United States: California has a cap and trade, and there's the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. So, there are some places where there are carbon prices, and those provide, at this time, a fairly small incentive. I haven't looked at those prices recently, but my guess would be less than $30 per ton, maybe $40 per ton. CCS costs a lot more than that for most applications. So, without the federal subsidy, there is no carbon capture.

The government subsidy has to be enough to cover the whole cost of this, and it has to continue in perpetuity. This has really important implications materially for both climate change, and fiscally for the United States.

For climate change, climate-tech subsidies come and go. We see this historically in the United States. Even the stuff that's pretty popular is sometimes not. Sometimes it's big; sometimes it's small. Unfortunately, CCS firms have no incentive to run a carbon capture facility without that payment, and they will never have an incentive to do that. So, any coal or gas power plant, or industrial facility that's built with CCS, is only going to capture carbon when the payment is sufficient to support it.

As just one example of that, the only coal-fired power plant in the United States—at least that I know of that currently has a carbon capture unit—is the Petra Nova project, which is on one of the generating units at the W. A. Parish Generating Station coal-fired power plant near Houston. And that project was heavily subsidized by the US Department of Energy and the federal government, and received payments under section 45Q—the subsidy for carbon capture. For a couple of years, when the price of oil dropped during the pandemic, it shut off the capture unit because it was not profitable to run that unit. The reason the price of oil made a difference was because the use of that carbon dioxide is for enhanced oil recovery.

So, the firm is getting a payment from the federal government to capture the carbon, and then it's also getting a payment for that carbon dioxide to be used in nearby oil fields for enhanced oil recovery. The EOR incentive was just not enough to keep that unit running. It really needed the government payment and a high oil price.

They have since restarted, but I would anticipate that if we see additional deployment of CCS in the power and industrial sector in the United States, exactly that kind of pattern will emerge, and they will say, “Hey, wait, when the subsidy is high enough, I'm going to run this thing. When it's not, I'm going to shut it off.”

For climate, this makes a big difference. If I incentivize a bunch of deployment and get a whole bunch of, say, power plants that stay in the industry and generate electricity that might have exited either without the subsidy or with a carbon tax or some other policy approach that might've achieved the same level of emissions change, then I have to keep paying those guys, or they're going to shut off the capture unit, and that is a real problem for the climate.

But it's also, as you can imagine, a problem fiscally. Currently, the subsidy expires after 12 years. And so, if we don't want all those capture units, and if we induce a bunch of deployment, and we don't want them shut off after 12 years, then the government is hostage to that. They have to keep making those payments in the absence of any kind of additional policy that might replace it, like a mandate or a carbon price or something like that. So, both for the sake of emissions and climate change, and for the fiscal situation of the federal government, I think CCS is very different from the other technologies that we're subsidizing. And it's very important.

If we can say one thing that comes away from this podcast, I hope people will keep that in mind: that these are not comparable subsidies.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Totally. And, just for context, I looked up the price in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in California, and it's on the order of $25 a ton right now. So, significantly less than the carbon capture subsidy that we're talking about.

Okay, so another point that you make in your piece is that providing a per-ton subsidy for CCS will actually encourage some of the most polluting plants to keep running so that they can take advantage of the fact that they have the most carbon dioxide that's available to capture and monetize. What's the implication of that for the deployment of other clean energy technologies and the competition between coal with CCS or gas with CCS and other nonpolluting sources?

Sheila Olmstead: Yes, it has pretty significant implications, I think. Again, I'm not a modeler. If you look at models suggesting the amount of deployment we might expect and so on, CCS is still a fairly small slice of the picture. But, as you know, Daniel, imagine we keep in the power-generation industry a small number of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants—those that have the highest emissions intensity. We could do that by paying $85 per ton for carbon dioxide stored. If we're doing that, then you have to ask, What would've happened without the subsidy? Would those coal-fired power plants have been displaced by either new gas generation or by new wind and solar? And really, in either of those cases, we might be better off for the climate with the counterfactual—without the subsidy being there for those plants. And so that's, I think, a pretty important point that may have been missed by a lot of other folks.

It's true that if I put carbon capture on a coal-fired power plant, I'm going to reduce a lot of carbon dioxide. The unit cost of removal is approximately constant between 80 and 95 percent removal, and 45Q requires 75 percent capture. So, those numbers are pretty high. It's good news that we are going to capture most carbon dioxide emissions.

But, again, the counterfactual is not, “What do we look like with the subsidy and capturing carbon dioxide from coal versus without the subsidy and not capturing carbon dioxide from coal?” It's, “What would otherwise have been there without the subsidy?” And for the climate, wind and solar would be better than even coal with, say, 85 percent or 90 percent removal. So, we really need to take that into account as we think about our modeling.

Another piece is that there's a dynamic to this, and I have touched on this a little bit. This subsidy alters these entry and exit incentives for power plants and industrial facilities in a way that favors carbon intensity over the long run. So, the richer that subsidy is, the more we might expect that we're shaping the fleet of power plants and industrial facilities in the United States in a direction that is exactly counter to what we would like to do as we decarbonize.

And so, those are both important points—both a static incentive, to be as dirty as possible and to increase your payments as much as you can, and the dynamic incentive that changes the nature of carbon intensity within the affected industries over time.

Daniel Raimi: Great. Got it. All right. So, you've already articulated a number of theoretical concerns with this policy design. In the paper, you articulate three specific flaws. What are those three specific concerns with 45Q?

Sheila Olmstead: The first two are related to what you just mentioned, that we could actually get, in a static sense, some increased emissions under 45Q, even with the high removal standard that the subsidy requires.

Think about this: if a coal-fired power plant has installed CCS, and it obtains this $85-per-ton tax credit, it would likely produce more electricity over the course of a year than it would without CCS, even during hours with low electricity prices, because the 45Q subsidy could make it profitable for the plant to generate even when it otherwise would not. So, again, it's not just, “Do I displace one plant with another? Do I have coal with CCS instead of wind and solar?” But, “How do those coal plants operate when they're receiving the subsidy?” They're likely to basically displace more generation by other resources, even in the short run, simply because it's profitable to run them more often when they have the subsidy than when they don't.

The second flaw is this dynamic problem of altering these entry and exit incentives. Polluting facilities that would have been unprofitable with a price on carbon or a mandate of some kind would actually earn a profit with an equivalent 45Q subsidy that's going to cover their carbon capture costs. And so, that could keep them in an industry that they would otherwise exit and likely be displaced by cleaner sources.

The third flaw is somewhat linked to these first two in that what we're doing when we pay $85 per ton for carbon dioxide storage is we're incentivizing more of the dirtiest production of whatever good or service we're talking about. And when we do that, a lot of that carbon dioxide is coming from the combustion of fossil fuels. This creates other emissions that we might worry a lot about, since they generate human health damages because of local air pollution.

There are a lot of good questions out there about how CCS is going to affect different pollutants. Some good news is that it will generally tend to reduce direct emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. But some bad news is that, when facilities adopt this post-combustion carbon capture technology, ammonia emissions may rise. For the most common post-combustion carbon capture technologies, we tend to see an increase, and sometimes a big increase, in ammonia emissions, and the result is an uptick in the secondary formation of fine particulate matter.

Some work that I've done with Andrew Waxman would suggest that, at least in the Gulf region on net for industrial facilities and for natural gas power plants, those human health damages on average are net negative. They're quite significant. They're still outweighed by the climate benefits, but it does suggest that there's potentially important (both from a distributional perspective and from a political and feasibility perspective) trade-offs between local damages and global benefits. And again, that gets more and more steep the more of that dirtier generation we incentivize through the per-ton subsidy.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Andrew was on the show talking about that paper maybe a year ago or something like that. I think it just reinforces the concerns that a lot of environmental justice organizations have about the deployment of carbon capture, at least with the specific technologies that we're talking about that can lead to increased ammonia around the plants.

Okay, so you've articulated lots of flaws with the policy design, but let's get constructive now. What are some recommendations that you offer for how to do this better?

Sheila Olmstead: That's a great question. So, I'm trying to follow the rules. So, my boss when I was at the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration was Jason Furman. He was the chair at the time of the council and he would always say, “You don't always want to be the economist in the room that says, ‘How about a carbon tax?’” Because it's not very constructive.

But the first thing I have to say (forgive me, Jason) is, How about a carbon tax? Okay, so I will just get that out of the way. Tax carbon dioxide. If we did that, we would have prompt deployment of carbon capture where it's cost-effective. It would probably happen in some hard-to-decarbonize industries, places where that makes a lot of sense without these counterproductive dynamic effects on industry composition and possibly on emissions. Not likely, as you know, to be politically feasible. So, in order not to be laughed out of the room, I'll offer some other, maybe marginal, changes that I think would be really helpful and viable given the design of other subsidies, even in the OBBBA.

The first thing I would recommend is to correct that most significant downside to 45Q, which is the fact that it is awarded on a per-ton-of-carbon-dioxide basis and rewards carbon-intensive production. So, the subsidy amounts to something like $100 per megawatt-hour for a coal-fired power plant and $40 for a natural gas–fired power plant. That really makes very little sense from a climate perspective. And I'm not sure, even from a stimulating-industry perspective, or whatever the other prompts behind 45Q are, I'm not sure it makes sense from that perspective, either, and I'm not sure it was on purpose per se.

I think you could pay it per unit of production and restrict it to firms that are meeting strict emissions standards—a megawatt-hour for fossil-fired power plants, or something like that, rather than per unit of captured emissions. And that's consistent with other tax credit designs that we've seen out there—the 45V hydrogen tax credit, for example, which determines subsidy eligibility based on life-cycle emissions. So that's one, I think, viable and important potential fix. I wish we had seen that in the OBBBA, since it's a slight tweak—a redesign of the subsidy.

You could also imagine hybrid approaches. We could adjust the structure so that it doesn't favor carbon-intensive production, but then also price uncaptured carbon dioxide emissions. You see how I snuck that in, pricing emissions again?

But the idea would be to provide some carrots to adopting facilities. And so, you're paying firms to continue to reduce carbon dioxide, but if you're basically taxing the residual emissions, they're still getting the payment so that they can afford to deploy the technology. Though we're creating marked technology, we for sure would reduce carbon dioxide emissions if we did that. But it's more expensive for sure than a carbon price alone, and it doesn't get us out of the fiscal jam of having to pay forever.

Another thing that I think would be very sensible—it might even make more sense at this stage of the technology's history and deployment—would be to reduce the level of the current per-ton incentive. You wouldn't have to drive it to zero, but you could reduce it from $85 per ton to soften these counterproductive effects and maybe better contain fiscal costs over the long run. Then, pair that with an investment tax credit that would reduce the cost of installing CCS, setting up the storage, and so on. That would enable projects to recoup more of their costs up front, which would also potentially be helpful in this era of uncertainty about how long these kinds of subsidies are going to be around and whether they're going to persist long enough for the stream of payments to make up for the up-front investment.

Again, at this fairly early stage, it's not unreasonable to think that this might be a better design and might both expose firms to less uncertainty about future policy risk and the federal budget to less uncertainty about future fiscal risk of making these really large payments in perpetuity.

And I would just add that, in order to fix this problem with local air pollution trade-offs, that would have to be directly addressed in a different way—to either require water washes or acid washes or another technology to reduce ammonia emissions, or just simply have some kind of a standard so that we don't get these unintended increases in local human health damages.

Daniel Raimi: Great. This has been a fascinating conversation. I feel like we're going to be talking about carbon capture for a long time into the future, so it's great to get these conversations going and really think hard about how the policies need to be designed.

I'd love to ask you now, Sheila, the same question we ask all of our guests at the end of each episode, which is to recommend something that you think is great and that you think our listeners would enjoy. So, what's at the top of your literal or metaphorical reading stack?

Sheila Olmstead: What is at the top of my stack? That’s a great question. It's terrible, but I'm trying to remember the book that's on the top of my stack. It's by Jayne Anne Phillips, and it's called Night Watch. It's a Civil War–era story, it's pretty dramatic, and it's really interesting. Thanks for asking.

Daniel Raimi: Sounds great. Okay, Sheila Olmstead, one more time from Cornell and RFF, thanks so much for coming on the show. Congratulations on the paper, and thanks for sharing it with our audience.

Thinking of an electric vehicle? You’ve only got a week left before federal tax credits end, or you’ll have to pay full price.

The $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles (EV) ends Sept. 30. Steven Hershkowitz is the managing director for clean transportation for the Washington Department of Commerce. He expects the loss of this incentive will hurt EV sales in the short term.

“There is going to be a bit of a drag on the growth rate that we have seen,” Hershkowitz said. “We’ve already seen the market growth slow down in 2024 and into 2025.

Washington got rid of its tax exemption for EVs earlier this year. The legislature and Governor Ferguson are deciding to use those dollars elsewhere, but Herskowitz said the state’s commitment to electric vehicles and clean energy isn’t going away.

“The commitment is still there, and the prioritization is still there,” Herskowitz said. “These consumer-facing incentives that were quite popular are not, unfortunately, but there’s progress being made in terms of making sure that, hopefully, we can get the incentives back at some point.”

Climate Commitment Act to fund clean energy projects

The state will continue to use funds from the Climate Commitment Act to push clean energy and expand EV charging around the state.

Herskowitz believes electric vehicles are the future, and the demand will eventually return.

“The automakers know that this is where it’s going,” he said. “The global competition is further ahead in many major markets now internationally for EVs, and so this is where we’re going. It’s just about the pace at which we get there.”

The pace also includes finding ways to improve the pricing for electric vehicles.

The average price for a new EV is over $55,000. The average price for a new gas car is $49,000. You can certainly find new EVs for much less. Some only run about $30,000.

Now might be the time to get in, if you want to take advantage of the tax credit.

“It’s a good opportunity for people who have been considering getting an electric vehicle to really bring that consideration up to a higher level, perhaps go into dealerships, test drive, see what the prices are,” Herskowitz said. “This could be a good opportunity to get deals depending on which model you’re looking at.”

But expect a lot of company. You won’t be the only person trying to squeeze in before the deadline.

Read the first three stories here.

In 2019, in the shadow of Hurricane Dorian, Danny Shelley, the new CEO at Horry Electric Cooperative in coastal South Carolina, sat at dinner with mutual aid crews including Chad Stone, a line foreman at Little River Electric Cooperative.

“This hurricane is coming and I haven’t been in this job six months,” Stone recalled a concerned Shelley saying. “I just want to let you know I appreciate you.”

The words stuck with Stone. In September 2024, he was the new interim general manager at Little River Electric Cooperative when an unthinkable hurricane shook his inland co-op to the core. Teams from Horry Electric were there the next day and would eventually outnumber the entire Little River staff.

The situation was reversed. You’ll excuse the catch in the Stone’s voice.

“This is what they kept saying: ‘We are not leaving till every light is on.’ And the ones that went home didn’t want to. They said, ‘We’re coming back, Chad, we’re coming back. We’re not gonna leave y’all until every light is on.’”

A war movie

Off a beaten path in Abbeville, about 90 miles west of Columbia, Little River has a little more than 15,000 meters. It is a blueprint for the tightly knit, small-town co-op, where everybody knows each other, wears multiple hats and takes pride in treating people with respect. Stone went to school with Tricia Smith, member service and communications director; he and Mike Hall, vice president of engineering services, have each put in more than 30 years at the co-op, which has 32 full-time staffers.

“Most of us that work here knew each other at some point long before we came here. We already had friendships before we came,” Smith said. “When we come to work here, you are already part of the family because you’ve known that person forever.”

As Helene approached, the family needed outside help. Anticipating the damage high winds could do to the oak and pine forests across Little River’s four-county territory, Stone asked the South Carolina statewide association to locate extra crews, figuring that his team could take care of about half of any situation.

The red dots showed otherwise. They flashed on the outage map screen in Hall’s office, one on top of another, outage after outage, on the morning of Sept. 27, 2024, until just about all of the co-op’s members were in the dark.

“It reminded me of those war movies when people are in the Defense Department and looking at the map of all the places that are going to be bombed. And this was kind of a bombing in a way. That was what we felt like,” Stone said.

Anecdotal evidence backed it up. Stone had called all lineworkers into the office, but a three-foot-wide pine tree blocked one crew member’s return after he had responded to a car trapped under a power line.

“We started going out to try to get to him and we couldn’t. No road was passable that quickly. It took us probably 30 minutes to finally get around trees and go this road and that road to get to him,” Stone recalled.

Once located, Stone and the lineworker found themselves on opposite sides of the immovable tree. Stone had planned to pick up an order at Cold Springs Cafe. With his path stymied, the lineworker went in his place, only to find the store pushing water out the front door.

“That is when I really realized that it was going to be 15 days or so before we got things under control,” Stone said.

From here to there

The morning after Helene hit, Horry Electric and Little River were going in opposite directions at the same time with distressingly poor prognoses.

Conway-based Horry Electric quickly brushed off Helene’s impact, restoring power to about 9,000 members within a few hours. On Sept. 28, four six-man line crews and engineering personnel set out west from Horry Electric to Abbeville, a four-hour-plus ride in normal conditions. As they got to the city of Newberry, it was time to refuel the trucks. But that was not going to happen.

“Everything was dark, no power, not a store or station was available, so we said we’ll just go as far as we can,” said lineworker Chad Tyler. They drove another 50 miles. Fallen pine trees everywhere. A bucket truck could barely squeeze by on some roads.

“The entire system, north to south, was destroyed. So overall their damage was way more than what we’ve ever experienced here since I’ve been here,” said supervisor Franklin Williams. “It was two days before we could really see all the damage.”

As line crews tried to make sense of things, Little River confronted the need to feed and care for a rush of visitors that eventually would number about 180 lineworkers. A preorder of sandwiches and biscuits proved to be inadequate, and a small team of employees from the office headed east in four SUVs around 9 a.m. to buy groceries in nearby Greenwood even as Horry Electric crews headed toward them.

It was a disaster. There was nothing in Greenwood. Every store was closed, every road was blocked. Turn around, find another road, find another blockage. On their own, they headed to Columbia, about two hours away. At headquarters, Smith became concerned. “We had no communication. I couldn’t call them. I had no idea where they were. And I was like, ‘Why is it taking so long?’” It was nightfall when they finally pulled into the Little River lot.

“Columbia’s not a hard ride, but they said it was so bad they could not get there. It took three or three-and-a-half hours,” Smith said. “And they were exhausted and tired and emotional because it had taken them about 10 hours to go get some groceries. They brought all that food back in four SUVs and we were like, ‘Gosh, this will last for days.’ Our food was gone in two days.”

With the community’s help, the co-op started to find a groove. Retirees came in to help. A local restaurant with a food truck made some dinners. Headquarters became Grand Central Station South as donations of food and ice turned the office into a food pantry. A member donated a refrigerator. “We had so much food we didn’t know where to put it,” Smith said. Staffers worked from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. so they’d be the first to arrive and the last to leave; Smith slept on an air mattress for nine nights.

A local doctor volunteered his house; that provided several comfortable beds for weary lineworkers. The fire station opened its doors, while other workers stayed at the house of Hall’s mother, a prominent educator who died three months before Helene. “We were buying cots and blow-up mattresses and blankets and pillows, putting them wherever we could,” Stone said. “I’m thankful that the crews didn’t know what was going on behind the scenes. All they knew was they had a place to go.”

Reinforcements arrive

Stone has a display of framed, color 8x10s of his heroes on one wall of his office. They’re not of sports stars or celebrities, though. They’re photographs of the dozens of line crews that came from points near and far to help Little River in its darkest hour.

Like Dave Monson, materials coordinator at Nishnabotna Valley REC in Harlan, Iowa, who traveled 1,100 miles as a part of a four-man team, waited out a three-hour traffic delay in Atlanta and labored 16 hours a day for 10 days in working his first hurricane.

“Being from Iowa, you don’t realize the amount of trees,” Monson said. “A lot of their structures just jump at angles through the trees. Almost every pole they had was at angles. The biggest thing I noticed right away, as we were driving into the hurricane damage, was how many trees were uprooted versus just broken off.”

At night, Monson and his partners ended up in a historic hotel in Abbeville. “Come to find out, after we were there a couple of days, it was haunted. We didn’t see anything but it was just kind of an interesting little story,” he said.

Out-of-state crews arriving a week after the storm found the challenges just as daunting as the first responders from Horry Electric. About 400 poles were down. A Dominion transmission outage presented a major complication in a portion of McCormick County, south of Abbeville. Little River couldn’t think about restoring power until that was fixed, which took nearly a week.

“If it wasn’t broken poles, it was wire on the ground or broken crossarms or some of that nature—everything from a three-phase pole to a service pole,” said crew foreman Jason McKinney, one of eight mutual aid lineworkers from Mecklenburg Electric Cooperative in Chase City, Virginia. “It was wild, all those roads with trees still across them.”

Little River was not sufficiently staffed to dispatch bird dogs, the term given a coordinator who appraises and supervises an area of repair. Lineworkers from Horry Electric stepped in and filled the vital role of leading and directing crews in the field.

“The help from the outside, it was just awesome. Maybe we could have done it without them, but it would have taken a lot longer and been a lot more painful,” Hall said. “We want to safely get everybody’s lights on as soon as we can. We like to take care of ourselves. But sometimes you need help.”

The Little River staff also wanted to make a good first impression on its visiting lineworkers. “I always say if you want respect from them, you better give them respect,” Hall said. From his experience on the ground during Hurricane Katrina, Stone knew the value of keeping a stockpile of supplies at hand. “We had headache medicine, we had socks, we had belts, we had everything. It was like a buffet every day and they appreciated that.”

Staffers, volunteers and employee spouses tended to lineworkers’ laundry every night. When the laundry came back in the morning, each basket was topped by a handwritten card or note from a child via a school or a church.

“There were notes everywhere with your lunches and everything from kids, members … I mean it was pretty amazing,” Monson said. “Almost every morning they had a devotional prayer for us. They really made it made you try to feel as close to home as you could.”

And Little River came full circle from the night when Shelley sat down with Stone and other crews at the onset of Hurricane Dorian. “They weren’t just a face; they were somebody we actually sat down with every night at dinner,” Smith said. “We would go from table to table or just greet them. I think that helped. It was like they were the same people from a whole different state.”

Chicken bog

Horry Electric did not let up by any means; in fact, it forestalled some of its work at home so its lineworkers could help Little River and other co-ops. Shortly after the storm hit, Horry Electric announced extended waiting times for new service requests, generator installation and outdoor light repairs so employees could focus on Helene restoration.

“They were not hooking up new connections as quickly as usual because so many of them were here and at other co-ops,” Stone said. “That was something their membership lost, but it was to help another community. That just really stuck out to me.”

Horry Electric’s communications team helped with social media posts and images sent by its lineworkers, and one of its retirees cooked a massive chicken bog as a celebration for all the good work done by the line crews.

“It’s rice, chicken, sausage, onions, a bunch of different seasonings. They brought it in these cast iron pots, just loads of them. That must be a tradition down there. It was new to me, but I tell you what, it was good,” said McKinney of Mecklenburg Electric. In fact, two members of his team cooked a chicken bog of their own when they returned home.

Stone also took note of a budding relationship between Horry Electric and the pastor of a small church in a troubled part of Little River’s territory. “They brought a huge trailer of supplies and were taking it to that community, and they dropped off supplies for that church to distribute. They had a horse trailer; it was that full. Then when they left here, they went straight to North Carolina to drop off more things. So they didn’t just help us. They were helping as many people as they could.”

That, he said, represents the best of the cooperative community and helps to explain the ties that bind Little River and Horry Electric.

“When their crews were leaving, there was a strong sense of gratitude and mutual respect shared between us,” Stone said. “That relationship we made with that co-op is like no other one you ever will see.”

It's also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign.","Rarely, if ever, do our nation’s most complex public policy problems have a singular cause. Such is the case of rising power bills across the country, and the misleading narrative that electricity is becoming more costly solely because of the growth of the data center industry.

For starters, consider Georgia, where the plan to build multiple new data centers is actually keeping electricity prices steady – bucking the national trend of rising power rates. In fact, Georgia Power, the state’s regulated utility, just got approval to freeze its rates for three years. This rate freeze is possible because data centers are pumping vast sums into the state’s economy and creating sufficient revenues for Georgia Power to stabilize rates for everyone else.

It is also worth noting, that for all the talk about data center development driving up rates across the country, current data centers are actually clustered in a small handful of states like: Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois, Florida, and New York. But with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, which will be powered by data centers, these facilities are rapidly expanding into new parts of the country.

However, a planned data center or one under construction does not impact current electric prices.

For example, Louisiana just approved what might one day be the largest data center on the planet for Meta (Facebook’s parent company). In the frenzied lead up to the vote by the state’s Public Service Commission to approve electric service for the facility, the false narrative of data centers and higher electric prices took hold. It led to inaccurate headlines like “Louisiana's electricity costs rise amid data center boom” even though the state only has a handful of data centers, with no impact on Louisiana's energy prices.

Also, in some states where electricity costs are going up, it’s because of external factors that have created roadblocks preventing new sources of generation. For example, PJM, the mid-Atlantic grid operator that encompasses 13 states and the District of Columbia, has become a regime incapable of bringing sufficient new electrons onto the grid.

Now, anger at PJM’s failings is bipartisan, with nine Governors – Democrats and Republicans – in the PJM footprint recently sending the grid operator a letter stating, among other things, that: “…PJM's multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment...”

PJM’s dysfunction means that its available capacity today is about the same as it was in 2024. So, it’s no surprise that with the rise of electric demand, including from data centers, that PJM’s electricity prices are skyrocketing to alarming levels and creating economic hardships for millions of customers.

Another factor driving up energy costs is that electrification means more Americans are plugging in their electric vehicles, converting to electric stoves, furnaces and water heaters, and using an ever-increasing number of electrified devices. Also, we cannot ignore the fact that parts of the country are experiencing weather extremes, forcing people to use large amounts of electricity to stay comfortable year-round. This drives up energy bills and customers are understandably frustrated.

Other reasons energy prices are rising is because after years of insufficient investment, states now need to spend billions on grid improvements like new transmission lines and distribution wires to people’s homes and businesses. Because of this long-term lack of investment in our electric grid, we are dealing with a series of electricity bottlenecks across the country that drives up electricity costs. Data centers, utilities, regulators and grid operators need to come together on this crisis, to ensure that electricity can move more efficiently across the nation.

It’s also worth noting, that because the construction of data centers is so appealing to states looking to create jobs and fill tax coffers, many will be built. But, again, that doesn’t mean they need to drive-up electricity rates. In Georgia, an additional reason they could implement a three-year rate freeze, was because the electric utility, working with state regulators and their data center customers, was able to create a special rate class for data centers to ensure they cover their share of grid maintenance, and those costs are not passed onto customers.

Other options to protect customers from rate hikes due to data center expansion, include using AI to coordinate with the utilities so that when demand spikes – say during a heatwave – those data centers can be throttled down to use less electricity. Data centers can also have their own generation onsite to reduce demand and lower electricity prices. If those data centers want to also use the electric grid as a backup, again, they must pay their fair share for maintaining that infrastructure. But with coordination and common sense, utilities and data centers can profit without exposing customers to risk.

It's also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign. After all, if lawmakers and regulators seek to lower energy costs, by throwing up roadblocks to data center construction, they will be trying to solve a problem by addressing the wrong cause. In the end, the result will be poorly crafted public policy that hamstrings the tech sector and our economy but fails to help the American people cope with rising electricity costs.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/696241_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 13:03:05.748129

As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded just days ago, the 2009 Endangerment Finding was accurate when first decided and has been reinforced by even stronger evidence since then. The conclusion is now “beyond scientific dispute,” the National Academies panel concluded.

“The EPA grasps at straws to explain away its statutory obligation under the Clean Air Act and muddies the water with bogus science, but its rushed and opaque rulemaking process cannot hide that its proposed repeal is contrary to law, science, and basic common sense,” the environmental groups said in their 221-page comments.

NRDC was joined by the Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, and Sierra Club in its filing. These groups are not alone. More than 600 witnesses testified over four days of public hearings in August – 97 percent of them opposing EPA’s proposals. And more than 350,000 individuals and organizations filed public comments, overwhelmingly against EPA’s retreat.

In addition to the substantive criticisms, the groups highlight how EPA has violated fundamental principles of administrative law: rushing its process; relying on a report prepared by a secret panel set up in an illegal manner; and failing to discuss its divergence from recommendations from the National Academies.

“EPA’s irrational and rushed process would leave Americans exposed to the worst climate impacts just as we are all seeing the evidence up close. Whether it’s flooding in North Carolina or heat waves in Phoenix, climate change is here and we need to tackle it,” said Meredith Hankins, federal climate legal director at NRDC. “What EPA is doing is clearly against the law, and if it follows through with this approach, we will see them in court.”

Separately, NRDC filed comments detailing why the EPA should also abandon its paired plans to eliminate carbon pollution standards for cars and trucks. Those comments detail how nixing those rules will mean higher costs for drivers, fewer American jobs, more asthma and heart disease, and greater amounts of harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Without even considering the health and climate lost benefits, repealing the rules would mean an additional $257 billion in fuel and maintenance costs for drivers over the next 25 years if realistic fuel prices are used.

Overall, repealing the standards would mean the loss of $3.38 trillion in net societal benefits by 2050, an analysis prepared for NRDC by the consulting firm ERM found.

“Clean car standards are a win-win proposition. They address the largest source of climate pollution, while also saving drivers on their fuel and maintenance costs,” said Kathy Harris, clean vehicles director at NRDC. “Repealing them might appease the oil industry, but the rest of us will suffer with more air pollution, more extreme storms and heat waves – and more trips to fill up at the gas station.”

Comments were due yesterday for EPA’s plan to rescind the endangerment finding and vehicle rules. EPA must now consider these comments before deciding if it will finalize its proposal. The agency has said it plans to do so by the end of the year.

Despite being the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity on the planet, nuclear energy is still largely excluded from voluntary carbon markets.
Investors are far more likely to back early-stage projects that can tap into carbon markets — especially when competing technologies already do.
Excluding nuclear from carbon markets undermines those goals by weakening the business case for investment in one of our most effective decarbonization tools.
Carbon markets without nuclear are incomplete.","Guido Núñez-Mujica is director of data science at the Anthropocene Institute.

As the world doubles down on net-zero targets, carbon markets have become a cornerstone of our global climate response. But their credibility hinges on one critical question: Are we truly valuing all forms of low-carbon energy? Right now, the answer is an emphatic no. And one glaring omission proves it: nuclear power.

Despite being the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity on the planet, nuclear energy is still largely excluded from voluntary carbon markets. Major standards like Verra and Gold Standard currently do not allow nuclear projects to generate carbon credits. This omission doesn’t just weaken the integrity of the system: it distorts the entire market.

Nuclear power prevents 430 million metric tons of CO2 emissions each year. That’s more than the annual emissions of Japan. Finland reduced their coal use by 70% after their latest nuclear reactor went online. Nuclear plants operate at high capacity, providing reliable baseload power that complements variable renewables like wind and solar. And yet, the enormous climate value of that contribution goes unrewarded — financially and symbolically.

To put it in perspective: while wind and solar generation often fluctuate with the weather and time of day, nuclear plants run more than 90% of the time. This makes them a crucial anchor in a clean energy grid — one that allows intermittent renewables to expand without sacrificing reliability or stability and able to replace fossil fuels 24/7.

This has serious implications. Around the world, aging nuclear reactors are being decommissioned without adequate replacements. In many cases, they are replaced by fossil fuels. When Germany shut down its nuclear fleet, coal use spiked. In California, emissions rose after San Onofre closed. In New York City, shutting down Indian Point led to such an increase in emissions that the Texas grid is cleaner now than the NYC grid. These are not isolated incidents: they are symptoms of a global financing problem.

Why does this happen? Because carbon markets create powerful economic signals. If nuclear can’t participate, it has no way to monetize the emissions it avoids. That makes it harder to keep existing plants running, and even harder to build new ones. Clean energy technologies like solar and wind benefit from both policy support and access to carbon finance. Nuclear, despite its proven performance, remains ineligible.

And this isn’t just about today’s technology. Tomorrow’s nuclear — small modular reactors, advanced molten salt systems, even solid-state fusion prototypes — is on the cusp of commercial readiness. These systems promise cleaner, safer and more flexible applications of nuclear power. But to scale, they need capital. Investors are far more likely to back early-stage projects that can tap into carbon markets — especially when competing technologies already do.

This sends the wrong message at precisely the wrong time.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has repeatedly stated that we cannot meet 1.5°C goals without nuclear energy. The International Energy Agency agrees, calling for a doubling of nuclear capacity by 2050. Excluding nuclear from carbon markets undermines those goals by weakening the business case for investment in one of our most effective decarbonization tools.

It also risks undercutting energy sovereignty for countries that could be ready to decarbonize but can’t depend solely on weather-dependent renewables. Nations in the Global South, in particular, stand to benefit from new nuclear technologies that are resilient, dispatchable and space-efficient. By blocking nuclear from carbon finance, we are effectively restricting access to one of the most scalable decarbonization tools for emerging economies and pushing them towards cheaper and reliable fossil fuels. There is a reason why coal use has been skyrocketing for the last decade despite the apparent success of solar and wind.

This issue is especially urgent for emerging reactor developers. New designs — many of them smaller, safer and more flexible — are ready to support hard-to-decarbonize sectors like industrial heat, hydrogen and desalination. But without access to carbon credits, their financing models are incomplete. That’s not just a missed opportunity. It’s a structural roadblock to innovation that makes our climate goals much harder, maybe impossible, to meet.

Industrial emissions alone account for roughly one-quarter of global greenhouse gases. These are sectors like steel, cement, chemicals and heavy transport — sectors where renewables often fall short. High-temperature nuclear reactors could supply the heat, hydrogen and power these industries need, without emissions. But first, we have to level the playing field.

Of course, bringing nuclear into carbon markets should come with safeguards. We need transparency, rigorous life cycle accounting and alignment with international safety standards. But exclusion by default is not a safeguard — it’s a failure to reflect scientific consensus.

There’s also a fairness issue at play. Carbon credits are meant to reward avoided emissions. If a new solar project gets credits, why not a nuclear project that avoids the same — or more — CO₂? If we are serious about climate outcomes, if we truly think we are in a climate emergency, then the rules must reflect the physics of carbon, not political or historical bias.

We don’t have time to cling to outdated perceptions. The original rationale for excluding nuclear from voluntary markets was tied to fears about safety, weapons proliferation and public perception. But decades of evidence — and a new generation of safer technologies — have shifted the conversation. Even the European Union accepts nuclear power as green in their energy taxonomy. Climate science now overwhelmingly supports nuclear as part of the solution. Climate Policy must catch up.

Nuclear energy is not a panacea. But it is a powerful, proven and essential part of the climate solution. If we want carbon markets to work the way they are supposed to — if we want them to drive real decarbonization — we must ensure they recognize all forms of low-carbon energy. That includes nuclear.

Key Votes

Passed Government Funding Package

The House has successfully voted to keep the government running and deliver on our agenda to put the American people first. In a perfect world, I do not support funding our government through continuing resolutions. However, Democrat obstruction has prevented Congress from passing appropriations bills under regular order as our Founding Fathers intended. Folks are tired of the partisan games that consume Washington and want our leaders to work together to meaningfully improve the lives of our constituents. Unfortunately, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to shut down the government to appease the far-left voices in his party, even if it hurts the American people. If Schumer and the Progressive Left want to shut down the government, it is solely on them. I supported the clean, bipartisan package to keep the government open and avert a harmful shutdown.

Passed FY26 National Defense Authorization Act

I applaud the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY26, and I am especially proud to share that over $90 million for Camp Lejeune and $200 million for F-35 maintenance at FRC East were secured.

This package robustly modernizes our armed forces to prepare us against threats and solidifies our national security.

Through this legislation, Congress has restored lethality and the warrior ethos in the military, put in measures to restore security at America’s borders, created reforms to improve the quality of life of servicemembers, supported the Golden Dome, and so much more.

This package robustly funds and modernizes our armed forces to prepare us against threats abroad and bolsters our national security.

Passed H. Res. 719, Honoring the Life and Legacy of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk

It was a somber day in the House as we passed H. Res. 719, Honoring the Life and Legacy of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk. America, and the world for that matter, lost a great voice for reason and clarity in a time of vast confusion. It is imperative that we, as Americans, look towards peace. It is okay to disagree, but as Charlie always said, ""When people stop talking, that's when you get violence.""

Charlie was a strong believer in the power of faith, family, and for standing firm in your beliefs. He was a loving husband and father, inspiring many people through his work. He dared to engage with those who disagreed with him, even in hostile environments, with vigor and integrity in the pursuit of truth.

Our nation mourns the loss of a good man who fervently believed in the American experiment and dedicated his life to making a strong case to young individuals for continuing to keep faith in our institutions.

May his death not be in vain; may it evoke a turning point in our nation to engage with one another respectfully and with reverence for the dignity of life.

Passed H.R. 3579, the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act

I am excited that H.R. 3579, the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act, has passed the House. As an original cosponsor of this bill, I recognize its importance in assisting veterans with service-connected disabilities.

This bill modifies the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that provides job training and employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. It requires the VA to report to Congress regarding the employment of veterans who participate in a vocational rehabilitation program under the VR&E program, including the annual wages of veterans before and after completion of a program. Additionally, the VA must annually publish the date on which a veteran requests a vocational rehabilitation program under the VR&E program and the date on which they first meet with a counselor as part of the program. Finally, the VA must seek to enter into a contract with a non-VA entity that has expertise in vocational rehabilitation to review, report, and provide recommendations on rehabilitation programs under the VR&E program.

This bipartisan bill will improve the support and opportunities that are available to veterans transitioning back to civilian life. I proudly supported it in the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee as it was being considered.

Introduced the Make America’s Youth Healthy Again Act

President Trump has reestablished the Presidential Fitness Test to promote the well-being of our nation’s youth, promote discipline, and encourage personal growth. That is why I introduced the Make America's Youth Healthy Again Act to codify this executive order into law.

Physical fitness is requisite to combating obesity, a major contributor to our nation’s life expectancy stagnation and mental health crisis. Daily movement improves brain health, lowers risk of disease, and physically active students receive better grades.

Introduced Resolution to Urge UN to End Special Treatment of China

For decades, China’s economy has grown to become the second largest in the world, fueling its ambition for global hegemony. Despite this status, China is still classified as a developing nation under multiple treaties and international organizations, allowing it to receive special privileges.

That is why I introduced a resolution calling on the House of Representatives to reject China’s classification and stand up for common sense.

Veterans National Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act Companion Legislation Introduced in Senate

America tragically loses 17 or more veterans to suicide each day. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are far more prevalent among the veteran community. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a promising treatment option that offers a lifeline to veterans with PTSD/TBI on whom other treatments have failed.

That is why I introduced H.R. 1336, the Veterans National Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act, which passed the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.

I am proud to continue my fight, alongside Senator Tuberville, who introduced companion legislation in the United States Senate, to make this therapy accessible to all of America's veterans.

House Committee on Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Hearing

The House Committee on Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on tax-exempt hospital spending. Many nonprofit hospitals spent significant amounts of money while failing to provide adequate community benefit, as required by law.

While health care costs have increased over the last few years, President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to decrease wasteful spending through reducing burdensome regulations and allowing innovation to thrive.

Some institutions of medicine have lost sight of their core mission to provide accessible, quality, and affordable health care through discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. It is time for accountability.

House Administration Subcommittee on Elections Hearing

The House Administration Subcommittee on Elections held a hearing on maintaining election operations in the face of natural disasters. North Carolina is no stranger to natural disasters. Time and again, our state has endured the impact of damaging hurricanes and powerful weather systems that test our leaders, institutions, and infrastructure. We understand the risk hurricane season poses each year to our communities, including the disruptions to critical services and functions of society, and we prepare accordingly.

Chief among these responsibilities is maintaining the ability to administer safe and secure elections under the difficult circumstances that natural disasters create. Regardless of the challenges thrown our way, voters deserve to have confidence in the results of our elections. It’s vital that we maintain the operations of our country during all natural disasters that we may face.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, there was significant uncertainty about how affected individuals would be able to participate in the 2024 election, including claims that the disaster would be leveraged for political purposes. It is a testament to the outstanding performance of the Board that not only were voters not disenfranchised by the disaster, but Western North Carolina led the state in turnout.

North Carolina continues to be a powerful role model in our country.

North Carolina Delegation Hurricane Helene Update

Nearly one year ago, Western North Carolina experienced the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene. It is our job to make sure WNC's ongoing recovery efforts are being funded. I joined members of the NC delegation, Governor Stein and his Staff, NC Emergency Management, and GROW NC to discuss the state of repair efforts and what Congress can do to continue assisting in restoration efforts.

Since the hurricane, we have been advocating as a bipartisan congressional delegation for continued funding and recovery support from the federal government. There is much funding that has been requested and approved by the Governor’s Office. However, due to federal bureaucracy, there have been delays with getting this funding to the local governments. I asked hard questions of our state leaders to uncover the cause of delays and determine how funding can be better distributed. It is essential that the entire North Carolina congressional delegation continue to work together to combat delays and deliver for the state.

Western North Carolina has been there for us in Eastern North Carolina through numerous natural disasters, and we will continue to be there for them now and in the years to come.

Meeting with the Austrian Vice-Chancellor

It was an honor to meet with the Austrian Vice-Chancellor, H.E. Andreas Babler, to discuss how the United States and Austria can cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship. The Central European nation is a democratic ally, friend, and economic partner. Our collaboration helps foster open dialogue and cooperation at an important time.

Meeting with White House Office of Science and Technology

I was able to meet with Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to discuss maintaining the United States’ global dominance in biopharmaceutical research and innovation.

During this pivotal time, we must ensure Americans can access safe and reliable medications at home and abroad.

Phone Call with the Ambassador of the Republic of Haiti to the US

I had the opportunity to speak with the Ambassador of the Republic of Haiti to the US, Lionel Delatour. It is in the interest of America to maintain peace and stability in the Caribbean.

We must reauthorize the HOPE/HELP Program to continue our fruitful partnership with Haiti and further develop our relationships with countries in our hemisphere.

Meeting with North Carolina Dermatologists

It was great to meet with dermatologists from North Carolina to discuss Medicare payment reform, the prior authorization process, and step therapy.

We must ensure insurance bureaucracy does not impede patients from receiving timely care.

Thank you for your vigorous advocacy on behalf of patients in our state!

Meeting with North Carolina Orthopedic Surgeons

I had the pleasure of meeting with several orthopedic surgeons from North Carolina to discuss Medicare payment reform, prior authorization reform, physician-led hospitals, and research funding.

The Trump Administration secured an industry pledge to fix the broken prior authorization system. Major insurance companies, which cover nearly 75% of American patients, have agreed to enact comprehensive reform to the prior authorization process to ensure at least 80% of prior authorization claims are adjudicated in real time by 2027. However, further oversight is needed to ensure progress is being made and other harmful insurer practices don’t arise.

As a physician for over 30 years, I have witnessed the ridiculous and ever-increasing obstructions caused by insurance companies to delay or deny care to patients. These bureaucratic hurdles end up hurting patients and those who care for them. Practices have had to hire many more staff to fight with insurance companies, which takes away from the time physicians should be spending with patients.

I have made reform a top priority of mine since coming to Congress. I am grateful we have so many surgeons advocating for our patients and ensuring bureaucracy does not affect timely care.

Helsinki Commission Hearing

The Helsinki Commission held a hearing regarding the country of Georgia’s government collaborating with U.S. adversaries, such as Russia, China, and Iran. Against the wishes of the Georgian people, the pro-Moscow government has engaged in authoritarian practices such as silencing independent media, jailing opposition leaders, and criminalizing civil society.

Action must be taken to hold the Georgian government accountable and to safeguard American interests.

Meeting with the National Community Pharmacists Association

I had the opportunity to speak with members of the National Community Pharmacists Association to discuss issues facing America’s pharmacies, including Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) who make drugs more expensive for patients.

NCPA was founded in 1898 and aims to be the voice of independent pharmacists so that they may compete in a free and fair marketplace through the American free enterprise system. They represent over 18,900 pharmacies that employ more than 205,000 individuals nationwide.

Congress must put patients and health care providers before insurers and their middlemen, who siphon precious health dollars off the backs of good folks in need of care.

The Hill: Employment in Healthcare Event

I had the opportunity to participate in a vibrant discussion on employer-sponsored health care. Quality health insurance should put patients first, providing access to timely care with price transparency.

We must protect the doctor-patient relationship, enhance the standard of care for all Americans, and preserve patients' dignity.

Meeting with the Association of Academic Physiatrists

It was great meeting with the Chairman of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at East Carolina University and member of the Association of Academic Physiatrists. The AAP is a group of psychiatry professionals working to improve patient care for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.

I appreciate the efforts of the group to expand research and education for numerous conditions affecting patients.

Meeting with Former President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia

Thank you to former President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia for meeting with me to discuss the fight for freedom by the Georgian people who are resisting Russia. The Helsinki Commission held a hearing regarding Georgia’s pro-Putin government collaborating with Moscow.

I am glad to see that former President Zourabichvili is working with the Commission to foster communication and transparency.

Meeting with the Ambassador of Denmark to the USA

I had the opportunity to meet with the Ambassador of Denmark to the USA, Jesper Møller Sørensen. As founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United States and Denmark continue to have a strong and lasting friendship. This relationship helps advance U.S. foreign policy and national security initiatives while cultivating the defensive strength of the Nordic Region.

Meeting with Puerto Rico Representatives

Great to meet with leaders from Puerto Rico to discuss various health care issues facing Americans living on the island.

We discussed H.R. 3042, the Medical Manufacturing, Economic Development, and Sustainability (MMEDS) Act of 2025, which would incentivize medical manufacturing in economically distressed areas of the US and the effects of this bill on Puerto Rico, if passed.

Additionally, we discussed the Medicaid block grant that is set to expire in 2027 and Medicare Advantage financing. Medicare Advantage benchmark rates in Puerto Rico are significantly lower than in the mainland, leading to lower plan quality, reduced benefits, and provider attrition.

We must stand up for Puerto Rican Americans and ensure they have access to quality care.

Meeting with the Epilepsies Action Network

I enjoyed meeting with Scott Copeland, who co-founded the Epilepsies Action Network with his wife after their son was diagnosed with epilepsy at a young age. Scott and his team have been vigorously advocating for the epilepsy community by promoting awareness, funding, and collaborating with various stakeholders to improve the lives of those living with epilepsy.

There are currently 3.4 million individuals living with active epilepsy in the U.S., and 1 in 26 individuals will develop epilepsy at some point in their lives. Even with its prevalence, epilepsy is the only common neurological disorder without a National Plan. Once passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, a National Plan would reduce epilepsy-related mortality, improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of epilepsies, increase research, and decrease socioeconomic, racial, and geographical disparities in healthcare.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5af308849d5abbb875f94e0f/5af308c30e2e72435caef952/68d1345396b3861f20af5576/1758620100427/NCPN+Template+Post+%2813%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-23 13:02:26.138130

Trump campaigned on a pledge to unleash American energy, and he has already signed multiple executive actions aimed at bolstering the nation’s nuclear power in particular. Energy groups have taken notice, and Trump’s efforts appear to have trickled into the state level, with places like New York embracing nuclear energy.

“President Trump has flipped the script on nuclear,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, said in a statement to The Hill.

“This is energy dominance in action, delivering more domestic fuel, more reliable 24/7 power, and downward pressure on electricity costs for families and industry,” Isaac added.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in June directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop at least one new nuclear plant to provide at least a gigawatt of power. In the announcement, Hochul touted the need to “embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence.”

Earlier this month, California-based company Oklo Inc. announced plans to build three modular nuclear reactors in Tennessee as part of a $1.7 billion facility that will convert nuclear waste into fuel.

The announcements follow actions taken by the Trump administration to increase the nation’s nuclear energy capacity.

In May, Trump signed executive orders aimed at quadrupling the nation’s nuclear power, including by cutting back on health and environmental considerations.

He also issued an order in May stating the government “must utilize its full authority to accelerate the secure and responsible development, demonstration, deployment, and export of United States designed advanced nuclear technologies to bolster readiness and enhance American technological superiority.”

“President Trump, along with those who he’s brought into his administration, has shifted the paradigm away from unfounded fear and alarmism on climate and energy, to new opportunities for American energy and its benefits for Americans,” Steve Milloy, senior policy fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Embracing safe, affordable nuclear energy is just one aspect of this change but it’s noteworthy because it demonstrates the declining influence of organizations whose objective has been to keep our leaders and the public in a perpetual state of fear; those days are over,” Milloy added.

Trump will be in New York City on Tuesday to attend events for the United Nations General Assembly. His presence will coincide with Climate Week NYC, an annual gathering of business, government and environmental leaders to discuss investments in clean technology and other ways to combat climate change.

Confirmed speakers for the climate event include European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Kenyan President William Ruto and top energy officials from Denmark, Australia and other nations.

“This is a critical year for climate action. It’s inspiring to see businesses, governments, and the wider climate community stepping up to show the world that global climate action continues,” Helen Clarkson, CEO of Climate Group, said in a statement.

“Our theme this year is Power On, because we need to stay focused, ambitious, and keep delivering progress,” Clarkson said. “New York City has really lived up to that spirit this year and it’s shaping up to be the most impactful Climate Week NYC we’ve ever held.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Trump_911_Pentagon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-23 15:01:22.121398

While the company largely met revenue expectations with robust sales growth, a notable miss on earnings per share (EPS) sent ripples through the market, causing an immediate dip in the company's stock price. This divergence highlights the ongoing pressures on profitability within the retail sector, even as demand for essential automotive parts and services remains resilient.

The earnings report serves as a critical barometer for the health of the automotive aftermarket, an industry often seen as recession-resistant due to the necessity of vehicle maintenance. AutoZone's performance, particularly its ability to drive sales across both its Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) segments, offers valuable insights into how consumers are prioritizing vehicle upkeep amidst evolving economic conditions. The market's reaction underscores the importance of bottom-line performance in investor sentiment, even when top-line figures appear strong.

AutoZone's Q4 Performance: A Closer Look at What Happened and Why It Matters

On Tuesday, September 23, 2025, AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) reported diluted earnings per share of $48.71 for its fiscal fourth quarter, which concluded on August 30, 2025. This figure fell short of the consensus analyst expectation of $50.86, representing a miss of approximately $2.01 per share. Despite the EPS shortfall, the company's net sales reached $6.24 billion, aligning closely with analyst forecasts that hovered around the $6.24 billion to $6.25 billion mark. When adjusted for an extra week in the prior year's quarter, sales growth was even more impressive at 6.9%.

The immediate aftermath saw AutoZone's stock price experience a negative reaction, declining by over 4% initially and settling down by 3.2% in early trading. This market response signals that while investors appreciate top-line growth, profitability remains a paramount concern. The primary culprit for the EPS miss and margin pressure was an $80 million non-cash LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge, which significantly impacted the gross profit margin, leading to a 98-basis point decline to 51.5%. Additionally, operating expenses increased to 32.4% of sales, driven by strategic investments in growth initiatives.

These results matter because they provide a clear window into the current state of the automotive aftermarket. The solid 5.1% increase in total company same-store sales, with domestic same-store sales up 4.8%, indicates robust consumer demand for automotive parts and accessories. Both the DIY and commercial (DIFM) segments demonstrated steady improvement throughout the quarter, with pre-earnings analyst projections suggesting DIFM growth at 11% and DIY growth at 1.5%. This dual-channel strength underscores the ongoing necessity of vehicle maintenance and repair, whether consumers choose to perform the work themselves or rely on professionals.

The increased inventory by 14.1% year-over-year also signals AutoZone's commitment to supporting its growth initiatives and ensuring product availability. However, the LIFO charge and increased operating expenses highlight the challenges retailers face in maintaining profitability amidst inflationary pressures and significant investments. The ability of companies like AutoZone to manage these costs while continuing to grow market share will be a key determinant of future success.

Market Implications: Winners, Losers, and Shifting Dynamics

AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) Q4 results are likely to send varied signals across the broader market, particularly within the retail and automotive sectors. The immediate impact on AZO's stock, with its initial decline, suggests that investors are highly sensitive to profitability metrics, even when sales figures are strong. This could lead to increased scrutiny on other retail companies reporting earnings, prompting a closer look at their gross margins and operating expenses. Companies that can demonstrate efficient cost management alongside revenue growth may see their valuations strengthen, while those facing similar margin pressures could experience investor skepticism.

Within the automotive aftermarket, AutoZone's performance offers a mixed bag. The robust same-store sales growth, particularly in the DIFM segment, bodes well for other players in the commercial auto parts supply chain, such as distributors and smaller independent repair shops. These entities could benefit from the sustained demand for professional automotive services. However, the gross margin contraction faced by AutoZone due to LIFO charges might signal broader inflationary pressures on inventory costs that could affect the entire industry. Competitors like O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP) will be closely watched to see if they experience similar cost pressures or if their operational efficiencies allow them to better navigate these challenges.

The emphasis on aggressive store expansion and investment in the Mega-Hub network by AutoZone indicates a commitment to gaining market share. This strategic move could intensify competition within the aftermarket, potentially putting pressure on smaller, less capitalized players. Companies with strong supply chain management and efficient distribution networks may emerge as winners, while those unable to scale or adapt to increased competition could face headwinds. Furthermore, the continued strength of both DIY and DIFM segments suggests that consumers are maintaining their vehicles, which is a positive for manufacturers of automotive parts and components, as well as diagnostic tools and equipment.

Conversely, companies heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spending, especially those outside of essential services like auto maintenance, might find the market's focus on profitability more challenging. The AutoZone report serves as a reminder that even in sectors with steady demand, cost control and margin protection are paramount for investor confidence. This could lead to a broader market trend of favoring companies with strong fundamentals and proven abilities to convert revenue into healthy profits, potentially impacting valuations across various consumer-facing industries.

Broader Implications: Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds and Industry Evolution

AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) recent quarterly results extend beyond mere financial figures, offering a deeper understanding of broader industry trends and macroeconomic undercurrents. The sustained demand in the automotive aftermarket, evidenced by strong same-store sales growth across both DIY and DIFM segments, reinforces the industry's often-cited resilience. In an environment where consumers might be tightening their belts on discretionary purchases, vehicle maintenance remains a non-negotiable expense, positioning the aftermarket as a relatively stable sector. This trend suggests that consumers are opting to repair and maintain existing vehicles rather than purchasing new ones, a common behavior during periods of economic uncertainty or higher interest rates.

The challenges to profitability, particularly the impact of the LIFO charge and increased operating expenses, highlight the pervasive issue of inflation and supply chain complexities affecting retailers globally. AutoZone's experience is not isolated; many businesses are grappling with rising input costs and the need to invest in infrastructure and technology to maintain competitiveness. This situation could lead to further consolidation within the automotive aftermarket as smaller players struggle to absorb these costs, while larger entities with greater economies of scale and purchasing power, like AutoZone, continue to expand their footprint. The company's aggressive store expansion and investment in its Mega-Hub network underscore a strategic pivot towards enhancing efficiency and inventory management to mitigate these pressures.

Moreover, the report sheds light on the evolving landscape of automotive service and parts distribution. The continued strength of the DIFM segment, catering to professional mechanics and repair shops, indicates a growing reliance on expert services. This trend could be driven by the increasing complexity of modern vehicles, which often require specialized tools and diagnostic equipment, making DIY repairs more challenging for the average consumer. For manufacturers of advanced automotive components and diagnostic software, this shift presents significant opportunities. Conversely, traditional DIY parts retailers may need to further enhance their service offerings and digital capabilities to retain their customer base.

Historically, the automotive aftermarket has demonstrated counter-cyclical tendencies, performing well when the broader economy faces headwinds. AutoZone's Q4 results largely align with this historical pattern, showcasing demand for essential services even as profitability faces external pressures. Regulatory implications could also emerge, particularly concerning supply chain resilience and pricing transparency, as governments and consumers become more attuned to the factors influencing product availability and cost. The industry's ability to adapt to these evolving dynamics, from technological advancements in vehicles to shifting consumer preferences and economic realities, will define its trajectory in the coming years.

What Comes Next: Strategic Pivots and Market Opportunities

Looking ahead, AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) Q4 2025 earnings report sets the stage for several key areas that investors, industry observers, and consumers should closely monitor. In the short term, the market will be keenly watching how AutoZone manages its gross margins and operating expenses in the coming quarters. The $80 million LIFO charge was a significant factor in the EPS miss, and the effectiveness of the company's strategies to mitigate such cost pressures will be crucial. Any signs of improved margin performance or continued investment in cost-saving technologies could positively influence investor sentiment and potentially lead to a stock price recovery.

From a long-term perspective, AutoZone's aggressive store expansion strategy and continued investment in its Mega-Hub network will be pivotal. CEO Phil Daniele's commitment to ""aggresively open stores in the new year"" to grow market share indicates a clear strategic direction. The success of this expansion will depend on effective site selection, efficient supply chain integration, and the ability to capture new customers in both DIY and DIFM segments. Market opportunities may emerge for companies that can provide complementary services or technologies to support this expansion, such as logistics providers or software solutions for inventory management and customer relationship management.

Potential strategic pivots for AutoZone might include further diversification of its product offerings, an intensified focus on digital sales channels, or even strategic acquisitions to bolster its market position and service capabilities. The balance between catering to the traditional DIY customer and the growing DIFM professional will remain a delicate but critical act. Companies that can effectively bridge this gap, offering tailored solutions and superior customer experiences for both segments, are likely to thrive.

Emerging challenges could include sustained inflationary pressures, potential shifts in consumer vehicle ownership patterns (e.g., increased adoption of electric vehicles requiring different parts and maintenance), and intensified competition from online retailers. Investors should pay close attention to AutoZone's guidance on future capital expenditures, inventory management strategies, and any commentary on its long-term vision for navigating these evolving market dynamics. The coming quarters will offer further clarity on whether AutoZone can translate its strong sales performance into sustainable profitability and continued market leadership.

Conclusion: A Resilient Market Faces Profitability Hurdles

AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 earnings report paints a compelling picture of a resilient automotive aftermarket sector grappling with persistent profitability challenges. The robust sales growth, particularly the strength in both the DIY and DIFM segments, underscores the non-discretionary nature of vehicle maintenance and repair, positioning the industry as a bedrock of consumer spending even amidst economic uncertainties. This demand highlights the enduring need for reliable transportation and consumers' willingness to invest in their existing vehicles.

However, the notable miss on earnings per share, primarily driven by a significant LIFO charge and increased operating expenses, serves as a stark reminder of the broader macroeconomic pressures impacting retailers. Inflationary costs, supply chain complexities, and the necessity of strategic investments for future growth are collectively squeezing margins across the industry. AutoZone's immediate stock price reaction reflects investor sensitivity to these profitability hurdles, indicating that top-line growth alone is not sufficient to satisfy market expectations.

Moving forward, the market will closely monitor AutoZone's ability to effectively manage its cost structure while continuing its aggressive expansion plans. The company's strategic focus on growing market share through new store openings and enhancing its Mega-Hub network is a clear commitment to long-term growth, but the execution of these initiatives will be critical. Investors should watch for improvements in gross margins, efficient inventory management, and the successful integration of new operational efficiencies.",https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/favicon-48x48.png,N,,2025-09-23 12:09:27.635459

Although it still remains to be seen whether either rule will survive judicial review, it appears that both will remain effective throughout the course of litigation.","Responding to the D.C. Circuit’s deadline to inform the court how it wishes to proceed in litigation challenging the agency’s listing of two types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as hazardous substances under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stood behind its rule. In a September 17, 2025 filing, EPA told the court that the Trump administration had completed its review and would ultimately keep the Biden-era CERCLA final rule in place. The agency also requested that the court remove—i.e. pause—the abeyance placed on the proceedings, so that the lawsuit could move forward and be adjudicated.

In an unusual move, EPA’s motion was accompanied by a declaration signed by John Evans, the principal deputy assistant administrator in the Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM), hinting that the administration would still seek to alter the regulatory framework for PFAS under CERCLA, but would do so instead through congressional engagement to shield liability for “passive receivers”—those entities that do not directly manufacture or generate PFAS but receive it through feedstocks, products, or waste. In a press release issued the same day as the filing, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin doubled down on requests for congressional engagement, while also announcing EPA’s intent to develop a “CERCLA section 102(a) Framework Rule” aimed at codifying a “uniform approach to guide future hazardous substance designations, including how the agency will consider the costs of proposed designations.”

The decision to defend the rule came as a surprise to some, as just last week, EPA told the same court, in a separate proceeding, that it would abandon support for Biden-era regulations setting nation-wide maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for four types of PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. However, the agency did in that case determine that it would leave undisturbed the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, the same two PFAS listed as hazardous substances in the CERCLA final rule. EPA also plans to extend the deadline for compliance with the PFOA and PFOS MCLs by an additional two years (from 2019 to 2031) as originally proposed under the Biden Administration.

Although it still remains to be seen whether either rule will survive judicial review, it appears that both will remain effective throughout the course of litigation. The Trump EPA has now confirmed that it intends to federally regulate at least some types of PFAS, and entities that suspect the presence of PFOA or PFOS in their wastewater, outfalls, or operations should begin preparing for compliance and potential CERCLA response actions.",https://www.crowell.com/a/web/r7g3u7E89nDi6HjG6hoBL8/aPY2QC/2025-09-22_the_other_pfas_shoe_drops.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:03.371719

At the company’s last earnings call in July, it shared that this model would be delayed since Tesla was concentrating on increasing Model Y deliveries before US tax credits ran out.

Now, a new software update has revealed key details about the cheaper model, hinting at a no-frills design that cuts costs. According to Tesla app code expert, greentheonly, who shared on X, several of the changes have been spotted.

This includes confirms that it will have a new outer design, code-named E41 and no glass roof and smaller 18-inch wheels with tyre pressure monitoring systems removed, on the outside.

There are also hints that the powered mirrors will be removed. Other changes include removing the heater from the reversing camera.

On the inside, the changes go a bit further with no scrren in the rear, a simpler audio system labelled in the code as “Essential”, a basic fibreglass headliner, less interior lights, simpler seat controls and removal of puddle lights found on Tesla’s other models.

Previously, a test vehicle was seen, indicating some of these changes that were expected when this goes into production before the end of the year.

Other signs that match what’s been shared in the software now are that the exterior and interior are shown in close-ups, indicating a solid roof rather than the panoramic glass found in all of Tesla’s current models, including the well-liked Model 3 and Model Y.

The front and back seats are now made of cloth on the interior, which means they won’t have the ventilation that comes with all current models.

The front and rear have also undergone styling changes to the outer design. The lightbars found on the new Model Y will likely not be included.

Also, it seems that the new model will be shorter than the typical Tesla Model Y, which is roughly 4.8 meters long.

On the design of the upcoming model, we learned more about the car’s styling from Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, response to a question from a Tesla investor during the last company earnings call..

Musk replied by jokingly saying that the more affordable model will look like the Model Y.

With several more reasonably priced options from rivals already on the market and about to be released in the coming months, a model in the lineup that comes under $58,900 starting price of Tesla’s Model Y may be the car that helps the company see strong growth locally and in other key markets around the world..

A cheaper model has been in the works for a while, with multiple mentions of this model at the company earnings calls over the last few quarters, including the last one where it was announced that it would be in Q4 instead of the end of Q2.

With Q4 now around the corner, it’s only a matter of time before the model is revealed, bringing with it a fresh set of customers to the brand and further helping with the EV transition in key markets like ours here in Australia.",https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tesla-Model-Y-Affordable-USA-September-2025-DriveGreenLiveGreen.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:05:57.716465

Federal EV Tax Credit Can Still Be Claimed After Deadline Despite the federal EV tax credit deadline now only days away, it’s not too late to take advantage.
Unsurprisingly, EV sales have spiked in the lead-up to the deadline.","Time is running out for anyone hoping to take advantage of the federal electric vehicle tax credit and snag a bargain like a discounted Chevrolet Equinox EV, as the generous incentive program is set to expire on September 30 under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. The looming deadline applies nationwide, including in California, where drivers had been assured by Governor Gavin Newsom that the state would step in with its own rebate program if the federal credit were eliminated.

However, despite his earlier pledge, Newsom has announced he's now backtracking on it. The governor, who originally made the promise in November 2024, told reporters in San Francisco last week that California will not be reviving its own EV rebate program, which ended in 2023. He said California simply didn't have the funding to match the federal tax credit, which offers up to $7,500 towards new EVs and up to $4,000 towards used models, SFGate reported.

California Still Open To Reviving Rebate Program

Newsom said that the funding the state does have will be directed toward expanding EV infrastructure, and pointed to the tens of thousands of public charging stations already built as proof of California’s commitment to the clean energy transition. He also added that California's rebate program could be revived if officials agree to use funds from the state's separate cap and trade program, which raises hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

For many, the expectation was that California – long a leader in green policy – would shield residents from the loss of a popular incentive that has helped drive EV adoption. Last year, EV sales represented roughly one out of every five new vehicles sold in the state, reaching nearly 380,000 units in total. Without the federal tax credit or California’s own rebates, however, many potential EV buyers may now consider delaying their purchase or opting for a vehicle with an internal-combustion engine.

Newsom, during his speech to reporters last week, also brought up the issue of automakers, specifically targeting Detroit companies like General Motors and its CEO, Mary Barra, of spearheading efforts in Congress to block the state’s planned 2035 ban on new ICE vehicle sales. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the ban in 2022, but in May of this year, the US Senate voted to block the rule, and President Trump signed the resolution into law in June, effectively halting the state’s mandate.

Federal EV Tax Credit Can Still Be Claimed After Deadline

Despite the federal EV tax credit deadline now only days away, it’s not too late to take advantage. A loophole allows buyers to still qualify, even if their EV is delivered well after the deadline. Anyone who has a written binding sales contract in place and has made at least a single payment before Sept. 30 will remain entitled to claim the credit upon eventual delivery.

Unsurprisingly, EV sales have spiked in the lead-up to the deadline. Kelley Blue Book reported that July sales jumped 26.4% compared to the previous month, with models like the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 topping the charts, while the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai Ioniq 5 also cracked the top five. Of course, a sharp decline in sales is likely in October and beyond, as the looming cutoff has clearly pulled demand forward.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tesla-model-y-charging.png?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:39.450558

(TNS)

Katie Larsell and Michael Schilmoeller adore the electric vehicle they bought in late August—a full month before the federal $7,500 tax credit is set to expire on Sept. 30—but not the big headache that came with it.

The Northeast Portland couple said they had to go to great lengths to ensure that they secured the tax credit that is supposed to come with each purchase of a qualifying EV. That’s because, they say, the Gresham dealership they patronized didn’t file the required paperwork with the IRS.

“I really had to push,” Larsell told The Oregonian/OregonLive, adding that the salesperson told her the paperwork was unnecessary. “The way this went, it was almost like they didn’t know about it.”

Larsell and Schilmoeller were unlucky to fall into a hole that other buyers of electric vehicles in Oregon and across the nation have also found themselves in. The National Auto Dealers Association earlier this year warned dealerships about this paperwork pitfall. The IRS, too, has issued instructions for two consecutive years as it has extended the window for dealerships to file paperwork that’s required so car buyers don’t miss out on the tax credit.

But apparently the same mistake keeps happening, again and again.

Larsell, a former Parkrose School Board member and current community minister at Eastrose Fellowship Unitarian Universalist, was worried enough that others might encounter the same troubles that she called The Oregonian/OregonLive to share her experience.

She also contacted friends who she knew bought the same car, a Kia EV6, from a different dealership last spring. Those friends—Gresham residents Richard Curtis and Jan Apland-Curtis—told The Oregonian/OregonLive that thanks to Larsell, they also discovered their dealership had failed to file the proper paperwork, putting them at risk of losing out on their $7,500 as well.

The couple said they spent a few months researching the purchase of a new EV. When they settled on a model, they figured they had everything they needed to get their $7,500 tax credit come tax filing season in early 2026. Little did they know, they would have had an unpleasant suprise waiting for them, if Larsell hadn’t reached out.

“We were blindsided,” Curtis said. “We said, ‘No, that can’t be right.’”

But it was.

Here’s what happened in each of their cases and how you, if you’re one of Oregon’s 2025 buyers of an electric vehicle, can avoid this bombshell before filing your taxes early next year:

According to the IRS, all buyers of new EVs qualify for the $7,500 tax credit only after the dealership gives them a “time-of-sale report” and a “copy of confirmation” showing that the dealership successfully entered the time-of-sale report into an IRS portal. (The same process is required for a customer to receive a $4,000 tax credit upon buying a used EV from a dealer.)

Since Jan. 1, 2024, the IRS has been requiring dealerships to complete these tasks within three days of the sale, according to step-by-step rules laid out on the IRS’s website. But because so many dealerships haven’t followed through, the IRS told The Oregonian/OregonLive that it has allowed for exceptions to the three-day time limit as long as dealerships provide a reason for blowing past it.

That’s key, because that’s what saved both couples—Larsell and Schilmoeller, and Curtis and Apland-Curtis—from missing out on the federal credit.

Larsell said when she and her husband bought their Kia on Aug. 26, they had no problem securing the state’s $2,500 EV rebate because the dealership immediately applied it to the sale price of her car. (The state EV rebate expired Sept. 8.)

But when it came to the $7,500 federal tax credit, Larsell said she told the salesperson at Weston Kia in Gresham that she thought they needed “some sort of report” in order to claim the credit. Larsell said the salesperson assured her that they didn’t and that they’d get their tax credit when filing their 2025 taxes next year.

Larsell said it wasn’t until the next week that she revisited the IRS website, realized the report was called a “time-of-sale report” and asked Schilmoeller to give her the stack of paperwork they’d taken home from the dealership. The report wasn’t there. And the IRS’ mandatory three-day time limit had already passed.

“The fact that this was an IRS thing made my heart sink,” Larsell said.

Larsell said she called the dealership and again the salesperson thought it was a non-issue. But she pressed: “I said, ‘This is really serious.’ I kind of went into a little rant.” Eventually, Larsell said, she was dealing with Jacob Weston, vice president of operations and grandson of the 50-year-old dealership’s founder. It wasn’t until 16 days after Larsell and her husband bought the EV that they finally had the time-of-sale report in hand, Larsell said.

Weston declined to talk to The Oregonian/OregonLive about his interactions with Larsell. That includes whether she was a customer, though she provided The Oregonian/OregonLive with documentation that she purchased her Kia EV6 there. Specifically, Weston declined to answer questions about whether the dealership had failed to report the sale to the IRS and give Larsell a time-of-sale report until she asked for one.

“I’m not going to discuss customer interactions with anybody, we value our customer privacy. We’d extend you the same courtesy obviously if you were a customer of ours,” Weston told The Oregonian/OregonLive.

But Weston did say, in general, his company has known since the tax credit began what it needed to do to ensure that customers get their $7,500 federal tax credits. At times, he said, he has encountered delays on the IRS’s side in accepting the information his dealership provided.

In the case of Curtis and Apland-Curtis, after Larsell told them about her troubles, they contacted the dealership where they purchased their EV—Power Kia in Salem—to ask for their time-of-sale report and confirmation. After a few weeks of texts, emails and a phone call—and a few non-responses—Curtis said they finally got theirs in hand, too, last week.

“It’s just maddening,” Curtis said.

Power Kia’s general manager didn’t respond to a phone message and an email from The Oregonian/OregonLive seeking comment.

Apland-Curtis said she hates to think of how many other recent EV buyers might be in for a shock.

“We think this is happening to a lot of people, and it doesn’t feel fair to the consumer,” Apland-Curtis said.

NV Energy’s score reveals the utility has begun to lag in its clean energy transition.
According to NV Energy’s latest energy plans, the utility will trade one expensive, polluting fossil fuel for another by converting the North Valmy coal plant to gas rather than an affordable, renewable source like solar.
In addition to converting Valmy, the utility also plans to build two new gas units at the site.
“NV Energy has taken a step backwards, binding Nevadans to costly fossil fuels for years to come,” said Olivia Tanager, Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter Director.","RENO, Nev. — Today, Sierra Club released its fifth annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This year, Berkshire Hathaway-owned NV Energy received a B, a grade that has decreased over the last two years.

Since 2023, NV Energy’s score in its northern service area dropped 21 points from 80 out of 100 to 59 out of 100, while the score in its southern service area dropped 10 points from 83 out of 100 to 73 out of 100. NV Energy’s score reveals the utility has begun to lag in its clean energy transition. At the same time, Nevada is experiencing a data center boom and energy demand is increasing significantly, with data centers largely powered by dangerous fossil fuels like natural gas.

According to NV Energy’s latest energy plans, the utility will trade one expensive, polluting fossil fuel for another by converting the North Valmy coal plant to gas rather than an affordable, renewable source like solar. In addition to converting Valmy, the utility also plans to build two new gas units at the site.

“NV Energy has taken a step backwards, binding Nevadans to costly fossil fuels for years to come,” said Olivia Tanager, Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter Director. “Customers shouldn’t have to pay the price for utilities’ poor planning. It’s time NV Energy got back on track with an accelerated clean energy plan that will meet growing demand, lower bills, and ensure a livable future for all.”

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

In a statement, Ørsted said it would ""resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority.""
In a separate lawsuit, Rhode Island and Connecticut sued the Trump administration over the stop-work order.
Revolution Wind is just one of a handful of large offshore wind projects under construction along the Atlantic Coast.
But President Trump is a longtime critic of offshore wind, and his administration has launched a multi-agency effort to stop projects at all phases of development.","A federal judge ruled on Monday that work can resume on Revolution Wind, a large and nearly complete offshore wind farm near Rhode Island. Construction on the project had been halted since Aug. 22, when the Trump administration issued a stop-work order.

The order represents a rare — and, at least for now, temporary — win for the offshore wind industry, which has been a frequent target of the Trump administration.

In issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of Revolution, Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said the construction pause represented the ""height of arbitrary and capricious action."" In explaining his decision, the judge repeatedly said that while the government cited potential national security concerns related to the project, it failed to ""make any factual findings or cite any reasons"" why the project needed to be paused.

Furthermore, Lamberth noted that the project's developer, Ørsted, was losing at least $2.3 million a day, and that hundreds of people were out of work while the project was in limbo.

""There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,"" he said.

In granting the injunction, Lamberth didn't make a final ruling in the case; the lawsuit over the stop-work order will continue, but in the meantime, construction can restart.

In a statement, Ørsted said it would ""resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issued the stop-work order, could challenge the injunction. In a statement, the agency said it will continue ""its investigation into possible impacts by the project to national security and prevention of other uses on the Outer Continental Shelf.""

Revolution Wind is a 65-turbine project that's slated to deliver 704 megawatts of power to Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year — enough electricity to power about 350,000 homes. The project received its final federal permits in 2023 and has been staging the wind farm from a newly revitalized port in New London, Connecticut.

At the time of the stop-work order, the company had spent around $5 billion on the project and construction was 80% complete.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont praised the judge's decision, calling it ""good news on behalf of consumers."" Once the project comes online, it's expected to save ratepayers in the state about $500 million annually.

""If you want to talk about the birds and the fish and national security, we can do that,"" Lamont added. ""But in the meantime, let's get back to work.""

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha also applauded the injunction, writing in a statement that the ""President cannot cancel clean energy projects just because he believes doing so is politically expedient for him.""

In a separate lawsuit, Rhode Island and Connecticut sued the Trump administration over the stop-work order.

""What we're looking for is to get this project up and running again as quickly as possible — get those workers and ships back out to sea to get the last 20% of this project done, and to bring this clean, reliable, over time inexpensive energy online to meet our energy needs up here in New England,"" Neronha said.

In New London, where daily construction work at State Pier has come to a standstill since the stop-work order was issued, Mayor Mike Passero said his reaction to the news was ""exuberance.""

""It's been a long month and we're so close to the end of this project,"" he said. ""We're just months away from turning on the spigot, so it's just a relief.""

Passero said Ørsted still has its construction workforce in place, so work should resume quickly.

""To be perfectly honest, I was a little concerned about irreparable harm,"" he added. But he now expects the project will be done before the lawsuit over the stop-work order wraps up.

Across New England, wind advocates outside of government also celebrated news of the injunction.

""This ruling confirms what we’ve known all along — that the Trump administration’s attempt to stop Revolution Wind is not only a violation of the law but a dramatic overreach,"" said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation. ""We applaud the court for upholding the rule of law and rejecting a reckless attempt to sabotage clean energy progress that will slash bills and toxic pollution.""

Revolution Wind is just one of a handful of large offshore wind projects under construction along the Atlantic Coast. Several New England states are counting on the renewable energy from offshore wind projects to provide a critical source of power, create jobs and spur economic development.

Under the Biden administration, these states, and the young industry, had a lot of support. But President Trump is a longtime critic of offshore wind, and his administration has launched a multi-agency effort to stop projects at all phases of development.

Just last week, the administration moved to revoke key permits for two previously-approved wind projects: SouthCoast Wind near Massachusetts and US Wind near Maryland. In court documents, the administration has announced its intention to revoke permits for another Massachusetts project, New England Wind, sometime in the next few weeks.

A FEW MILES DOWNSTREAM from the bridge that connects Cannelton, Indiana, to Hawesville, Kentucky, Southwire Company fulfills another important connection—producing the material needed to carry electricity from power generation sites to homes, businesses and industrial facilities across North America.

In operation since 1969, the Hancock County facility produces aluminum rod, strip and bare overhead conductors while also manufacturing bare transmission and distribution cable.

Within the last several years, Southwire has marked significant growth in efficiency, productivity and safety. The plant recently expanded the workforce by about 30% and square footage from 439,570 to 806,770 square feet.

“The growth of our Hawesville plant over the past few years is truly exciting,” says Roy Jackson, Southwire’s vice president of manufacturing. “We are in the process of our third and fourth expansions, which will add another 50 positions. Once these expansions are complete, we will have nearly doubled our bare overhead production capacity and replaced almost all legacy production equipment with new machines and technology.”

As growth coincides with rising energy demand and a more electrified economy, “Southwire provides the strong partnership electric co-ops are looking for,” says Phil Clark, executive vice president of United Utility Supply, a Kentucky-based cooperative that distributes material to utilities across the Midwest and Atlantic Coast. “Southwire is a partner with you to the end of the line.”

Southwire officials credit a partnership with Kenergy, its local electric cooperative, with a more responsive, tailored approach to its energy requirements compared with larger, investor-owned utilities.

“Decisions about electricity service are made locally and are driven by the needs of the members Kenergy serves,” says Nathan Ward, site leader at Southwire’s Kentucky plant.

“The amount of investment being made here in Hawesville is a great example of Southwire’s commitment to being a long-term blessing to the community and the people we serve,” Ward says.

A good neighbor

Southwire’s Hawesville facility is a cornerstone of the community, known for industrial excellence and meaningful local involvement. The Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce Business of the Year contributes tens of thousands of dollars to charities, disaster relief efforts and sponsorships of local initiatives and foundations.

Volunteer efforts of the plant’s employees are boosted by Southwire’s Project GIFT initiatives, including Back-to-School, Puzzle Pieces, Crossroads Women’s Shelter, the Daniel Pitino Shelter and Jeffreys Cliffs.",https://d2fxn1d7fsdeeo.cloudfront.net/kentuckyliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23100736/IMG_0002-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 15:02:10.907960

Similar protective language for pesticide makers is expected to be included in the new Farm Bill as well.

“I don’t care what party you are in, if you get poisoned by a pesticide manufacturer you want to be able to sue.","Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI).

It’s been seven years since Germany’s Bayer bought US agrochemical giant Monsanto, inheriting not only the company’s vast portfolio of seeds and pesticide products, but also more than 100,000 lawsuits alleging Monsanto’s popular Roundup herbicide causes cancer. Bayer, which has so far paid out billions of dollars in settlements and jury verdicts to cancer victims, has been working – so far in vain – to put an end to the litigation and to block any future such cases.

Now, the company appears closer than ever to success, as many Republican congressional leaders push for measures that would effectively block lawsuits against pesticide makers around the country.

A group founded by Bayer called the Modern Ag Alliance is the face of the legislative push, advocating for liability shields they say are necessary to allow companies to continue to sell pesticides that farmers use to kill weeds and bugs in their fields.

The group says it represents more than 100 agricultural organizations, including farmers who grow wheat, corn, soybeans and other key food crops.

“Without legislative action, a potential catastrophe is on the horizon that could result in many farmers going out of business and food prices rising even further,” the alliance warns on its website.

The alliance has been lobbying for the passage of state laws blocking such lawsuits, so far succeeding in two states – Georgia and North Dakota – and continues to lobby for such laws in all 50 states.

But the immediate battleground is in the halls of Congress where a provision tucked into a congressional appropriations bill is outraging consumer advocates, including those affiliated with the influential Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. Similar protective language for pesticide makers is expected to be included in the new Farm Bill as well.

“Bayer is in a desperate position,” said Kelly Ryerson, a leading MAHA advocate who has been lobbying lawmakers and her 84,000 social media followers to fight back against pesticide company protections. “Rather than slapping a [warning] label on the side of the product, they would rather take on the enormous challenge of changing US federal and state law.

“The audacity of elected officials voting for legislation to fully strip our legal rights away when injured by chemicals is stunning, especially in this age of MAHA when an unprecedented number of Americans are rallying against toxins in food and the environment,” Ryerson said.

“Important investments”

Bayer has made it clear that changing laws in its favor is a priority. The company states on its website that without “legislative certainty,” lawsuits over its glyphosate-based Roundup and other weed killers can impact its research and product development and other “important investments.”

The company says the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should be the ultimate arbiter of product safety and what warnings should be required on product labels. If the EPA approves a product label, consumers should not be able to sue companies for failing to warn of perceived risks, according to Bayer.

In a statement to The New Lede, Bayer said federal legislation is “needed to ensure that states and courts do not take a position or action regarding product labels at odds with congressional intent, federal law and established scientific research and federal authority.”

Bayer has already removed glyphosate, classified as “probably” carcinogenic to humans by World Health Organization cancer experts, from consumer herbicide products. And the company has threatened to stop selling it to farmers if the litigation is not brought to an end.

The company disputes, however, that the appropriations bill will provide that certainty, saying in its statement that the language doesn’t prevent lawsuits and asserting it does in a “distortion of reality.”

The relevant section of the House version of the appropriations bill – Section 453 – does not mention litigation or pesticide company liability. Section 453 simply says that no funds can be used to “issue or adopt any guidance or any policy, take any regulatory action, or approve any labeling or change to such labeling” inconsistent with the conclusion of an EPA human health assessment.

But critics say the language effectively would impede states and local governments from warning about risks of pesticides even in the face of new scientific findings about health harms if such warnings are not consistent with outdated EPA assessments. The EPA itself would not be able to update warnings without finalizing a new assessment, the critics say.

And because of the limits on warnings, consumers would find it nearly impossible to sue pesticide makers for failing to warn them of health risks if the EPA assessments do not support such warnings.

The language is “by design, sneaky and complicated and hard to explain,” said Daniel Hinkle, senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice, who has been lobbying against the action. “Nobody thinks that a giant chemical company should be able to lie about the risks of using their product and get away with it. It’s just making sure that people understand that is what is at stake,” Hinkle said.

The language is also clear to the Farm & Ranch Freedom Alliance, which warns in an “action alert” opposing the measure that it would “give pesticide manufacturers immunity from lawsuits, even when their products devastate a farmer’s crops, sicken farm workers, or contaminate organic fields.”

And even though Bayer downplays the significance of the appropriations language, its Modern Ag Alliance promotes support for Section 453 as a way “Congress can put American farmers first,” and says having “enough healthy, affordable food depends on it.”

“Very worried”

US Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat from Maine who tried but failed to overturn the language in a July appropriations committee hearing, said she is “very worried” about the “outrageous” efforts to protect pesticide companies from litigation.

“We’re talking about chemicals here that are already prone to health risks,” Pingree said. “And the chemical industry is trying to keep that information from consumers … and then to have immunity from being responsible if you get cancer from being in the presence of these chemicals.”

The language is not currently included in the short-term government spending package being debated ahead of a looming government shutdown that would occur at the end of the month in the absence of continued spending authorization.

But it is expected to see support in both House and Senate appropriations bill versions once the short-term budget is resolved. As well, the new Farm Bill is expected to include language limiting or preventing pesticide injury lawsuits, with strong signals from Glenn Thompson, chairman of the US House Committee on Agriculture favoring such protections.

Thompson has weighed in on the side of Bayer in the past in the company’s ongoing efforts to get the US Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue of federal “preemption” over pesticide regulation.

The involvement and influence of the MAHA movement is adding a bipartisan element to what otherwise might be a highly partisan fight, raising awareness with voters in both red and blue states about the issues at stake.

Max Lugavere, a health journalist, author and podcaster who posted a photo of a MAHA-related visit to the White House to his 1.1 million Instagram followers, said pushing lawmakers is important, but “awareness among everyday people is the first domino.”

Citing “growing evidence linking pesticides to health risks,” Lugavere said “stripping away legal recourse in these cases wouldn’t just be wrong, it would be a tragedy.”

For California lawyer Brent Wisner, who helped lead the early Roundup litigation against Bayer, the efforts by lawmakers to protect the company against future litigation is un-American and potentially unconstitutional.

“I don’t care what party you are in, if you get poisoned by a pesticide manufacturer you want to be able to sue. You need to be able to sue,” Wisner said. “For you to think otherwise you have to assume that the EPA is infallible and that our federal government’s regulators are the top notch. Bayer is paying millions of dollars to get these laws passed because it’s cheaper than it is to pay people they’ve given cancer to.”",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cropped-NewLede-Fav-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 16:01:44.559055

“Competitive, market-rate royalty rates do not affect industry interest or production decisions — lowering rates only shortchanges taxpayers by reducing future royalty revenue,” Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote.
Oil and gas industry officials in Wyoming agree.
The Inflation Reduction Act increased the federal oil and gas royalty rate from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022, Obermueller noted.
The industry holds a vast amount of federal oil and gas leases that it has not acted on, they note.","A federal oil and natural gas lease sale in Wyoming this month netted $8.5 million for 32 parcels spanning 39,225 acres, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.

The “bonus bid” proceeds are paid up front and split between the U.S. Treasury and the state. Companies also pay federal mineral royalties as they produce the petrol.

But the sale — the BLM’s third competitive oil and gas lease auction in Wyoming so far this year — and any resulting royalty payments will ultimately generate less revenue for American taxpayers than sales in the past, conservation groups and one taxpayer advocacy organization say.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, reduced the royalty rate for federal oil and gas from 16.67% to 12.5%. If all 32 parcels in this month’s sale are fully developed, then the lesser royalty rate will reap an estimated $22 million less than under the previous royalty rate, according to calculations by Taxpayers for Common Sense. That would put Wyoming’s loss at $11 million.

Advocacy groups have also noted that a similar royalty rate reduction for federal coal will cost Wyoming about $50 million annually — a revenue loss that many state lawmakers want to rectify.

“Competitive, market-rate royalty rates do not affect industry interest or production decisions — lowering rates only shortchanges taxpayers by reducing future royalty revenue,” Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote.

The BLM, under the Trump administration, doesn’t see it that way.

Instead, the reduced royalty rate “is expected to spur additional leasing and drilling activity, which in turn supports increased domestic energy production and strengthens U.S. energy security,” according to a BLM statement regarding the Wyoming lease sale.

Oil and gas industry officials in Wyoming agree.

“It simply isn’t true to claim that higher royalty rates always result in more revenue for the federal government,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile.

The Inflation Reduction Act increased the federal oil and gas royalty rate from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022, Obermueller noted. “Total royalties paid by Wyoming’s industry decreased by 17% from 2022 to 2023,” he said. “In 2024, while still under the IRA-mandated higher royalty rate, federal royalties decreased again, this time falling by a whopping 30%.”

Compounding the issue, conservation groups contend the industry is nominating and acquiring federal oil and gas lease parcels beyond the typical “speculation” required to suss out the potential productivity of new areas. The type of speculation alleged by some conservation groups is to simply hold some areas open to future development, where they fear environmental restrictions in the future might keep them out.

The industry holds a vast amount of federal oil and gas leases that it has not acted on, they note.

One piece of evidence the taxpayer advocacy group points to is what they say is an uncommonly low average dollar-per-acre among successful bids in this month’s lease sale in Wyoming.

“More than 90% of acres [in Fremont and Natrona counties] were leased for less than $40 per acre,” Taxpayers for Common Sense said. In contrast, some of the highest winning bids were for parcels in Converse and Campbell counties — a highly active oil play — fetching more than $1,000 per acre, including one in Campbell County for $4,612 per acre, based on BLM reports.

The accusation of speculation, or buying federal oil and gas leases to fend off future environmental limitations to development, “is an odd concept,” and doesn’t hold water, according to Obermueller.

“Every single lease ever offered is, at one point, speculative,” he said. “People forget that oil and natural gas must first be found before it can be produced.”

Oil and gas companies that bought federal leases in the Jonah Field in the late 1990s or early 2000s, for example, were considered by some within the industry to be risky, at best, Obermueller suggested. “They paid off quite handsomely for Wyoming.

“Wyoming,” Obermueller continued, “is exciting to oil and gas operators precisely because we are still exploring for resources and testing the horizontal and vertical bounds of oil and natural gas basins. If so-called ‘speculative’ leasing were not allowed, then there would no longer be a mechanism for exploring in Wyoming.”

The BLM’s lease sale this month is the first to “fully” implement myriad new policies under the Trump administration, Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile. The concern laid out by Taxpayers for Common Sense — that the average per-acre bid price suggests overt speculation — he said, holds some merit.

“Only a very small percentage of acres purchased in the sale, 7%, accounted for more than 80% of auction revenue. This points to many of the parcels being leased through speculation,” Underwood said. “Rather than offering a fire sale of leases in important habitat such as crucial winter range for ungulates, we should be prioritizing leasing in areas that are likely for production and adjacent to existing development.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/workover-rig-hwy-59-cc-dbleizeffer1758623167.jpg?h=3fcb88d5&itok=Rr9GHqy_,N,,2025-09-23 12:08:42.840268

To take advantage of the tax credit, you only need to have ordered an EV by the deadline.","Thinking of an electric vehicle? You’ve only got a week left before federal tax credits end, or you’ll have to pay full price.

The $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles (EV) ends Sept. 30. Steven Hershkowitz is the managing director for clean transportation for the Washington Department of Commerce. He expects the loss of this incentive will hurt EV sales in the short term.

“There is going to be a bit of a drag on the growth rate that we have seen,” Hershkowitz said. “We’ve already seen the market growth slow down in 2024 and into 2025.

Washington got rid of its tax exemption for EVs earlier this year. The legislature and Governor Ferguson are deciding to use those dollars elsewhere, but Herskowitz said the state’s commitment to electric vehicles and clean energy isn’t going away.

“The commitment is still there, and the prioritization is still there,” Herskowitz said. “These consumer-facing incentives that were quite popular are not, unfortunately, but there’s progress being made in terms of making sure that, hopefully, we can get the incentives back at some point.”

Climate Commitment Act to fund clean energy projects

The state will continue to use funds from the Climate Commitment Act to push clean energy and expand EV charging around the state.

Herskowitz believes electric vehicles are the future, and the demand will eventually return.

“The automakers know that this is where it’s going,” he said. “The global competition is further ahead in many major markets now internationally for EVs, and so this is where we’re going. It’s just about the pace at which we get there.”

The pace also includes finding ways to improve the pricing for electric vehicles.

The average price for a new EV is over $55,000. The average price for a new gas car is $49,000. You can certainly find new EVs for much less. Some only run about $30,000.

Now might be the time to get in, if you want to take advantage of the tax credit.

“It’s a good opportunity for people who have been considering getting an electric vehicle to really bring that consideration up to a higher level, perhaps go into dealerships, test drive, see what the prices are,” Herskowitz said. “This could be a good opportunity to get deals depending on which model you’re looking at.”

But expect a lot of company. You won’t be the only person trying to squeeze in before the deadline.

To take advantage of the tax credit, you only need to have ordered an EV by the deadline. You can take delivery later and still get it.

Despite the Government’s efforts, California will not be able to revive the EV credit yet, but the Governor’s office said that it is possible that it can come back “next year.”

The office cited hundreds of millions of dollars from a carbon-trading program that supports environmental initiatives, which the states will soon have to allocate.

California’s previous EV rebate program ended in 2023, after President Joe Biden approved the federal tax credit as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022.

Under the IRA, buyers of eligible electric vehicles starting in 2023 could receive up to $7,500, provided the vehicle met requirements for battery sourcing and final assembly.

The law originally set the credit to expire on December 31, 2025, unless new legislation extended or replaced it.

Earlier this year, Congress moved the expiration date up to September 30, following a proposal by Senate Republicans and reflecting the Trump Administration’s push to end clean energy and EV tax incentives.

Congress also voted to block California’s ban on selling gasoline-powered vehicles from 2035.

Detroit automaker General Motors, which is reshifting its focus towards internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, told employees that it was opposing the EV mandate.

According to an email, “emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

GM reportedly wanted a national emissions policy instead of separate rules for each state.

The company also pointed out that demand for EVs is falling, even as the overall auto market grows, and that EV manufacturing costs are rising to record levels.

In July, GM halted its plans to produce EVs in Orion, telling its employees it will produce internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the site instead.

According to a recent Reuters report, General Motors will halt production of two electric Cadillac SUVs in Spring Hill, Tennessee, in December.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-15.07.54_converted.webp?fit=1200%2C602&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-23 11:01:19.918692

Job market

Clean energy jobs have grown three times faster than overall U.S. workforce since 2020, but federal obstruction puts job growth at risk, according to a recent report from E2. In 2025, job growth slowdowns and investment cancellations persist. E2 research shows that since January 2025, businesses cancelled more than $22 billion of planned clean energy factories and projects that were expected to create 16,500 jobs. Analysis by Energy Innovation suggests that more than 830,000 jobs could be lost due to policy rollbacks created by the Trump Administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The U.S. clean energy workforce now stands at 3.56 million. In 2024, 7% of all new jobs in the United States were in clean energy, and clean energy represented 82% of all new energy sector jobs. However, approximately 50,000 fewer jobs were created in 2024 as compared to 2023.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

A Guide to the Last-Minute $7,500 Federal EV Credit

One of the most frequent questions I’ve been asked lately is a pressing one: “Which electric vehicles are still eligible for that $7,500 federal tax credit before it simply disappears on September 30?” It’s a valid query, given the ever-shifting goalposts of government incentives. The answer is, there are still a few contenders, and they come from some of the biggest names in the game. From Kia’s design-forward electrics to GM’s all-American offerings and even Tesla’s market dominators, a surprising number of cars are still on Uncle Sam’s good list, provided you act quickly.

Why does this matter right now?

The clock is ticking. The $7,500 EV tax credit, a substantial incentive for anyone considering a shift to electric power, is set to undergo another change on September 30. For many prospective buyers, this credit is the difference between a purchase and a postponement. The list of eligible vehicles has been in a constant state of flux, primarily due to complex requirements around battery component sourcing and final vehicle assembly location. This deadline acts as a final call, offering a window for buyers to secure a significant discount on a new electric car, truck, or SUV.

Kia, for example, is hitting home runs with its E-GMP platform. The Kia EV6 is more than just a crossover; it’s a statement piece built on their “Opposites United” philosophy. The flat floor creates a surprisingly spacious cabin, fronted by a sleek, curved display panel. With up to 282 miles of range, it’s a practical daily driver, but the high-performance GT model is a different beast entirely, a rocketship that does 0 to 60 in a blistering 3.4 seconds. For larger families, the EV9 is essentially a living room on wheels, one of the few three-row EVs that comfortably accommodates adults in the back. Its available second-row swivel seats are an innovative touch for creating a social space while parked. Built with sustainable materials and offering up to 304 miles of range, the EV9 is a versatile and compelling family machine, made even more appealing by that credit.

General Motors is stacking the deck with its Ultium platform, with the Blazer EV, Equinox EV, and Silverado EV all still on the eligible list. While the SUVs are strong contenders, the main event for Chevrolet is the Silverado EV. This is GM’s moonshot for electrifying America’s heartland, and the specs are staggering. The work truck trim boasts a massive 450-mile maximum range, while the RST model unleashes 754 horsepower in its ‘Wide Open Watts’ mode. The Silverado’s genius, however, lies in its utility. The Multi-Flex Midgate is a true game-changer, allowing you to fold down the back of the cab to haul items over ten feet long. The lockable eTrunk provides weatherproof storage, and the PowerBase system offers up to 10 outlets with 10.2 kilowatts of power, enough to run a construction site or power your home in a blackout.

Even Cadillac, known for its luxury, has surprisingly made the cut. The Lyriq is the leader here, a luxury SUV with a serene ride, a stunning 33-inch curved display, and up to 314 miles of range. It will soon be joined by the smaller Optiq and the three-row Vistiq, both expected to deliver around 300 miles of range and the high-end features Cadillac is known for. Not to be outdone, Hyundai has managed to sneak in a couple of models, including the award-winning Ioniq 5, with its retro-futuristic design, ultra-fast 800-volt charging, and 303 miles of range. It will soon be joined by the highly anticipated Ioniq 9, a full-size, three-row SUV.

How does it compare to rivals?

The vehicles on this list present a compelling mix of practicality, performance, and luxury that directly challenges traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The F-150 Lightning, for instance, packages its impressive technology, including the Pro Power Onboard generator system, into the familiar body of America’s best-selling truck, the 2025 Ford F-150. The extended-range battery offers up to 320 miles of range. It’s a direct response to the Silverado EV, and the competition between these two electric trucks is fueling innovation at a breakneck pace.

The Jeep Wagoneer S, with its promise of a 3.4-second 0-60 time and over 300 miles of range, takes direct aim at luxury performance EVs from brands like Tesla and Porsche. Meanwhile, the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid stands alone as the only PHEV on this list, offering a unique “best of both worlds” proposition for families not ready to go all-in on a full EV. It provides 32 miles of pure electric driving for daily errands, with a gas engine for long-haul peace of mind.

Honda and Acura have also entered the fray, leveraging GM’s proven Ultium platform. The Honda Prologue is a clean, family-friendly SUV with a 281-mile range, while its sportier cousin, the Acura ZDX, boasts up to 313 miles of range and an available 500-horsepower Type S model. The fact that established Japanese brands are now joining the EV party with these models, even if they’re not fully homegrown, is a massive shift in the EV transition. The competition is stiff, but each of these vehicles carves out a distinct niche for itself.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

This list is for the savvy consumer who was already considering an EV and understands the financial significance of a $7,500 tax credit. If you’re a family looking for a practical, spacious ride, the Kia EV9, Chevrolet Equinox EV, or Hyundai Ioniq 9 are perfect candidates. For those who need a workhorse that can handle everything from a construction site to a cross-country trip, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ford F-150 Lightning are purpose-built for you. And if you want luxury with a side of zero emissions, the Cadillac Lyriq or Genesis Electrified GV70 fit the bill. The Genesis, assembled in Alabama, is a true luxury SUV with a stunning interior and a potent 429 horsepower.

However, this list is not for everyone. If you aren’t in a financial position to make a car purchase, a tax credit won’t magically make it happen. The credit is non-refundable, meaning you only get the full amount if you have a tax liability of at least $7,500. It’s a key detail that many forget. And if you are still hesitant about the switch to electric, the September 30 deadline won’t change your mind. But for those who have been on the fence, weighing the pros and cons, this final window is your cue to act.

What is the long-term significance?

The disappearance of this specific tax credit is part of a larger, ongoing shift in government policy aimed at encouraging domestic EV production. This particular deadline is a moment of reckoning for both consumers and automakers. For consumers, it marks the end of a very generous, albeit complex, incentive. For automakers, it means they must now rely on the inherent value, performance, and features of their vehicles to attract buyers, rather than a government subsidy.

Tesla remains a significant player on this list, with wide eligibility across its Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and even the Cybertruck, provided they stay under the price caps. This continued eligibility, while others have been dropped, speaks to their early and decisive investment in a domestic supply chain. Their Model Y, with up to 310 miles of range, remains a best-seller for a reason.

The long-term significance is that the market is maturing. It’s moving beyond simple incentives and into a phase where the best products, the ones that are most practical, powerful, and affordable, will win. The fact that a single plug-in hybrid like the Chrysler Pacifica made the cut is also a signal that the government is still hedging its bets, acknowledging that for some families, a PHEV remains the most logical transition point. This final list of eligible vehicles is a snapshot of an industry in transition, a market that is quickly evolving from a subsidized niche to a competitive mainstream segment.

So, there you have it, the complete list, from Kia and ​Chevrolet to Tesla and everyone in between. The deadline is September 30. If any of these vehicles were on your radar, now is the time to act.

In the prior week, Tesla stock surged 12.85%, racing out of a consolidation buy point of 367.71, according to MarketSurge charts.","Tesla (TSLA) announces global third-quarter deliveries next week and the EV giant just posted its strongest weekly China vehicle registrations of the quarter, signaling a big improvement compared to Q2 but still lagging behind last year. TSLA shares are just 12% below record highs entering Tuesday's stock market.

Tesla insurance registrations in China totaled 17,300 for the week of Sept. 15 to 21, up nearly 13% from 15,350 the previous week, marking its highest weekly total so far in Q3, according to data compiled Tuesday by independent China auto industry trackers.

Along with Tesla's China insurance registrations jump last week, other major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers also broadly saw increases. Registrations tend to ramp up at the end of the quarter.

Of Tesla's total vehicle registrations, there were 10,340 Model Ys, 850 of the newly released six-seat Model Y L and 6,060 Model 3 vehicle registrations, according to CnEVPost.

During the prior week, 1,030 new Model Y L vehicles were registered while 894 were registered three weeks ago. The new, slightly longer wheelbase Model Y variation appears to be having an incremental boost to sales since deliveries Sept. 2.

Twelve weeks into Q3, Tesla registrations in China, a rough gauge for deliveries, are now up 33% compared to Q2 but down around 8% to Q3 2024. So far this year, Tesla vehicle registrations in China have declined 6%.

Tesla Q3 Deliveries Upcoming

Investors will get another China vehicle registrations report next week before Tesla reports third-quarter global vehicle deliveries. The EV giant will then announce Q3 earnings on Oct. 21.

Officially, analyst consensus has global Tesla Q3 vehicle deliveries coming in around 446,000, according to FactSet. That would be about 16% above the second-quarter total but still down 4% vs. Q3 2024. Few analysts have updated Q3 delivery targets since late July, however.

Piper Sandler on Sunday projected 495,000 Q3 deliveries while GLJ Research forecasts 467,000. Meanwhile, Kalshi prediction market has been pegging deliveries at 510,000 units.

UBS analysts on Tuesday predicted that Tesla Q3 deliveries will come in at 475,000, up from its prior view of 431,000. For Q4, UBS forecasts 428,000 deliveries, down 14% vs. a year ago and down 10% quarter over quarter. UBS has a sell rating and a 215 price target on TSLA shares.

Mizuho also on Tuesday raised its Tesla stock price target to 450 from 375, noting that U.S. tariffs should have a minimal impact on new vehicle prices and that consumers appear to be buying EVs before the tax credit ends.

After the U.S. tax credit expires on Sept. 30, deliveries are likely to fall significantly in the U.S.

The EV giant updated its website over the weekend showing that customers can still take advantage of the tax credit if they order a vehicle by Sept. 30, not if it is delivered by that date. The IRS revised guidance about expiring EV tax credits in late August.

Tesla Stock Performance

TSLA edged up around 0.5% to 436.50 at Tuesday's stock market open after gaining 1.9% to 434.21 on Monday. Tesla stock jumped 7.6% last week to 426.07, following Musk's disclosure of $1 billion worth of share buys.

In the prior week, Tesla stock surged 12.85%, racing out of a consolidation buy point of 367.71, according to MarketSurge charts. At Monday's market close, Tesla was just 12% below December's all-time high of 488.54.

Baird analyst Ben Kallo on Friday upgraded Tesla to outperform from neutral with a price target of 548, up from 320. Kallo wrote that Tesla's vehicle volumes will likely decline again in 2025 and near-term fundamentals ""will be choppy,"" but that TSLA could outperform as Tesla is increasingly viewed as the leader in physical artificial intelligence.

At this point, investors looking to start a position should see if Tesla pulls back or perhaps forges a handle to a consolidation going back to end of last year.

""We'd wanted to get rooftop solar, but it's so expensive,"" Milner said in the story.
Milner's system — referenced in the industry as ""plug-and-play solar"" — comes at a fraction of the cost of the larger rooftop arrays.
""It fixes our energy cost a little bit, because rates keep rising,"" he said in the story.
The combination of solar energy and smarter tech can lower utility expenses even more.","Rooftops are no longer the lone domains of household solar, as budget-savvy homeowners are taking advantage of improving technology to gather cleaner energy from a growing number of surfaces.

California public radio station KQED recently highlighted Berkeley hills resident Matthew Milner's foray into solar with an easily installed array that he attached to the side of a fence.

""We'd wanted to get rooftop solar, but it's so expensive,"" Milner said in the story. ""This allows us to dip our toe in a little bit.""

It's part of an amazing time for suncatchers, as they are being installed under train tracks, on public infrastructure, and on balconies.

Milner's setup is a fresh take on the latter concept. The small, portable array was assembled in a couple of hours, plugged into his house, and offsetting potentially dirty energy coming from the grid, according to KQED.

Solar is one of the best ways to lower, and sometimes eliminate, utility bills. But the price can be a detriment for many people. Rooftop arrays can cost up to $30,000, depending on the size and applicable incentives, according to EnergySage. It's a free resource that can help you compare quotes and find the right professional installer for a quick job. Fast action is important to land 30% tax credits that expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

Milner's system — referenced in the industry as ""plug-and-play solar"" — comes at a fraction of the cost of the larger rooftop arrays. KQED reported that two panels and accessories from San Francisco's Bright Saver cost about $2,100 and can power lights, electronics, and maybe even an efficient refrigerator. It will take Milner less than five years for his energy savings to pay for the setup, which he got at a discounted price of $1,700. His power bill was running at up to $80 a month, all per KQED.

""It fixes our energy cost a little bit, because rates keep rising,"" he said in the story.

Thinner, smaller, and cheaper portable versions are in development by other companies with the goal of lowering costs through self-installation, KQED's report added. Leasing panels through programs such as Palmetto's LightReach is another option gaining traction.

The onus is surging power bills that are outpacing inflation. That's partly due to heat waves and data center energy demand, which requires loads of electricity for cooling and computing.

EnergySage's mapping tool compares costs and incentives by state. Its overall guidance can save customers up to $10,000. Experts there can even help with an HVAC upgrade via heat pump guidance. The combination of solar energy and smarter tech can lower utility expenses even more. The tech can reduce household electricity costs for heating by up to 75%, according to the government.

It all limits heat-trapping air pollution generated by fossil fuels that are burned to make power. The lung-troubling fumes are linked by NASA to extreme temperatures that could soon force people from certain parts of the world.

For plug-in solar's part, KQED reported that safety standards, rules, and even laws easing its use would help with adoption.

Republican Utah state Rep. Raymond Ward wrote legislation to make it easier for folks to use the lower-cost, convenient suncatchers.

""I'm interested in anything that helps move toward more abundant energy,"" he said in KQED's story.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/plug-and-play-solarimage-rec72HqBoRvBBETlz-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:57.012865

The federal Clean Vehicle Credit, worth up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used one, is set to expire at the end of the month.
Joe Craig, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, said the end of the credit could reshape demand.

Colorado drivers also have access to a state-level tax credit of up to $6,000 this year.","COLORADO — Coloradans are running out of time to cash in on thousands of dollars in federal tax breaks for electric vehicles. The federal Clean Vehicle Credit, worth up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used one, is set to expire at the end of the month.

Buyers have two options for claiming the incentive: filing for the credit on their tax return or transferring it directly to the dealer for an immediate discount. But to receive the full federal benefit, an eligible vehicle must be purchased or delivered bySept. 30, 2025.

The program was created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and was originally expected to run through 2032. However, a recent tax and spending-cut package passed by Congress shortened that timeline, making this the final week to take advantage of the federal incentive.

Joe Craig, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, said the end of the credit could reshape demand.

“We’ve seen a huge surge in people buying electric vehicles the last two months. We should absolutely expect that EV sales will drop. I would be shocked if that didn’t happen after the tax credits went away,” Craig told News5.

Colorado drivers also have access to a state-level tax credit of up to $6,000 this year. That benefit will shrink starting in 2026, when credits drop to between $750 and $2,000.

For drivers weighing a switch to electric, the window to maximize savings is closing quickly.

""Repealing the [Endangerment] Finding is like tossing out the Ten Commandments,"" Rabbi Jennie Rosenn, Dayenu founder and CEO, said in a statement.
Evidence beyond scientific dispute The endangerment finding has long been a target of conservative lawmakers and fossil fuel companies.
You may think that repealing the Endangerment Finding will better our economy or our society.","Catholic and other faith-based organizations submitted nearly 10,000 comments opposing the Trump administration's attempt to revoke the bedrock environmental policy underpinning federal regulations on polluting emissions that drive climate change and harm human health.

The comments come in response to efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to repeal its 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" in which the agency determined through scientific review that heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions — released primarily from burning coal, oil and gas — pose a danger to public health and welfare.

The endangerment finding is seen as the legal linchpin in the federal government's ability to regulate emissions, from sources like vehicles and power plants, that are driving climate change. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has challenged the finding and called its attempted reversal part of the largest deregulatory push in U.S. history.

In all, nine faith organizations collected more than 9,400 comments as of Sept. 19 in support of retaining the endangerment finding. Staff members delivered the boxes of comments Sept. 17 to EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Catholics accounted for roughly 4,400 of those comments, with a quarter submitted by women religious.

EPA issued the endangerment finding after the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2007 landmark case, Massachusetts v. EPA, ruled that greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, are considered air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA's determination that greenhouse gases endanger public health was seen as a major development in how the U.S. — the largest cumulative source of emissions and world leader in oil and gas use and production — could address climate change at the federal level.

A public health and moral crisis

On Aug. 1, the EPA under President Donald Trump began the process of repealing the endangerment finding. As part of its proposed rule, it also sought to roll back pollution standards on cars and trucks.

Any new proposed rule or regulatory revision requires a public commenting period as part of the process. Public comments on the endangerment finding closed Sept. 22.

The nearly 10,000 comments were collected by the Catholic Climate Covenant, Laudato Si' Movement, Franciscan Action Network, Ignatian Solidarity Network, the Sisters of Mercy, Maryknoll, women religious lobby NETWORK, Jewish climate group Dayenu and the National Religious Partnership for the Environment. The comments included nearly 4,400 from Black church leaders, who also issued a joint statement opposing the EPA action.

At a virtual public hearing Aug. 22, Archbishop Thomas Zinkula of Dubuque, Iowa, said the proposed rollback of the endangerment finding jeopardizes the moral responsibility humans hold to protect life, care for creation and defend the most vulnerable.

""Strong [pollution] standards save lives,"" the Iowa archbishop said. ""They prevent billions of tons of climate pollution, reduce smog and soot, and mean fewer cases of asthma and premature death. Families save thousands of dollars on fuel and healthcare costs. These protections are good for people and good for God's creation.""

""Repealing the [Endangerment] Finding is like tossing out the Ten Commandments,"" Rabbi Jennie Rosenn, Dayenu founder and CEO, said in a statement. ""[Zeldin] is not only denying something that's fundamentally true about the world, but he is eliminating what enables our government to live and act in alignment with our core values.""

In its own 15-page comment, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops urged EPA to abandon its plans to revoke the endangerment finding, which it said would ""rewind any progress the nation has made in combating the dangerous effects of climate change."" The letter, written by the conference's legal counsel, including general counsel William Quinn, said EPA was attempting to manipulate the Clean Air Act and ignoring scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change on the health of people and the planet.

""Our concerns with the Reconsideration are founded on the Catholic Church's commitment to environmental justice and care for creation, as it is an integral component of Catholic faith,"" the bishops' letter said.

""Repealing the [Endangerment] Finding is like tossing out the Ten Commandments,"" Rabbi Jennie Rosenn, Dayenu founder and CEO, said in a statement.

In their statement, the Black church leaders called climate change and emissions pollution ""one of the greatest public health and moral crises facing not just our communities but our country.""

“The cost of this decision by the EPA will be paid for in human lives — and Black bodies will bear the brunt of the burden,"" they said, citing data showing Black Americans are more likely to live near highly polluted areas, such as highways and industrial facilities.

Evidence beyond scientific dispute

The endangerment finding has long been a target of conservative lawmakers and fossil fuel companies. It underpins many of the other limits on emissions and pollution the Trump administration has sought to eliminate.

Zeldin has questioned climate change and the reliability of EPA's 2009 scientific review that led to the endangerment finding, and has suggested new evidence casts doubt on its conclusions.

Representatives of Catholic and other faith organizations delivered boxes of public comments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Sept. 17 in Washington, D.C. The groups collected nearly 10,000 comments from people of faith opposing the Trump administration's plans to reverse EPA's 2009 ""endangerment finding."" (FranciscanAction Network/Robert Christian)

In response, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which provides independent analysis to the government and policymakers, commissioned a new review of science and evidence around climate change. The 137-page report issued Sept. 17 concluded EPA's 2009 finding was accurate and has been reinforced since.

""The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs is beyond scientific dispute,"" the nation's leading scientific bodies wrote in the report.

""The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today's extremes become tomorrow's norms,"" they said.

The past 10 years have been the hottest on record. Extreme weather events levied nearly $183 billion in damage in 2024 alone, while heat-related deaths in the U.S. have doubled since 1999.

In comments, many Catholics emphasized the ways human health — especially among already vulnerable populations like children, low-income families and the elderly — is put at risk through impacts of climate change, such as intensifying extreme heat and storms and increasing exposure to pollutants from wildfires and industrial plants burning fossil fuels.

""Rescinding the Endangerment Finding would erode life-saving public health protections and set the stage for irreversible harm to God's creation,"" said Franciscan Br. Jacek Orzechowski, associate director of the Laudato Si’ Center for Integral Ecology at Siena University in New York.

""All people living in the US are harmed by pollution in our air and water. You may think that repealing the Endangerment Finding will better our economy or our society. But it will not. … My Catholic faith compels me to urge you to leave the Endangerment Finding in place,"" wrote Patricia Sills-Trausch, a staff member at the Franciscan Renewal Center in Scottsdale, Arizona.

""Do the right thing, Mr. Zeldin. Protect the air we all breathe. Think about your daughters, and your daughters' children, and your daughters' children’s children,"" wrote Lindsay Nugent, a parishioner at St. Francis Xavier Church in Missoula, Montana.

A current and ongoing threat

During one of three public hearings in August, Dan Misleh, executive director of Catholic Climate Covenant, called the endangerment finding a moral issue for the Catholic community and the basis of air quality regulations protecting human health and the planet.

""The dumping of excess carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into our atmosphere is, despite some who would deny it, a current and ongoing threat to our way of life and will subject future generations to untold suffering,"" he said in his Aug. 21 testimony.

In April, Misleh witnessed firsthand how emissions from petrochemical facilities harm local communities during a Catholic health conference in southern Louisiana's ""Cancer Alley,"" which has seen inflated rates of cancer and birth complications.

""It's clear that if states and the federal government don't regulate these industries properly, particularly for health impacts, they will just continue to operate in business as usual, and which means that they'll continue to pollute the neighboring communities,"" Misleh said in an interview.

""For the U.S. to pull back on that core [endangerment] finding basically allows polluters to just run wild,"" he said.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/9.23.25%20climate%20SOS.JPG?h=82f92a78&itok=KVcTpP_n,N,,2025-09-23 13:01:27.778948

As of March 2025, EG4 assembles power inverters at the site, and has plans to further scale its US production footprint.
“Our partnership with LG Energy Solution is more than a supply agreement — it’s a commitment to possibility,” said James Showalter, CEO of EG4 Electronics.
While residential energy storage development in the US has so far concentrated in California, the state represents only 13% of EG4’s revenue, and the company has seen strong performance elsewhere, including in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, among others.
With made-in-America supply secured, it expects to keep bringing a value prospect where residential storage has yet to take off, and is also eyeing the United States’ underdeveloped commercial battery market.","Since its beginnings five years ago in Sulphur Springs, Texas, EG4 has grown to place among the largest suppliers of residential energy storage in the United States, achieving close to 1 GWh in sales over the past year. The company has around 500 employees at its base just outside Dallas working on development, manufacturing, distribution and more.

As of March 2025, EG4 assembles power inverters at the site, and has plans to further scale its US production footprint. Key to these plans is a new partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES), comprising a six-year, multibillion-dollar contract for the supply of 13.275 GWh of lithium-iron phosphate battery cells, manufactured in the United States at LGES facility in Holland, Michigan. “Our partnership with LG Energy Solution is more than a supply agreement — it’s a commitment to possibility,” said James Showalter, CEO of EG4 Electronics. “Together, we are creating a future of renewable, reliable, and affordable energy that puts customers and communities first.”

At a time when various tariffs, domestic content requirements and other trade restrictions are coming to the US energy storage market, and many still rely on Chinese suppliers for battery cells, EG4 has been able to react and quickly move to an American made cell. With expected 60% import tariffs along with other additional costs for made in China products factored in, the cells from the LGES Michigan facility will be among the best priced on the US market. “When you calculate the actual value delivered to the site, the LG solutions just dominate. We feel they will be the best value into next year by a long shot,” said Showalter.

And tariff resilience is not the only advantage: The cells are backed by a 15-year warranty, offering improved terms compared to many other suppliers. “That’s something we’re looking to leverage in the market,” said Showalter. “It’s a concern that insurance companies have been pricing in, and we are very happy to be approaching the market with an American made product and seeing how this affects conversations around regulation and reliability.”

Much of EG4’s success to date has come from its ability to tap new markets. While residential energy storage development in the US has so far concentrated in California, the state represents only 13% of EG4’s revenue, and the company has seen strong performance elsewhere, including in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, among others.

With made-in-America supply secured, it expects to keep bringing a value prospect where residential storage has yet to take off, and is also eyeing the United States’ underdeveloped commercial battery market. “The missing spot has been that small and medium commercial sector. They have their tax credit on batteries protected until 2032, so that’s definitely a strong lane to be operating in.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/eg4-photo-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 11:01:32.970271

Accretive Transaction Improves Sempra's Financial Strength

Efficiently Funds 2025–2029 Capital Plan without Equity Issuances

Reached Final Investment Decision for Port Arthur LNG Phase 2

Hosting Conference Call at 11 a.m. EST

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra (NYSE: SRE) today announced several strategic actions that advance Sempra's corporate strategy. The company is executing on five value creation initiatives designed to simplify Sempra's business model, improve financial performance and reduce risk. The company expects these initiatives to strengthen its ability to deliver improved earnings growth while driving enhanced benefits for customers and communities across its service territories.

""The transactions announced today further Sempra's corporate strategy by advancing the company's capital recycling program and transition to a leading U.S. utility growth business,"" said Jeffrey W. Martin, chairman and CEO of Sempra.

Sale of Equity Stake in Sempra Infrastructure Partners

Sempra announced that it has agreed to sell a 45% equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, one of North America's leading energy infrastructure platforms, to affiliates of KKR, a leading global investment firm, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments).

Subject to adjustments, the transaction proceeds of $10 billion implies an equity value of $22.2 billion and an enterprise value of $31.7 billion for Sempra Infrastructure Partners.

Before adjustments, Sempra is expected to receive 47% of the cash at close, 41% by year-end 2027 and the balance approximately seven years after closing. This schedule helps Sempra generate attractive post-closing interest income as it efficiently reinvests proceeds over time in capital expenditures at its U.S. utilities.

The transaction is expected to close in Q2 – Q3 2026, subject to necessary regulatory and other approvals and closing conditions.

Upon closing, a KKR-led consortium will become the majority owner of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, holding a 65% equity stake, while Sempra will retain a 25% interest alongside Abu Dhabi Investment Authority's (ADIA) existing 10% stake. Under the terms of the agreement, Sempra and ADIA will have certain minority rights in Sempra Infrastructure Partners.

""The transaction announced today underscores our commitment to extend our strategic partnership with KKR, with whom we have a shared vision of improving America's position as a global leader in LNG exports,"" said Martin. ""It also directly supports our five value creation initiatives designed to simplify our business, efficiently fund strong utility growth in Texas and California and improve our financial strength.""

""Over the past four years, we have developed a close relationship with the Sempra Infrastructure Partners team and a deep understanding of their business,"" said Raj Agrawal, Global Head of Real Assets at KKR. ""We are excited to grow this strategic partnership and are pleased to welcome CPP Investments alongside us as we work to expand Sempra Infrastructure Partners' assets to help meet growing global demand for energy.""

The transaction also helps strengthen Sempra's credit profile, deconsolidates Sempra Infrastructure Partners, improves Sempra's business mix with a goal of approximately 95% earnings from regulated U.S. utilities and eliminates the need for equity issuances in the previously announced 2025-2029 capital plan.

Key expected benefits from the transaction announced today:

Sharpens focus on building a leading U.S. utility growth business

Reduces business risk by lowering exposure to non-utility investments

Strengthens balance sheet

Improves credit profile and FFO-to-debt

Adds five-year average annual accretion of $0.20 of earnings per common share (EPS) starting in 2027

Highlights value of LNG franchise

Eliminates planned common equity needs in previously announced 2025 – 2029 capital plan

Port Arthur Phase 2 Final Investment Decision

Sempra also announced today that Sempra Infrastructure Partners has reached a final investment decision to advance the development, construction and operation of Port Arthur LNG Phase 2. This new phase will include two natural gas liquefaction trains, one LNG storage tank and associated facilities with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of U.S.-produced LNG. Incremental project capital expenditures at Phase 2 are estimated at $12 billion, plus an approximate $2 billion payment for shared common facilities, with commercial operations expected in 2030 and 2031 for Trains 3 and 4, respectively.

Funding for Phase 2 is supported by an equity investment led by Blackstone Credit & Insurance, together with an investor consortium including KKR, Apollo-managed funds and Private Credit at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. Together these investors have acquired a 49.9% minority equity interest for $7 billion. Sempra Infrastructure Partners has retained a 50.1% majority stake in the project.

In addition to securing 100% equity financing, Sempra Infrastructure Partners has contracted with global engineering, construction and project management firm Bechtel Energy Inc., which has received full notice to proceed for the project. Bechtel's continued involvement from Phase 1 into Phase 2 is expected to drive favorable economics and help mitigate execution risk by leveraging efficiencies and learnings across phases.

Phase 2 is subscribed with long-term offtake under 20-year sales and purchase agreements with strategic partner ConocoPhillips as anchor, and high-quality counterparties EQT, JERA Co. Inc. and Sempra Infrastructure Partners. Consistent with industry practice, Sempra Infrastructure Partners expects to enter into additional offtake agreements from time to time to enhance the overall economic value of the project.

Earnings Guidance

Sempra is updating its full-year 2025 EPS guidance range prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to $3.29 to $3.69, reflecting actual results through the second quarter and certain estimated tax impacts related to the equity sale transaction announced today that are expected to be recognized in the third quarter, and affirming its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.30 to $4.70. With the Sempra Infrastructure Partners equity sale transaction expected to close in Q2 — Q3 of 2026, Sempra is affirming its full-year 2026 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.30. The company is also affirming its guidance to the high-end or above its projected long-term EPS compound annual growth rate of 7% to 9% for 2025 through 2029. Sempra intends to provide an update to its five-year capital plan during its fourth-quarter earnings call in February 2026, subject to completion of the base rate review at Oncor.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures include Sempra's adjusted EPS guidance ranges and net debt, which is used in the calculation of implied enterprise value. See Table A for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.

SEMPRA ADJUSTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE

Sempra 2025 and 2026 Adjusted EPS Guidance Ranges are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant items that are generally not related to our ongoing business activities and/or infrequent in nature. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact from foreign currency and inflation on our monetary positions in Mexico and net unrealized gains and losses on commodity and interest rate derivatives, which we expect to occur in future periods, and which can vary significantly from one period to the next. Exclusion of these items is useful to management and investors because it provides a meaningful comparison of the performance of Sempra's business operations to prior and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplementary information that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

RECONCILIATION OF SEMPRA 2025 ADJUSTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE TO SEMPRA 2025 GAAP EPS GUIDANCE RANGE

Sempra 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range of $4.30 to $4.70 excludes items (after the effects of income taxes and, if applicable, noncontrolling interests) as follows:

$(25) million impact from regulatory disallowances related to the recovery of coronavirus disease 2019 costs at Sempra California for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(89) million impact from foreign currency and inflation on our monetary positions in Mexico for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(10) million net unrealized losses on commodity derivatives for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(8) million net unrealized losses on interest rate swaps related to the Port Arthur LNG liquefaction project (PA LNG Phase 1 project) for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(526) million tax items related to assets held for sale at Sempra Infrastructure, which such amounts could change in future periods until the dates of sale:

$(500) million income tax expense that will be recognized in the third quarter of 2025 to adjust deferred tax liabilities related to our outside basis differences in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, LP (Sempra Infrastructure Partners), changes to state income tax apportionment, and valuation allowances against certain tax attribute carryforwards

$(26) million income tax expense that was recognized in the second quarter of 2025 due to the recognition of a Mexican deferred tax liability on our outside basis difference in Ecogas México, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Ecogas)

Sempra 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range should not be considered an alternative to Sempra 2025 GAAP EPS Guidance Range. The table below reconciles Sempra 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range to Sempra 2025 GAAP EPS Guidance Range, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

SEMPRA 2026 ADJUSTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE

We are unable to reconcile Sempra 2026 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range of $4.80 to $5.30 to Sempra 2026 GAAP EPS Guidance Range, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because we cannot reasonably estimate the forward-looking amount or range of amounts of reasonably estimable GAAP amounts for, or the probable significance of, each of the following future events:

impact from foreign currency and inflation on our monetary positions in Mexico

net unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives

net unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swaps related to the PA LNG Phase 1 project

any potential gain from the proposed sale of Ecogas

any potential gain from the agreement to sell an equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to KKR Partners that was entered into in September 2025, as the purchase price is subject to closing adjustments, post-closing adjustments, and tax items related to our outside basis difference in Sempra Infrastructure Partners that is subject to adjustments based on changes in carrying value, foreign exchange rates and inflation until the date of sale

SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS ENTERPRISE VALUE

Management and external users, such as industry analysts and investors, use Enterprise Value (EV) as a supplemental measure of valuation of Sempra Infrastructure Partners. EV is calculated using an implied equity value based on transaction proceeds adjusted for Projected Proportionate Net Debt at December 31, 2025, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the amount prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Projected Proportionate Net Debt includes Sempra Infrastructure Partners' proportionate ownership interest in expected net debt at unconsolidated equity method investees and excludes such amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Rising competition, higher costs, and a bruised brand thanks to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement are all putting pressure on the company.

Some investors are hopeful for a turnaround. Tesla's stock recently got a bump after Musk purchased $1 billion worth of shares. The purchase was likely a way for Musk to signal to Tesla's board that he's committed to the company as he seeks a pay package that's worth up to an eye-popping $975 billion, if certain goals are met.

But Tesla faces serious challenges. Declining profits and shrinking cash reserves limit its ability to reinvest just as Musk is pushing the company to expand into new growth areas, including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Without the profits and cash to do so, it's a big question whether the company will be able to pivot to these new industries -- or even if it should.

I'm optimistic about Rivian because I think the company is building a strong EV lineup, and I've been impressed with how management has adapted to an increasingly difficult EV environment.

While Rivian's success is nowhere near guaranteed -- especially given the difficult EV environment -- I think it's the better EV stock right now. Tesla's falling profits and shrinking cash availability put it in a tough spot as it tries to transition to robotics and AVs. Investors will still need to be patient with Rivian, though, as the company navigates a challenging period for the EV industry.

CEA energy demand is currently ~1% of the US total (all sectors).
Improving assessment practices: Joint of measurement and modeling Some CEA energy estimates are measurement-based while others are modeled.
Assumptions often favor CEA over open-field cultivation and transport energy use The literature occasionally compares CEA outcomes to open-field practices (Fig.
It is rare that analyses offer sensitivities to baseline open-field energy use or emissions reductions as a function of energy efficiency or renewable energy.","Meta-analysis of a broad literature

While thousands of publications discuss indoor agriculture, only 748 identified through bibliographic search reference energy use, among which 116 provide adequate data for analysis and intercomparisons. The 154 evaluated locations span a broad range of climates and potential solar energy resources (latitudes −0°S to 71°N) in 40 countries and Antarctica, with few located in lower-income countries (Fig. 1) (Table S1). These studies emerge from diverse research communities, the earliest dating from 1993 followed by low publication levels throughout the ensuing 25 years, after which activity increased markedly.

In reviewing the literature, no limitations were placed on geography, cultivation scale, or type of crop. Some were research or demonstration facilities, but all were represented as relevant to commercial production. Inclusion of studies in the compilation required sufficient data to determine aggregate energy use and yields for an entire year (often involving multiple cultivation cycles) and to compute normalized energy per unit yield (MJ/kg) or energy per unit production area (MJ/m2 growing surface). Cases were excluded where major fuels or uses were omitted, seasonal variations not accurately captured, energy needs reported only indirectly in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, or commercial “on-farm” energy use combined with that of labor, solar gains, or off-farm uses. Some sources were excluded where authors confused energy use with peak electricity demands and/or results were expressed in terms of loads, i.e., not accounting for on-site conversion efficiencies.

The identified literature includes measured or modeled energy use for 486 cultivation trials and 23 crop types, with 57% of the estimates being model-based and 43% measurement-based, the latter cohort representing 1686 production sites with an aggregate cultivation area of 14.6 million m2. Of all cases, 59% were in greenhouses and 41% in plant factories. Energy use values for open-field cultivation use were offered for comparison in only 12 of the studies.

Orders-of-magnitude variation in energy use

The compiled energy intensities exhibit extraordinary variability (Figs. 2a, b and 3a–h). Differences are evident among and within crop types, facility types, and geographies. Other potential causes of divergence include yields per unit of growing area, energy efficiency, and various lighting factors including type, contribution of daylight, illuminance levels (PPFD), and artificial lighting on-times (photoperiod).

Lettuce and tomatoes exhibit loosely overlapping energy intensities, while herbs and leafy greens tend to be somewhat more energy intensive, cucumbers the least energy-intensive, and cannabis the most energy-intensive crop by orders of magnitude (Fig. 4a, b). Approaching the lower bound of cannabis are soybeans and wheat (gray and black markers) which are both found to be uneconomic given the high required energy inputs–despite use of LED lighting, high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, and a well-insulated facility envelope in the case of wheat. Microgreens are also among the more energy-intensive crops.

When grouped by facility type (Fig. 4c), greenhouses are the least energy-intensive (median 27 MJ/kg), followed by plant factories (127 MJ/kg) which includes 23,300 MJ/kg for cannabis and 78 MJ/kg for non-cannabis crops. While not always identifiable in the source literature, less-mechanized “open” greenhouses appear to operate between 1.5 and 5 MJ/kg. Yield intensities (kg/m2-y) in greenhouses fully overlap with those of plant factories, with far less energy input, an observation that has been made by others20. For comparison, the median value for open-field crops is only ~1 MJ/kg.

Depending on metric, median energy intensities of facilities without identified energy-efficiency measures are only 1% (MJ/kg) and 3% (MJ/m2-y) higher than those with one or more efficiency features (Fig. 3a–f) although the variation is expectedly greater for those not identifying the presence of energy efficiency features (Fig. 2a, b). While individual side-by-side studies clearly show energy savings from efficiency measures, many other factors appear to have more influence on the overall sample outcomes. Energy intensities are uncorrelated with facility size for both metrics (Fig. S1).

No substantial differences between energy use for modeled and measured results are evident (Fig. 3g, h). Detailed validations of models against measured data for a given facility are uncommon. Model results appear to assume systematically higher annual yields — which translates to lower energy intensities — perhaps reflecting idealized conditions and neglecting real-world factors such as crop losses.

Energy consumption at the end-use level is disaggregated in 191 cases (Fig. 4). This information is valuable for understanding drivers of energy use and identifying opportunities to improve energy efficiency. For example, dehumidification represents more than half of total energy use for cannabis cultivation in hot and humid locations while heating is negligible compared to cold climates where dehumidification is minimal and heating represents about two-thirds of total energy use. Wide variations in end-use shares are notable even for a given crop or facility type.

This large and diversified sample reveals findings not captured by less-comprehensive studies, and distinguishes energy intensities by crop and facility type. It also provides a counterpoint to claims based on far smaller samples that energy use is largely insensitive to climate13,21,22,23,24. End-use analysis also helps scrutinize rules-of-thumb, e.g., that all plant factories have the same end-use breakdowns23 or the assumption that a multiplier of 1.25 can be readily applied to lighting energy to obtain total energy use25,26,27. In practice, per Fig. 4, artificial lighting can constitute between ~0% and ~95% total energy use.

Extreme CEA: Arctic and Antarctic applications are particularly energy-intensive

CEA facilities are operated by five countries in Antarctica28 to produce food and conduct research for space-based applications. Interestingly, despite minimum temperatures of −43.5 °C, greenhouses with ultra-high-efficiency envelopes are employed in some cases to take advantage of daylight and minimize fuel use or costly solar installations. Measured energy intensities of ~17,000 MJ/kg for mixed vegetables7 are among the highest in the meta-analysis, and more than 200-times greater than the median for food production.

Energy intensities of ~6000 MJ/kg occur for cucumbers in container farms in the Canadian arctic8, where fresh produce must otherwise be flown into Inuit villages. Despite the waste heat from lighting and dehumidification meeting nearly all heating needs, nearly 50 kW of on-site renewable energy and battery storage, plus diesel generator backup, is needed to support this modest 6.7 m2 growing area.

In Icelandic greenhouses, heat is required year-round, with supplemental lighting much of the year, along with summertime cooling29. Significant additional energy use is associated with melting snow from greenhouse glazing. Energy intensities are 2600–5800 MJ/kg for low-calorie crops such as lettuce and tomatoes.

The cannabis conundrum: the most energy-intensive crop

Cannabis emerges as the most energy-intensive crop (Figs. 2 and 3), and represents approximately 95% of present-day US CEA crop value30,31. About 63% of this cannabis (legal and illicit) is produced in CEA facilities, representing 17% of the country’s overall CEA facility footprint. Little data on cannabis cultivation is available for other countries.

Likely drivers for the relative energy inefficiency include the yield being measured in dry- rather than wet-weight, high crop losses from interdiction and other factors, high proportions of unused and woody biomass (low harvest index), long cultivation cycles (~70 days) and photoperiods (12–18 h/d), higher lighting intensities (PPFDs up to 1323 micromoles/m2/s) creating corresponding elevated cooling needs, lower tolerable humidity levels (50–60%), unsuitability for multi-layer vertical farming, higher air-circulation rates, and higher levels of CO2 enrichment than most food crops (1000–1200 ppm are common).

In the U.S., cannabis has become the largest cash crop, while releasing CO2 emissions at the rate of ten million cars with an energy expenditure of $11 billion each year31. While there is general debate about the environmental merits of urban agriculture11, the expansion of factory-farm cannabis cultivation into cities has raised distinct secondary energy issues, including strain on power grids, significant power outages, and environmental justice concerns31.

Notably, the broader literature on CEA crop production is virtually devoid of reference to cannabis, while that on cannabis rarely provides comparisons to other crops. LCA analyses for cannabis are rare31,32,33.

Energy is a constraint to producing essential staple crops

Multiple studies find that because fruits, cereals, legumes, seeds, root crops, and other high-protein/high-calorie staple crops are significantly more energy-intensive than crops such as lettuce and herbs they cannot be cost-competitively produced under CEA15,20,29,34,35. For example, even at scale, strawberries from CEA facilities are priced at ten-times that of their field-grown equivalents4.

In another study, soybeans had among the highest energy intensity26 of all food crops in this meta-analysis. While yields were up to six-times greater than open-field soybeans, energy intensity was 1000- to 2000-times greater, even with energy-efficient LED lighting.

Asseng et al.34 model a hypothetical 18,225 m2, 10-story wheat-production facility with high energy efficiency (insulation, heat pumps, LED lights, and heat-recovery ventilation). To maximize yields (63-times greater than field-grown wheat), very high illuminance levels (5- to 10-times that of most other studies in this compilation) are assumed to be delivered 24 h per day, with natural background levels of atmospheric CO2 tripled (to 1200 ppm) to accelerate plant growth. Estimated energy costs for the facility are $16 M/y based on an inexplicably low assumed price of $0.02/kWh – versus an average US industrial price of $0.09/kWh in summer 202436 – representing 77% of total operational costs, or $13/kg yield, greatly exceeding the value of the commodity.

Prospects for greater adoption of energy efficient technologies are constrained

In a global survey of greenhouse and plant-factory operators37, two thirds report not employing any energy efficiency strategies. Providing insight as to why uptake is low, another industry survey identified multiple barriers, in order of decreasing severity: upfront costs (compounded by narrow profit margins), access to capital and financing, lack of knowledge, skepticism and lack of trust in the performance of efficient technologies, lack of executive support, and insufficient training38. Cultivators of even the most energy-intensive crops demand, on average, a rapid 4-year payback time on their energy efficiency investments39. While some qualitative assessments are optimistic9, model studies document a limited cost-effective energy savings potential of <10% for most measures in cannabis farms40, which should be among the most promising applications given the high energy use and expenditures.

The benefits of LED lighting have been found to be highly variable. In field trials, Leichleiter et al.41 found energy savings ranging from negligible to substantial depending on cultivar. Measurement-based studies for tomato production found LED lighting required augmentation with less-efficient high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting42. The efficacy of LED products appears to also be an issue, given the 2.2-fold variance in yields of microgreens per unit of energy depending on LED manufacturer43.

Facility energy efficiencies among the sites included in the meta-analysis vary widely, with some having single-glazing, combustion heating systems, minimal insulation, low-efficiency lighting, and deficiencies in system operation44. However, compared to the aforementioned industry surveys, a disproportionate number of studies in the meta-analysis involved one or more energy-efficiency measures (Fig. 3e, f). Such measures were reported in 50% of the studies and 70% of the cases (individual measurement trials or model runs), including 60% with LEDs, 24% with heat pumps, 15% with insulation, 3% with evaporative cooling, 2% with economizer cooling, and 1% with multiple glazing. The potential for energy efficiency – within a given CEA facility type – is thus already partly captured, while facility operators perceive many barriers to further adoption.

For indoor agriculture (and all other industries) the primary path to full decarbonization requires conversion of all energy uses to electricity, and then producing that electricity with renewable energy. Electrification also offers unique opportunities for energy efficiency (e.g., heat pumps instead of combustion heating). Just under 60% of the facilities reviewed here are all-electric. If not provided for at the time of construction, capital requirements for such conversions are substantial.

Process change can reduce or increase energy efficiency

The choice of CEA facility type (greenhouse instead of plant factory) is perhaps the single-most impactful determinant of energy efficiency. A few studies document other promising forms of process change. These include measures such as reducing photoperiod and light intensity in the case of Stevia45, growing strawberry runners outdoors before bringing them into the controlled environment for flowering and fruiting35, and varying fertigation techniques, light levels, lighting location, and greenhouse operation46. Light deprivation is commonly used in plant-factory and greenhouse operations to compress cultivation times for cannabis and certain other crops, thereby reducing energy requirements. Pennisi et al.47 varied the spectrum of LED lighting, finding variations in energy use for lettuce (1.5x) and chicory (1.2x). Field tests in Australia48 found that optimizing planting dates can yield energy savings in cool winters. Increasing yield was found to improve efficiency for tomatoes bred to also thrive at slightly lower temperatures49. One particularly effective case study utilized root-zone cooling for cucumbers in the extreme United Arab Emirates climate, lowering energy use by 20-fold while maintaining yields50. While AI may play a role in attaining operational benefits24, it also requires substantial energy inputs.

Cultivar choice can also impact energy use, yet only one-quarter of cases in this review identify the exact cultivar, and few of these explore the energy implications. Almeida et al.51 attribute some of their observed differences in energy intensity to the choice of tomato cultivars. Leichleiter et al.41 found a 6-fold difference in energy intensity of different types of cannabis cultivated in otherwise identical plant factories. It is proposed that genetic engineering can develop cultivars that grow better under energy-efficient LED lighting52.

Site selection is also a key variable. One study53 found that the most energy-efficient approach to cucumber greenhouse cultivation in Norway was summertime cultivation in the southern part of the country, with moveable glazing insulation and no artificial lighting. Replicating that same method in the north increased energy intensity by 51%, with 11% reduced yields.

Conversely, efficiency losses can arise from efforts to increase yields. Early efforts to increase yields in the Netherlands included increased CO2 enrichment, which was produced by burning fossil fuels on site54. Elevating CO2 levels requires increased light levels to support amplified photosynthesis, which, in turn, boosts transpiration and dehumidification energy needs. In another example, reducing temperatures for tomato greenhouses in a hot desert climate resulted in an 18% increase in energy use for a 0.35% increase in yield55. Some studies found that yields level off or even decline appreciably with increasing light inputs, and, conversely, in some cases greenhouses without artificial light achieve less energy input per unit of yield without sacrificing product quality20,42,46,56,57. Microgreen yields declined by 23% in Chile as light application was increased by 144% while energy intensity increased 72%58. Qualitatively similar results were observed in Russia59. In southern Norway, while intensified cucumber production with artificial lighting, cooling, and year-round cultivation tripled yields, it also increased energy intensity by 88%53.

In a further complication, certain efforts to reduce non-energy environmental impacts can increase energy use. For example, water recovery from exhaust air is energy intensive20 and steam-cleaning soils for re-use rather than disposal60 can double on-farm energy use.

Shifting to renewable energy can negate the land-use benefits of intensive indoor cultivation

The elevated yields of CEA facilities are often credited with creating “freed” or “spared” land that can ostensibly be returned to a wild state4. In response to concerns about energy use, it is also commonly stated that CEA facilities can become more sustainable if fully powered with renewable energy to achieve net-zero emissions – yet these propositions rarely quantify the associated land requirements.

Individual case studies8,34,61,62,63,64,65,66,67 report that on-site solar electricity would require land areas ranging from 2- to 100-times the facility’s floor area – often more than that needed for open-field cultivation. A techno-economic optimization for US-based greenhouses (which are significantly less energy-intensive than plant factories) found the approach not to be cost-effective except in the mildest climates68. Moreover, diversion of renewable energy for discretionary indoor cultivation is problematic given the current need to dramatically reduce global emissions in other sectors in order to manage rising climate risk, while the practical constraints on renewable energy expansion are many, ranging from ecological to cultural conflicts17,20,31.

Figure 5 shows the standardized area required to meet all on-farm energy needs with solar photovoltaic (PV) power for cases in the meta-analysis. In all cases, the array area exceeds the building footprint. The average ground-mounted PV area (panels in excess of what will fit on the roof) required for food-producing greenhouses is 4-times their building footprint, 48-times for food-producing plant factories, and 122-times for cannabis-producing plant factories. In the best cases, highly energy-efficient greenhouses (envelope, lighting, and equipment) in an ideal solar climate (Turkey) required an array area equal to building footprint, but this outcome is rare. The largest solar arrays are required for energy-intensive crops and vertical-farming facilities for food crops with multiple cultivation layers and/or multiple-stories. The extreme case, a skyscraper lettuce-production greenhouse in a sunny Los Angeles location would require a PV array ~600-times its footprint to meet target lighting levels beyond what daylight provides. Inconveniently, multi-layer vertical farming ostensibly spares the most land (albeit before counting the solar requirements)4.

In the US, typical ratios of CEA to open-field yields per unit of land area include: cucumbers 22:1, lettuces 12-21:1, peppers 6-12:1, 4.9:1 for cannabis, tomatoes 4:1, and strawberries 1.4:110,69. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the required additional solar land areas are generally much higher than these multiples. Not included in the analysis is land area for electrical transmission lines, fossil fuel mining and processing, or other renewable energy land uses (hydroelectric, wind, etc.). While no all-electric open-field cases were identified, such farms would only require a minor fractional expansion of land area to achieve net-zero emissions with solar PV. Moreover, the ratios shown above compare conventional open-field results rather than best practices (which use less land area), suggesting that optimal open-field cultivation could be even more competitive on a land-use basis.

Energy-determinative dynamics of controlled environment agriculture: technologies and markets

Narratives describing advantages of CEA compared to open-field agriculture inform the assessment of energy needs and environmental impact4,9,45,70,71. Key stated benefits include control of environmental factors (temperature, light, humidity), shortened crop cycles, an extended growing season, and increasing output with high predictability. The degree to which yields exceed those of open-field farming varies widely as a function of cultivar and practices, and outdoor conditions where competing open-field cultivation would occur10. Other stipulated benefits include reduced transportation energy in delivering crops to market, exposure to pests and natural hazards, land-area requirements, soil degradation and erosion, fertilizer use, water use, soil-derived greenhouse-gas emissions, odor nuisance, food-safety risks, and commodity shrinkage and spoilage if facilities are located closer to markets. These technical aspirations are often rhetorically tied to broader goals including environmental protection, public health, and affordable and equitable availability of food for a growing land-constrained population.

For each of these stated advantages are caveats and countervailing concerns15. In some cases, unique collateral problems are associated with energy and mechanization and bringing cultivation closer to population centers, including light pollution and odor nuisance72. Reduced transport distances do not predictably lower overall carbon footprints15. More broadly, in an intrinsic contradiction, greenhouse-gas emissions from CEA’s energy use—which can exceed that of open-field cultivation—exacerbate the very climate risks the practice is hoped to shield against11. Disaster-resilience is an oft-cited benefit73, although CEA has acutely greater vulnerability to utility disruptions (power and water) than open-field agriculture, more costly potential damage to cultivation infrastructure, and substantial added capital cost for backup electricity generation and nuisance while in operation. The advantages of CEA in terms of water and land requirements only hold when moderate open-field yields are assumed and system boundaries omit the land and water required for energy production69.

Nonetheless, CEA has high appeal and is well-established for certain crop types and geographies. For example, most microgreens and commercial mushrooms are grown in plant factories. Geographically-isolated Iceland imports about two-thirds of its vegetables, by calorie count29, while the land-constrained island state of Singapore imports 90% of its food74. Greenhouses provide one-third of fresh vegetables imported to the US from Mexico10, ~60% of vegetable production in Iran75,76, and virtually all non-summer cultivation in Siberia77. In Norway, virtually all tomatoes, 90% of cucumbers, and 13% of lettuce are grown in greenhouses78. The highest-value crops are the most viable, as in the case of cannabis for which US wholesale prices are ~$2000/kg, yet, energy costs remain a concerning factor and one-third of production continues to be conducted outdoors31.

The scale of CEA practices is increasing. Globally, greenhouses occupy an estimated land area of 1.3–3.7 million ha – an unknown fraction being heated or artificially illuminated – of which closed glass houses comprise ~70 kha79,80. No reliable estimates have been identified for plant factories, but they likely number in the low thousands of hectares. As an illustration at the national scale, CEA production in the US occurs in in ~11,000 greenhouse farms, spanning 19.4 Mm2 plus 3.1 Mm2 for mushrooms30 and 4.6 million m2 for cannabis cultivation in a mix of greenhouse and plant-factory settings81 (Table S2).

On-farm energy use is a leading determinant of overall climate impacts from crop production (Table 1). Energy uses include electricity, diesel, natural gas, propane, coal, biofuels, on-site renewable energy, and industrial waste heat76,82,83,84,85,86,87 Energy needs are driven by artificial lighting, heating, space cooling due to solar gains in greenhouses and substantial waste-heat from lighting, and dehumidification. For certain crops and geographies, greenhouses can avoid the need for artificial lighting, but since artificial lighting can increase yields, and provide sometimes-useful waste heat, many greenhouses rely heavily on it87. Secondary energy-using activities include ventilation, irrigation water temperature control, crop drying, water pumping and irrigation, snow-melting, carbon-dioxide enrichment, post-harvest soil steaming for disinfection, water recovery and on-site treatment, harvesting and other on-site crop handling or processing, cold storage, robotics or other automation, and AI or other computing associated with process control.

In addition to technical issues are energy-related market challenges. CEA capital costs–much of which trace to energy infrastructure–far exceed those for open-field agriculture and are reported to range from $550–$1600/m2 for greenhouses and $1600–$4300/m2 for plant factories88. Some authors note that capital costs are orders of magnitude higher for CEA than for open-field operations, and a single facility can cost hundreds of millions of dollars4,89. Land costs are also higher in urban and peri-urban areas, which is where CEA is often proposed as a means of reducing food-transportation distances.

As a reflection of these costs, many CEA producers fail to attain profitability89. Operating costs for energy constitute a larger share of expenses than most other industries (Table 2) – and were at the root of early vertical farming start-up bankruptcies5,9,15,20,67,90. A late-1970s effort known as Phytofarms was abandoned by General Mills in 1982, purchased by another entity (for $20 M in today’s dollars), and operated until 1992, with utility costs named as a major factor in its ultimate bankruptcy4. Other well-capitalized companies (Google, General Electric, GTE, Sylvania, and Weyerhaeuser) also abandoned early efforts4. The current-day cannabis industry also faces solvency issues, tied in part to energy intensity31. Energy costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of elevated commodity prices, which can negate socioeconomic benefits of growing nearer to the point of demand, particularly for lower-income consumers35,91,92.

Contextualizing aggregate energy demand for indoor agriculture

It is helpful to put the energy intensity of CEA in context with other uses, and to similarly assess the aggregate energy demand. As an illustration, the median energy intensity (MJ/m2-y) for food crops grown in plant factories is 5-times that of the average US office building, while for the most intensive food crops the ratio is 90-times greater. Righini et al.26 estimate of 16 MWh to provide a year’s worth of protein per person with soybeans grown in plant factories is on par with the requirements of an all-electric home with two electric vehicles. Moreover, while the energy embodied in producing 1 kg of usable protein from open-field soybeans ranges from 1.5 to 3% that of producing that same protein from beef, soybeans grown in plant factories require 4500- to 9000-times more energy than open-field farming and thus 60- to 120-times more than producing protein via beef (Table S3).

The literature review revealed no prior estimates of aggregate national energy use associated with CEA, aside from cannabis31,93. Results of this meta-analysis enable the determination that current on-farm energy use for 15 primary CEA food crops (representing 7.4% of all yields of those crops) is 735 PJ/year, exceeding that to produce all crops under open-field conditions (Table S4)94. Approximately half this energy use is attributable to cannabis cultivation. The total CEA food- crop production is <1% of all US food-crop supply (~7% of vegetables), by weight, and much less by calorie content. The cultivation area represented in this analysis is only about one-fifth the total protected area when including crops such as bedding plants, florist products, hemp, nursery plants, and sod (Table S2).

CEA energy demand is currently ~1% of the US total (all sectors). In a scoping estimate in which all applicable crops are produced in plant factories (Fig. 6), this would increase to up to 7% of all US energy consumption (10-times current energy use for all open-field crops) (Table S5), exceeding that of many other segments of the economy (Fig. 7). The hypothetical land area required to produce this CEA energy with solar photovoltaic arrays would be triple that currently used for outdoor production of these same crops.

Improving assessment practices: Nuances of energy analysis and benchmarking

The choice of energy metrics is critical to meaningful performance benchmarking16,95. In the energy literature, CEA facilities are typically rated in terms of energy per unit of floor area44,62,67,68,87,96, a metric useful for energy-infrastructure planning, assessing burdens on the grid, etc. The choice of net cultivation area or gross facility area (e.g., including aisles or office areas) can have a marked effect on computed intensities, but the distinction is often not made in the CEA literature. Metrics based on yield are standard in the agronomy and LCA literature – and in the agricultural industry itself – illuminating the energy-efficiency of the cultivation process while being insensitive to definition of planted area or cultivation periods. Occasionally, other functional units are used, e.g., sweetener metabolite for Stevia45, kilocalories for mushrooms97, protein for soybeans26, or potency for cannabis41.

Defining a system boundary that articulates which energy-using processes are considered is essential to achieving clear and usable metrics. In practice, the literature is often imprecise in these definitions or otherwise quantitatively or conceptually ambiguous, e.g., regarding inclusion of energy inputs during production of seedlings or clones. Some studies omit specific energy types such as fuel for heating, end uses such as cooling, on-site electricity generation by diesel generators, or energy used on-site to produce CO2, post-harvest processing, cold storage, etc. Others normatively include only single energy uses, e.g., heating98,99, or lighting27,100, or only measure total energy use while lighting is on13,101,102, heating and cooling103,104, during only part of the cultivation cycle105, only seasonally106, or during even briefer periods of monitoring thus missing the seasonal effects of fluctuations in weather and daylighting107. Test facilities are sometimes located inside other buildings47,108, with studies failing to measure the heating and cooling provided from the surrounding conditioned space.

The literature can also present incommensurate values with respect to the system boundary. For example, in some cases a portion of the injected CO2 is made on-site and part off-site53,109. Similarly, one study counted irrigation energy and substantial post-harvest weight loss due to commodity shrinkage during transport for open-field operations but not for CEA operations91. In an assessment of mushroom cultivation, the most energy-intensive process (composting) was conducted on-farm in one case and off-farm in another, resulting in a ten-fold difference in energy intensity between facilities that reflected energy accounting rather than actual energy efficiency110. Some assessments include energy input from human labor and sunlight (in the form of heat as well as illumination).

Other nuances arise from study duration and net yields. Most CEA crops can be grown multiple times each year. To extrapolate annual energy use from a single reported cycle one must know the cycle duration and any possible seasonal limitations or yield variability. The energy use embodied in pre- and post-harvest crop losses should also be added to the calculations, but rarely is. Cannabis is particularly impacted in this latter respect through a combination of losses due to disease (mold outbreaks are common), interdiction, and product destruction or recalls due to consumer safety testing failures that can collectively result in 20% losses nationally31.

Studies reporting only carbon footprint19,111,112 have limited usefulness for energy analysis since the underlying energy intensity and types of constituent fuels and electricity are obscured, which is important when evaluating tradeoffs between fossil-fuel transport and electrified cultivation. Even studies providing both views show that emissions comparisons can obscure differences in underlying energy use91. This is particularly problematic when outcomes from countries with low-emissions electricity are compared to those with more carbon-intensive grids113. An emissions focus can mask caveats to conclusions and policy recommendations, as in a study set in Sweden which found lower CO2 emissions for vertically-farmed lettuce and basil than for field-grown lettuce commonly imported from southern Europe108. As Sweden’s grid is almost entirely based on zero-emissions nuclear and hydroelectric power, recalibration of those results to US conditions results in a 20-fold increase in total CEA emissions. Another Swedish study found domestic emissions below those of crop imports only in summer, excluding cooling energy114.

A model-based assessment of tomato production in Norwegian greenhouses further illuminates how assumptions can shape findings. Surprisingly, summertime cultivation in un-lit greenhouses was found to be more carbon-intensive than year-round cultivation. This arose from inappropriately comparing summer heating at low efficiency with fossil fuels and in some cases less facility insulation to heat pumps and lighting in winter at high efficiency powered with carbon-free hydroelectric electricity82. Wintertime heating is thus decarbonized and waste heat from electric light further substitutes for fuel. The comparisons also appear to involve variations in the mix of CO2 produced on-site with fossil fuel vs. purchased CO2 canisters for which the embodied energy and carbon is outside the system boundary and thus not counted. The evaluation of facility characteristics and seasonality are thus conflated with the influences of fuel, heating efficiencies, lighting, and perhaps varying system boundary conditions. With identical heating fuels and efficiencies, seasonal summer production would have the lowest carbon footprint per unit yield.

Improving assessment practices: Joint of measurement and modeling

Some CEA energy estimates are measurement-based while others are modeled. Measurement provides a “ground-truth” of sorts, albeit often with caveats, and helps identify potentially unmodeled uses (e.g., snow-melting on greenhouses). Modeling allows explicit articulation of system boundaries; annualized estimation under long-term average weather; and assessment of sensitivity to interior climate setpoints, building geometry, and outdoor climatic conditions while accounting for energetic trade-offs between factors such as lighting and cooling loads as a function of solar gains. Co-modeling of energy together with evapotranspiration, photoperiod, and other crop dynamics captures implications for energy-using processes such as dehumidification or lighting needs and how yields may vary as a function of energy inputs (Table 3).

Model studies also offer advantages insofar as they control for or at least make transparent the “noisy” drivers underlying measured data, and enable rapid and less costly parametric analyses and scenario studies44,67 but are also susceptible to specification error and unrealistic assumptions. Energy-agronomy interactions are complex and challenging to model, while empirical data intrinsically captures the effects.

Comparing model results to measured data can help design, validate, and calibrate models and ensure realism35,44,67,68,115,116,117,118,119,120. Measurement and modeling can be combined to achieve more comprehensive assessments8,31,56. While estimating the benefits of energy efficiency measures is far easier with modeling – especially for ensembles of measures — some studies44,46,121 have done so in actual facilities, providing added confidence in the findings.

Assumptions often favor CEA over open-field cultivation and transport energy use

The literature occasionally compares CEA outcomes to open-field practices (Fig. 3c, d), often citing values for different crops and geographies and comparing optimized and high-tech indoor methods to average open-field practices (rather than best practices). CEA yields for “protected” practices are reported to be 1.5 to 20-times greater than open-field cultivation, depending on crop10. More intensive open-field methods have been documented to increase yields by 2- to 3-fold122,123 above standard practices, which would reduce the yield gap by half to two-thirds and correspondingly widen the differences in energy intensity in favor of open-field cultivation. It is rare that analyses offer sensitivities to baseline open-field energy use or emissions reductions as a function of energy efficiency or renewable energy.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44264-025-00091-z/MediaObjects/44264_2025_91_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-23 14:01:44.029304

Commenting in a release was Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie: “Utility programme caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity.”

Market maturation continues

The share of VPP wholesale market capacity from residential customers increased to 10.2%, from 8.8% in 2024, still reflecting market barriers to small customers. Third-party data access for enrolment and market settlement are the primary blockers.

Leading markets

California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37% of VPP deployments. Meanwhile, PJM and ERCOT, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data centre capacity, also have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centres are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Offtake growth

The top 25 VPP offtakers procured over 100MW each this year, while over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30% compared to last year, showing the breadth of the market.

An ‘independent distributed power producer’ business model has emerged, whose thesis is that energy arbitrage and grid service revenue can finance an electricity retailer’s third-party-owned storage offering.

Regulatory pushback

A majority of VPP aggregators and software providers do not support utilities rate basing DERs, a key plank of the Distributed Capacity Procurement model for utilities. “This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” says Hertz-Shargel.

“Meanwhile, there is broad consensus among experienced wholesale market participants that FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and will not have a significant impact on market access.”",https://www.smart-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US-virtual-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 11:01:01.764270

“I don’t know that anyone really thought they would issue FEOC [guidance] within 45 days, because, these rules are very, very complicated,” explained Crouse.
“It goes without saying that clean energy tax incentives is less of a priority” for the Trump administration, Hanlon said during his September 8 remarks.","The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB, P.L. 119-21) imposes complex foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions on clean energy credits – but practitioners are still awaiting clarity on the new provisions. Tax experts weighed in on when guidance might begin to trickle out, and which credit will likely be addressed first.

FEOC restrictions already applied to some tax credits, including the IRC § 30D Clean Vehicle Credit and IRC § 48D Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit. Those restrictions were put in place by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, respectively.

But the OBBB applies new and expanded FEOC restrictions to several other clean energy credits, namely the IRC § 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, IRC § 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit, IRC § 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit, IRC § 45Q Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit, IRC § 45U Nuclear Power Production Credit, and IRC § 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

Under the OBBB, credits are subject to two types of entity-level restrictions – those applicable to “specified foreign entities” and to “foreign-influenced entities.” The Sections 45X, 45Y, and 48E credits are also subject to new “material assistance” provisions.

NYU’s Tax Law Center describes the provisions as “a thicket of new and complex prohibited foreign entity rules that will, at minimum, impose significant compliance burdens on taxpayers.” The Tax Law Center’s Kyle Sweeney, Seth Hanlon, and Michael Kaercher delve into the details in a July post.

Guidance Watch

With a maze of new statutory requirements, the clean energy sector and tax practitioners are watching for implementation guidance from Treasury and the IRS. “There’s a huge amount of uncertainty around those rules and how this administration will apply them,” Hanlon explained during a September 8 American Tax Policy Institute webinar.

While clean energy credits aren’t loved by most Republicans, Holland & Knight’s Elizabeth Crouse said that “Treasury kind of needs to deliver on some guidance so that people can run their businesses.” That’s because “no matter what anyone thinks of the renewable energy industry, it is an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people in this country – millions, depending on how you count,” Crouse told Checkpoint.

The Tax Law Center included the FEOC provisions in its OBBB implementation watch list. The group takes a more skeptical view than Crouse, cautioning of the “risk that the Administration will implement these provisions in ways that impermissibly restrict access to clean energy tax credits or will not issue guidance at all.”

A July 7 executive order, issued in the wake of the OBBB, directed Treasury to “take prompt action … to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions.” The executive order had called for action within 45 days of the OBBB’s July 4 enactment – but guidance has yet to be released.

Crouse said she’d be “pleasantly surprised” to see FEOC guidance trickle out by the end of this year – and having no guidance until the first quarter of 2026 “isn’t out of the question” to her. “I don’t know that anyone really thought they would issue FEOC [guidance] within 45 days, because, these rules are very, very complicated,” explained Crouse. She thinks of it as “domestic content turned on its head.”

But FEOC guidance is needed, because the statutory language of OBBB is “vague, in part” and leaves “gray areas to fill in,” Crouse said. However, FEOC is not the only area in need of guidance, and “it’s entirely possible that the FEOC rules are just not as high a priority” to Treasury and the White House as some other areas, Crouse explained.

“It goes without saying that clean energy tax incentives is less of a priority” for the Trump administration, Hanlon said during his September 8 remarks. The OBBB is a “sweeping law,” he added, with other high priority tax provisions such as “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime.”

But more than that, Hanlon is concerned about the loss of “sources of expertise within the government.” That includes not only Treasury and the IRS, but also “many of the technical agencies … like the Department of Energy and the EPA.”

Hanlon, who served as Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax and Climate Policy in the Biden administration, explained that when implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, Treasury and the IRS relied on those technical agencies to produce guidance. With recent federal workforce reductions, “I think it’s going to be more difficult to tackle these extremely complicated issues,” said Hanlon.

What Will Come First?

Crouse suspects that when the Trump administration does release FEOC guidance, the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under Section 45X “has to be the first focus.” That’s because “everything under 45X becomes more pertinent more quickly,” she added.

More specifically, Crouse elaborated, “the material assistance rules are really the thing that’s causing people to lose sleep in the 45X context.”

The OBBB restricts three credits where a prohibited foreign entity provides “material assistance” to a taxpayer. For Sections 45Y and 48E, the restriction applies for facilities and energy storage technology where construction begins after 2025. However, for Section 45X, the restriction applies for components sold in tax years beginning after the OBBB’s date of enactment.

Crouse said that one implementation challenge is that “the rules for 48E, 45Y, and 45X are kind of smushed together when it comes to material assistance, which makes them a bit more difficult to interpret.” To understand the requirements “you kind of have to untangle the threads” – but then “you end up with some questions, some little knot that you’re not quite sure exactly how to untangle.”

Crouse seemed confident, however, that the IRS and Treasury can address Section 45X separately from Sections 48E and 45Y.

For Section 45X, production must happen in the U.S. “It’s pretty clear” that manufacturers will need to look at some “thing” or component “beyond the thing that qualifies for 45X,” Crouse explained. What’s not clear, she said, is whether manufacturers will “have to look down to the itty-bitty stuff.”

For Sections 48E and 45Y, however you “pretty clearly, are supposed to be looking at the prior domestic content notice first,” she explained.

Crouse also stressed that guidance on material assistance for purposes of Sections 48E and 45Y is “not as pressing,” because plants can “begin construction by the end of this year in order to avoid the material assistance rules.” And “there will be other plants that safe harbor during the first half of next year,” she added. Although those plants will have to qualify for material assistance, “they’re not going to start procuring equipment until probably into 2028.”",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-09-23 11:00:49.400488

LONDONDERRY, Pa., September 23, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

""Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,"" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. ""Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.""

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, ""In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power.

Andrew SpenceLocal Democracy Reporting Service

The mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire has said he is ""all for"" cleaner air and green energy.

At a Hull and East Yorkshire Combined Authority (HEYCA) meeting, councillors questioned Luke Campbell's stance on renewable energy.

Reform UK has pledged to scrap the UK's net-zero target and introduce taxes on the renewables sector.

But former Olympic boxer Campbell said at the meeting he is ""all for creating jobs in any sector"" and added: ""Who doesn't like cleaner air and green energy?""

Campbell has openly supported parts of the region's renewables sector by visiting and offering support to Vivergo Fuels, the bioethanol plant that was shut down.

He also said he was ""delighted"" after HEYCA secured £700k from the government's mayoral renewables fund to cut energy costs in Hull and East Yorkshire over the next 25 years through solar panel projects.

But Campbell later warned renewable energy firms to act ""at your own risk"" in response to Boston and Skegness MP Richard Tice's letter stating a Reform UK-led government would ""reassess all net zero-related commitments"".

'Stand for the people'

According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, at the HEYCA meeting, Labour councillor Shane McMurray asked Campbell: ""Is there anything you can say now to give reassurance to people who work at Siemens, who want to get a career in wind farms and jobs like that?""

Campbell replied: ""The mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire should stand for the people, it was the people that elected Luke Campbell into place so I'll stand up and represent them the best I can.

""If that's creating jobs in any sector I'm all for it. Who doesn't like cleaner air and green energy? I do and I'm all for that.""

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models.","(CNN) — Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1, leaving automakers and car buyers wondering where prices will go.

The tax credit, which was passed in 2022 as part of the Biden administration’s legislative push to support EVs and green energy, is going away as part of President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill that passed in July. The move came after US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

The end of the tax credit means demand for EVs is expected to fall, which means prices in real terms will rise — a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September. But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.

With fewer people buying EVs in the coming months, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand. But it’s not clear how much savings that will provide buyers, and it likely won’t make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US electric vehicles rose more than three times as fast as the 2% rise in non-electric passenger vehicles, according to data from the BTS.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

“If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms or cash-back offers for buyers.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

“I think we’ll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,” Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won’t kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they’ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey from Cox found that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment, were all more important factors than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models. It’s not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won’t necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a “moving target,” said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

“I think there’s going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,” Green said.

About Troutman Pepper Locke","New insights gathered by law firm Troutman Pepper Locke reveal a sector bruised but buoyant amid regulatory and tariff uncertainty

NEW YORK – The U.S. energy storage sector remains optimistic after a turbulent year marked by increased regulatory and tariff-related risks, according to findings from law firm Troutman Pepper Locke.

Its latest industry report, “Brave New World: What’s Next for US Energy Storage After OBBBA and Amid Continued Tariff Risk?“ highlights how developers, investors, and lenders across the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) landscape have prepared to face escalating risk profiles in 2025, and why they remain confident about the sector’s overall growth trajectory.

Co-author and Troutman Pepper Locke partner Vaughn Morrison said, “Energy storage’s versatility of use cases has untethered it from the fate of wind and solar to a meaningful degree.”

Across the shifting U.S. energy landscape, the strategic value of storage is widely recognized. It is seen as much as a service for grid resilience and power price stability as it is for decarbonization. Andrew Waranch, CEO of Spearmint Energy, points to this as a source of industry confidence: “So much of the power market and power price is set by expensive and old generators that only need to operate during ramp times in the morning and evening. In contrast, batteries can solve that quickly and cheaply with extremely high reliability.”

As the implications of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs become clearer, the report finds that project owners expect to be better placed to plan for risks and move their projects forward.

John Leonti, partner and chair of the Energy Department at Troutman Pepper Locke, said, “Although the impact of the OBBBA on energy storage is less severe than some feared, the ambition to onshore battery component manufacturing and the attendant Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) provisions issue significant supply challenges for the industry moving forward. The most prepared in the sector have acted nimbly to restructure supply chains, and key stakeholders are strengthening their close working relationships to share risk and collaboratively revise strategies.”

Many see reasons for continued optimism. While the energy storage sector navigates supply strain, demand for its services is set to rise sharply due to the country’s exploding load growth and aging grid infrastructure. The burgeoning data center industry requires high uptimes and short- and long-term reliability from energy providers in order to grow, making energy storage an increasingly essential solution.

However, the report also emphasizes that uncertainty remains one of the primary barriers to progress and attracting investment.

Market actors report a complicated and tumultuous chapter in the ongoing rollout of utility-scale energy storage, with a number of critical obstacles unresolved.

Foremost among these are the tariff hikes on China — the source of the majority of the world’s battery components — and compliance with FEOC rules, which exclude entities linked to adversarial nations, particularly China, from the benefits of U.S. energy tax incentives. Investors underlined the difficulty of forecasting scenarios given that the supply chain capacity needed for U.S. energy storage currently far exceeds what can realistically be manufactured domestically. Tom Cornell, CEO of BESS supplier Prevalon, described the FEOC rules as “handicapping the industry pretty significantly.”

Still, tailwinds such as robust demand for grid flexibility, supportive federal incentives, and growing bipartisan recognition of the strategic value of energy storage are helping the sector push forward. Its clear value proposition for grid reliability, economic development, and national security has meant energy storage retains an integral role in the U.S.’ energy future. For these reasons, energy storage has — and will continue to — march on.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state will not replace the federal $7,500 EV tax credit that is set to expire this month. Newsom cited the state's budget deficit and criticized Detroit's mainstream automakers for opposing California's ban on new gasoline-powered vehicles. The governor's office said California may revive an EV credit next year using funds from a carbon-trading program.

Newsom stated during a press conference in San Francisco, ""We can't make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits."" The state will support expanding EV infrastructure but will not provide direct subsidies that it cannot afford. This decision reverses an earlier pledge by Newsom to restart California's own EV subsidies.

The federal tax credit, which was part of the major tax-and-spending bill passed by Congress, is set to expire on September 30. This move ends years of federal support for EV buyers. Newsom's announcement has dashed near-term hopes among EV makers such as Rivian Automotive Inc., Hyundai Motor Co., and Volkswagen AG, which had urged the governor and state leaders to create a $5,000 EV incentive.

Newsom last year vowed that California would step in if the Trump administration followed through with campaign threats to eliminate the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. However, the governor's plan encountered difficulties due to California's budget deficit.

Newsom also took aim at Detroit's mainstream automakers, stating that General Motors Co. and its CEO, Mary Barra, ""sold us out."" This comment comes after Congress voted earlier this year to block California's ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles set to take effect in 2035.

The governor's office noted that California could still revive an EV credit next year, using funds from a carbon-trading program that boosts environmental programs. California's previous EV tax credit program ended in 2023, leaving it currently outside of a group of 17 states that currently offer some form of EV purchase tax credit, according to an August report from the nonprofit Tax Foundation.

Despite the lack of state-level incentives, California accounted for about 27% of all EV sales in the country, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. This market position made California the best alternative for EV incentives.

Renewing the incentive also has support from the California Air Resources Board, which joined five other state agencies in August to recommend that the state backfill the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs with whatever resources are available.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/kamisAssets/og-image-news-20240226.50i1a1wtwa2.png,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:48.200665

Car shopping experts report a surge in consumer demand for EVs as the deadline approaches.

Some analysts predict a significant drop in EV sales once the federal incentive is no longer available.

Car shopping experts say consumers are rushing to buy electric vehicles as the clock winds down to just seven days before the federal EV tax credit expires on Sept. 30.

But some warn that once the incentives are gone, EV sales will all but halt.

As part of the mega-tax bill signed into law in July, the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit was pushed up to Sept. 30 from its original expiration date of 2032. That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying new EV, and up to $4,000 on a used EV is closing in.

New data from car-shopping website Cars.com released on Sept. 18 showed that nearly half of consumers considering buying an EV are now accelerating their purchases. Cars.com said demand on its site is up 33% for new EVs compared with this time a year ago. And demand for used EVs is up by 22% compared with the year-ago period.

Cars.com said nearly three-fourths of consumers surveyed said the federal credit is a ""major or contributing factor"" in their decision to purchase an EV. Cars.com said it conducted the survey Aug. 25-26 and said it got 950 respondents.

Cars.com said its research showed that 70% of EV and plug-in hybrid shoppers are aware of the federal tax credit, and just over half, or 53%, know when it ends.

How long will incentives last?

The federal EV tax credit helped make EVs more affordable. While its expiration at the end of the month might slow demand in the near term, it doesn’t mean the end of affordable EVs, said Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief at Cars.com.

“Shoppers are moving quickly to lock in savings, and Cars.com’s Top EV Picks, including the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Ioniq 5, Kia EV9 and Chevrolet Equinox EV, show there are strong options for every type of buyer,"" Bragman said in a statement. ""And even after Sept. 30, deals won’t disappear — many state and local incentives remain, and automakers like Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai have already announced new lower-priced models. ”

Karl Brauer,executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said once the federal tax credit ends, EV sales are ""going to crater. It’s going to be quite the whipsaw effect. You’ve got the rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives now ... but what’s going to happen in the next three to six months? There’ll be almost no buyers.”

Brauer said EVs comprise about 8% of the total U.S. new vehicle marketshare, he expects that to drop to 1% to 3% by year's end and settle in at 4% of total marketshare by early next year.

""The consumer is going to think, 'I don’t get $7,500 off the car and it already is priced more than a gasoline vehicle ... and it loses range in cold weather so, why am I buying this car?' "" Brauer said.

Edmunds.com's Director of Insights Ivan Drury said his data also showed that as the EV tax credit deadline nears, shoppers are beginning to at least research EVs at a higher rate than all last year. He said there is still rich inventory for buyers to choose from if they do decide to go electric.

""Availability shouldn't be too much of an issue, EVs still make up 4.2% or roughly one out of every 25 pieces of inventory on dealer lots,"" Drury said, citing that data as of Sept. 21. ""This is down from the same time last year at 5.6%, but needless to say, past the 30th, there will certainly be inventory, the only question is what kind of deals will there be?""

Affordability the key to adoption

Many automakers have said the key to accelerating mass adoption of EVs is to offer more EVs for a cheaper price point, especially if the automakers are to compete with the Chinese globally for EV marketshare. The Chinese automakers are known for making high-quality and affordable EVs.

According to Cox Automotive, the average transaction price of a new EV in August was $57,245, a slight decrease of 0.1% year-over-year. The average transaction price is what car buyers paid after incentives and trade-in amounts were deducted from the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Cox Automotive said EVs carry an average price premium of $9,000 above the average transaction price of gasoline-powered vehicle.

Ford Motor Co., which saw sales of its EVs soar in August driven largely by the nation's car buyers hurrying to get ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, announced in August the creation of a new electric vehicle production system and a new EV platform that will allow the automaker to more efficiently bring several lower-cost EVs to market in the future. The first of those will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup that seats five, to launch in 2027. That vehicle is expected to be priced at about $30,000.

Dealers expect slower sales going forward

At Cox Automotive, spokesman Mark Schirmer said, ""While we don't have a shareable measure on September yet, the activity in August was strong and total new EV sales blew past the previous monthly all-time sales record by 7.5%.""

Schirmer said the previous EV sales record was in December 2024 when the industry sold about 135,000 new EVs. In August, the industry sold 146,000.

Schirmer said a majority of franchised automobile dealers, according to Cox Automotive's quarterly sentiment index, believe that the tax credits offered by the government are having ""a positive effect on EV sales at their dealership.""

But, similar to Brauer's prediction, dealers expect EV sales to halt after the incentives dry up.

When asked about expectation for EV sales three months from now, the majority of dealers expected sales to be declining, Schirmer said. He said third-quarter 2023 was the last time franchised dealers expected ""growing EV sales"" in the next three months, ""but the third-quarter 2025 score was the lowest we've ever seen.""

Last month, Cars.com said new EV inventory grew by 1.4% compared with August 2024, with Chevrolet and Honda scaling back supply due to five EV launches last year as most other brands expanded. They did not provide a figure for how many new EVs remain in inventory.

Sales of used EVs pick up

On the used side, inventory is moving faster this year — spending just 46 days on the lot in August, down from 66 days the same time a year ago, Cars.com said. Tesla, which makes up about one-third of used EV listings, saw average prices fall 16.2% year-over-year, pulling the overall used-EV average down 3.8%. A spokesman for Cars.com did not provide the average transaction price for used Tesla.

With 77 EV models now available, Cars.com’s editors identified the best EVs for 2026 looking at value, use, performance and technology and selected the following models for their range, affordability, family-friendliness and technological innovation as follows:

They’ve filed a complaint asking federal energy regulators to halt development of a $22 billion slate of proposed high-voltage electric transmission lines that would expand an existing network stretching from Kentucky to Minnesota and the Dakotas. They argue the Upper Midwest’s main power grid operator dramatically overstated the lines’ financial and environmental merits while improperly allocating their construction costs to states that say they don’t need them.

On the other side is a motley coalition of electric utilities, tech companies, agribusinesses, environmental groups, a Republican governor and a couple potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders who support the investment.

The new lines are expected to be in service by 2034, strengthening links between the windy, sunny Plains states and population centers further south and east.

The fight over the transmission lines highlights a key flashpoint in the energy sphere, as cheaper renewable energy runs headlong into a lack of transmission capacity and political hostility from Republican states.

“These improvements will save customers billions by avoiding costly inefficiencies and diversifying the market of generation resources across the region,” Gov. Tim Walz, who’s running for a third term, said in a Sept. 16 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker made similar arguments in letters earlier this month. Like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois have statutory mandates for 100% carbon-free electricity — Michigan by 2040 and Illinois by 2050. Both governors are potential 2028 presidential candidates.

Gov. Kim Reynolds of wind-rich and mandate-free Iowa also pushed back on the five utility commissions’ complaint in a Sept. 5 letter hailing her state’s “all-of-the-above energy strategy” and name-checking President Trump.

The new infrastructure “will ensure continued reliability and resilience of the electric grid not only in Iowa but also across the region,” she wrote. Killing the new transmission investments, she added, could in turn stall seven nuclear reactors’ worth of new power plants in her state “by months to even years.”

The Indiana-based nonprofit that operates the electric grid in Minnesota and parts or all of 14 other states asserts the proposed lines — collectively known as LRTP Tranche 2.1 — could pay for themselves more than three times over.

That’s more than enough to qualify them as “multi-value projects” whose costs can be spread broadly across the territory of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — known as MISO —including among ratepayers in Republican-controlled states without ambitious decarbonization goals. Stakeholders across the region had ample opportunity to weigh in on the proposed lines, a MISO spokesperson told the Reformer.

Before finalizing the tranche last year, MISO led “a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement as well as more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits,” MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said in an email.

Representing the public utility commissions of Montana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, the complainants argued that the cost allocation effectively subsidizes the development of wind and solar farms far from population centers — and, by extension, Midwestern blue states’ clean energy goals. Instead of asking Montana and North Dakota to share the burden, they said states like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois should build more clean energy and transmission within their own borders.

North Dakota’s GOP congressional delegation said much the same in a Sept. 11 letter urging regulators to grant the complaint and undo the cost allocation framework.

“The current approach to cost allocation is a subsidy scheme that alleviates certain states of the costs of their most aggressive energy policies…while out-of-state ratepayers bear the costs,” U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak and Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven wrote.

Belying the complaint, Minnesota is building plenty of clean energy on home soil. Renewables supplied 33% of the state’s electricity in 2024, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, and a state law that accelerates permitting for wind, solar and other energy infrastructure took effect in July. Solar power projects approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission since then will supply nearly a nuclear reactor’s worth of energy as they come online over the next few years.

But regardless of how it’s produced, experts say high-voltage transmission is needed to move electricity across longer distances.

“One of the key concepts of a renewables-based system is you want the grid to be bigger than the weather,” said Mike Schowalter of Fresh Energy, a St. Paul-based clean energy nonprofit.

Transmission lines built to deliver coal-fired power from North Dakota to Minnesota now catch a fair amount of wind, which supplies more than one-third of North Dakota’s electricity. North Dakota officials said during MISO’s stakeholder engagement process — before the utility commissioners’ July complaint — that they’d like to see more of that, Schowalter said.

East of the Rockies, power generally moves from west to east, but the prevailing flow often reverses during winter storms and other extreme weather events, Schowalter explained. To ensure everyone has enough power under the circumstances, utilities can either build lots of transmission and some power plants or lots of power plants and some transmission.

“The latter is far more expensive,” Schowalter said.

Building lots of new gas-fired power plants — something that’s already likely to happen as more AI data centers come online — could push up natural gas prices, Schowalter said. Because gas plants often set the local price of electricity, and fuel represents a significant fraction of their operating expenses, that means costlier power.

“The world that the complainants envision is one of more expensive electricity, and our AI industry is going to be at risk,” he said. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot.”

MISO appears to agree.

“The complaint jeopardizes the ability of MISO and its state partners to support the anticipated growth in electricity demand and would increase costs to customers within the MISO region by replacing an efficient, regional solution with a piecemeal one,” the grid operator said in a Sept. 9 filing that called the utility commissioners’ proposal “haphazard and unrealistic.”

Schowalter said a setback for Tranche 2.1 would mess with the delicate grid planning process and delay the arrival of new power plants that MISO, utilities and big customers were counting on.

Ironically, those delays could slow deployment of the the very gas plants meant to stabilize the grid as AI data centers multiply.

The Data Center Coalition, a tech industry trade group, made this point in a Sept. 9 filing.

Though Schowalter said MISO allocated less than 2% of total Tranche 2.1 costs to North Dakota and Montana, their utility commissions’ complaints make sense: They don’t want to pay at all for investments they believe benefit others.

The other three commissions’ motivations are less obvious because federal energy regulators have prevented MISO from allocating Tranche 2.1 costs across its southern region.

Colby Cook of the Louisiana Public Service Commission told the Reformer that LPSC “has always supported the MISO regional transmission planning processes” but joined the complaint for two main reasons.

The first was “the unreasonable underlying assumptions relied upon to justify these projects as (multi-value projects),” Cook said in an email. Beyond decarbonization benefits, the complaint objected to MISO’s estimates of how cost-effectively the new high-voltage lines could be built and the extent to which they would improve grid reliability and reduce the need for new power plants.

Second was the concern that Louisiana — though not currently required to pay the proposed new costs — could be on the hook later.

Legal representatives for the other four commissions did not respond to a Reformer request for comment.

Perhaps recognizing the need for a speedy resolution, the complainants themselves have asked federal regulators to expedite the complaint. It’s unclear whether the feds will agree.

In the meantime, a key piece of the Midwest’s future power grid is in limbo.

“If the complainants are successful, MISO would have to redo at least a year’s worth of work,” Schowalter said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x6831758625706.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=lMil5Ej-,N,,2025-09-23 11:02:26.755308

Constellation’s restart announcement stands as a defining moment for American nuclear power, riding a wave of public support and launching widespread commercial interest in nuclear energy to power the digital economy and strengthen grid reliability

LONDONDERRY, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.”

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, “In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power. As an all-of-the-above energy Governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear. I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians.”

Project Milestones Achieved in the Past Year

Workforce and Site Development

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain an NRC license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside significant enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and Regulatory Progress

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a dedicated Restart Panel overseeing comprehensive review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan. A video on his legacy can be viewed on our website.

Continued progress with state and local environmental agencies to secure permits for water usage and environmental protection.

Economic Impact and Community Engagement

An independent economic study confirmed the plant will result in approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, over $16 billion added to Pennsylvania’s GDP and more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

Constellation is making good on its commitment to community investment, including more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations. In 2025, the company donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Crane’s community engagement manager Dave Marcheskie has been meeting frequently with residents and community groups to gather feedback and offer philanthropic support. Follow Crane’s progress on our website and recently launched Instagram channel @CraneUnit1.

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a new model

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

US gas could lock Indonesia into fossil fuels

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

Had the four Democrats voted against Rulli’s bill, the vote would have failed in a 213-213 tie.
No jobs, no growth, no future.” The DOE’s most-recent annual coal report, released Oct. 30, 2024, showed the number of employees at U.S. coal mines increased in 2023 by 1,894 from 2022 to a total of 45,476 workers.
While coal production decreased by 2.8% year over year, the number of producing coal mines increased from 548 to 560, the DOE report states.
Also, more coal has been mined west of the Mississippi River every year since 1999, according to the DOE report.","The U.S. House approved a bill sponsored by Republican Congressman Michael Rulli to codify into law President Donald Trump’s executive order to reestablish the National Coal Council to provide advice on the industry.

The bill needed the approval of four Democrats to pass 217-209 because three Republicans voted against it.

The bill moves to the Senate for consideration.

Rulli, R-Salem, introduced the bill on April 24, 18 days after Trump, a fellow Republican, issued an executive order, called “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” The executive order included having Energy Secretary Chris Wright reinstate the 50-member National Coal Council that provides him guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets.

Members of the council represent coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders across the coal value chain, according to the Department of Energy. The council had faced criticism from environmental groups that contended it favored the interests of the coal industry over the public.

While Trump’s executive order returned the council to its advisory capacity, Rulli’s legislation would have Congress codify it into law even though its elimination wasn’t done through congressional action.

The council was established in 1984 during the Republican Ronald Reagan presidential administration to provide advice on the industry to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy.

In November 2021, the DOE, during the presidential administration of Democrat Joe Biden, allowed the council’s charter to expire rather than be renewed. Prior to that, its charter was last renewed in 2019.

Rulli’s district, with Mahoning as its most-populous county, includes several other counties with coal production facilities.

Rulli said the council is “a powerful voice for coal and a timeless champion for American workers and American communities. Coal fuels the factories, powers our homes and helped build the greatest economy this world has ever seen. It’s ridiculous to neglect this.”

All but three Republican House members – Brian K. Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Nick LaLota and Nicole Malliotakis, both of New York – voted in favor of Rulli’s bill.

All but four Democratic House members voted against it. The four Democrats who voted in support of Rulli’s bill were Sanford D. Bishop of Georgia, Donald G. Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.

Had the four Democrats voted against Rulli’s bill, the vote would have failed in a 213-213 tie.

Before the vote, Rulli called his bill “a Paul Revere moment where we are calling everyone to realize that the meltdown is coming and what I mean by that is the (power) grid is going to melt down. The grid is not stable.”

Rulli said: “Paul Revere would be turning in his grave if he saw the jeopardy that these (Democrats) are putting our country through by putting the grid up against the wall.”

Rulli added: “When they say that this is a meaningless bill, it couldn’t be further from the truth. This is a bill for national security.”

Rulli said there are seven or eight investors in his district “ready to build new coal capacity. They want to attract AI companies, data centers and data mining jobs to Ohio. But if there’s no energy, no one is coming. No jobs, no growth, no future.”

The DOE’s most-recent annual coal report, released Oct. 30, 2024, showed the number of employees at U.S. coal mines increased in 2023 by 1,894 from 2022 to a total of 45,476 workers. While coal production decreased by 2.8% year over year, the number of producing coal mines increased from 548 to 560, the DOE report states.

In 2018, there were 53,583 coal workers, according to DOE statistics.

Also, more coal has been mined west of the Mississippi River every year since 1999, according to the DOE report. Coal production expanded significantly in the West starting in the 1970s because of new emission regulations that restricted sulfur emissions with low-sulfur coal mostly found in the West, new large-scale surfacing mines in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and other areas in the West, and lower freight rail shipping costs, according to the DOE.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration released a report last week showing a 30% per capita reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2023 nationwide with Ohio having a 34% reduction primarily “because less coal was burned in the electric power sector.” But the report forecasts a 1% increase in total carbon dioxide emissions this year in part because of an increase in coal production.

A July 23 EIA analysis states: “The long-term decrease in U.S. coal consumption will temporarily reverse in 2025 primarily because of rising electricity demand and coal’s increased competitiveness in the electric power sector, which accounted for more than 90% of U.S. coal consumption in 2024.”

The EIA forecasted a 6% increase this year in coal consumption followed by a 6% decrease in 2026 because of “planned coal-power plant retirements and increasing renewable capacity coming online.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.reviewonline.com/images/2016/10/12171200/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 13:02:40.387063

Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan.","LONDONDERRY, PA (Sept. 23, 2025) – Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.”

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, “In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power. As an all-of-the-above energy Governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear. I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians.”

Project Milestones Achieved in the Past Year

Workforce and Site Development

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain an NRC license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside significant enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and Regulatory Progress

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a dedicated Restart Panel overseeing comprehensive review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan.

By Alex Mey, Owen Comstock

In our annual survey of power plant activity, we ask operators of utility-scale batteries how they are using their systems, and one use case is increasingly prevalent: price arbitrage. Arbitrage involves buying electricity when prices are relatively low and selling that electricity when prices are high.

Data values: File 3.4—Energy Storage

Utility-scale battery systems can be used for many applications. In previous years, we asked operators to identify the ways they used their batteries. Common use cases included price arbitrage as well as frequency regulation, excess wind and solar generation, system peak shaving, load management, and more.

Beginning with the 2023 survey, we asked operators to identify the primary use case for their battery system. Last year, operators responded that 66% of all utility-scale battery capacity had arbitrage among its uses and that 41% of the total capacity was primarily used for arbitrage.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Electric Generator Report

The next most common use case was frequency regulation, which was the primary usage for 24% of battery capacity. Frequency regulation involves maintaining the grid’s frequency of 60 cycles per second. In previous years, operators had reported that frequency regulation was the most common use case for their battery systems.

Much of the United States’ utility-scale battery capacity is in the two electricity markets that cover much of California and Texas. At the end of 2024, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) reported 11.7 gigawatts (GW) of battery capacity, 43% of which was primarily used for arbitrage.

Watch the full livestreamed event on Food Tank’s YouTube channel.

“You can’t really talk about climate change without talking about food waste,” says Luiz Beling, CEO of Apeel Sciences.

Speakers agreed that tackling food waste is one of the most immediately effective climate solutions that countries, communities, and individuals can implement right now.

“You get food out of landfills today, and you’re saving methane emissions within the year,” says Dana Gunders, President of ReFED, who is seeing positivity around food waste solutions from both sides of the political aisle in the United States.

“It has to be a whole of society approach…We have to press upon the leaders of the world to work together on climate,” says Jamil Ahmad, Director, New York Office, UN Environment Programme.

Multiple speakers pointed to portion sizes as a low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing food waste. Research supports this: According to Gunders, 59 percent of people surveyed say they would go to a different restaurant if it offered different portion sizes.

“The most impactful thing we can do to decrease food waste is changing portion sizes…Giving consumers options like that can enable them to make changes,” says Roni Neff, Professor at Johns Hopkins University, who researches ways to reduce food waste and address climate change through food systems.

And technology plays a big role: Harry Chrispin, Senior Manager of ESG EMEA at Hilton, uses the artificial intelligence system Winnow to track food waste in hotel kitchens automatically. With Winnow, “the previously invisible food waste in the bin is now visible, and chefs can make decisions based on that,” says Chrispin. “Just changing the way we cut fruit and portion fruit, all of these small changes can make a really big difference in food waste,” without compromising the customer experience.

Many factors influence what eaters do and don’t eat, and how they dispose of their food choices: “We make at least 200 different food decisions in a day. Many of them you don’t know you’re making,” says Caleb McClennan, President of RARE. This creates opportunities throughout each day to make positive change. But while small changes like composting and repurposing leftovers and scraps are important tools for change, consumers should also go easy on themselves, says U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree.

“You’re not going to be perfect every day of the week,” says Rep. Pingree. “But the things that you do at home…changing our habits and getting into new habits…all of these things are important to do.”

Eaters can also look to their freezers to help make small but meaningful changes to reduce food waste at home.

“Take advantage of your freezer,” says Alison Bodor, President and CEO of the American Frozen Food Institute. “Whether that’s freezing your own leftovers or buying resealable packages. Be part of the solution because it will take all of us.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Dexter, MD, says that consumers should not forget the power of their voices: “Consumer behavior needs to drive the changes,” she says. “If we are demanding it, it’s easier for people like me to pass the laws.”

“As someone who represents about 800,000 people, getting that outreach really drives our perspective. Reaching out to your elected leaders, sharing what you want—even if you know they’re not aligned—is really important,” says Rep. Dexter. “Americans need to demand better from their government. Politicians need to demand more from themselves.”

Stacy Blondin, Behavioral Science Associate at the World Resources Institute, emphasizes that while there is a significant consumer will to reduce waste, eaters need support from the government, nonprofit, and private sectors. “A large percentage of Americans are already motivated to reduce food waste, but we need these underlying societal support systems” that will enable people to make meaningful change, says Blondin.

The Summit’s conversations continually turned to collaborations as an effective way to amplify change across sectors.

“Co-developing together a solution is truly energizing and powerful. Your coworkers have the answers and power; they meet the customers every day,” says Lorena Lourido Gomez, Head of IKEA Food, IKEA Retail Services, Ingka.

“Nobody really wants to waste food. People are looking for advice on how to do that,” says David Rogers, Director of International Development at WRAP. “And if you can reach people through the cities they live in or the shops they go to, you can really reach everyone.”

Michael Grunwald, Food & Climate Columnist at Canary Media and also a Contributing Writer for The New York Times Opinion, left the audience with a simple call to action for eaters:

“Eat less beef, waste less food. I can give you 50 things to do, and the other 48 combined wouldn’t have as much impact as that,” says Grunwald. And “right now, food waste is an area where we can actually make progress.”

Among other things, the act also established the REACH program, which automatically discounts energy bills for low- and moderate-income ratepayers in disadvantaged communities through NYPA’s renewable energy sales.
New York will likely only achieve around 45% to 61% renewable energy by 2030, a 2023 Strategen report said.
To get this number to 70%, Strategen said NYPA will have to construct and connect between 7 GW and 20 GW renewable energy projects by 2030.

Rallied by New York City mayoral candidate and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, NYPA received more than 6,100 public comments in response to building the 15 GW of public renewables.

Madani was a strong supporter of the Build Public Renewables Act, which tasked state utility New York Power Authority (NYPA) with leading the state’s progress toward reaching a state mandate for 70% renewable energy by 2030, per the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. To do this, the Build Public Renewables Act granted NYPA the power to build and operate its own renewable projects so that it can step in to build enough clean energy to get the state back on track to reach 70% renewable energy by 2030.

Last month NYPA doubled the total renewable energy capacity from its inaugural plan after receiving public backlash over the 3.3 GW it initially proposed.

“That outside power that we built is how we were able to force the state to double its initial plans,” said Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes (D). “15 GW [of renewables] means shutting down the state’s most polluting plants, the peaker plants, 5 years sooner. It means lower bills for New Yorkers. This is not just an environmental issue, but it is a racial issue.”’

NYPA closed its public comment period for its updated Renewables Updated Strategic Plan and the overwhelming majority of comments said the same: NYPA must build 15 GW of public renewable energy by 2030. “Increasing the plan to 7 GW is a step forward, but it remains a half-measure in the face of increasing climate devastation,” thousands of public comments wrote.

Under the Build Public Renewables Act, NYPA must supply customers with 70% renewable energy by 2030. New York also must have:

10 GW of distributed solar 2030 (currently 68% achieved at 6.7 GW installed);

6 GW of energy storage by 2030 (currently 7% achieved with 445 MW installed); and

9 GW of offshore wind by 2035.

Among other things, the act also established the REACH program, which automatically discounts energy bills for low- and moderate-income ratepayers in disadvantaged communities through NYPA’s renewable energy sales. It also requires NYPA to work with climate, union and community groups to create biennial plans on building public renewables, with a 60-day comment period for each plan.

New York acknowledged last summer it would likely fail to meet its 70% mandate by 2030.

“This is a life or death issue for children across the state,” Sen. Jabari Brisport (D) said.

Public Power NY said New York “relies on profoundly unrealistic projections of how much capacity is on track to come online.” Since the Climate Act passed in 2019, progress toward achieving 70% renewables by 2030 has been dire, Public Power NY said.

New York will likely only achieve around 45% to 61% renewable energy by 2030, a 2023 Strategen report said. To get this number to 70%, Strategen said NYPA will have to construct and connect between 7 GW and 20 GW renewable energy projects by 2030. According to Public Power NY, if New York can add almost 4 GW of renewable energy in the next six months, it can add enough generation to achieve its mandate.

Much of the New York City residents’ outcry for more renewable generation stem from the city’s many peaker plants, most of which are more than 50 years old.

New York City ratepayers have paid gas peaker plant owners an estimated $4.5 billion in capacity payments over the past decade to keep peakers online in case they may be needed.

The Climate Act directed peaker plants to be phased out as it progressed toward its renewable energy targets. but its ambition turned sluggish in bringing the projects to operation. Now the state has been forced to hold off on closing many of the fossil-fuel peaker plants spread around the city.

New York has about 7.2 GW of solar capacity installed across the state, representing less than 0.07% of the state’s electricity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. New York is ranked 48th per capita for its utility-scale solar.

Not only does New York City have a notable number of peaker plants, but most of them are more than 50 years old, so they emit even higher levels of pollutants relative to the electricity they generate.

Not to mention, rising electric costs. Replacing NYPA’s fossil-fuel plants with renewables by 2030 could save New Yorkers up to $1.2 billion through 2050 compared to fossil-fuel plant operation, according to Public Power NY.

In 2022, NYPA commissioned a study to determine the feasibility and economics of replacing its gas-fired peaker plants with renewable generation. The study found each of its plants could either be completely replaced, or almost completely replaced with 4-hour energy storage.

Residents from Long Island were opposed to more battery energy storage systems, however, demanding the systems in their community be mandated to have at least a five-mile buffer from residential and commercial districts on the island, which is about 23 miles at its widest point.

Most comments, however, did not share this opposition.

“One hundred years from now people are going to look back at this time period and be absolutely flabbergasted that we dragged our feet for so long towards this obvious truth,” Maria Huff said in a public comment. “Change is tough and it’s not always easy or cheap but it’s necessary.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Credit-Ken-Schles-1-1200x800.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 12:06:54.043607

These kinds of home improvement projects will pad your wallet in the long run and also make your house more resilient as rising global temperatures threaten communities around the world. More frequent and severe extreme weather events are one consequence of the changing climate, and that leads to power outages and increases strain on the electric grid. Clean energy solutions bolster neighborhoods and cut the production of heat-trapping gases that drive these shifts, as well as unstable dirty energy prices.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack, slashing your energy costs to or near $0. Like LG, EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted contractors, helping you save up to $10,000 on a solar system.

It's Not As Rosy[ 1 ], its broader financial performance reveals a mixed picture. This analysis examines Volvo's capital allocation strategies and their implications for long-term shareholder value, highlighting both the opportunities and risks inherent in its U.S. EV expansion.

Capital Allocation Strategies: Local Production and Cost Optimization

Volvo's approach to the U.S. EV market hinges on two pillars: localized production to mitigate tariff impacts and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The company has announced a $1.86 billion (SEK 18 billion) cost and cash action plan to offset financial pressures, including U.S. tariffs and development delaysHow U.S. Tariffs and EV Delays Caused a 64% Profit Crash at Volvo[ 2 ]. A key component of this strategy involves shifting production to its U.S. facilities, particularly in South Carolina. By 2026, Volvo will begin manufacturing its best-selling XC60 model at the Ridgeville plant, a move designed to avoid tariffs on imported vehicles and reduce costsVolvo Shifts to US Production Amid Tariffs, CEO Warns[ 3 ].

The South Carolina plant, which has already received $1.3 billion in investments over the past decadeVolvo to build its most popular car in Ridgeville[ 4 ], will also introduce a next-generation hybrid model by 2030 to cater to U.S. market preferences. This dual focus on electrification and hybrid technologies reflects Volvo's adaptability to regulatory and consumer dynamics.

The future of Texas data center development is somewhat contingent on the availability of power and water.
Texas data centers used nearly 22 million MWh of electricity in 2023, 4.6 per cent of the state’s electricity consumption.
In a state that often faces drought conditions, this could set up conflicts between proposed data centers and agricultural and industrial users and residential communities.","The Texas construction industry has lots of work to look forward to, according to analysis by Twisted Nail, a Texas-based construction aggregate supplier.

The company analyzed national and state-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau and found that today, Texas leads the nation in commercial construction spending at nearly $90 billion annually. That’s more than double any other state.

The continued vitality of the state’s construction industry is fueled by federal incentives, low state taxes, manufacturing investments and population growth, with clean energy, semiconductor and advanced manufacturing projects accounting for much of that activity.

Further goods news comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics which projects job growth of 5.8 per cent for skilled trade workers through to 2034, and even higher levels for other construction workers. This is encouraging given how construction employment has flat lined across the country over the past six months to August.

The boom in data center development is a particularly bright star for Texas construction.

One of the largest and most interesting data facilities planned is the 50,000-acre data center hub near Laredo, dubbed “Data City, Texas,” announced by Houston-based Energy Abundance Development Corporation this past March.

“Data City offers a unique solution, achieving the holy grail of hyperscalers’ clean energy ambitions, delivering low-cost 100 per cent 24/7 green energy at scale,” the company said in a news release.

Although powered initially by Texas-produced natural gas, Data City proposes to shift to green hydrogen sourced from the company’s adjacent 2TWh Hydrogen City salt dome storage facility. Wind, solar and batteries are also part of the plan. In this way, Data City will be fully self-powering and isolated from ERCOT, the state’s energy utility.

Data City will be built in phases, with the first 300 MW and one-million-square-feet of data center space set to launch in 2026, and could expand quickly to 5 GW and over 15-million-square-feet of leasable space, the announcement says.

Even more ambitious is a $300 billion AI campus near Amarillo, Texas, called HyperGrid, planned by Fermi America. If plans move forward, the 18-million-square-foot facility could generate 11 GW of IT capacity, powered by a combination of natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear energy, making it the world’s largest energy and data complex.

Texas is getting a good piece of the $375 billion estimated by investment bank UBS that will be spent globally in 2025 on AI infrastructure. As much as $500 billion of data center investments are projected in 2026 and an estimated $3 trillion by 2028. In fact, nearly 20 data center projects are underway or planned in the Austin area alone.

Smaller rural communities become excited about the economic prospects surrounding new data centers proposed for their area. But while massive data centers mean short term construction jobs and add revenue to local municipal tax rolls, the longer-term employment picture is not as rosy. Completed data centers don’t require a high number of long-term workers.

As reported in the Wall Street Journal, some 1,500 people, including site workers, electricians and engineers, are involved in the construction of Stargate Project’s data center covering 1,100 acres near Abilene, Texas. The Abilene facility is part of the $500 billion nationwide AI infrastructure venture involving OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and the investment firm MGX.

However, Abilene’s economic development agency says the Stargate facility will hire only about 100 full-time employees, a fraction of the number of people who might work in a similarly-sized commercial development like an office park, factory or warehouse.

Nevertheless, the booming data center market is good news for the building industry should other areas of construction in Texas take a pause due to economic uncertainty.

Even if all the planned facilities don’t get built, data center expansion is likely to continue due to demand.

According to Jones Lang LaSalle, a global commercial real estate and investment management company, vacancy rates in existing data centers are at a record low of 2.3 per cent nationwide and virtually zero in Texas. Strong preleasing through 2027 is expected to keep vacancy rates at low levels.

However, it isn’t all clear sailing. The future of Texas data center development is somewhat contingent on the availability of power and water.

Texas data centers used nearly 22 million MWh of electricity in 2023, 4.6 per cent of the state’s electricity consumption. ERCOT projects that by 2031, the state grid will need to more than double its 2024 capacity, mainly due to the growth of data centers. This suggests the importance of new data centers having some self-powering capability.

What is even more challenging is the water supply required to cool processing servers, amounting to millions of gallons every day for each facility. In a state that often faces drought conditions, this could set up conflicts between proposed data centers and agricultural and industrial users and residential communities.

Building new data centers may be critical to the future success of the state’s construction industry. However, the limited long-term, large scale employment potential, alongside the required power generation and water supply demands, present complex realities that need to be recognized over the coming years.",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Inside-data-center-uncreditedMainWEB-US-01.png,N,,2025-09-23 11:02:06.388130

After talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the two leaders have made a bilateral trade agreement targeting nuclear power development to meet the energy demands of AI infrastructure.

The Tech Prosperity Deal, unveiled by President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, positions nuclear energy as the backbone for powering AI data centres.

Keir Starmer describes the agreement as a “landmark nuclear partnership” that would power economic growth, saying the commitments would set Britain “well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.”

Google, Nvidia and Microsoft have also committed to expanding UK operations as part of the broader agreement.

Why nuclear power?

AI data centres consume hundreds of megawatts of power continuously to run the parallel processing systems that enable machine learning (ML) applications.

Chris Wright, the US Energy Secretary, frames nuclear power as essential for supporting America’s AI ambitions.

He says that America has been looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution.

“Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”

The partnership promises to slash regulatory red tape through the UK-US Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, which aims to halve licensing times to approximately two years.

Both countries will accept each other’s safety assessments, eliminating duplicative approval processes that have historically slowed nuclear deployment.

Why the nuclear push will be at a former coal plant

The centrepiece of the nuclear push is an ambitious US$11bn project at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire.

Nuclear technology company Holtec International will partner with EDF Energy and property developer Tritax to build small modular reactors specifically designed for AI data centres.

These smaller nuclear units produce between 50 and 300 megawatts of power, compared with traditional plants that generate over 1,000 megawatts.

The modular approach allows components to be manufactured in factories and transported to sites, potentially reducing both construction times and costs.

EDF Energy, which operates Britain’s existing nuclear fleet and supplies electricity to 5.8 million customers, sees the partnership as its entry into next-generation nuclear technologies targeting AI infrastructure.

Meanwhile, nuclear startup Last Energy will team up with ports operator DP World to develop micro-modular plants at the London Gateway port and business park, where automated cargo systems require reliable power.

Ed Miliband, the UK’s Energy Secretary, says: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the US to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.”

The promise of thousands of new jobs

Beyond the headline projects, energy supplier Centrica will partner with reactor developer X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool.

The project could create 2,500 jobs in England’s North East, where traditional heavy industries have declined.

The Hartlepool facility alone is expected to generate enough electricity to power 1.5 million homes.

By 2028, the new reactors could collectively provide up to 6 gigawatts of power across the UK – matching the country’s current nuclear output.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/cb07a9369b5485698aa27a0263963fed:a89409712449ba76344d3b50347516d6/54354197632-dc2a4f2c65-b.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:36.780266

BISHOPVILLE, S.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–#RECs–Ever.green today announced their support for a 28-megawatt (MW) solar project in Lee County, South Carolina, enabled through a long-term purchase of High-Impact Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) by Wells Fargo, proving that corporate energy buyers can tangibly accelerate the deployment of new clean energy projects. The solar installation, developed by Headwater Energy, will generate approximately 50,000 MWh of electricity annually—enough to power 3,000 homes.

“High-Impact RECs are making it easier for companies to directly support new, impactful projects,” said Cris Eugster, CEO of Ever.green. “This project is a powerful example of how forward-thinking buyers can accelerate the energy transition while advancing grid resilience.”

Ever.green’s High-Impact RECs are renewable energy certificates sourced from yet-built clean energy projects via long-term, fixed-price forward contracts that are material to the project’s financeability. Projects are selected for their ability to maximize climate impact, minimize environmental harm, and deliver social benefits.

The Bishopville project uses low-carbon, domestically manufactured solar panels, helping to create new U.S. manufacturing jobs while strengthening the domestic energy supply chain. The panels use thin-film technology, which performs well in hot and humid climates, and they are both sustainably constructed and designed to be recycled at their end-of-life.

A comprehensive environmental assessment of the project ensured compliance with biodiversity and land use protections, including the safeguarding of wetlands and floodplains through best management practices. Non-reflective panels and habitat preservation efforts have helped minimize impacts on 12 migratory bird species. At the end of its useful life, the site will be fully restored with native vegetation to preserve local ecosystems.

Astroelectricity: America’s national energy security imperative

In July, President Donald J. Trump announced a trade deal with the European Union (EU) in which they will purchase $750 billion of US energy resources over the next three years. At a price of $60 per barrel of oil, this would buy about 12.5 billion barrels of American oil. In terms of energy content, this would roughly equal one year’s worth of consumption of oil and natural gas used in America. With the presumption that this purchase will predominantly be oil and natural gas, it would substantially increase the demand on US oil and natural gas production—and this is without adding any other exports such as to Japan, South Korea, and China.

If oil and natural gas were renewable energy sources, this would be a tremendously beneficial trade deal. Recognizing that the geopolitics surrounding this trade deal is very complicated, it is important to recognize that exporting American oil and natural gas accelerates the depletion of affordable supplies of these non-sustainable fuels—the very fuels of which just a generation earlier, America was dangerously short of.

Periodically, the US Geological Survey publishes estimates of the amount of “technically recoverable” coal, oil, and natural gas remaining in the US. Technically recoverable means that portion of the remaining identified in situ resources that “can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices.” Importantly, market price is not a consideration in determining how much technically recoverable resources remain.

Figure 1: US technically recoverable crude oil and dry natural gas resources as of 1 January 2020. The energy unit “BOE” is an abbreviation for barrels of oil equivalent. References: US Energy Information Administration National Energy Modeling System’s Oil and Gas Supply Module, Tables 1 and 2, dated March 2022.

Oil and natural gas now supply about 70% of the total energy used in America. Based on the pre-COVID-19 use of these two fuels—and prior to these recent trade deals—at the 2019 consumption rate of 12 billion BOE, the technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources would last about 75 years. Should US oil and natural gas exports be substantial and ongoing, then this lifetime estimate would obviously be shorter—perhaps, much shorter! Within the lifetime of today’s young children, these vital energy resources will likely be exhausted, leaving America dangerously energy insecure.

Figure 2: The late-1973 oil embargo caused shortages of gasoline. To moderate demand, rationing was implemented in the form of odd and even number days, based on the number in the license plate, when gasoline could be bought.

America has been down that dangerous road before. In 1970, after 111 years of generally steadily growing production, conventional US oil production peaked, making America oil insecure. Within three years, America’s first oil supply crisis hit when some Middle East nations attempted to squeeze the US president to align with their foreign policy priorities. That crisis dramatically increased oil prices and caused a substantial US recession.

Figure 3: History of US domestic oil production and imports from 1900-2023 with the author’s illustration of the likely decline of conventional oil production through 2100.

Within a decade, as America’s oil insecurity grew to the point that America was importing over half of the oil used, President Jimmy Carter declared protecting American access to foreign oil a national security priority. Within another decade, America was engaged in full-out conventional warfare in the Middle East to protect US access. It took nearly another 30 years for the US to finally be rescued —yes, rescued—from that quagmire by the practicable technological breakthrough of guided drilling and hydraulic fracturing known as “fracking.”

The US Department of Energy (DOE) was formed in 1977 by President Carter. He consolidated several existing federal agencies—many arising out of the Manhattan Project and civil nuclear power—into a department level organization focused on energy conservation and renewable energy sources, with a “side hustle” of managing much of the government’s nuclear weapon and nuclear power activities. (None of which have proven to reduce America’s persistent conventional oil insecurity.) Yet, buried deep in that organization when it was formed was federal research and development financial support for what became the fracking that rescued America three decades later and has now enabled the world to enter a period of energy insecurity dormancy led by the US.

The chart above shows the history of US domestic oil production. Specifically, the chart shows the sustained rise in production of conventional oil wells until the peak in 1970 followed by the decline that is still underway. This bell-shaped production curve is representative of all natural resources in demand. It was seen in the production of both wood fuel and coal in the US. Hence, we know that it will repeat with the production of fracked oil and natural gas.

As everyone should acknowledge, fracking is only a “band-aid” fix to America’s need to be permanently energy secure. Knowing this, it is only common sense that the US Department of Energy should have (by now) established a national energy security strategy to undertake America’s orderly transition to sustainable energy before, once again, America becomes energy insecure. However, this has not happened, even as the necessity for America undertaking this transition has been readily apparent for decades.

Responding to this need, I began to quantitatively model America’s energy use and evaluate its sustainable energy transition needs in 2008. Over the years, I have refined my analysis. In 2022, I summarized my findings in an article here in 2022. (See “Evaluating America’s green energy options including astroelectricity (part 1)”, The Space Review, November 14, 2022.) Recently, I updated and published my analytical assessment on ResearchGate. In this article, I summarize my updated results to reemphasize the point that pursuing the development of space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity should now be America’s (and DOE’s) national energy security imperative.

What will it take for America to “go clean”

The failed Green New Deal efforts make very clear that successfully transitioning to sustainable energy is not a trivial undertaking. Difficulties arise in two areas. First, the type of sustainable energy must be able to be scaled up sufficiently to make a difference. Second, the implementation of the solution must provide an orderly transition path while being practicable to be built. To better understand these two considerations, I will begin by explaining how much total energy America now needs and then show the equivalent amount of entirely sustainable energy needed for America to “go clean.”

America’s current energy use

The starting point is to refresh our understanding of pertinent energy units. For the use of primary combustible fuels in America —coal, oil, and natural gas—the primary energy unit is the British Thermal Unit (BTU). This unit originated two centuries ago to aid in designing steam engines. A BTU is the amount of thermal energy (heat) needed to raise one pound (16 fluid ounces) of water by one degree Fahrenheit. For perspective, when heating 16 fluid ounces of tap water to make tea, around 130 BTU of heat must be used. A BOE is defined as having 5.8 million BTUs of thermal energy.

For the following discussions, I use America’s energy use in 2019 as the baseline. That was the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic when the impact of the pandemic and later national energy policy changes suppressed energy use. Thus, in terms of per-person energy use, the 2019 value indicates what is needed during generally prosperous economic times.

Reflecting the fact that fossil carbon fuels still predominate US energy use, America’s national energy use is often reported using a unit called the “Quad”. This is an abbreviation for 1 quadrillion BTUs or 1 × 1015 BTUs. The chart below shows America’s sources of energy and how energy use “flows” through the US economy. In 2019, according to this chart, America used 100.2 Quads of energy from all sources. Coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas provided about 80 Quads or 80% of the primary energy, with just oil and natural gas providing nearly 70 Quads. Further, electricity use consumed about 37 Quads or 37% of the primary energy.

Figure 4: Diagram of how the sources of energy used in the US, shown on the left, “flow” through America’s economy to yield the goods and services consumed. Essentially, this entire energy flow needs to be made sustainable.

One Quad equals 172.4 million BOE. Thus, from the above chart, the 100.2 Quads used in 2019 equaled 17.3 billion BOE, with the petroleum and natural gas consumption supplying nearly 12 billion BOE—the value shown in the earlier Figure 1 table.

An oil supertanker will carry two to three million barrels. Thus, in 2019, Americans used the equivalent of around 7,000 supertankers of oil—nearly one supertanker worth of energy every hour of every day. Of these, four of every five supertankers would be non-sustainable energy that must be replaced by new sustainable energy sources. Supplying 10–12 million BOE of new sustainable energy every day illustrates the challenge that America must solve to undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy. Clearly, this will require a well-developed “engineering” solution, not an impractical political solution as has been tried for the past several decades.

America’s possible sustainable energy source options

Figure 5: The four possible sustainable energy sources that are sufficiently scalable to substantially replace fossil carbon fuels.

While there are many possible sources of terrestrial sustainable energy for America to use, biomass, hydroelectricity, geothermal electricity, and wave- and tidal-generated electrical power cannot be scaled up to become a primary source of sustainable energy to replace fossil carbon fuels. This leaves only wind power, ground solar power, and nuclear fission power as the remaining terrestrial options for America to possibly use to “go clean.” For this assessment, I added the option of SSP-supplied astroelectricity. Wind power and ground solar power are, obviously, intermittent power sources while nuclear fission power and astroelectricity are baseload power sources, meaning that they are assumed in this assessment to be able to operate continuously.

American current per person use of energy

The starting point to determine how much sustainable electrical energy America will need to go clean is to start with America’s current average energy use per person—specifically per resident. Using updated consumption and population values for 2019, the following chart shows how much energy per person was used on average and how this was consumed in the form of electrical energy and fuels.

In 2019, 12,545.8 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy and 31.1 BOE of fuels were used per person on average. In total, the equivalent of 50.584 BOE of energy was used per person. (By using the BOE unit, this provides an appreciation of how much energy is actually being used per person in America today.)

Figure 6: US average total energy used per person in 2019 showing the breakdown into electrical energy and fuels use.

Introducing two new energy units

In America’s new sustainable energy infrastructure, electrical energy will be the primary type of sustainable energy used. The two electrical energy units used that will replace the BTU and BOE are the kilowatt-hour (kWh) and the gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, with kWh and GWh not having any real world physical meaning—as the BTU and BOE do—two new energy units are needed to help appreciate how much sustainable electrical energy will be needed per person and nationally.

From the above chart, 12,545.8 kWh of electrical energy was used on average per person in 2019. This was the electricity used directly (e.g., air conditioning) as well as that used to produce the goods and services consumed. There are 8,760 hours in a year. Thus, 12,545.8 kWh ÷ 8,760 hours = 1.43 kW of electrical power being used continuously throughout the year, on average. We can conveniently express 12,545.8 kWh as 1.43 kW-continuous or 1.43 kWc.

A typical microwave oven uses 1 kW of power when operating. Thus, in 2019, each American consumed enough electricity to operate 1.43 microwave ovens continuously. We can think of the per person electrical energy use in terms of microwave ovens just as we thought of the total energy use in terms of the barrel of oil equivalent.

In 2019, the US used 4,130,574 GWh of total electrical energy, or 472 GW continuous, GWc. The Hoover Dam can generate 2 GW when operating at full power. If the Hoover Dam could operate continuously, it would be rated at 2 GWc. We can use this to express the 472 GWc generated in 2019 as being equivalent to 236 Hoover Dams operating continuously.

When mentioning that the US was generating the equivalent of 472 GW of continuous power, most people would have little appreciation of how much energy that was. However, if this is stated as the US was producing the equivalent of 236 Hoover Dams operating continuously, this can readily be understood. Just as I will use the number of microwave ovens operating continuously to illustrate how much clean energy will be needed per person, the number of Hoover Dams operating continuously will be used to illustrate how much total sustainable energy for America will need to go clean.

Figure 7: A microwave oven and the Hoover Dam are used to provide a perspective on how much sustainable energy America will need per person and nationally to “go clean”.

(Note: Before continuing, take a guess at how many Hoover Dams operating continuously would be needed for America to fully transition to sustainable energy.)

Modeling America’s needed new sustainable energy infrastructure

Figure 8: Diagram of the model used to estimate the total primary sustainable electrical power (kWc) needed to go clean.

The sustainable energy transition model I used is shown in the diagram above. The complexity of energy use in America—as shown earlier in the energy flow diagram—and the need for carbon-based fuels and industrial feedstocks makes an all-electric or an electric-hydrogen energy infrastructure impracticable to use. Therefore, in this model, both clean hydrogen and CO₂-neutral (clean) carbon fuels are supplied to replace the use of fossil carbon fuels. By producing clean carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks, the transition from the use of fossil carbon fuels to an entirely sustainable energy infrastructure is seamless, making it generally transparent to the end-users. This is what I call an “orderly” transition.

(Note: All carbon used to produce synthetic carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks comes from the CO₂ either extracted from the atmosphere or captured in the exhaust of industrial plants, power plants, and waste disposal incinerators. In this manner, no net CO₂ is added to the atmosphere. This is necessary for undertaking an orderly transition to sustainable energy.)

I used this model to estimate the total primary sustainable electrical power (kWc) needed per person to supply 12,545.8 kWh of sustainable dispatched electrical power and 31.1 BOE of sustainable fuels. This model was run separately using only intermittent primary power and then using only baseload power.

(Note: For this top-level estimate of sustainable energy needs, only synthetic methane is assumed to be produced to supply the needed replacement fuels.)

America’s total kWc and GWc needed to have already “gone clean” in 2019

Figure 9: Estimated total kWh of primary electrical energy and kWc of primary electrical power needed per person on average in the US in 2019 to have already transitioned to sustainable energy.

Recall that in 2019, the average end-user, directly and indirectly, used 1.43 kWc of utility-dispatched electrical power. This was generated using 38.5% of the total energy used. If all energy consumed had been used to generate electricity, then the total would have been 3.71 kWc.

From the above table, to transition fully to sustainable energy using the baseload-methane case, 16.47 kWc would be needed per person. Thus, for the baseload-methane case, America’s new sustainable energy infrastructure needs to supply roughly 4.4 times more energy per person. When using intermittent sources, this increases to 21.14 kWc, 5.7 times more energy. Using the microwave oven metaphor, the energy need increases from about 4 microwave ovens to about 16 for the baseload case and about 21 for the intermittent case. Hopefully, this is making clear the magnitude of the challenge of America successfully transitioning from fossil carbon fuels.

Figure 10: Comparison of the total GWc of primary electrical power needed in 2019 along with the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously to supply that power.

The total GWc needed for America to have already transitioned to sustainable energy can easily be calculated by multiplying the above table’s kWc values by the US 2019 resident population. These results, along with the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously, are shown in the table above. When using baseload primary power, the equivalent of 2,476 two-gigawatt Hoover Dams operating continuously, supplying 5,424 GWc of electrical power, would have been needed. For the intermittent case, this increases to the equivalent of 3,481 Hoover Dams supplying 6,962 GWc.

Was your guess anywhere near this number?

(Note: The 2019 resident population used was about 329 million. Each additional million adds the need for 7.5 additional Hoover Dams operating continuously.)

Assessing America’s four possible scalable sustainable power options

As noted earlier, America has only four possible sufficiently scalable options to enable its transition to sustainable energy. The intermittent options are wind power and ground solar power, while the baseload options are nuclear fission power and space solar power-supplied astroelectricity. In my assessment, I examined each to determine if it was a practicable solution at the scale needed to fully meet the GWc need.

Wind power

Figure 11: Possible wind farm locations in the contiguous US for wind turbines with a hub height of 110 meters.

The above map was created by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as part of their assessment of the wind power potential in the contiguous US. The blue areas are where commercial wind farms could be built with the darker blue areas where the annual wind energy potential is greatest.

The NREL study found that about five million square kilometers (1.9 million square miles) of the contiguous United States could be used to build commercial wind farms. Building out this extent of wind power would require installing about 7.7 million wind turbines on nearly two-thirds of the contiguous US.

Figure 12: This chart summarizes the author’s analysis of the NREL assessment of the wind power potential in the contiguous US. It shows how the total GWc available increases as more of the land area is used for wind farms, beginning with those areas with the greatest wind power potential.

From my assessment’s results—shown in the chart above—such extensive use of commercial wind farms could yield 4,756 GWc of intermittent primary electrical power in an average wind power year. Recall that 6,692 GWc of such intermittent primary power would have been needed in 2019. Thus, in an average year, the available wind power is only 68% of what the US would have needed to transition fully to sustainable energy. In a low wind power year, this drops to 3,805 GWc, or only 55% of what would have been needed. Obviously, wind power alone is not a practicable solution since the American public is unlikely to accept covering America with a forest of wind turbines, especially without yielding a full sustainable energy solution.

Ground solar power

While obviously there is sufficient land in the contiguous United States on which to build ground solar farms, how much land would be needed? By my estimate, to supply 6,692 GWc of intermittent primary power, about 14% of the contiguous United States would need to be converted into ground solar farms. In total, the required land area, within the perimeter fence, would be 1.1 million square kilometers (420,000 square miles). As shown in the map below, this is equivalent to a square of land 1,045 kilometers on each side.

Figure 13: Representative total area of ground solar farms needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need overlaid on a terrain map of the contiguous US.

As the map above shows, a large percentage of the contiguous United States is unsuitable for ground solar farms due to terrain, especially in the sunny Southwest. Also, suitable locations for commercial solar farms require generally flat land and a location that has generally sunny skies—essentially the same requirements needed for large-scale agriculture. Thus, while needing only 14% of the total contiguous land area may not at first appear unreasonable, ground solar farms would need to be built across much of America’s breadbasket states. This is unlikely to be politically acceptable as well as being unacceptable from a food-security perspective.

Hence, as with wind power, ground solar power alone is NOT a practicable means of enabling America to transition to sustainable energy. In fact, a combination of wind power and ground solar power is also not a practicable solution as it still requires a coast-to-coast forest of turbines while only cutting the required land area for solar farms in half.

Nuclear fission power

With wind and ground solar power not enabling America to undertake a practicable transition to sustainable energy, the only remaining terrestrial option is nuclear fission power. As noted previously, the baseload-methane case would require 5,424 GWc of primary electrical power. This equates to 5,641 GW of nameplate power with the assumption that each plant would not be generating power for two weeks each year to undertake maintenance, inspection, and refueling. For perspective, the US currently has around 100 GW of nuclear power generation capacity. To fully meet the baseload sustainable energy need using only nuclear fission power, about 56 times more nuclear generation capacity would be needed.

As has been recognized since the 1950s, with natural uranium only having 0.72% of the U-235 fissile fuel needed by the reactors, breeding is needed to undertake a substantial expansion of nuclear fission power. It is estimated that about 1.2 metric tonnes of fissile fuel are needed per GW-year of generation. Thus, to fully meet the US sustainable energy need, 6,509 metric tonnes of either Pu-239 or U-233 would need to be bred each year. For perspective, from 1945 until it ended breeding in 1987, the government’s Hanford plant only produced a total of 67.4 metric tonnes of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons and to power naval reactors.

While nuclear breeding reactors were pursued in the 1960s and early 1970s, by the end of the 1970s, these were abandoned due to worries about nuclear weapon proliferation as both Pu-239 and U-233 can be used to produce nuclear weapons. Further, no enrichment is needed as with U-235. Thus, nuclear breeder reactors could covertly—or defiantly, by a rogue nation—be used to produce fissile materials to make nuclear weapons. Should the United States establish a precedent for using nuclear breeder reactors to transition to sustainable energy, this will most certainly open the door for uncontrollable nuclear weapon proliferation worldwide.

Figure 14: An already built naval reactor was used to speed up the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Plant.

In the 1950s, the US advocated for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The first civilian nuclear power plant was built at Shippingport, Pennsylvania. An unneeded US Navy 60-megawatt (MW) reactor, developed for an aircraft carrier, was installed in 1956 as shown in the photograph above. The plant began to generate electrical power the next year.

This particular reactor bred fuel while producing power. During its 25 years of operation, it first bred Pu-239 and, later, was modified to breed U-233. However, doing this required a special core of weapons-grade U-235 to breed Pu-239 with a similar approach used to breed U-233. This effort spurred interest in the 1960s and early 1970s in developing more advanced breeding power reactors—efforts that were abandoned by the end of the 1970s.

The Shippingport Atomic Power Plant illustrates why there is current interest in building new nuclear fission power plants using smaller “modular” reactors. The intent is to reduce the construction cost and shorten the plant’s construction time by powering it with one or more smaller reactors that can be built on an assembly line and then installed in the plant as was done with the naval reactor. To achieve the US total GWc need, the chart below shows how many of such small modular reactors in the range of 100–500 megawatts would be needed.

Figure 15: Number of small modular reactors needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need as a function of the reactor nameplate power generation rating.

Naval reactors typically have an operating life of about 30 years. Thus, the small modular reactors will have a finite life perhaps in the range of 30 to 60 years. At the end of their life—when the reactor would likely be highly radioactive—each would need to be decommissioned, removed from the power plant, and transported to where they would be finally (somehow) rendered no longer a radioactive hazard to humanity.

While this sounds straightforward, when the Shippingport reactor was decommissioned and removed in the late 1980s, to render it safe for transport, the reactor pressure vessel and its steel and concrete filled surrounding radiation shield weighed 870 metric tonnes. It required a 320-wheel trailer to transport it the short distance to the Ohio River to be loaded aboard a special oceangoing barge for transport down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and then by sea to Washington state where it was entombed—meaning it is probably still there. This is what may need to be done to remove and replace the modular reactors—perhaps several hundred each year—at the end of their rated life to keep the nuclear power plants operating.

In addition to the nuclear weapon proliferation issues and the likely need for the transport and entombment of highly radioactive decommissioned reactors, many other serious concerns exist. Among these are the threat of natural disaster (such as the tsunamis that destroyed several Japanese nuclear power plants in 2011), a continuously expanding need for nuclear waste disposal (with no current politically acceptable solution), the growing threat of terrorist attacks (perhaps using drone-deployed weapons), and the threat of a space-based electromagnetic pulse attack (potentially rendering the reactors’ safety systems inoperative). As with wind power and ground solar power, nuclear fission power will not enable America to undertake an orderly transition to sustainable energy.

Astroelectricity

As the 1960s came to an end, American oil insecurity was emerging as a major political, economic, and national security issue. One proposed solution—far ahead of its time—was to collect sunlight in Earth orbit, convert this into electrical power, transmit this power via radio waves to special receiving antenna (rectenna) farms on the ground, and supply this power—what I call “astroelectricity”—to the power grid as baseload power. This is called space solar power (SSP). It was invented by Peter Glaser in 1968, perhaps building on the idea of beaming power to planets in a 1941 story by science fiction author Isaac Asimov. Glaser received a US patent for this in 1973.

Figure 16: Illustration of space solar power from Peter Glaser’s space solar power patent.

As America’s energy insecurity grew in the 1970s—and after breeder reactors were abandoned—space solar power was investigated from 1978 to 1980 by NASA and the recently formed DOE. From these efforts, a baseline five-gigawatt space solar power system was defined. This concept is shown in the following illustration. It involves using Manhattan Island-size space solar power platforms located in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) to collect sunlight, convert this into electrical power, and transmit the power using radio waves to the ground receiving antennas (rectenna farm).

Figure 17: Illustration of the ground rectenna site that would receive the power transmitted from the space solar power platform. The transmitted power will be converted into “astroelectricity” and fed into the regional power grid just as is done with baseload powerplants today.

I refer to the ground rectenna farm as an astroelectric plant. For the baseline 5-GWc design, the ground area used by the astroelectric plant is shown in the following illustration. For a typical plant located in the contiguous US, the plant’s rectangular area would be 12.6 km  16.6 km = 209 square kilometers (81 square miles). This equates to 42 square kilometers (16 square miles) needed per 1 GWc of baseload power supplied.

(Note: The GEO SSP platforms will enter the Earth’s shadow at local midnight for about an hour each day for about a week before and after the spring and fall equinoxes. This would be at a time of minimal power demand—seasonally as well as daily. With the annual loss of energy being less than 1%, for this top-level assessment, the SSP platforms are considered to be operating continuously.)

Figure 18: Diagram of the dimensions of a typical astroelectric plant located in the mid-latitudes of the contiguous US.

I assumed that astroelectricity would supply 80% of the primary baseload power America would need. This equates to 4,339 GWc of astroelectricity needed. This would require about 182,000 square kilometers (70,000 square miles) of land in the contiguous United States for the astroelectric plants. This is less than 3% of the contiguous US. For perspective, this is comparable to the total land used for cities in the contiguous US.

For the remaining 20% of the total GWc needed, ground photovoltaic solar farms would be used. Using special rectenna panels collecting both sunlight and the transmitted power, these solar farms would be built as part of the overall astroelectric plants.

Figure 19: Representative total area of astroelectric plants needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need overlaid on a terrain map of the contiguous US.

The approximate total land area needed for this astroelectric option is shown on the map above. The 180,000 square kilometers needed for the astroelectricity option compares very favorably to the more than one million square kilometers needed for an all-ground solar power solution or with the coast-to-coast forest of wind turbines and a half-million square kilometers of ground solar farms needed for a combined solution. The space solar power option will provide America with the best form of sustainable primary power—baseload—while minimizing the land area needed to meet America’s total sustainable energy need. Also, it is the only one of the four options that provides a practicable solution for undertaking an orderly transition to sustainable energy.

Conclusion

The primary conclusions drawn from the assessment are:

At least for America, only SSP-supplied astroelectricity can provide an orderly transition to sustainable energy at the scale needed to replace fossil carbon fuels.

The magnitude of America’s transition to sustainable energy is immense requiring concerted leadership and effort by the Government to ensure that it is effectively undertaken.

To avoid a return to the geopolitical plague of energy insecurity, America must complete the transition to SSP-supplied astroelectricity before the end of this century while being ready to begin its orderly deployment by the time fracked oil and natural gas production peaks and begin their inevitable decline.

Acknowledging today’s moral obligation that we owe to future generations to ensure that their America will still be free, prosperous, energy secure, and at peace, undertaking SSP must now become America’s national energy security imperative.

Why is the EV truck segment so different from the gasoline segment?
But when it comes to EV trucks, the largest cost component is typically the battery, and those weigh down margins significantly.","Perhaps management at Lucid Group (LCID 6.35%) was right the entire time: Electric pickups just aren't going to be a winner in the near term.

""It's very tough to make an electric pickup work today,"" then-Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said during the company's Tech and Manufacturing Day back in September 2024, adding, ""not one that's usable and cost-effective.""

The bad news is that many of Lucid's rivals have tried and are mostly failing.

What have you done for me lately?

Let's briefly go down the list. Tesla's (TSLA 1.88%) Cybertruck, which (it is fair to say) has been a commercial flop, has disappeared from Tesla's U.S. order page as battery-electric pickups industrywide feel the pain. Tesla introduced the base model in April with a sticker price roughly $10,000 lower in the hopes of attracting buyers, but it was essentially a gutted version of the vehicle and dropped key features that made the truck compelling to the small niche of an audience it had.

Back in 2019, CEO Elon Musk announced the cheapest version of the Cybertruck would start under $40,000 before shipping, but in reality, it retailed at nearly $70,000. Musk also predicted the pickup truck would sell between 250,000 and 500,000 units. While Tesla doesn't report sales by country or model, U.S. vehicle registration data can give us an idea of the sales landscape -- and it's not pretty. In fact, year to date through July, the Cybertruck had only 15,211 U.S. registrations, per S&P Global Mobility. That was good enough for a 14% decline compared to the same period in 2024. July registrations are down 54% year over year.

Tesla isn't the only automaker with a big truck problem. Ram, a major Stellantis (STLA -1.42%) brand, canceled plans for its first full electric pickup and attributed the decision to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

Rivian (RIVN 5.98%), in the same fashion as Tesla, doesn't report sales by country or model, but U.S. registrations for Rivian's R1T fell 37% year to date through July. July registrations dropped about as severely as Tesla's, down 40% to only 588 pickups. Ford Motor Company's (F 0.47%) F-150 Lightning faced a less drastic drop, but a drop nonetheless. The F-150 Lightning recorded a 12% drop in registrations through July, with July registrations down 15%. Ford rival General Motors (GM -0.05%) was the lone bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture: The automaker's Silverado EV, Sierra EV, and Hummer EV all posted registration gains through July.

What's the problem?

Despite GM's bright spot, the pickup EV segment failed to break 50,000 sales through July, which is the opposite of the gasoline-powered full-size truck segment that powers sales by the hundreds of thousands annually. So what gives? Why is the EV truck segment so different from the gasoline segment?

Essentially, the economics of an electric pickup flip historic truths. The dirty little secret is that gasoline-powered full-size trucks cost only marginally more to produce than sedans, yet the former can power price tags 2 to 3 times higher. That gives full-size trucks margins that are unprecedented in the automotive industry, and have powered profits in Detroit for decades.

But when it comes to EV trucks, the largest cost component is typically the battery, and those weigh down margins significantly. And there isn't much breathing room because consumers view full-size trucks, even electric trucks, as a work tool and aren't generally willing to give up performance or towing power to lower price tags. It becomes incredibly difficult to turn a profit, even a gross profit, when massive battery packs on the market can cost around $50,000.

What it all means

But all is not lost. Eventually, battery prices will come down to earth, potentially opening the door for successful EV pickups -- Ford is already on this path.

In fact, Ford essentially has doubled down on its EV ambitions. It went back to the drawing board and revolutionized its historic assembly line into an ""assembly tree,"" where three sub-lines produce their parts simultaneously before joining together. Not only is it expected to substantially improve production speed, by up to 40% compared to the current vehicles produced, but Ford also anticipates that the first EV to roll off the line will be an EV pickup that's expected to be profitable very early in its life cycle.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/834322/2026-hummer-ev-carbon-fiber-edition-pickup.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:56.711160

Atem was formed by Meta this year and is wholly owned by the Mark Zuckerberg-run company. According to the application, it was ""formed to act as a power marketer to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services at wholesale in the United States.""

The decision by Meta is predicated on skyrocketing energy demand emanating from the artificial intelligence data center market. Its planned Louisiana data center is expected to have a capacity exceeding 2GW and will be powered by three combined-cycle gas turbines with a capacity of 2.26GW, built and operated by utility Entergy.

Late last year, the company also announced a request for proposals to identify potential nuclear energy developers to support 1.4GW of new nuclear generation capacity across the US.

Following the RFP, the company signed a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Constellation Energy for more than 1.1GW of power from a nuclear power plant in Clinton, Illinois.

The company has also signed numerous renewable supply agreements to decarbonize its operations. In June, the firm procured almost 800MW of renewable power from Invenergy to power its US data center portfolio.

However, its renewable strategy has come under fire due to a reliance on Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreement (EAPA) over PPAs. EAPAs do not involve the direct purchase of energy.

On Sept. 16, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved a four-megawatt hydroelectric facility and four solar projects totaling more than 250 megawatts through a procurement process that prioritized the reuse of contaminated land for economic development.

In July, the commission asked for proposals to develop energy projects that used eligible renewable resources, which could include solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass. Priority was given to projects that would be placed on agricultural land contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals.

Although that approach is intended to help communities turn environmental challenges into economic opportunities, Commission Chair Philip Bartlett said it was difficult to assess the benefits of these projects because of the current market and federal policy changes.

The Inflation Reduction Act offered developers a 30% tax credit into the 2030s for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. However, President Donald Trump signed a policy measure on July 4 that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

States fast-track wind, solar permits and contracts to beat Trump’s deadline

Some states, including Maine, have tried to fast-track clean energy projects in light of that change, but these particular projects were the result of legislation Gov. Janet Mills signed into law in June 2025 that called for expedited procurements for cost-effective renewable energy projects.

“Assessing benefits based on assumptions and forecasts is particularly challenging at this moment,” Bartlett said. “We’ve seen significant changes in federal policy that will make renewable projects more expensive going forward, and there is increasing uncertainty and potential volatility in our [renewable energy credit], energy, and capacity markets.”

Bartlett added that all three commissioners agreed the new projects have “a reasonably strong chance of achieving benefits and will also provide a hedge against market volatility in the years ahead.”

The leader of the Governor’s Energy Office, which is expected to transition to the cabinet-level Maine Department of Energy Resources this fall, expressed support for the projects selected. .

“This procurement, expedited by bipartisan legislation, will result in new clean energy generation for Maine that should be able to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits and deliver affordable energy to ratepayers,” Director Dan Burgess said.

In the future, the new Department of Energy Resources will conduct competition procurements for clean energy projects that are approved by the Public Utilities Commission. Mills also signed LD 1868 into law earlier this year to codify the state’s goal of using 100% clean energy by 2040.

Debt financing for eligible transmission, generation and integrated systems under Title 17 authorities.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Grid Deployment Office (GDO) on Sept. 18, 2025, launched the Speed to Power Initiative to accelerate delivery of multi-gigawatt (GW) generation and transmission projects needed to support artificial intelligence (AI) data center growth and broader U.S. reindustrialization. A companion Request for Information (RFI), with responses due Nov. 21, 2025, aims to surface projects and bottlenecks across regions – everything from inter-regional transmission and reconductoring to bringing retired thermal assets back online or building new and balanced portfolios of generation – and how best to utilize its funding programs and authorities to meet this demand growth.

The launch follows DOE's report, ""Evaluating the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,"" developed under President Donald Trump's executive order (EO) on ""Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid"" (EO 14262). That analysis underscores an urgent reality: Planned retirements and interconnection delays – combined with AI/data center and industrial load growth – are stressing the U.S. electric grid. DOE is now asking industry, states, regulators, utilities and grid operators to help identify what can be advanced quickly and how federal tools should be applied to do so.

How Speed to Power Fits the Administration's Policy Framework

Speed to Power aligns with several administration priorities:

Unleashing American Energy (EO 14154). Emphasizes abundant, reliable and affordable energy across the nation as an economic and national security imperative.

Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI (EO 14179). Prioritizes building U.S. AI dominance to promote economic competitiveness and national security.

Strengthening Grid Reliability and Security (EO 14262). Directs DOE to use a uniform reliability methodology to guide federal interventions to meet growing demand.

Reinvigorating America's Nuclear Industrial Base (EO 14302). Encourages rapid deployment of nuclear generation as firm, dispatchable capacity.

Together, these actions point to a federal posture that is both pro-build and time-sensitive – with Speed to Power as the mechanism to identify and accelerate critical projects that can realistically increase power availability and reliability over the near-term to accommodate and enable load growth.

What DOE Is Looking For

DOE seeks information on large-scale projects that could enable at least 3 GW (and up to 20 GW) of incremental load, including:

New interregional lines (≥1,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA)) and reconductoring of existing lines (≥500 MVA) to increase load-serving capability.

Bringing retired thermal generation facilities back into service or otherwise using the existing interconnection capacity to provide reliable power generation.

DOE is also inviting respondents to flag high-priority geographic areas – such as data center corridors, semiconductor clusters, industrial parks and port complexes – where targeted federal support could unlock major private investment but where grid constraints (i.e., capacity, congestion and interconnection) stand in the way.

Programs and Authorities on the Table

While the RFI is not a funding opportunity, DOE explicitly asks how its programs and authorities should be deployed to accelerate delivery. Relevant tools include:

Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP). DOE acts as an ""anchor customer"" and administers borrowing authority to support and de-risk large interregional projects.

Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP). Competitive funding for grid hardening, optimization and advanced technologies.

Loan Programs Office (LPO). Debt financing for eligible transmission, generation and integrated systems under Title 17 authorities.

Technical Assistance. Modeling, planning support and national lab expertise to help design bankable, buildable solutions.

For sponsors weighing capital stacks, the RFI also invites input on where gaps exist and how DOE could best de-risk early stages to crowd in private capital.

Connection to Recent INL RFA

Speed to Power complements DOE's recent Request for Applications (RFA) for long-term lease agreements to use federal land at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for AI data center and integrated energy infrastructure – a site-specific opportunity that encouraged engagement with GDO and LPO on financing pathways independent of leasing decisions. (See Holland & Knight's previous blog post, ""DOE Opportunity to Lease INL Land for AI Data Centers and Integrated Energy Infrastructure,"" Sept. 12, 2025.)

Who Should Consider Responding

Utilities and public power entities with major load additions or grid constraints in their service territories

Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) coordinating interregional solutions or facing queue backlogs

Large load customers (e.g., AI/data center operators, semiconductor fabrication plants and industrial facilities) with location-specific, near-term needs

Generation and transmission developers with advanced projects that can materially increase power availability and reliability

State energy offices (SEOs) and public utility commissions (PUCs) with development investment zones or corridor designations with projected demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, semiconductor plants and other large energy users

Technology and software providers with solutions that can realistically be deployed quickly to increase power availability or address grid constraints

How Holland & Knight Can Help

Holland & Knight advises investors, utilities and large-load customers on federal energy programs, including through GDO (TFP/GRIP) and LPO financing pathways. We can help scope a targeted RFI response, align projects with the appropriate federal tools, and position near-term projects for accelerated delivery.

“They’re too embarrassed to show the true face of this government and the policies it’s dismantling in the fight against climate change.” While MPs grilled Environment Canada officials, another climate fight was happening a floor above in the House of Commons on Monday.","Another report last year from Environment Commissioner Jerry DeMarco warned Canada would miss the 2030 target and said there was still 20 to 30 years’ worth of emissions reduction work ahead before it could catch up.

A group of assistant deputy ministers appeared before the House of Commons standing committee on environment and sustainable development Monday morning to brief MPs.

Bloc Québécois MP Patrick Bonin asked them repeatedly about the impact on Canada’s 2030 emission targets from the repeal of the consumer carbon price and the decision to pause implementation of the electric vehicle mandate for 2026.

Department officials initially cited other measures in place and repeated Prime Minister Mark Carney’s talking points, but eventually shared some data when pressed further.

Megan Nichols, one of five officials answering questions, said scrapping the consumer carbon price would add three megatonnes of emissions in 2030, while the impact of suspending the EV mandate for 2026 had not yet been calculated.

“Given that, the government has also announced its intent to review that regulation in more detail to make sure that industry will continue to be able to achieve the goals, and also that prices are affordable,” Nichols said.

The electric vehicle mandate would have required automakers to have 20 per cent of all new car, SUV and light-duty truck sales be zero-emission. The mandate, as written, would still be enacted in 2027 at a threshold of 23 per cent, rising steadily to 100 per cent by 2025.

But when the government paused its implementation, it also launched a 60-day review of the mandate, which is being led by Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Bonin pressed further in another round of questions, but the officials couldn’t say how those recent policy changes, in combination, have impacted Canada’s work to reach its 2030 target.

“We’re just in the middle of revising the projections with the most recent information to be able to respond directly to that question,” said Alison McDermott, the assistant deputy minister of strategic policy.

McDermott said they would have the revised projections before the end of year, which — by law — is when the government must present a progress report with an assessment on the 2030 target.

Speaking to The Canadian Press, Bonin said he believes the government already ran those numbers ahead of making its recent policy decisions, but is too embarrassed to share it.

“It’s clear to me that the government has all that information and it’s walking back (climate policies) in many instances, while it wasn’t even on track to meet its 2030 emission reduction targets,” Bonin said in French.

“They’re too embarrassed to show the true face of this government and the policies it’s dismantling in the fight against climate change.”

While MPs grilled Environment Canada officials, another climate fight was happening a floor above in the House of Commons on Monday.

During an opposition day, the Conservative Party presented a motion calling for the government to eliminate its emissions cap on oil and gas producers.

Last year, Ottawa introduced draft regulations — two years behind schedule — requiring producers to cut emissions by about one-third over the next eight years.

The Liberals have said repeatedly they aren’t capping production, just the emissions that come from it — a bid to force companies to invest in technology to produce the fuels more cleanly. But industry leaders and Conservative politicians insist the targets are too stringent and can’t be met without capping production.

“We’re giving Liberals an opportunity to vote here and now,” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said during a speech on the motion.

“If they vote to keep their production cap in place, it’ll be a signal that all of the flirtations that the Prime Minister has done with the possibility of producing more or building pipelines, were nothing but an illusion. A tragic and extremely costly illusion.”

About 50,000 fewer jobs were created than in 2023 as uncertainty and policy rollbacks took hold.

Trump’s administration has scrapped tax credits, cancelled permits and added new red tape. Since January, companies have pulled more than $22 billion (£17.6bn) of planned projects that would have created 16,500 jobs.

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

On 22 August, the US Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a stop-work order halting all offshore construction activities on the 704 MW project, which is already 80 per cent completed, according to its developers, Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables.

A few days later, the joint venture challenged the stop-work order in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, while Connecticut and Rhode Island filed their own lawsuits against the decision on the same day.

On 22 September, the court granted the preliminary injunction sought by Revolution Wind, allowing the developer to restart impacted activities while the underlying lawsuit challenging the stop-work order progresses.

“Revolution Wind will resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority,” according to Ørsted.

After the temporary injunction was granted, Oceantic Network’s CEO, Liz Burdock, said: “Today’s decision allowing work to resume on Revolution Wind is welcome news for the hundreds of skilled workers who can now return to their jobs while the legal process continues.”

The 704 MW Revolution Wind offshore wind project is set to provide power to Connecticut and Rhode Island in 2026. According to Oceantic Network, the wind farm sparked investments in Louisiana and New England shipyards, purchased export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of union jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.

“Revolution Wind is critical to securing New England’s electric grid, lowering energy costs for businesses and families, strengthening the local supply chain, and achieving energy independence. This Made in America energy project is putting Americans to work building reliable, affordable power to communities across New England that desperately need it,” Liz Burdock added.

HEALEY: When we talk clean energy, what sort of jobs are we talking about?
HEALEY: Minister, I want to come back the increase of women in the sector in a second.
GILES: These are more the energy jobs than the construction jobs that we're talking about.
HEALEY: Minister, we've got a new report out today, Sydney Uni, talking about the adversity that women still face in the construction sector – inflexible conditions.","NIC HEALEY, HOST: But look, this morning, and I mentioned it earlier, the Federal Minister for Skills and Trade, Andrew Giles, is in Morwell talking up careers, talking up jobs in the clean energy sector. Because one of the things we're constantly told about the renewable transition is that there will be jobs attached to it. Now, the focus today is on women in the energy sector. It's the launch of the Powering Her Pathways project designed to boost the amount of women working in that workforce. And Minister, a very good morning to you.

ANDREW GILES, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Good morning to you, Nic. Great to be speaking with you.

HEALEY: When we talk clean energy, what sort of jobs are we talking about?

GILES: There are so many jobs out there. The opportunities in net zero are enormous. We're around 32 or perhaps 42,000 electrical workers short alone in transmission work and work associated with batteries, and of course in rewiring our nation, our communities more broadly. These jobs are largely also located in regional Australia, which is why it's so important that I'm here in Morwell today.

HEALEY: I want to be clear, are these jobs that already exist? Are these jobs of the future that we need to train for now, a mix of both?

GILES: It is a mix of both. So there are jobs out there right now, and it's about also recognising something else that's going on in our workforce at the moment. We know we've got skill shortages right across the board, but those shortages are really concentrated in those areas of our economy, our labour force where there's a big skew in terms of gender, and clean energy is one of those. Only one in six jobs in this industry, in this growing industry, is currently being done by women, and that goes down to 6 percent when it comes to some of the trade apprenticeships. So it's about recognising we've got this challenge to build a workforce that we need to support our national goals, but also to open up more opportunities for women to be part of this.

HEALEY: Minister, I want to come back the increase of women in the sector in a second. I just also want to ask one thing, talking about these jobs – are they all ongoing jobs? Because we tend to see some of these be temporary during construction or building phase.

GILES: These are more the energy jobs than the construction jobs that we're talking about. There are some connected with transmission construction, but most of these are ongoing jobs.

HEALEY: Why is it so important to you that we get more women in this sector then?

GILES: There are two reasons. One, our view as a Government, and my view as a minister, is we should make sure that every job is equally open to every member of our community, that people aren't held back from pursuing their dreams because of a stereotype or some other barrier. The second reason is the point I made earlier, that we've got skills shortages right across the economy, but they are particularly concentrated in those areas where there's been a historical skew towards one gender or the other.

So there's a really important national interest as well as that principle-based job that says we've got to break down the barriers that have been holding back women from getting into clean energy, and for that matter, men getting into nursing or primary teaching.

HEALEY: What are you specifically targeting with Powering Her Pathways? How are you going to encourage this change?

GILES: Importantly, this is a community-led partnership that we are supporting with around $1 million of the Commonwealth investment through the Building Women's Careers Program. So I want to give a big shout-out to Tradeswomen Australia, a fantastic organisation, and the partnership they've established with TAFE Gippsland down here and ENGIE, the operators, to make sure that we can work out a couple of things. Firstly, to better understand the barriers that have been preventing from women getting into the industry and staying in the industry.

We also want to make sure that the training is appropriate, and that's going to be about piloting some arrangements with women down here, but also thinking about what best practice looks like, because this is about Morwell, but it's also about building a clearer understanding about how we can break down more barriers so that more women can have the opportunity to participate in the opportunities of this industry.

HEALEY: What are the barriers you want to see taken away?

GILES: There are some which are just cultural, I think, that have said that being involved in the electricity industry is roles that historically have been associated with men. So it's about hearing directly from women who have been the pathfinders, the pathbreakers in this industry, letting them tell and share their stories so that young women or perhaps women thinking about a career change can understand that this is an option for them. It's also about thinking about what are the flexibilities that we might need to think about in both the training offer, but also in building careers that work for everyone, not just the model that's been in existence up to this point in time.

HEALEY: Minister, we've got a new report out today, Sydney Uni, talking about the adversity that women still face in the construction sector – inflexible conditions. I think there was phrasing talking about becoming pregnant or looking for parental leave as being career-ending – still very focused on a jobs-for-blokes attitude. How do we make sure that that doesn't become part of the issue in the energy sector as well?

GILES: Yeah, these are really concerning reports. And as it happens, yesterday, I was with my colleague, Minister Rishworth, and also the Housing Minister, Minister O'Neil, meeting with employer and union representatives in construction to discuss exactly these issues, how we need to make sure that we are doing absolutely everything that's possible to build a culture that is safe and welcoming in all industries. Issues obviously apply in construction. We have been working to address them, including, of course, by placing the CFMEU in administration.

When it comes to clean energy, I don't presume that we deal with the same issues, but we've got to recognise the fact if only one in six people are currently women in the industry, we've got to ask why. And in particular, we've got to ask the women who have been involved in the industry about their experiences, the barriers that they have experienced and how we can work around them, and also think about how we can engage young people by understanding what it is that's saying to someone this is a job for me or this isn't a job for me.

HEALEY: I mean, surely one of the biggest issues is not just the attracting of people to this industry but the retaining of them once they're there.

GILES: Yeah, well, that's critical at every level. We want people to start, for example, trade apprenticeships, women in particular, but we also want to make sure they finish them. So some of the points that you made in construction apply equally to every industry, whether there are arrangements that recognise that inflexible start and finish times, for example, inflexible locations of work, outdated attitudes to pregnancy. All of these things need to be addressed. Now, there isn't going to be one answer, but the question really for this project, which of course is led by people in this community, is about understanding how do we bridge these barriers?

How do we make sure that some of the things that we know about, the issues that I've just been talking about, particularly around pregnancy and reproductive rights and health, can be dealt with, but also, what are the issues that perhaps we're not seeing? And that's why the regions are so important here because some of the barriers in Morwell, for example, will be different than in Melbourne when it comes perhaps to access to childcare, as just one example.

HEALEY: I'm speaking with Andrew Giles. He’s the Federal Skills and Training Minister. And Minister, I know you need to move on soon, but a few people have been texting in, and when it comes to jobs in clean energy, they're saying things like, ‘there are three wind farms in my area, there's only three full-time jobs for those farms’. There seems to be a perception that these jobs do not exist at a level that makes a difference to the community.

GILES: Again, I won't speak to any particular individual circumstances, but I'd ask people to have a look at the work that's being done by Jobs and Skills Australia, which has identified an enormous shortage of good jobs in the region. We know we need tens of thousands of more electrical workers in Australia to meet our net zero ambitions and to enable the electrification of large chunks of our economy. It's something that I'm concerned about. It's something the industry is concerned about. And in particular, I want to make sure that every Australian has an equal opportunity to be part of this transformation.

HEALEY: Very quickly, Free TAFE, I understand we're seeing some pretty strong numbers out of regional Victoria people taking up that option.

GILES: Yeah, fantastic. It's been terrific to see the take-up in regional Victoria. And some of the barriers that have held people back, I mean, previously to do an enrolled nursing diploma would have cost someone $17,000. So that's obviously been a huge barrier that's held people back from realising their ambitions. Regional Victoria have really picked up the ball and run with it when it comes to Free TAFE. It's something that I'm really looking forward to chatting to TAFE Gippsland in a minute about to see what they are seeing on the ground, particularly seeing different people who've had the opportunity to participate in TAFE who've been held back.

Around the country, more than one in three Free TAFE enrolments have been in the regions. So we're seeing a fantastic opportunity being opened up that was previously closed for people to get fantastic skills in community development, in nursing, in early childhood education, and, of course, in the traditional trades as well.",https://ministers.dewr.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-03/dese-default-social.png,N,,2025-09-23 07:00:00.235661

INDIANAPOLIS — Sept. 22, 2025 — Indiana’s major electric utilities are backsliding on promises to move toward renewable energy, with none improving their scores in the Sierra Club’s latest Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges report.

The report, released Monday, graded 75 utilities nationwide on their plans to retire coal by 2030, avoid building new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy by 2035. The national average score was just 15 out of 100.

Duke Energy Indiana once again ranked the lowest among the state’s five monopoly utilities, earning a failing grade of 0%. The utility has delayed its coal exit from 2035 to 2038, cut nearly 3,800 megawatts of planned clean energy from its 2021 blueprint, and will lose its remaining wind power by the end of the decade.

“Duke Indiana is not only failing compared to its monopoly utility peers in Indiana, it is also among the worst when compared to utilities across the nation,” said Megan Anderson, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. “There’s no better example of Duke’s renewable energy failure than the fact it will not have any wind energy resources after a power purchase agreement expires in a few years.”

CenterPoint Energy earned a 33% grade, down from last year, after canceling renewable contracts and signaling coal plants could remain online past 2030. AES Indiana held steady at 57% but plans up to 1,600 megawatts of new gas-fired power plants to meet the demands of data centers.

NIPSCO, once considered a state leader in transitioning away from coal, saw its score drop from 80% to 57% due to planned new gas plants. Indiana Michigan Power fell to 48% from 66% after its parent company sought to shift coal plant costs onto Indiana customers.

Sierra Club officials criticized Gov. Mike Braun and President Donald Trump for supporting coal interests and approving rate hikes that they say saddle Hoosier families with higher bills while delaying investment in renewables.

“Governor Braun, monopoly utilities, and tech companies are driving up monthly utility bills for Hoosier families by straddling us with expensive coal and gas costs to feed power-hungry data centers,” Anderson said.

Addressing the opening ceremony of the 5th World Congress of Biosphere Reserves, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang called for strengthened global cooperation on biosphere conservation.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Ding said, China has achieved ""remarkable progress"" in ecological protection and green development. China has also actively contributed to global environmental and climate governance, playing a key role as a participant, contributor and leader in international ecological efforts.

To address global environmental challenges, Ding urged countries to strengthen coordination and cooperation, increase investment and encourage participation from governments, enterprises and the public. He also called for enhanced scientific and technological support, the sharing of research outcomes, and efforts to bridge knowledge gaps between countries and regions.

Ding highlighted the importance of biosphere reserves in promoting harmony between humans and nature and fostering coordinated progress between economic growth and environmental protection.

The congress, which is convened by UNESCO every 10 years, aims to evaluate progress, share experiences, and set future directions for the Man and the Biosphere Programme.

Latifa Yaakoubi, chair of the International Coordinating Council of the MAB Programme, said countries around the world are now facing a series of interconnected crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. The impacts of these crises are intensifying, affecting everyone and threatening the foundations of socioeconomic systems.

Yaakoubi said the goal of the MAB Programme, established in 1971, is to enhance understanding of the connections between humanity and nature. This understanding is crucial for changing behaviors and building a more sustainable future.

The program can bridge global ideals with local and regional actions, align national agendas with international ones, and fulfill sustainability commitments at local, national and international levels, she said.

Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, echoed Yaakoubi's comments, adding that ecological multilateralism is central to UNESCO's work.

The World Network of Biosphere Reserves now includes 759 biosphere reserves across 136 countries, which Azoulay said demonstrates ""concrete multilateralism"".

Azoulay also highlighted an island watch program in Mauritius, where local communities are becoming observers and actively involved in monitoring environmental changes.

""Gaining a better understanding of the living world also means raising awareness of indigenous knowledge and integrating it better into our management policies,"" Azoulay said, stressing the importance of open science and international cooperation.

Hou Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said new technologies, including artificial intelligence and biotechnology, have created favorable conditions for collective efforts to tackle global ecological and environmental challenges.

""The establishment and development of biosphere reserves not only provide important application scenarios for the practical implementation of new theories, technologies and products, but also serve as an important platform for countries to jointly strengthen ecological conservation efforts and cooperation, thereby achieving common sustainable development,"" Hou said.

He emphasized the importance of deepening technological communication and cooperation to empower the construction of biosphere reserves by leveraging the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, universities and research institutions. This collaboration should focus on key areas such as ecological restoration, biodiversity protection, and green and low-carbon development, providing more effective solutions.

""We should strengthen the co-construction and sharing of foundational capability building,"" he said, adding that a big data platform should be built to enhance exchanges and cooperation in data sharing and talent cultivation, thereby establishing an intelligent, integrated ecosystem research and monitoring network.

He also called for greater attention to the challenges faced by developing countries in balancing socioeconomic development with ecological and environmental protection, emphasizing the need to provide them with tailored solutions.",https://www.chinadailyhk.com/upload/main/image/2025/09/23/97a52b83bed2cbe5146911fdb04fcb04.png,N,,2025-09-23 05:59:58.777235

“And how you were able to go about getting this facility was pretty strategic.” When he started ReGenesis, Mitchell said he didn’t know anything about environmental justice.
Quentin Pair, retired from the U.S. Department of Justice, rounded out the evening’s speeches, complimenting the folks in the room on the work they’d done.
“As wonderful as Sherri is, and she is wonderful, you are the ones who make this possible.” “All of these people we’ve been talking about … didn’t know a damn thing about environmental justice, and many of you may not know what environmental justice is,” Pair continued.","In 2020, in the midst of the COVID pandemic, Sherri White-Williamson took a bold step toward realizing a dream. She started the Environmental Justice Community Action Network, known as EJCAN, in Clinton to help empower the Sampson County community and surrounding areas to fight against environmental threats. On Saturday night, about 225 people gathered to help her celebrate the organization’s fifth anniversary and also to welcome EJCAN to its new facility, the former National Guard Armory, at 200 Northeast Blvd.

“It’s phenomenal to see the work, the effort, but most importantly the vision of Sherri to make the offer for this building; to manifest this in about six months’ time,” said master of ceremonies for Saturday’s banquet, Jeffrey Robbins.

EJCAN Board Chair Allie Sheffield called White-Williamson “an extraordinary leader.”

“As a result of her leading all of us, I think we have done amazing things in the time we’ve been working together,” she continued.

Phillip Bell of the Coharie was also on hand for land acknowledgement. “For over 14,000 years, this land and the waterways have been integral to the life-sustaining ceremonies and healing practices,” he shared. “Despite facing displacement and removal, American Indian communities in North Carolina have shown remarkable resilience and sustainability.”

Bell added that American Indians are present in all 100 counties in the state, and Coharie continues to be one of the federally recognized tribes.

White-Williamson said she was overwhelmed at the turnout for the banquet and the recognition for EJCAN’s work. “Five years ago, some of us who were students of Vermont Law decided we wanted to try to make a difference in the world, and we decided we wanted to start here in Sampson County,” she explained. “We started working for several communities here, primarily the Snow Hill community, and we wanted to hear what they needed here in the county. We managed to get a consent agreement to help improve life for folks around the Snow Hill community, but more than that, I think the gathering here demonstrates what we were trying so hard to do, is to bring community together so that we could all work together toward a common goal. The environment is most important to all of us. It doesn’t matter where you live, how much money you make, what your race makeup is, or any of those things. We all breathe the same air, we all drink the same water. What we should be doing most of all is working together to make sure all of us are equally taken care of, in terms of our lives and our lifestyles.”

She asked those present to let EJCAN know of any changes they’d like to see made in the community. “We will work very hard to make that happen.”

After a performance by gospel recording artist Gerald Hinton, EJCAN Deputy Director Denise Robinson took to the stage to thank sponsors of the event and donors to the organization. Robbins called Robinson “the glue that holds everything together.”

Maggie Galka, co-founder and classmate of White-Williamson’s, introduced the guest speaker for the evening’s event, Harold Mitchell, the founder of the ReGenesis Institute in Spartanburg, S.C. In the late 1990s, Mitchell founded ReGenesis to help revitalize his community after his family and neighbors experienced severe health effects from toxic pollution. Under his guidance, ReGenesis grew from a $20,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to nearly $300 million in investments from federal, state and local governments, as well as the private sector.

He served on the Biden-Harris Campaign Climate Advisory Council, the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, and co-chaired the executive order committee that shaped national environmental justice policies, which was started by President Bill Clinton.

“This is not a sprint, this is a marathon,” Mitchell shared. “I know, with this five-year anniversary that you are celebrating, if you look at the experiences of the past five years, we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve had the experience of this administration, but you’re still here. And I think it says a lot about North Carolina, because you know how to mobilize, organize and galvanize.”

He said that EJCAN is something special, because of its diversity and local support. “What you have is a beginning point, with this incredible facility,” Mitchell stated. “And how you were able to go about getting this facility was pretty strategic.”

When he started ReGenesis, Mitchell said he didn’t know anything about environmental justice. “I was sick. I was throwing up blood. We grew up in front of a fertilizer plant, landfill in the backyard, chemical plants to the side. We were completely surrounded.”

Mitchell’s sister died from sepsis, due to the chemicals surrounding their home, he said. “We got tired of seeing people pointing fingers back and forth,” he shared. “We were able to pull everyone together.”

He said he’s seen small, rural communities that had a population the size of the room in which the banquet was held. “And they’re drinking 150 parts per billion arsenic in their drinking water,” he said.

“This is a good start,” Mitchell said of EJCAN. “Please pull together. Embrace the vision of EJCAN. There is so much that can be done here. You are in the place to be able to help your community.”

He encouraged those present to come together and look at the real needs of the community. “The answers are in the community,” he said. “The federal government doesn’t have the answers; the state government doesn’t have the answers. And until the people realize who’s in charge, you are the ones in charge, and that’s why the civic engagement piece is so important. If your elected officials ain’t doing their job, send them home. It’s time to get spinally challenged people who are sitting in office, doing nothing because they’re afraid of who’s coming after them. You own them. Take them out. Until we do so … elections have consequences. We’re seeing that over the past eight months. Please take your community forward.”

Mitchell concluded that at EJCAN’s sixth anniversary, he hoped to see solid plans in place to improve the community.

Quentin Pair, retired from the U.S. Department of Justice, rounded out the evening’s speeches, complimenting the folks in the room on the work they’d done. “Everything that has been done could not have been done without you,” he stated. “As wonderful as Sherri is, and she is wonderful, you are the ones who make this possible.”

“All of these people we’ve been talking about … didn’t know a damn thing about environmental justice, and many of you may not know what environmental justice is,” Pair continued. “But they knew there was something wrong with their communities, and they stepped forward.”

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.
“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a new model

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

US gas could lock Indonesia into fossil fuels

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

According to MidAmerican’s and IPL’s latest energy plans, both utilities intend to build new gas power plants while continuing to operate outdated, costly coal power plants.
With a power grid increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, Iowans will face rising energy prices and devastating health impacts.
“While the wind turbines are hard to miss, it’s Iowa’s dirty secret that there are still 6 coal plants across the state polluting our air and water.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Today, Sierra Club released its fifth annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This year, Berkshire Hathaway-owned MidAmerican Energy, as well as Alliant Energy-owned Interstate Power and Light (IPL), both received the lowest grade possible, an F.

It is IPL’s second year in a row to receive a failing grade, while MidAmerican’s score dropped 10 points over the last year from 23 out of 100 (D) to 13 out of 100 (F). MidAmerican’s and IPL’s low scores reveal the utilities are resistant to fully transitioning to affordable clean energy, and continue to rely on expensive, polluting fossil fuels. At the same time, Americans’ protections for clean air and water are being rescinded, and electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

According to MidAmerican’s and IPL’s latest energy plans, both utilities intend to build new gas power plants while continuing to operate outdated, costly coal power plants. IPL plans to add 1,275 MW of gas-burning power over the next 10 years, and MidAmerican is slated to add 1,164 MW. With a power grid increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, Iowans will face rising energy prices and devastating health impacts.

“MidAmerican and IPL have an opportunity to be the renewable energy leaders they claim to be, but instead, they keep clinging to gas and coal,” said Pamela Mackey Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director. “While the wind turbines are hard to miss, it’s Iowa’s dirty secret that there are still 6 coal plants across the state polluting our air and water. But together, Iowans can demand better from our utilities. It’s time these companies acted in our best interest, and that means phasing out dangerous fossil fuels to save lives and lower bills.”

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

In significant part, the OBBBA extended or made permanent various provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) that were set to expire at the end of this year. The OBBBA also introduced many changes to the tax law that will be relevant to various sectors of the economy, including real estate. Below is a high-level summary of certain key provisions of the OBBBA that may impact the real estate sector.

Goulston & Storrs continues to closely monitor the OBBBA and its implications for individuals and businesses across sectors. If you have any questions about how these changes may affect you or your business, please contact your G&S attorney or a member of our Tax Group.

Income Tax Rates

The OBBBA preserves and permanently extends the ordinary income tax rates applicable to individuals that were introduced by the TCJA (i.e., a 37% top marginal rate). No changes were made to the capital gains rate. Read additional details related to the impact of the OBBBA on individuals, including charitable giving, as well as estate and gift tax considerations here.

Bonus Depreciation

The OBBBA now makes permanent 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property and new tangible property that has a recovery period of 20 years or less. The TCJA had introduced the 100% bonus regime but had been gradually sunsetting the program. The full expensing rule will apply to qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025. As was the case prior to the OBBBA, this provision does not apply with respect to non-residential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property held by taxpayers with a real property business who elect out of the 30% limitation on interest deductions described below.

Qualified Production Property

Subject to several limitations and qualifications, the OBBBA introduces an election allowing taxpayers to currently expense costs associated with building so-called “qualified production property,” which generally is limited to nonresidential real property that is used by the taxpayer to manufacture tangible personal property. Among other things, the new election will only apply to newly constructed manufacturing facilities located in the United States or a possession of the United States, the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 19, 2029, and which are placed in service before January 1, 2031.

Business Interest Limitation

Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, originally established under the TCJA, limits business interest expense deductions to 30% of adjusted taxable income (“ATI”). Since 2022, the calculation of ATI has been based on earnings before interest and taxes, but after deducting depreciation and amortization (“EBIT”). The OBBBA returns to the more generous pre-2022 standard by adding back depreciation and amortization to the calculation of ATI, effectively allowing taxpayers to deduct interest subject to a limitation of 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”).

As was the case under the TCJA, the 30% of ATI limitation does not apply to taxpayers with a real property business who elect out of Section 163(j).

Read additional details related to the impact of the OBBBA on financing transactions here.

SALT Deduction Cap

The limitation on the deduction of state and local taxes (“SALT”) was a major facet of the TCJA and has been one of its most controversial provisions. There is a temporary increase in the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 beginning in 2025. The cap increases by 1% per year beginning in 2026 until 2030 when it reverts to $10,000.

The increased SALT deduction begins to phase out when a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income reaches a threshold of $500,000 (or $250,000 for married filing separately), which will grow by 1% annually. The amount of the phasedown is equal to 30% of the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income over the threshold; however, the deduction will not decrease below $10,000.

Qualified Business Income Deduction

OBBBA makes permanent the qualified business income deduction under Section 199A, which allows non-corporate taxpayers the ability to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income. As was the case under the TCJA, “qualified business income” includes qualified REIT dividends.

REITs

The OBBBA relaxes the REIT asset test with respect to taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) to provide that a REIT cannot hold securities in one or more TRSs representing more than 25% (up from 20%) of the REIT’s value. This change is applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. In addition, as described above, certain REIT investors will continue to benefit from the qualified business income deduction with respect to qualified REIT dividends.

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The OBBBA permanently extends and updates the qualified opportunity zone (QOZ) program, which had previously been set to expire for new investments made after December 31, 2026. The OBBBA made several changes to the QOZ program, including a new designation process, deferral mechanics, changes to the designation of qualified census tracts, incentives to promote investments in rural low-income communities, and new information return reporting requirements and associated penalties. See additional details related to the OBBBA and Qualified Opportunity Zones here.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credits

The OBBBA increases by 12% the State housing ceiling applicable to the allocation of 9% low-income housing tax credits for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2025. In addition, the so-called “50% test” applicable to 4% credit projects financed by tax-exempt bonds is relaxed for certain buildings placed in service after December 31, 2025, to provide that it is sufficient for 25% of the aggregate basis of the building and land to be financed by tax-exempt bonds, one or more of which must be issued after December 31, 2025. The new 25% test requires that at least 5% of building and land be financed by tax-exempt bonds issued after December 31, 2025.

Phase Out of Certain Green Building Incentives

The OBBBA makes numerous changes to the clean energy incentives introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In relevant part, the OBBBA phases out the Section 179D deduction for the cost of energy efficient commercial building property and new energy efficient homes credit under Section 45L. The Section 179D deduction will not apply to property the construction of which begins after June 30, 2026. The Section 45L credit will not apply to any qualified new energy efficient home acquired after June 30, 2026.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15468_1147.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 00:57:59.408598

LANSING — In case you missed it, Lucerne International Inc. has scrapped its plans for a “$50 million hot aluminum forging plant with 325 new jobs in Detroit,” according to Crain’s Detroit Business. The company is blaming the chaotic tariffs supported by GOP senate candidate Mike Rogers for “driv[ing] up costs” and undermining the auto supplier’s “three-year effort to bring manufacturing from China to the U.S.”

Earlier this month, Mike Rogers was caught at a campaign event “making fun of those who worry about higher prices,” arguing that they are “worth the financial strife being put on the American people,” even as the U.S. has lost 42,000 manufacturing jobs since Rogers-backed tariffs were implemented in April.

“Mike Rogers’ reckless tariff policies just cost Detroit more than 300 manufacturing jobs and a $50 million investment that was supposed to bring production back from China,” said Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Curtis Hertel. “While Mike Rogers is out on the campaign trail mocking families worried about higher costs, his failed policies are killing opportunities for Michigan workers to rebuild the state’s manufacturing base.”

Crain’s Detroit Business: Auto supplier scraps $50M Detroit factory plan as tariffs drive up costs

Lucerne International Inc.’s plan for a $50 million hot aluminum forging plant with 325 new jobs in Detroit — the culmination of the automotive supplier’s three-year effort to bring manufacturing from China to the U.S. — was nearly a done deal.

Then came President Donald Trump’s frenzied tariffs and regulatory upheaval, prompting decision-making paralysis across the industry.

[…] “It’s everything converging at once,” Buchzeiger told Crain’s. “You’ve got tariffs that are hitting our equipment costs. You’ve got tariffs that are hitting our raw material costs. You’ve got these questions over the Inflation Reduction Act. You’ve got the industry itself, where programs are being delayed or canceled, margins are being squeezed.”

Michigan is feeling the pain as previously announced investments fizzle out. In just the past few weeks, an Australian mining giant scrapped a $210 million electric vehicle battery plant in Detroit due to federal policy, a once high-flying battery startup is vacating most of its factory in Van Buren Township, a $60 billion microchip project near Flint is kaput and the list goes on.

Meanwhile, the Detroit 3 automakers are out billions of dollars in profit due to import fees, while production volume uncertainty rocks auto suppliers.

[…] Tariffs could cost the auto industry a staggering $188 billion over the next three years, according to an analysis by Ann Arbor-based think tank Center for Automotive Research. Auto manufacturers have so far absorbed most of the costs to protect sales, but sticker prices are expected to rise and that could hurt production volume.

[…] “I think in the long run, tariffs are bad for everybody because all they’re doing is raising the price for consumers here in the U.S. and making us uncompetitive with the rest of the world,” [Buchzeiger] said.

This year, PacifiCorp received a C. In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress, if any, the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

Important to note is PacifiCorp’s grade is based on its entire system, including Rocky Mountain Power in the east (covering parts of Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho) and Pacific Power in the west (covering parts of Oregon, Washington, and California). When reviewed separately, Rocky Mountain Power received a D (31 out of 100) and Pacific Power received a B (63 out of 100). Pacific Power boosts PacifiCorp’s overall score because it operates in states that require utilities to phase out fossil fuels and transition to clean energy like solar, wind, and batteries. PacifiCorp’s plans for its Oregon and Washington customers project more progress in its clean energy transition and PacifiCorp has initiated processes to procure clean resources for these states, but only because it is legally mandated to do so.

By contrast, Rocky Mountain Power has backtracked on retirement dates for some of the dirtiest coal plants in the country. In its latest energy plan, the utility proposed to burn coal indefinitely at the majority of its coal plants, including the Hunter and Huntington coal plants in Utah and Dave Johnston Unit 4, Naughton Unit 2, and Wyodak coal plants in Wyoming. With most of PacifiCorp’s coal plants forecasted to operate without a retirement date, Utahns, Wyomingites, and Idahoans are facing the consequences of a grid powered by expensive, polluting fossil fuels, and electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

Earlier this year, Sierra Club released a report based on PacifiCorp’s own proposal that showed investments in renewable energy could create thousands of long-term, good-paying jobs while boosting economic activity and generating critical tax revenue for communities in Utah and Wyoming.

“Rocky Mountain Power is leaving money on the table, period. Investing in clean energy could immediately boost our communities by providing good jobs and funding for schools,” said Luis Miranda, Utah-based Campaign Organizer for the Sierra Club. “This report is more proof that the coal plants in Utah are dragging all of us down. They are giving kids asthma, making our water dirty and unsafe, and running our wallets dry.”

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:15.576190

Many were hoping the promise made before wasn’t empty, but it turns out people who shell out for an electric car won’t be able to make their neighbors help pay for a portion of it.

The Subaru Legacy is no more.

This news comes as the September 30 deadline for the federal EV tax credits approaches. It turns out the reason for this rather unsurprising development is rather fundamental.

It all comes down to one thing: cost. The state of California can’t foot the bill for such a measure, reports Bloomberg. According to Governor Newsom, the removal of the tax incentives by Republicans is “federal vandalism.”

Considering under the federal program people who lived in other states helped finance vehicle purchases for people living in California, we’re not sure how that even makes sense. But most politicians get rather testy when they’re told they can no longer raid private citizen’s earnings for their pet programs.

Some automakers were really banking on California offering the $7,500 EV tax credit, picking up where the federal government is leaving off. There was a proposal for a $5,000 incentive, but California can’t even float that much.

After all, the Golden State is out of cash, running a budget deficit was it keeps spending money like crazy. It’s almost like there are consequences to actions.

During a speech announcing the disappointing development, Governor Newsom made sure to threaten GM CEO Mary Barra, accusing her of “selling out” his state by pushing on US Congress to end the EV mandate in California.

However, Newsom has made a fresh batch of promises, saying next year California will offer a new EV subsidy program, even though it hasn’t had one since 2023. We can’t wait to see who he blames when that also falls apart.

SACE is pleased to report that on August 28, the Forsyth County Council did indeed pass a unanimous, bipartisan resolution questioning the health and safety impacts of the Transco Southeast Supply Enhancement Project and asking FERC and NC DEQ to deny applicable permits unless and until concrete steps are taken that ensure the protection of the community. You can read the resolution here. Thank you, Forsyth County Council, for adding your name to the growing list of communities with concerns about this expensive, disruptive, harmful, and unnecessary fossil gas pipeline project.

I grew up in Thomasville, but with my grandmothers, great-aunts, and uncles all in Winston-Salem, it always felt like my second home. Back in the 1980s, I attended the North Carolina Governor’s School at Salem, took summer courses at Wake Forest, and worked a summer job at Piedmont Airlines in its final days. I have fond memories of early dinners at the K&W on Knollwood with my grandmother — a place we loved until it was tragically destroyed by a methane gas explosion in 1988.

I now work for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and I have serious concerns about a large proposed interstate gas pipeline project called the Williams Transco Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) that could jeopardize the safety of citizens along its path, including those right here in Winston-Salem. Part of the SSEP expansion is 24 miles of new 42” pipeline to be added next to Transco’s three existing large diameter, high pressure pipelines here in the Triad.

These older lines were installed long before Winston-Salem’s population, now over 125,000, began to grow around them. Neighborhoods, businesses, churches, hospitals, and schools are now in close proximity. Currently, plans call for adding a fourth massive pipeline into this already crowded corridor, a move that could be incredibly disruptive but also potentially dangerous. Much of the route now falls within a “high consequence area,” meaning that if the pipeline were to explode, loss of life and property would be likely. Heightening the risk, Williams intends to thread the new pipeline beneath the three existing lines in several places, including a crossing beside the new VA Clinic in Kernersville and another just 1,000 feet from Wallburg Elementary School on Highway 109.

In North Carolina, where safety comes first, adding another pipeline so close to homes, schools, and hospitals is reckless, especially when we don’t even know the full blast impact of stacking it beneath three existing lines. It is possible to calculate a “blast zone” for a single pipeline when you know its diameter and pressure. For example, for a 42-inch pipeline at a standard 1,440 psi, the blast zone extends 1,115 feet from the center — though the Pipeline Safety Trust has raised concerns that this figure may be too low. Currently, there are no studies to determine how the blast zone might be impacted if an explosion were to occur beneath two, three, or even four pipelines, leaving critical safety questions unanswered.

Furthermore, most of the gas from this project may never be used in North Carolina, but Duke Energy’s ratepayers in the state will likely end up paying for most of the $1.5 billion project since Duke Energy has agreed to contract for two-thirds of it. As cleaner, more affordable energy sources come online, Duke Energy likely won’t need most of that pipeline capacity. Williams has designed the project so that excess supply can continue flowing south toward liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals in the Gulf Coast.

The project includes adding bi-directional flow capability to compressor stations all the way to Transco’s main pooling station on the Alabama-Mississippi line. This would allow SSEP, if approved, to move fracked gas from the Pennsylvania and West Virginia shale gas region down to the Gulf Coast, conveniently close to LNG export terminals.

Winston-Salem is where I formed some of my most cherished memories, and I want future generations to have the same chance — to grow up in safe neighborhoods, to gather with family in beloved local spots, and to build their own stories without the looming threat of another hazardous methane gas pipeline. Protecting this community means preserving not just our safety, but the places and moments that make it home.

So why are we being asked to assume the risks so Williams and others can profit from new capital projects and LNG exports while undermining the state’s clean energy goals? It’s not too late to stop this. The project has not received state or federal approvals. If this dangerous and unnecessary proposal concerns you, contact your elected officials and urge Forsyth County Commissioners to join Guilford County in passing a resolution against SSEP.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/pipeline-orange.png,N,,2025-09-23 06:00:44.359473

In 2013, when the Appalachian fracking rush was still in its early days, then President Barack Obama extolled its benefits in his State of the Union address. Not only had natural gas already helped to lower America’s carbon emissions, it could protect Americans from the fluctuations of the global oil market, Obama said. And there was one more important benefit: “Nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it.”

Obama’s words echoed fracking’s champions in politics, business and government, who boasted that natural gas would save Americans money—perhaps nowhere more fervently than in Pennsylvania, the epicenter of the boom.

“Having that kind of a resource and that kind of production of energy right in our own backyard does help to keep the price of natural gas down for customers and the price of electricity down too,” the former chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, Terry Fitzpatrick, told television viewers in 2011. “So it’s very important to the people of Pennsylvania.”

But the savings Obama and others touted were short-lived for many Pennsylvanians, followed by punishing increases that are on track to balloon even further as forecasts for demand skyrocket in the age of AI. The result is a growing energy affordability crisis, a nightmare collision of higher utility bills, climate change and shrinking federal aid.

After state Republicans fielded “distressed calls from Pennsylvanians asking for an inquiry into rising energy prices,” the Pennsylvania House Republican Policy Committee held a hearing in 2023 to learn more about the reasons for a “dramatic increase in energy costs for residents and businesses.”

“With our immense resources, and our status as a net-energy exporter, one would think the People of PA would receive lower energy prices,” the committee wrote. “But this is not the case.”

David Callahan, then the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group for companies fracking in the Marcellus formation, said natural gas was “a solution to poverty” that is “most beneficial to lower income individuals and communities of color.” He testified that the state Department of Environmental Protection was to blame for rising prices because permitting delays held up fracking projects.

That argument didn’t address a fundamental contradiction: If Pennsylvania is producing so much more gas, why are prices going up? Why aren’t its residents benefiting more from the resource beneath their feet?

Impossible Choices

Natural gas production in Pennsylvania more than doubled between 2013 and 2024, and consumption rose faster than in any other state. The rise in natural gas consumption in Pennsylvania has largely been driven by electricity as coal power plants went offline. Now close to 60 percent of the state’s electricity comes from gas, far above the national average. Pennsylvania is awash in excess power, sending more electricity outside its borders than any other state and exporting, domestically and internationally, three-quarters of the gas it produces.

These shifts have not translated to lower costs for Pennsylvanians. Comparing average household electricity prices from 2010 to 2024, residents here haven’t fared better than consumers in many states with little or no natural gas production.

After a period of stability, Pennsylvania electricity rates have soared since 2020. The average household electricity bill in the state has risen 31 percent in that time, according to the Energy Information Administration, faster than the national average by six percentage points.

Some of the highest increases in Pennsylvania are in the southwest, the heart of fracking country, where residents often live in close proximity to wells and bear the heaviest health and environmental burdens caused by drilling.

Gas industry advocates say increases in the past few years are blips due to price shocks from the Ukraine war and other factors that affected the global economy, not a reason to question Pennsylvania’s resource decisions.

But the long-term record is more difficult to defend.

A review of federal electricity data since 2005—a year selected because it preceded the development of the Marcellus, the shale gas deposit under Pennsylvania—shows that the period when abundant gas contributed to stable electricity costs didn’t last long.

The state’s household electricity prices were the 14th highest in the country in 2005. In 2024, they were also 14th. Pennsylvania’s prices were above the national average in 2005 and remain so now.

Gas costs aren’t the only driver. Utilities spent significantly more on wires and other grid infrastructure that were little noticed when fuel costs were flat.

Still, the state’s dependence on a single energy source is a significant part of the story.

Twenty-four percent of Pennsylvanians struggled to pay their energy bills in 2024, according to census data, up from 19 percent in 2021, and disconnection rates are rising.

Data from utilities shows a 25 percent increase in electricity terminations between 2023 and 2024 alone.

Elected officials, activists and utility lawyers who help people with their energy bills have watched the reverberations ripple across the state. A suddenly higher bill for a person on a tight budget means impossible choices, between food and heat or between medicine and air conditioning. Terminations can lead to debt, eviction and family separations. In heat waves and cold snaps, and for people who rely on electricity to power medical equipment, they can be life-threatening.

“More and more people cannot afford to keep energy on,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, a legal advocacy group that assists people with their bills.

When people can’t keep up with their utility bills, they try to make do with less electricity, she said, which often has serious consequences for their health.

“In the wintertime, I’m usually not turning on the heat because I don’t want the electric bill to go up,” said Amber Gale, a resident of Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania. “We unfortunately don’t have any air conditioning. We can’t afford to get it, but we do have some fans.” She tries to avoid turning the fans on in the summer, even as the temperature soars.

In all seasons, she constantly watches how much electricity she uses, trying to avoid spikes in her bills.

The Pennsylvania Gas Discount

For almost 20 years, the gas industry sold fracking to Pennsylvanians as a revolutionary economic engine that would bring jobs, infrastructure investment, energy security, tax revenue for local governments—and lower energy bills.

“Abundant natural gas in the Marcellus not only means lower heating bills for families and small businesses, but lower electricity rates as well, as they are tied to prices for natural gas,” a 2011 fact sheet from the Marcellus Shale Coalition said. In the early 2010s, the industry paid for economic studies carried out by researchers at Penn State University that estimated that Pennsylvanians had already saved millions of dollars in energy bills because of fracking, $27.7 million on electricity alone.

“Electricity prices for all Pennsylvanians are down nearly 40 percent since the onset of the shale gas revolution, thanks to the increased use of natural gas for electric generation,” David Spigelmyer, then the coalition’s president, wrote in 2016.

In 2017, the University of Pennsylvania released a study reflecting on more than 10 years of shale gas development. As things stood then, the fracking revolution had delivered a “clear win for consumers” in Pennsylvania, said Christina Simeone, the researcher who authored the study and now works for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Simeone’s study showed a “Pennsylvania Gas Discount” from fracking that lowered gas and electricity commodity prices, though residential consumers were still paying more than national averages. From 2007 t0 2016, consumers in the state experienced fewer service terminations and less energy debt.

But Simeone warned that the discount could disappear, especially as companies exported more gas out of state. “It is also important to understand that erosion of the PA Gas Discount has the potential to also increase electric power prices,” she wrote.

Her prediction was prescient. Earlier in the fracking boom, lack of pipeline infrastructure meant that the gas was essentially stranded in the state, sold at lower prices than would be available elsewhere.

Today, with additional infrastructure in place, the local cost benefit has been undercut by the state’s role as a major supplier to much of the country and abroad.

This is a boon for companies that produce gas, but it does little for the state’s consumers.

“Pennsylvanians are competing for their own gas with other countries that are willing to pay a lot of money for it,” said Marx, with the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. “There’s no requirement, like, ‘You shall provide this amount of gas to the people whose backyards it’s pumped out of,’ right? If you have people willing to pay more to ship it out of state, as long as the infrastructure exists to ship it out of state, you’re going to ship it out of state.”

Because Pennsylvania’s electricity grid is now so reliant on natural gas, when gas prices spike, utility bills go up, too. More service disconnections follow. Marx said there is a “direct line” between rising gas prices and more people losing access to heating and cooling in their homes.

These factors are magnified as the country enters a period in which electricity demand is rising to serve the growth of data centers and AI. Rising demand for electricity contributes to rising prices for gas, which is Pennsylvania’s and the country’s leading fuel for power plants.

“People Are Struggling”

Before Elizabeth Marx specialized in utility law, she was an attorney at the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence. In that role, she handled a case where custody was transferred to an abusive parent because the other parent had lost electricity service.

“The judge thought it was safer for that child to be with the batterer than it was to be in a home without electricity,” she said. That case gave her insight into the unexpected ways that energy precarity can unravel lives, compromising safety, housing, health, education and stability.

Marx’s work is deeply personal for her. When she was a child, she and her mother and siblings escaped from domestic violence, leading to a period of upheaval. After leaving a shelter, the family lived in a 19th century farmhouse with nearly original windows and extremely high costs for heating.

“It’s not an academic exercise for me,” she said. “I lived poverty.” She and her family experienced energy insecurity, though it didn’t have a name then.

Today, she’s increasingly alarmed by the situation in her home state. She has a bird’s-eye view via the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project’s emergency hotline for people seeking help with their utility bills. These days, the calls are coming from across the state, Marx said.

“You’d find energy insecurity everywhere you go. There’s certainly high concentrations in Philadelphia, and increasingly high concentrations in Pittsburgh. But we’ve got clients in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania, and Erie, Pennsylvania, and everywhere in between,” Marx said. That’s why promising Pennsylvanians lower energy prices was a winning political strategy in the 2024 election: “It resonates with people, because there’s not a single person that’s going to tell you their energy prices haven’t gone up.”

Between 2006 and 2025, western Pennsylvania’s Duquesne Light Co. and West Penn Power, and Penelec in northern and central Pennsylvania all increased rates more than 110 percent, according to an annual rate survey from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission that started in 2006. Met-Ed, in the southeast, increased rates 95 percent. These increases far outpaced the rate of inflation in this period. (The percentages are based on comparisons of the total electricity bill for households using 500 kilowatt-hours per month.)

“In my office, we see so many people, young people living in their first apartments, seniors who are on fixed incomes, parents with really hungry kids who are holding their breath when they get their electric bill every month, because it could be a big shock,” state Rep. Mandy Steele, a Democrat representing an area just north of Pittsburgh, said during a virtual discussion in April about rising electricity costs.

Jessica Shirley, secretary of Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection, shared her own experience in that meeting of opening a bill in the dead of the prior winter. “I was like, ‘We’re just gonna be cold, guys.’”

For Amber Gale, who moved from Pittsburgh to Clearfield County in 2020, increases have meant shortchanging her budget for food and clothing and going without heat whenever possible. “When we first moved, our average electric bill was anywhere from $50 to $60. Now, this past winter, it was about $120 to $170,” she said. She still can’t figure out why the bill for her small apartment, which uses electric heat, is so high.

Gale has experienced what it’s like to survive without electricity at home: walking to the library to charge her phone, going to the laundromat to wash clothes, relying on friends or family for other essential needs. She fears that increasing utility bills will land her in the same situation again.

“Not being able to afford anything, having our electricity turned off right now, getting sick and dying from the heat: That’s what I’m really worried about,” said Gale, who has diabetes, one of many chronic conditions exacerbated by high temperatures. “I’ve never been able to handle the heat well, so it makes me really sick.” There are no cooling centers close to where she lives and few options for public transportation.

In Braddock, a steel town south of Pittsburgh, seniors on fixed incomes are struggling the most with utility bills, said Chardaé Jones, the former mayor of Braddock and a regional organizer for the Pennsylvania Policy Center. “There’s only so far that they can stretch their budget,” she said. “It’s not like they’re using more electricity. They’re just getting charged more.” Braddock is served by Duquesne Light.

When intense storms tore through the Pittsburgh region in April, an example of extreme weather increasing as the climate changes, people in Braddock were left without power for days. Duquesne and other Pennsylvania utilities have increased investment in infrastructure updates, in part to contend with the climate-fueled storms that the state’s natural-gas use contributes to, but data shows little or even no improvement in several indicators of grid reliability.

As climate change fuels more frequent heat waves and extreme weather events, and prices are likely to keep rising, summers in Pennsylvania will be increasingly dangerous.

“I’m worried about seniors. I’m worried about newborns. I’m worried about medically vulnerable households not being able to keep their homes at adequate temperatures in the summer,” said Joline Price at Community Legal Services, a nonprofit that provides legal help to low-income Philadelphia residents. “The only thing we’re going to see with increasing prices is increasing shut-off notices.”

She’s watched the number of Philadelphia households needing help with their utility bills rise for the past five years.

“The assistance that’s available has been going down,” added Price, a divisional supervising attorney specializing in energy. “People are struggling.”

Philadelphia’s aging housing stock, higher levels of poverty, urban heat islands and warmer climate compared to the rest of the state mean that the city is particularly vulnerable. “I’m concerned about not being able to pay for my electric,” said Carol Foy, a Philadelphian who tries to keep her usage down, a difficult task. Her husband needs electricity to power a medical machine for his heart, she said.

Like Gale, she worries about what the future will bring. She’s seen what can happen when someone is unable to get help with their utility bills. “I had a friend that passed away like 10 to 15 years ago, because she didn’t want to turn on her heat. She froze to death because she was scared that she couldn’t afford to pay her electric bill,” Foy said.

Cuts to federal funding that used to be a lifeline for people like Gale and Foy are making a bad situation worse. Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off the entire staff overseeing the national Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps Americans with heating and cooling costs. The program provided aid to hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians every year, keeping families out of debt and their power and heat turned on.

In Pennsylvania, the funding had also been used to pay for air conditioners for residents, one possible avenue of help for Gale now potentially closed off, though even before staff was cut, need far exceeded supply. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating funding for the energy assistance program entirely, though so far Congress has rejected this proposal.

“There’s no help,” Gale said. “Anytime you try to get help or ask someone or call a government agency, they just tell you to call another one, and then they tell you to call another one.”

The Resource ‘Right in Our Backyard’

Inside Climate News asked the Marcellus Shale Coalition and the companies that own the state’s largest electricity utilities the same question: How do they explain the recent price surge?

Patrick Henderson, vice president of government affairs and communication for the coalition, took issue with using the rates people pay—retail electricity prices—to assess what’s happening because customers’ bills have many costs beyond fuel.

“I’d find the nearest window, open it and throw out comparisons of retail prices,” he said.

He prefers to use figures that separate the regulated portion of the retail price, which mainly includes delivery charges, and the unregulated portion, which includes the electricity supply and is closely tied to the price of gas.

The Public Utility Commission’s rate survey makes it easy to analyze changes to different parts of the bill over time. Looking at the survey from 2006 to 2016, the regulated and unrelated parts of the bill for most Pennsylvania utilities was close to a 50-50 split.

From 2017 to 2022, the ratio shifted to roughly a 55-45 split, regulated charges exceeding the unregulated ones. Delivery charges grew while gas prices were close to flat.

From 2023 to 2025, a substantial growth in the unregulated charges as gas prices rose helped return bills to about a 50-50 split.

But this attempt to summarize the pricing belies some big differences between utilities. For example, Duquesne Light has been an outlier for much of the last decade in having a large share of its overall bill taken up by regulated delivery charges and a small share—as low as 31 percent in 2021—taken up by unregulated charges.

Henderson listed several factors that he thinks should be part of the conversation about rising electricity rates.

First, he points to the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, a state requirement that utilities get a certain percentage of their electricity from solar, wind, hydropower and natural gas captured from coal mines and landfills, along with other qualifying sources. Utilities spent $702 million complying with the law in 2024, which gets passed on to customers. This was equivalent to 3.9 percent of Pennsylvania consumers’ total spending on electricity that year.

Second, he said the 2019 proposal for Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, has led power plant owners and others in the electricity market to shift their spending in ways that lead to higher costs. So far, the state has not joined the carbon-trading initiative due to legal challenges, and it’s difficult to distinguish between investments companies might have made in anticipation of RGGI membership and decisions that would have happened anyway.

Henderson’s third point is that increases in gas prices in the last few years were tied to global events such as the Ukraine war, and some of the more recent increases reflect rising electricity demand to serve data centers and other large users.

While acknowledging that the price increases have happened, Henderson thinks shale gas producers deserve credit for the years of stable prices.

Prices would “be a hell of a lot higher if they weren’t being mitigated by a cheap, abundant resource right in our backyard,” he added.

Consumer and environmental advocates strongly disagree with Henderson’s points about the alternative energy standard and RGGI. They note that some of these arguments may have currency when talking to elected officials or people affiliated with the oil and gas industry, but they are off base as part of any serious attempt to explain the major factors behind the state’s pricing trends.

How could RGGI be driving price increases when it has not become policy in Pennsylvania? “Utilities are creatures of stability,” said Marx. “They don’t respond to potentials.”

The problem, she said, is that the oil and gas industry is exaggerating the effects of small factors, such as the alternative energy standard, while downplaying huge factors, such as the harm of relying so heavily on one fuel.

“The most recent jump that we have seen post-pandemic is nearly entirely driven by the gas export market,” she said. “I would point to the substantial increase in LNG exports that have Pennsylvanians competing in the world market for gas the way they do for oil.”

Pennsylvania’s utility companies explained rate increases as largely driven by the need to make investments in equipment to improve reliability, along with increases in the market price of gas.

“PECO’s rate trend remained relatively stable for many years, with more noticeable changes beginning in 2021,” said Candice Womer, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia-area utility. “These adjustments reflect the company’s ongoing commitment to strengthening the energy grid, enhancing service reliability, and supporting the region’s transition to cleaner energy.”

Other utilities had similar comments. For example, Matt Neistein, director of communications for Duquesne Light, said recent rate increases are because the company is “investing in the replacement and modernization of our grid infrastructure.”

Todd Meyers, a spokesman for the four FirstEnergy utilities in Pennsylvania, said the company’s customers pay rates comparable to those of other investor-owned utilities in the state. He said any differences can largely be explained by contrasts in population density and topography. “Some have large rural territories while others have a more urban footprint, with each requiring different electrical equipment, infrastructure and staffing levels,” he said.

Some of the people who predicted the current affordability crisis are incredulous about what they see as weak excuses from the companies that have benefited.

“What has happened over the last 20 to 25 years is that these utilities have essentially boiled the frog,” said Patrick Cicero, who was head of the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate until January. “They’ve had increases over increases over increases.”

He had a reputation for being an aggressive defender of utility consumers’ interests. Now he is working on the legal staff at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, alongside Marx.

The low price of natural gas in the late 2010s, he said, meant that utilities could increase their delivery charges without having much of an effect on overall bills.

Then delivery charges kept going up as gas prices spiked in the last few years.

Cicero doesn’t blame gas companies for trying to increase demand for their product and he doesn’t blame utilities for proposing rate increases. He places most of the blame on the Public Utility Commission for not being skeptical enough of utilities’ spending.

“Utilities are acting in their rational self interest all the time, and it is a shame that our system has not held them more accountable,” he said.

When asked for an explanation for rising rates, the commission said that it only has oversight for part of the electricity bill, and that the process for setting the regulated portion of rates is transparent.

“We do not set or control generation prices,” said Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, the Public Utility Commission’s press secretary, in an email. “Those are based on wholesale market forces and supplier pricing decisions. However, we understand consumer frustration when energy costs rise, regardless of the cause.”

Asked if the Marcellus is a net benefit to electricity ratepayers, he said this:

“The advent of Marcellus Shale production in Pennsylvania, beginning in the late 2000s, contributed to a lengthy period of relatively low and stable energy prices. But market dynamics have changed dramatically over the past several years, leading to increasing and more volatile energy prices.”

Energy Dependence

When Obama gave an important speech on American energy policy in March 2011, the “enormous” potential of natural gas played a starring role. The U.S. needed to reduce its reliance on foreign oil, Obama said, to protect consumers from “being a victim to shifts in the oil market.” Natural gas could help ensure America’s security and prosperity, he said.

Obama’s vision for American energy independence has not come to pass. The rise in natural gas exports is creating the same challenges for consumers that he had hoped to avoid by weaning the country off oil imports.

President Donald Trump wants to accelerate that trend: He has made expanding liquified natural gas exports a priority of his second administration. One of Trump’s first acts in his second term as president was to end a pause on additional export terminal permits that was put in place under President Joe Biden. The Marcellus Shale Coalition has supported Trump’s LNG policy; its then-president said in December that LNG exports “promote jobs” and “deliver energy savings for consumers.”

“The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in May.

Although the Trump administration has said that providing affordable energy for Americans is a priority, the president’s emphasis on increasing LNG exports is likely to have the opposite effect, experts warn.

Pennsylvania could pay as much as $16 billion in additional costs between 2035 and 2050 because of higher natural gas prices if proposed LNG export projects move forward, according to a November report from Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.

“Trump doesn’t seem to realize that the more LNG you export, the higher people’s home energy bills are going to be. The more we export, the more we expose ourselves to these wild swings in the market,” said Alan Zibel, research director at Public Citizen. “The Trump administration has pretty clearly sold out the future of rural communities in Pennsylvania.”

Over the past 20 years, Pennsylvania has locked itself into a future where its fate is tied to the volatilities of the global price of natural gas, and the people paying the highest price are the same ones that fracking companies promised to help.

After months spent trying to find government resources to assist with paying her climbing energy bills, Gale sees community support as the only real option for help, and she encourages people to look out for each other when they can.

But she acknowledged there were limits. She had realized recently that she was not alone in navigating this new, more expensive reality.

“It’s not just me. It’s everyone,” she said. “Everybody’s struggling.”",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNS8wNy8wMW04LWZodjUtajcwdi04ZHJxLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 23:59:07.086563

It is the origin of management science and the cradle of management ideas.

Before introducing the special topic of the 42nd issue of Management Vision, we will use three articles to review the history of management ideas starting from the factory - Taylor's ""scientific management,"" Ford's ""assembly line,"" and Toyota's ""lean production."" Returning to the factory, we see not only ""how to improve efficiency"" but also understand how people, technology, and systems in an organization shape each other; we question not only ""how to make rules"" but also how to make rules the fertile ground for human nature to play its role.

Ford is transforming its factories.

As the global automotive industry shifts its focus from fuel - powered vehicles to electric vehicles, Ford, a veteran automaker from Detroit, realizes that this is not just a matter of replacing the engine. Electric vehicles require a whole new set of components, especially batteries, which means a new set of specialized production equipment and new production methods.

Managing the supply chains of both fuel - powered and electric vehicles simultaneously is no easy task. From being one of the ""Big Three in Detroit"" to implementing an ""all - electric strategy,"" Ford's transformation has been extremely difficult.

In May 2025, Ford's electric vehicle sales in the US market were only 6,723 units, a 25% decrease compared to the same period last year. Among them, the sales of the F - 150 Lightning plummeted by 42%, and the sales of the E - Transit were even more dismal. As a result, Ford cancelled an expected $12 billion investment in electric vehicles, cut more than 40% of the production plan at its Michigan battery factory, postponed the launch of its large electric pickup truck to 2027, and cancelled the launch plan of an SUV. Competitors like Tesla's strong grasp of battery technology, production processes, and supply chains also put great pressure on Ford.

However, this is not the only challenge Ford faces. Since the 1970s, the global manufacturing landscape has changed. Today's world stage does not shine the spotlight on just a few players. Emerging markets such as India, China, and Southeast Asia have risen rapidly in the past decade and become important driving forces in global manufacturing. Meanwhile, geopolitical factors such as trade frictions, economic decoupling, resource nationalism, technological sovereignty, and regulatory fragmentation are driving the restructuring of the global supply chain. In the vision of Industry 4.0, the way humans and machines collaborate is changing, and the application of AI in manufacturing is changing the roles and skill requirements of workers. Environmental challenges also require enterprises to adopt green technologies, optimize resource use, and improve waste management efficiency.

Ford has no choice but to keep up with the ""frontier"" and start renovating its old factories around the world. For example, the Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Michigan is being renovated to produce electric motors and electric transaxles, paving the way for its electric vehicle strategy. At its famous River Rouge Plant, which was built in the 20th century, Ford also built a new assembly plant dedicated to producing the all - electric version of the F - 150 pickup truck.

The factory transformation brought about by the electric vehicle business inevitably makes us think of the glorious Ford factories a century ago:

In 1904, the Piquette Avenue Plant was completed in Detroit. This was Ford's first self - built factory. It witnessed the birth of the legendary ""Model T"" and also witnessed Ford's early history of continuously conducting efficiency experiments and process optimizations in the factory. In 1909, the Highland Park Plant was completed. Here, Ford made its most famous contribution to industrial production - the Ford system, which gave birth to the world's first application of the automatic assembly line in large - scale industrial production. In 1920, the then - most modern ""super - factory,"" the River Rouge Plant, was built. It carried Ford's attempt at vertical integration in the automotive industry and witnessed the crucial moment of the rise and fall of the Ford system and the US manufacturing industry.

These factories were not only the most cutting - edge experimental bases in the 20th - century automotive industry but also gave rise to the ""mass consumption,"" ""middle class,"" and ""Modern Times"" that emerged around mass production, having a profound impact on production methods, corporate management, and social life forms.

Can Industry 4.0 lead the world to a new ""Ford moment""? What transformation challenges do the advancing factories face? Looking back at the Ford factories a century ago in the context of today's manufacturing industry, revisiting an important slice of 20th - century US manufacturing may provide inspiration for us to understand the evolution of factory management logic and the changes in manufacturing paradigms.

1904: The Piquette Avenue Plant, the Model T, and Edison - style Experiments

Figure 1 The Piquette Avenue Plant of Ford Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan, 1936

In the summer of 1904, when Ford Motor Company was one year old, Henry Ford celebrated his 41st birthday. This year, Ford finally had its first real car factory of its own.

The Piquette Avenue Plant is located in Detroit, Michigan. It has a brick - built structure in the late Victorian style, modeled after the New England textile mills, and is three stories high. There are three fire - proof doors inside the factory, and a 25,000 - gallon water tank on the roof supplies water for the automatic sprinkler system. It is one of the earliest buildings in the US equipped with a fire - fighting system. Ford spent $76,500 on building this new factory. As it turned out, this investment was completely worthwhile. At the Piquette Avenue Plant, Ford assembled seven early - model vehicles and later contributed to the birth of the most famous ""Model T."" Now, it is recognized as one of the most important automotive industrial heritages in the world.

The location of the Piquette Avenue Plant was carefully chosen. Two railway lines intersect nearby, and its neighbors include well - known automobile manufacturers such as Anderson Electric, Brush, and Cadillac. These unique and convenient conditions provided a solid foundation for the Detroit automotive industry, and Ford naturally benefited from them. After the factory was completed, Henry Ford, his wife Clara, and his son Edsel rented a duplex apartment a few blocks away from the factory. Ford usually walked or rode a bicycle to the factory, and his office was on the second floor.

However, visitors rarely saw Ford in his office. The Piquette Avenue Plant was producing several models simultaneously, including the Model B, Model C, Model F, Model N, Model R, Model S, and Model K. Ford was constantly arguing with the company's directors about one question: which model should Ford focus on producing?

In the early 20th century, cars were still regarded as toys for the rich, and most people wondered what use an ordinary family could have for a car. Therefore, some members of the board of directors were inclined to manufacture luxury cars for the rich to achieve higher profit margins. Ford, on the contrary, advocated producing simpler and cheaper cars - not just for the rich but for everyone. Although the profit per car would be lower, it might effectively expand the market.

In the first few years, the directors who believed that only the rich would buy cars won. In April 1906, Ford Motor Company launched a large and expensive car - the Model K. For some time, Ford had to focus on the design of the Model K, but he did not give up his vision. Soon, Ford bought out Alexander Malcomson's shares in the ""large - car camp"" and officially became the president of Ford Motor Company. Later, he designed and launched a new four - cylinder car - the Model N, which was almost exactly what Ford wanted.

By the end of 1906, Ford had sold 2,194 Model N cars to dealers across the United States. It undoubtedly became Ford's best - selling ""hit"" that year. But the experiments continued. There was still a long way to go before Ford's ideas were truly realized.

As different models were launched and production methods were improved, the existing space in the Piquette Avenue Plant was no longer sufficient. Charles Emil Sorensen, the head of the assembly department, oversaw the construction of an annex on the west side of the factory to meet the increasing work demand.

In January 1907, Ford ordered the establishment of a ""secret laboratory"" in the back corner of the third floor of the factory. There was a drawing room on one side of the laboratory, and on the other side, there were several machine tools, a blackboard, and Ford's mother's old rocking chair. Ford carefully assembled a research and development team and focused on developing new ideas in this ""secret laboratory."" Except for Ford, who was 44 years old in 1907, almost all the key members of the laboratory's R & D team were in their twenties. They conducted the initial tests of the new car prototype on the Model N chassis and redesigned the blueprints over and over again.

It wasn't until the spring of 1908 that Ford led the workers to build several complete new cars for testing. They were light, inexpensive, easy to drive and maintain, performed well on rough roads, and could accommodate five people. This was the Model T that fully met Ford's expectations.

Figure 2 A touring version of Ford's ""Model T,"" 1908

Ford personally took the Model T for a test drive. He drove the test car on a trip to northern Wisconsin and Michigan, climbed the stairs of the Tennessee State Capitol, and reached the peak of Pikes Peak. People were amazed by this inexpensive car that could perform all kinds of stunts. After passing the final test, the first Model T was completed on September 27, 1908, and was delivered to the first customer on October 1st.

At first, the production volume of the Model T was very small. Only 11 cars were produced in October. But by December, the monthly production volume had risen to 200. Soon, every available inch of space in the factory was dedicated to the production of this popular product. The engines and axles were assembled on the first floor, and light - processing work was done on the second floor. According to Ford's statistics, the first batch of Model T cars produced at the Piquette Avenue Plant totaled 12,000 units.

The Model T did bring an innovation of ""ease of driving"" to drivers. It placed the steering wheel on the left side, making it convenient for passengers to get in and out of the car. Its flexible gearbox allowed drivers to shift gears easily. It was the first model to cast the engine block and crankcase as one piece, the first to use removable cylinder heads for easy maintenance, and the first to widely use the light and strong vanadium - steel alloy. Early Model T cars also came with a tool kit for the driver, and car owners could optionally choose to install a windshield.

Figure 3 A 1911 - model Model T driving up the steps of the YMCA

In his memoir My Life and Work, published in 1922, Ford elaborated on his vision for the Model T: ""I will build a car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, yet small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. It will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one..."" Ford firmly believed in his concept. So, one morning in 1909, Ford announced to the entire factory that from then on, they would only produce one model, the Model T.

Regarding the Model T, Ford had a famous quote: ""Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black."" This is a direct proof of the innovation of the Model T. Cars gradually changed from being specific toys for the rich to standard products with a unified image, performance, and general operation modules. However, this design to improve production efficiency did not mean that all Model T cars had to be black. Before 1914 and after 1925, people could buy Model T cars in various colors, such as blue, red, gray, and green. By the early 1920s, more than half of the registered cars in the world were Fords, and the sales volume of the Model T exceeded 15,000,000 units. The success of the Model T truly brought the ""Ford concept"" into the US automotive industry.

Ford recalled that when the company was first established, the rented factory area was only 0.28 acres, and it employed only 311 people in the first year, manufacturing 1,708 cars. But four years after moving to the Piquette Avenue Plant, in 1908 when the Model T was officially born, the area of the Ford factory increased to 2.65 acres, the number of employees reached 1,908, and 6,181 cars were manufactured. The Piquette Avenue Plant became an important base for Ford's early production and innovation. It witnessed the birth of several legendary car models and the rise of the company, and at the same time, practiced the initial ""Ford concept.""

The purpose of the ""Ford concept"" is to reduce prices, increase production volume, and improve product quality. Among them, ""reducing prices"" is always given top priority. However, it is obvious that price reduction cannot be achieved easily. Ford invested a large number of experiments in every possible production process that could be ""better and cheaper.""

Actually, when Ford first started trying to build cars, he had been focusing on experiments to reduce the weight of the car. He believed that ""excessive weight would damage any self - propelled vehicle."" Reducing weight and eliminating unnecessary parts was Ford's consistent logic in his work. In 1905, at a racing event in Palm Beach, Ford accidentally picked up a valve stem from a scrapped French car and found that it was both light and tough. Ford knew that this was the key material he had been looking for to make the car lighter - vanadium steel.

Ford began to find someone to try to produce vanadium steel. The first batch failed, but the second batch was successful. Ford was overjoyed and immediately disassembled the existing car models to check the condition of each part and decide which type of steel was the most suitable. Ford believed that for the first time in the history of machine production, they scientifically determined the exact quality of steel. In this material optimization initiative, the strength and lightness of vanadium steel helped Ford cars shed a lot of weight. This is just one example of the numerous experiments Ford conducted on the way to his vision of a universal car.

""There must be a better way."" Ford promoted this ""foolish - charge"" experimental spirit throughout the entire factory. When someone told them that there was only one way to cast a certain part, Ford decided to try other methods. The first attempt always failed, but Ford and the workers ignored the failures. When an ""expert"" told them that there was no need to make changes, Ford asked this ""expert"" to leave the factory and decided to continue the experiments and overcome the failures. To some extent, this factory experimental spirit is an important foundation of the Ford concept and the premise for Ford to gradually reduce production costs and product prices and ultimately lead the transformation of the automotive industry.

But without the right frameworks, finance, and capacity, community energy in Australia could remain small scale and fragmented.","A moment of ambition and risk

The Australian Government has announced a new target to cut emissions by 62–70% below 2005 levels by 2035. Achieving this goal will depend heavily on the energy sector, which is expected to carry the lion’s share of the effort. Renewables already supply more than a third of Australia’s electricity, but the pace of rollout is falling short of what’s needed to stay on track for future targets.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has warned that transmission build-out is lagging; industry reporting confirms a sharp fall in large-scale renewable approvals since 2018. Connection queues are growing, and communities across the country have pushed back against new wind, solar and high-voltage transmission lines.

The social licence problem

Arguably, Australia’s renewables build out is being slowed not by technology, but by trust. Some research shows that most Australians support renewables in principle, but when projects land in people’s backyard, opposition can be significant. The Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner (AEIC) in their “Community Engagement” report observes that poor or absent engagement correlates with stronger local opposition, delays, and even legal challenges.

In Planning to engage the community on renewables: insights from community engagement plans of the Australian wind industry (Lansbury et al., 2020), an analysis of 32 wind farm engagement plans found increasing use of benefit-sharing practices, but also wide variation in how meaningful engagement is, and a gap between intention and actual practice.

NSW has established community funds for Renewable Energy Zones (REZs), and Victoria is proposing compensation for landholders near new lines. These are important steps, but some detail is still lacking, and more could be done to drive faster or more widespread uptake. Social licence shouldn’t be considered a secondary issue, it has become one of the most important determinants of whether Australia can build the infrastructure to meet its climate goals on time.

Community energy: a missing lever

Community energy refers to models where communities take a direct role in generation, storage, or energy sharing. This can take different forms, some include:

Shared ownership: local residents or councils hold equity stakes in projects.

Benefit-sharing: dedicated community funds, local bill reductions, or infrastructure upgrades.

Participatory governance: communities co-design siting, design, and revenue distribution.

Energy sharing: neighbours pooling solar, or accessing shared “solar gardens” or batteries.

In principle, these approaches can help align national ambition with local acceptance. They turn communities from passive consultees into active partners. Yet in Australia, such models appear relatively rare or small-scale (some exceptions include Hepburn Wind, Indigo Power, and the Haystacks Solar Garden).

What might be blocking community energy in Australia

Our research suggests that some of the barriers to greater uptake include:

No consistent enabling framework: Unlike the EU (which defines Renewable Energy Communities in law), Australia has no clear national policy framework giving communities rights to participate, share energy, or access markets on fair terms.

Uncertain financial pathways: Community projects cannot access dedicated development grants, low-cost loans, or tax reliefs. Scotland’s CARES program offers structured support, while Australian groups may not benefit from the same type of structured and long-term support.

Complex governance and legal structuring: Community groups often lack the legal templates, governance guidance, and risk-allocation models needed to negotiate shared ownership with developers - every deal is bespoke, adding cost and delay.

Voluntary, not mandatory, benefit-sharing: Current practice is guided in part by the Clean Energy Council’s Best Practice Charter, but there is no baseline requirement for developers to offer equity or revenue-sharing. By contrast, Denmark mandates a 20% local ownership offer for new wind farms.

Capacity and skills gaps in communities: Many local groups lack the technical, financial, and legal capacity to engage on equal terms with developers. Compressed consultation windows exacerbate the imbalance.

Retail and market design barriers: Community solar gardens, batteries, and peer-to-peer energy sharing face complex retail and tariff rules. Each project must negotiate bespoke retail contracts, undermining scalability.

Limited recognition in planning and approvals: Approvals frameworks don’t distinguish between developer-led and community-inclusive projects. There are no streamlined pathways or scoring uplifts for proposals embedding community ownership or benefit funds - so the system offers no incentive to go beyond the minimum.

Lessons from abroad

International practice shows these barriers can be overcome:

Finance frameworks: Scotland’s Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES), tax-relief schemes, and dedicated community benefit/share-ownership policies (e.g. UK Govt working paper Community benefits and shared ownership for low carbon infrastructure) offer examples.

Legal rights: EU law (via RED II and IEMD) requires legal status for energy communities and rights including energy sharing, equal market access and governance structures.

Mandatory/local ownership: Denmark has required developers to offer at least 20% ownership to local residents in new wind projects under its Renewable Energy Act 2008. Germany also saw wide co-operative ownership thanks to feed-in tariffs and favourable rules.

Capacity support: At EU level the Citizen Energy Advisory Hub (CEAH) will provide one-stop support with technical, financial, and governance advice. The Citizen-led Renovation (CLR) initiative (concluding in 2025) has strengthened citizen participation in building renovation and energy efficiency, while the new LIFE EnerCOM project (launched in September 2024) is expanding support for innovative community energy models. Without support for communities to engage (technical, financial, governance capacity), sharing offers or mandates are less likely to succeed. As an example, Ricardo led the Rural Energy Community Advisory Hub (RECAH) to help rural communities develop renewable energy projects, complementing wider EU initiatives like CEAH, CLR and LIFE EnerCOM.

Connection & planning reforms: EU/UK jurisdictions have simplified permitting/licensing for community energy groups; reduced regulatory burdens; and implemented priority grid access in some cases for small/community-led generation.

A call to action

The Australian Government’s new Net Zero Plan and sector strategies set out five national priorities: decarbonising the electricity system, electrifying wherever possible, switching to low-carbon fuels, driving innovation, and expanding carbon removals. Community energy is not explicitly named in these documents, yet it directly supports several of these pillars. By embedding shared ownership, participatory governance and local benefit-sharing into renewable projects, community energy can accelerate renewables deployment, build social licence for transmission, and make household and community-level electrification more affordable and inclusive.

For community energy to become more than niche, Australia needs to take a more active and supportive stance. Possible policy support and reform could include:

A national enabling framework defining Renewable Energy Communities in law

A finance stack: grants, loans, and tax relief to de-risk community equity

Mandatory benefit-sharing baselines for renewables and transmission

Priority connection and streamlined planning for projects with verified community participation

Dedicated capacity-building for communities and First Nations partners

Scaling REZ community funds into a standard national model

Australia’s climate targets and REZ rollout create the right conditions. The question now is how to make community energy a core enabler of the transition, not an afterthought.

International evidence shows it can accelerate deployment, reduce resistance, and strengthen social licence. But without the right frameworks, finance, and capacity, community energy in Australia could remain small scale and fragmented. With them, it can become a cornerstone of delivering on Australia’s 2035 and 2050 goals.

Ricardo’s work leading major initiatives on community energy and citizen-led energy renovation has shown how to embed participation into national systems through policy advice, advisory hubs, financial innovation, and citizen engagement. This experience demonstrates how structured frameworks and inclusive models can accelerate renewable uptake while building fairness and trust - lessons directly relevant to Australia’s transition.",https://www.ricardo.com/media/siln1sru/aerial-drone-view-of-the-hybrid-gullen-solar-farm-and-gullen-range-wind-farm-for-renewable-clean-energy-supply-located-at-bannister-in-the-upper-lachlan-shire-nsw-australia.jpg?width=1200&height=630&v=1dc2c23922d6bc0,N,,2025-09-23 08:00:14.968970

What’s more, some new or fully redesigned vehicles may not have yet been put through their paces.
Cut-rate financing deals are typically reserved only for those having stellar credit ratings.","Electric vehicle sales surged to a record 146,332 units in August as buyers flocked to dealerships to take advantage of the one-time $7,500 federal tax credit (which can also be taken at the point of sale like a rebate) before it expires on September 30.

While only a relative handful of EVs that meet certain requirements for domestic production and price limits qualify for the incentive, many automakers have managed to exploit a loophole in the tax credit legislation that passes all or part of the $7,500 to those leasing an EV that otherwise doesn’t qualify for the credit. And automakers are also pumping up sales by offering some unbeatable cash rebates and cut-rate financing deals that could likewise go away on October 1.

But as with any vehicular acquisition, making the switch from gas to battery power should not be made on a whim. In addition to considering an EV’s sticker price, energy consumption, operating range on a charge and the aforementioned incentives, shoppers should also consider a given EV’s safety ratings.

To that end, 11 current models passed all of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s (IIHS) rigorous evaluations and were designated Top Safety Picks (TSP), with all but one earning the tougher Top Safety Pick+ (TSP+) award.

To earn top marks in the IIHS’ rigorous ratings system, a given model must excel in in all of its crashworthiness tests, including front and side-impact crash tests, and both driver- and passenger-side offset frontal crash tests that replicate an offset collision between two vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

Award recipients must also include highly-rated forward emergency automatic braking systems that can help avoid collisions with both other vehicles and pedestrians in both daytime and nighttime driving. What’s more, top-ranked vehicles must offer headlight systems that are deemed as being “Acceptable” or “Good” as standard equipment.

The IIHS gives models that receive Good marks in most of the above criteria its “Top Safety Pick” designation, but with a second-best Acceptable mark for the recently upgraded side-impact test. Those that also ace the latter test get the organization’s “Top Safety Pick+” honors.

On the down side, the IIHS tends to concentrates its testing efforts on the industry’s best-selling vehicles, which often leaves out big-ticket luxury models. What’s more, some new or fully redesigned vehicles may not have yet been put through their paces.

To help safety-minded EV shoppers we’ve compiled the below list of the IIHS’ top-rated battery-powered models along with the special offers on each that can save last-minute buyers a bundle through the end of September.

The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.","After much anticipation and several months of evaluation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has decided to keep the landmark Biden-era rule extending Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) liability to certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—otherwise known as “forever chemicals.” This announcement comes amid an industry lawsuit challenging the rule, which has been stayed for months while the Trump Administration’s EPA reconsidered whether it wanted to continue defending the designation.

What are the relevant PFAS?

PFAS are synthetic chemicals used in many products and materials by a broad range of industries—from cosmetics to textiles—because they resist heat, water, and oil. Given their widespread use, these chemicals are relatively ubiquitous at low levels and have been detected in soil, sediments, groundwater, and surface water at many sites. The EPA rule at issue focuses on two PFAS specifically, PFOA and PFOS, given their widespread use and prevalence in the environment.

What does the rule do?

The EPA’s April 2024 rule designates PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. The rule establishes substantial reporting requirements for PFOA and PFOS releases, allows the EPA to initiate response actions without showing imminent and substantial endangerment, and perhaps most importantly, allows parties to pursue reimbursement or contribution claims for cleanups of these two substances. CERCLA’s strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability regime is particularly concerning in the context of chemicals like PFOA and PFOS that are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to degradation.

More details on the rule’s specific requirements can be found in analysis from the Alston & Bird team here and here.

What’s the rule’s current status?

After the rule went into effect in July 2024, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and industry groups petitioned for review by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that the agency had wrongly applied CERCLA and did not adequately assess the costs and benefits extending Superfund liability to PFAS contamination. With the Trump Administration’s arrival, the EPA moved for a stay in February 2025, and the case has been paused since then while the agency decided whether to continue defending the rule.

In its September 17 motion this week, the EPA asked the court to lift the stay. Attached to the motion was a declaration from a senior adviser to the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management stating that the agency will continue to “engage with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.” This goal of protecting so-called “passive receivers” raises significant questions, including the criteria for determining which entities qualify, the scope of protections provided, and the potential of unintended consequences on enforcement actions and cost allocations at sites where these entities are involved. The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.

The decision to retain the PFAS Superfund rule contrasts with other Trump Administration actions to relax PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act and push back compliance deadlines under similar legislation.

Next Steps

As litigation against the rule proceeds, companies and stakeholders should follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels, where prominent leaders in both branches have supported measures to keep the rule but excuse so-called “passive receivers” from liability. For now, companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams, be mindful of potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions, and stay informed on potential liability that may arise from real property investments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 23:59:12.548638

Revolution Wind is being developed as part of a joint-partnership between the Danish energy company Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, a division of Global Infrastructure Partners.
Both developers sued the Trump administration earlier this month in an effort to lift the stop-work order, which officials said was costing the project up to $2.3 million per day.
“The Trump Administration should see the writing on the wall with this decision and drop its defense of their indefensible actions,” Tong said.
Kathy Hochul agreed to relent on her state’s opposition to several gas pipeline projects in exchange for the Trump administration allowing the wind project to continue.","This story has been updated.

Work on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project was allowed to resume on Monday, after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had failed to justify its sudden decision last month to halt all offshore construction on the $6 billion project.

In particular, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said that the government has yet to provide any new information to back up its claims that the project — which is more than 80% completed — poses a severe risk to national security.

Any potential impacts on national security were already reviewed as part of the project’s years-long permitting process, Lamberth said. Without any apparent basis with which to reverse its prior approvals, he said the government’s stop-work order represented “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”

“If Revolution Wind cannot meet its deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse,” said Lamberth, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by President Ronald Reagan.

“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm,” he added.

The Trump administration did not immediately say whether it plans to appeal the ruling. In a statement Monday, Department of the Interior spokeswoman Elizabeth Peace said the agency will continue to investigate any potential national security and other concerns as work resumes on the project.

“The Department of the Interior remains committed to ensuring that prior decisions are legally and factually sound,” Peace said.

Revolution Wind is being developed as part of a joint-partnership between the Danish energy company Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, a division of Global Infrastructure Partners. Both developers sued the Trump administration earlier this month in an effort to lift the stop-work order, which officials said was costing the project up to $2.3 million per day.

Much of the work on Revolution Wind is taking place at the State Pier in New London, where workers are tasked with preparing pieces of the massive turbine shafts and propeller blades to be loaded onto specialized ships and carried out to the assembly area off the coast of Block Island.

Once completed, the project is expected to supply 704 megawatts of carbon-free power to the New England electric grid supported by power-purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island.

In a statement after the judge agreed to the developers’ request for a preliminary injunction, Revolution Wind spokeswoman Meaghan Wims said that work on the project will resume “as soon as possible.”

“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” of the underlying lawsuit, she said.

In addition to the lawsuit brought by the developers, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island jointly sued the Trump administration over its decision to issue halt work on Revolution Wind. While that case remains pending in federal court in Providence, Tong issued a statement on Monday calling Lamberth’s ruling a “major win” for the the state.

“The Trump Administration should see the writing on the wall with this decision and drop its defense of their indefensible actions,” Tong said. “Every day that this project is stymied is a day of lost employment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach.”

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement Monday, “The court’s decision restores momentum toward bringing clean, local power to New England, strengthening our energy security, and supporting thousands of jobs across the region. We applaud the court for upholding the rule of law and rejecting a reckless attempt to sabotage clean energy progress that will slash bills and toxic pollution.”

Lamberth’s ruling came at the start of a critical week for the project that has been stalled since Aug. 23.

In an affidavit filed with the federal court in Washington D.C. earlier this month, Ørsted’s senior engineering, procurement, and construction director Paul Murphy said the developers have a tight window this year to make use of several specialized transportation and installation ships contracted to work on the project. Once those ships depart to work on other scheduled projects, he said, it could be years before they are available to return.

In addition, offshore weather conditions during the winter pose a “significant risk” to workers, making further delays more likely.

If work on the project does not resume by the end of September, Murphy said that Revolution Wind risked missing its deadline to begin supplying power by the end of 2026. That could result in the developers having to forgo “billions of dollars” of revenue through power-purchase agreements, and may force them to cancel the project altogether.

“Revolution Wind currently has no mechanism for extending those deadlines, and the [power-purchase agreements] would be subject to termination, significantly threatening the financial viability of the entire Project and posing an existential risk to the Project, and thus to Revolution Wind,” he said

Officials in Connecticut were quick to praise Monday’s ruling, with many noting the number of jobs tied to the project along with projections of lower electric costs once Revolution Wind begins producing power.

“The Trump Administration offered no credible facts — not a shred of evidence — to support a continued stop work order that deprives thousands of workers of jobs and Connecticut consumers of more affordable energy,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement. “None of the government’s trumped-up arguments have factual or legal weight. While I am pleased with today’s ruling, construction should be permanently permitted to go forward, and workers should be allowed back to the site. The Trump Administration’s irresponsible pandering to the fossil fuel industry cannot be permitted to persist in wasting taxpayer and consumer dollars.”

After the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued its stop-work order in August, Gov. Ned Lamont said he reached out to officials within the Trump administration in an attempt to negotiate a deal that would allow work on the project to resume.

When the federal government halted work on similar wind farm under development in Brooklyn this spring, Lamont noted, it was widely reported that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to relent on her state’s opposition to several gas pipeline projects in exchange for the Trump administration allowing the wind project to continue. (Hochul has denied to making such an explicit agreement.)

In his efforts to get a deal, however, Lamont said he was repeatedly met with silence from federal officials.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Lamont expressed satisfaction with the judge’s decision to issue an injunction.

“I haven’t had a chance to follow up with Ørsted yet to see what the timing is, but it’s good news on behalf of the consumers and bringing down the price of electricity and honoring a contract with Ørsted that goes back to the first Trump administration,” Lamont said.

Renewable energy can unlock opportunities and change lives

Aid budgets are under pressure and every concessional dollar must stretch further. Meanwhile, climate change is advancing and global instability looms.

As leaders gather in New York for the UN General Assembly and Climate Week, these crises demand an answer to the hard question of how and where limited capital can work to deliver the greatest growth and global resilience.

The answer is renewable energy.

Access to electricity is the foundation of modern prosperity. No country has achieved broad economic development without it.

Electricity drives education, industry and public health. It powers irrigation pumps for farmers, refrigeration for vaccines, and digital tools for entrepreneurs.

Yet, nearly 700mn people still live without electricity. Billions live with access that is unaffordable or unreliable. At the same time, climate change is worsening risks such as flooding and drought that often hit energy-poor communities hardest.

Without decisive action and co-ordinated efforts, climate change will accelerate, entire countries will be locked out of the energy-enabled economy, and global instability will intensify.

But there is a path forward. Clean electricity can unlock opportunity and change lives.

I have met farmers in Kenya irrigating crops using solar pumps; entrepreneurs in Nigeria expanding their businesses; innovators in India pioneering new technologies; utilities in Indonesia emboldened to integrate renewables; and world leaders committing to ambitious national energy transition plans.

I have also seen far too many places where a lack of electricity and the means to use it is holding back communities and economies.

A recent report from the International Renewable Energy Agency found that 91 per cent of renewable energy projects are now cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. It predicted pronounced cost declines in Africa, Asia and South America.

Yet, according to the International Energy Agency, only a fifth of global clean energy investment goes to emerging markets and developing economies.

Catalysing private funding

The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, which includes organisations from the public, private and philanthropic sectors, released a report on Monday that lays out how governments, businesses, philanthropies and non-profits can work in consort to accelerate clean energy uptake. This growth can create jobs, improve prosperity, manage climate change, and drive lasting, systemic change — even in this constrained funding environment.

The alliance has supported 137 clean energy projects across more than 30 developing economies. But one of the report’s most striking findings is that philanthropic investments of $503mn in catalytic funding have unlocked $7.8bn from private investors and development banks for projects that are either already deployed or ready for deployment.

In a world of shrinking aid budgets, that multiplier is not a luxury, it is essential.

In Nigeria — home to the world’s largest population without electricity access — philanthropic capital is catalysing large-scale public and private investment and building a pipeline of interconnected solar-powered, mini-grid projects that will serve hundreds of thousands of people.

Here, the GEAPP has deployed flexible grant funding and technical support to launch a pilot project with the non-profit RMI. At the same time, local utilities have worked to prove their commercial viability. And the World Bank, persuaded by the early evidence and improved developer capacity, committed $127mn in concessional finance, with expectations of mobilising substantial additional funding, including $190mn in private capital.

This model of alliances in action shows how even in a constrained environment, we can drive progress at the speed and scale the world demands.

Even with the best intentions, if we work in silos, fail to integrate community level inputs or recognise the technical capacity needs of governments, and assume that infrastructure automatically leads to economic advancement, change will not happen.

Renewable energy access offers a clear path to shared, equitable, sustainable prosperity. It delivers jobs, competitiveness and carbon reductions in a single package. But no single organisation has all the answers.

We are making great strides together and we must all — governments, investors and philanthropies — stay focused on deepening our collaboration.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/ae0cd714-4490-4ea1-aabd-4f1ecaf1e1ed.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 22:58:44.954656

Mike and his car club friends were in downtown Stillwater earlier this year, on their way back home to the cities.

""We were thinking about stopping to get a bite to eat at one of the various pizza places in town,"" Mike said.

A group of six cars stopped at the traffic light right across from a gas station. The light turned green.

""Here I am, at the back of the line. I make my way to the front. The light turns red. I stop,"" Mike said.

A Minnesota State Patrol trooper, driving in the opposite direction, was also stopped at the light.

""The State Trooper looks at me. I look at him. As he drives by, we make eye contact. He continues, flips, pulls me over,"" Mike said.

The car he was driving was a 2025 Dodge Daytona, an electric vehicle. It has a fratzonic chambered sound mechanism.

""You can rev it, but you have to be in park to rev it,"" Mike said.

The car is equipped with three modes. The sport mode gives motorists the visceral feeling of an eight-cylinder Muscle car.

""Speakers on the outside and speakers on the rear,"" Mike said.

Mike tried to explain the speakers to the trooper, but he wouldn't listen and issued the citations.

""I didn't want to argue with him, so I said, 'I'll see you in court,'"" he said.

Mike has been waiting for a court date since June. The ticket still isn't in the Washington County court system. In the meantime, a video of the interaction that was posted online has gone viral.

""We didn't really expect it to blow up overnight. I was heading out to Chicago the very next day ... and, like, my phone is blowing up,"" he said. ""I would hope the trooper realized his mistake and didn't submit or write up the ticket.""

Without the tax incentive to encourage EV purchases, the electric vehicle industry obviously will take hit.

So will auto buyers who insist on sticking with more environmentally friendly private transportation.

And if past purchases and EV tax credit claims are an indicator, drivers in two staunchly red states will feel the loss of the tax break.

EVs popular in populous states: California, not surprisingly, has the most registered electric vehicles by a large margin. The latest U.S. Department of Energy data shows 1,256,646 EVs on the official rolls.

The Golden State has long been the leader on environmental matters. It’s hefty gasoline tax also no doubt convinces a lot of drivers to switch to alternative fuel autos.

But two other states with Trump administration supporting leadership and overall voting populations that lean conservative come in second and third.

Florida had 254,878 EVs, with Texas accounting for 230,125.

And recent research by the online lending marketplace LendingTree found that drivers in these three states will lose the most from the end of the EV tax credit.

Almost $4 billion claimed in EV credits: EV inclined drivers in those three states obviously will face difficult decisions about whether to buy without a tax break.

Overall, after analyzing Internal Revenue Service data on individual income tax returns filed and Clean Vehicle Credits claimed, LendingTree found that in tax year 2023, Americans filed 487,990 returns claiming the EV tax credit. Those claims totaled $3.3 billion.

Another 28,180 returns included claims for the pre-owned EV credit. Those used car credits totaled $95.6 million.

The maximum possible EV tax credit for a new vehicle is $7,500. The average credit claimed on the returns LendingTree examined was $6,709. For used EVs, which could get a possible $4,000 maximum tax break, the average credit claimed was $3,392.

Potential costs for CA, TX, and FL drivers: California would be hardest hit by the expiration of the new EV tax credit, as it leads in total claims and national share.

Californians submitted 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit in tax year 2023, or 32.2 percent of the tax break claims, according to the LendingTree findings. California also led in used EV tax credit claims, accounting for 23.2 percent of the overall filings for the pre-owned auto tax benefit.

Over a year, Californians could miss out on an estimated $1.1 billion in EV tax credits when the federal incentive ends, according to the study. That includes credits for new and used electric vehicles.

Texans filed 38,870 EV tax credit claims. That produced $272.7 million in savings for those drivers.

Florida claims came to 30,090. Those filings accounted for $201.4 million in tax savings on EV purchases.

Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst, says those credits are big, especially when you consider how expensive vehicles are today.

“That these credits could often be taken at the point of sale makes them even more significant,” says Schulz. “It’s one thing to have to wait until the following spring to get a rebate with your tax refund. It’s something else to be able to knock thousands of dollars off the price of a vehicle from the start. I have no doubt that those credits inspired people who may not otherwise have considered an electric vehicle to at least think about them.”

From Fears to Discoveries The journey of the electric vehicle through the consumer’s eyes is a story of transformation.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer confined to prototypes or niche markets. They are entering mainstream conversations across industries, governments, and households. Yet, the real story of adoption cannot be understood solely through statistics on sales or production. At the heart of the transition lies the consumer: the individual who weighs risks and rewards, who is both skeptical and curious, and whose decisions ultimately determine the pace at which electromobility reshapes global transportation.

This article explores the electric vehicle through the consumer’s eyes, delving into their fears, expectations, and discoveries. By understanding these dimensions, we can better assess the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for policymakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure providers.

1. Fears: The Psychological and Practical Barriers to EV Adoption

Although EV adoption is accelerating worldwide, surveys consistently reveal that consumers harbor significant concerns that slow down decision-making. These fears are not irrational; rather, they reflect real gaps between the promises of technology and the realities of infrastructure, affordability, and information.

1.1 Range anxiety

The most cited concern is “range anxiety” — the fear of running out of battery power before reaching a charging station. For decades, drivers have been conditioned by the ubiquity of gasoline stations, where refueling takes minutes and locations are predictable. In contrast, charging infrastructure is still unevenly distributed, especially outside urban centers.

Even though modern EVs often offer ranges exceeding 400km per charge, perception lags behind reality. For consumers, it is not only about the maximum advertised range but also about how that range varies with driving style, weather conditions, and the use of auxiliary systems such as heating or air conditioning.

1.2 Charging time and convenience

Another obstacle lies in charging time. Fast-charging technology has improved significantly, reducing charging sessions to 20–30 minutes for an 80% charge in many models. Yet, consumers still compare this to the five minutes needed at a gas pump. The idea of waiting — even with amenities at charging hubs — remains a barrier, especially for drivers who rely on their vehicles for long commutes or professional use.

1.3 Battery degradation and replacement costs

Consumers often express uncertainty about the durability of EV batteries. Will the performance of the battery decline significantly after a few years? How much will replacement cost, and will warranties cover it? Despite evidence that most EV batteries retain the majority of their capacity after eight years or more, the perception of rapid degradation remains strong, fueled by early-generation EVs and anecdotes.

1.4 Purchase price and affordability

Price is perhaps the most tangible concern. Even though total cost of ownership (TCO) often favors EVs due to lower fuel and maintenance costs, the upfront purchase price is typically higher than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. For middle-income consumers, this remains a decisive factor, especially in markets with limited government incentives.

1.5 Resale value and technological obsolescence

Rapid technological advances create an additional layer of uncertainty. Potential buyers worry that their EV may lose value quickly as newer models enter the market with longer ranges, better software, and faster charging. This fear of obsolescence mirrors consumer behavior in the smartphone industry, where yearly upgrades shift perceptions of value.

2. Expectations: The Consumer’s Vision of EVs

While fears are powerful, they coexist with a set of expectations that motivate interest and exploration. Consumers view EVs not only as vehicles but as symbols of a broader shift in technology, lifestyle, and environmental responsibility.

2.1 Environmental responsibility and sustainability

For many, EVs represent a tangible way to reduce personal carbon footprints. Consumers increasingly expect that their purchasing choices should reflect their values, and sustainability is central to that equation. Surveys show that younger generations, in particular, associate EV ownership with climate action and social responsibility.

2.2 Affordability through incentives and innovation

Consumers expect that governments and manufacturers will work together to make EVs more affordable. Subsidies, tax breaks, reduced registration fees, and free access to urban toll zones are all incentives that shape expectations. At the same time, many consumers anticipate that technological progress will naturally reduce costs, much like the declining price trajectory of smartphones and solar panels.

2.3 Convenience and infrastructure parity

The ideal consumer expectation is parity with ICE vehicles in terms of convenience. That means charging stations should be as abundant and reliable as gas stations, and charging times should continue to decrease. Home charging is often viewed as a potential game-changer, offering unmatched convenience for those with access to private parking.

2.4 Innovation and digital integration

Consumers expect EVs to be more than just cars with batteries. They envision vehicles integrated into digital ecosystems: smart navigation that optimizes charging stops, over-the-air software updates, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and seamless connectivity with smartphones and smart homes. In many ways, EVs are perceived as “computers on wheels,” and consumers expect a level of innovation that justifies the transition.

2.5 Status and lifestyle

In certain markets, EVs are associated with status and modernity. Just as early adopters of smartphones were seen as forward-thinking, EV owners often view their choice as a statement about being aligned with innovation, sustainability, and the future of mobility.

3. Discoveries: When Perception Meets Reality

The most transformative part of the consumer journey occurs when individuals move from abstract concerns to firsthand experiences. Test drives, ownership, and peer influence all play critical roles in reshaping attitudes.

3.1 The driving experience

One of the most surprising discoveries for new EV drivers is the quality of the driving experience. Instant torque provides rapid acceleration, while the absence of engine noise creates a smoother, quieter ride. For many, these features turn EV driving into a revelation.

3.2 Range anxiety diminishes with experience

Surveys reveal that actual EV owners report significantly lower levels of range anxiety than those who have never driven one. Daily commutes are often well within the range of most EVs, and home charging eliminates the need for frequent public charging. This discovery helps normalize EV use and gradually reduces fears.

3.3 Financial benefits over time

Consumers who track their expenses often discover substantial savings in fuel and maintenance. EVs have fewer moving parts, no oil changes, and reduced wear on brakes thanks to regenerative braking. Over the vehicle’s lifetime, these savings can offset the higher initial cost, reinforcing the economic case for adoption.

3.4 Lifestyle integration

Discoveries extend beyond economics and performance. Many owners integrate EVs into broader lifestyle choices, such as pairing home solar panels with EV charging or participating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) programs. These experiences deepen the sense of being part of a sustainable, technology-driven movement.

3.5 Community and identity

EV ownership often fosters a sense of belonging to a community of early adopters and innovators. Online forums, local clubs, and shared charging experiences create social value that goes beyond the utility of transportation.

4. Regional Perspectives on Consumer Adoption

4.1 Europe: Incentives and urban restrictions

European consumers often face strong policy-driven incentives. In cities like Oslo, EVs benefit from free tolls, parking privileges, and access to bus lanes. These measures not only reduce fears but also align with expectations of convenience and cost savings. Discoveries in Europe often revolve around the seamless integration of EVs into daily urban life.

4.2 North America: Lifestyle and infrastructure gaps

In the United States and Canada, consumer adoption varies by region. While California leads with incentives and infrastructure, other states lag behind. Consumers often fear limited charging availability during road trips but discover the benefits of home charging for daily use. Lifestyle and status also play a role, with Tesla serving as a cultural symbol of innovation.

4.3 Asia: Affordability and mass adoption

China demonstrates how large-scale infrastructure investment and aggressive government policies can reshape consumer perceptions. Fears are mitigated by widespread charging networks, while expectations are fulfilled by affordable domestic models. Discoveries in China often highlight the practicality of EVs in densely populated cities.

4.4 Latin America: Early adoption challenges

In Latin America, consumers often face high upfront costs and limited infrastructure. Fears about affordability dominate, while expectations center on government support and future infrastructure growth. Discoveries, for now, are concentrated among early adopters who value environmental responsibility and status.

5. The Role of Communication and Education

Bridging the gap between fears and discoveries requires effective communication. Misinformation about battery degradation, exaggerated concerns about charging times, and lack of awareness of incentives can all slow adoption. Transparent data, consumer education campaigns, and hands-on experiences such as test drive events are critical tools for reshaping perceptions.

6. From Fears to Discoveries

The journey of the electric vehicle through the consumer’s eyes is a story of transformation. It begins with fears rooted in uncertainty, evolves through expectations shaped by values and aspirations, and culminates in discoveries that redefine mobility.

Manufacturers, governments, and infrastructure providers must recognize that this journey is not only technological but also emotional. Addressing practical concerns, fulfilling expectations, and facilitating positive discoveries will determine the speed of EV adoption worldwide.

That’s in peril unless tech companies and utilities demand more transparency and opt for more renewables like solar and wind energy.
There could also be some double or triple counting (or more) going on when it comes to forecasting AI energy demand because of developers approaching more than one utility to get several quotes.
Despite the uncertainty, they’re still building out new gas power plants and pipelines to meet that demand.
Tech companies clearly have a big role to play, too, by improving the energy efficiency of their technologies and investing in renewables.","Even if AI turns out not to be as much of an energy hog as people are making it out to be, it could still spell out trouble for power grids across the US.

Tech companies are already burning through increasing amounts of electricity to train and run new AI models. And they’re asking for a lot more electricity as they try to outcompete each other. That rising demand is already starting to reshape the energy system, with utilities scrambling to build out new gas plants and pipelines.

But all these plans to reshape the US energy system could be based on an AI bubble. With overexcited investors pumping money into tech companies afraid of missing the bandwagon but still at risk of developing AI tools that ultimately flop, utilities are also faced with a wave of speculation over data centers’ energy needs.

“The uncertainty is unnerving”

The uncertainty is unnerving considering the costs that Americans could wind up paying when it comes to higher utility bills and more pollution, a recent report warns. A transition to cleaner and more affordable energy sources has been making progress slowly in the US. That’s in peril unless tech companies and utilities demand more transparency and opt for more renewables like solar and wind energy.

“While the AI boom provides exciting opportunities, there are many risks to not approaching energy needs with a deliberate and informed response that takes long term impacts into account,” Kelly Poole, lead author of the report published this month by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow and environmental organization Sierra Club, said in a briefing with reporters.

The nation’s fleet of gas-fired power plants would grow by nearly a third if all of the new gas projects proposed between January 2023 and January 2025, as the generative AI industry heated up, come to fruition. The amount of new gas capacity that utilities and independent developers proposed jumped by 70 percent during that time frame, driven in large part by rising data center electricity demand.

Prior to the generative AI boom, electricity demand had pretty much flatlined for more than a decade with energy efficiency gains. But new data centers, souped-up for AI, are a lot more energy-hungry than they have been in the past. A rack of computers in a traditional data center might use 6-8 kilowatts of power — roughly equivalent to the power used by three homes in the US, Dan Thompson, a principal research analyst at S&P Global, explained in the briefing. AI, however, requires more powerful computer chips to run more complicated tasks. The power required to run one of those high-density racks equals about 80 to 100 homes’ worth of power, or upward of 100 kilowatts, according to Thompson.

“Essentially what you’re looking at is a small town’s worth of power being deployed,” he said.

Why does that matter? Power grids basically function as a precarious balancing act. If power supply can’t meet demand growth, it could lead to higher utility bills and potential outages. On the other hand, overbuilding new capacity risks creating stranded assets that utilities and their customers wind up paying for regardless of whether or not they actually need them in the long term. That’s why it’s so important to try to get an accurate forecast of future demand.

“Essentially what you’re looking at is a small town’s worth of power being deployed.”

And while AI does use a lot of energy, projections for the future get murky. “Speculators are flooding the market,” the report says, seeking to build and flip data centers. Trying to get ahead of long wait times to connect to the power grid, some of those speculators are requesting power even before they’ve got the capital or customers lined up to ensure they can bring a project to the finish line. There could also be some double or triple counting (or more) going on when it comes to forecasting AI energy demand because of developers approaching more than one utility to get several quotes.

In the Southeast, a major hub for data centers, utilities are projecting as much as four times more demand growth compared to independent analyses of industry trends, according to a report earlier this year from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Nationally, utilities are preparing for 50 percent more demand growth than the tech industry is expecting, a separate report from December 2024 states.

Utilities themselves have recognized this risk on recent earnings calls. Proposed projects trying to connect to the grid “may be overstated anywhere from three to five times what might actually materialize,” Jim Burke, CEO of Texas-based Vistra Energy, said in a Q1 earnings call this year.

Despite the uncertainty, they’re still building out new gas power plants and pipelines to meet that demand. After all, building new infrastructure is one of the most lucrative ways for a utility to increase profits. And right now, the Trump administration — whose campaign was buoyed by oil and gas contributions — is incentivizing reliance on fossil fuels. In Louisiana, for example, local utility Entergy proposed building three new gas plants to power a giant new Meta data center. The data center is estimated consume as much electricity as 1.5 million homes and lead to 100 million tons of carbon emissions over 15 years.

It’s a stark contrast from the Biden administration’s goal of getting the power grid to run on 100 percent carbon pollution-free energy by 2035. The only way to stop climate change in its tracks is to get rid of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels. Building a rush of new gas infrastructure obviously moves the nation in the opposite direction.

There are solutions to minimize all these risks, As You Sow and Sierra Club point out in their report. Utilities can require developers to disclose the number of other utilities they’ve brought their data center proposal to and how far along they are in finalizing a project. When inking contracts, they can also require long-term service agreements, hike-up nonrefundable deposits, and raise fees for canceling a project.

Tech companies clearly have a big role to play, too, by improving the energy efficiency of their technologies and investing in renewables. For years, tech giants including Amazon, Meta, and Google have been top corporate purchasers of renewable energy. Inking those kinds of long-term agreements to build out new solar and wind farms can have even more impact now, counteracting the Trump administration’s rollback of financial incentives for renewables, if companies are willing to prioritize their own sustainability goals as much as their AI ambitions.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2190030422.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-09-22 20:02:13.249061

American Antimony Corporation (OTCID:XTPT), operating as Xtra Energy Corporation, is pleased to announce that Chairman & CEO, Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., has completed an on-site visit with the Company's field team at the IHX Zone, part of the flagship American Antimony Project in Nevada's historic Bernice Canyon District.

The visit focused on evaluating surface stockpiles and near-surface mineralized material across the IHX Zone and the adjacent King Solomon and Antimony King targets. During the review, the team identified and initiated further testing of approximately 6,700 tons of mineralized material at the IHX Zone, with the objective of commencing initial commercial sales of antimony ore.

Additional site visits are scheduled, during which the team will conduct inspections and volumetric assessments of the other stockpiles previously identified by the field team. These visits will also provide critical data for the permitting process required to support the timely, staged removal of the additional piles.

On-Site Assessment Highlights

Up to 6,700 Tons Targeted - Includes stockpiles identified during the 2025 drilling program and 2024 sampling campaigns.

Bulk Sampling in Progress - Representative material is being collected at the end of September to ship for mill scale recovery tests under Metallurgical Testing Agreements (MTAs) with a prospective mill partner and buyer.

3rd Party Lab Accredited Assay Results from Stockpiles: -

Antimony King: ~42.9% Sb (429,366 ppm Sb); Au 0.09 g/t; Ag 6.6 g/t; As 148 ppm

King Solomon: ~24.7% Sb (247,431 ppm Sb); Au 0.22 g/t; Ag 23.1 g/t; As 125 ppm

IHX: ~2.5% Sb (24,915 ppm Sb); Au 0.06 g/t; Ag 2.7 g/t; As 226 ppm

Low-Arsenic Advantage - Confirmed consistently across drill core and surface samples, arsenic levels remain in the tens to low hundreds of ppm, supporting favorable metallurgy compared to many global peers.

Commercial Pathway - Positive metallurgy and offtake results would position the Company to finalize direct sales agreements, establishing an early revenue stream from U.S.-sourced antimony ore while broader exploration and resource definition continue.

CEO Commentary

""Our on-site review at the IHX Zone underscores that the American Antimony Project is not only a world-class exploration opportunity, but also a near-term commercial pathway,"" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO. ""The antimony at IHX sits near the canyon entrance, making it readily accessible for shipment and processing. This oxidized surface stockpile is rich in stibnite, and further testing, validation, and permitting to lift up to 6,700 tons of material represent the next step in proving we can deliver clean, U.S.-sourced antimony to the market. This initiative is designed to enhance shareholder value by advancing early revenue generation while simultaneously expanding the Project's long-term resource base.""

Strategic Importance

Antimony is a federally designated critical mineral, essential for:

Defense applications (munitions, armor, flame-retardant systems)

Semiconductors and battery technologies

Energy storage and industrial alloys

With the United States currently 100% import-reliant on foreign antimony-primarily from China and Russia - the American Antimony Project is one of the few emerging domestic supply sources capable of strengthening U.S. critical mineral independence.

This update demonstrates that American Antimony Corporation is executing a dual-track strategy: near-term commercialization of high-grade stockpiles alongside long-term expansion of a district-scale antimony resource in Nevada.

Environmental groups are facing an unprecedented battering from a Trump administration hell-bent on tearing down regulations, rolling back Biden-era climate policies and expanding drilling and mining for fossil fuels.

On top of that, the White House is pledging to crack down on left-leaning nonprofits, possibly by revoking their tax-exempt status or launching racketeering investigations.

It’s all added up to a crushing year for many environmental groups, which are also coping with disappointing fund raising, internal divisions, adverse court rulings, last year’s electoral wipeout for their Democratic allies and the failure of GOP moderates to hold the line on clean energy spending. And now, two camps have emerged on how climate activists should revive their deflated movement, writes my colleague Zack Colman.

On the one side are groups that want to weave their climate message into a broader anti-billionaire campaign led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). That movement depicts the Trump administration as dismantling democratic norms and regulations to give more power to a ruling class of wealthy elites.

A second faction wants to continue the path of former President Joe Biden, who championed climate action as an engine to revive U.S. manufacturing, generate jobs and blunt high costs for consumers by pouring billions into clean energy technologies.

Both approaches are on display at New York City’s annual Climate Week, which kicked off Sunday and corresponds with the United Nations General Assembly, which convened earlier this month. This past weekend saw both a “Make Billionaires Pay” march in Manhattan, as well as a gathering led by environmental activist Bill McKibben touting solar power.

But many in the environmental movement are scrambling for new ideas.

“The same playbook isn’t going to work and is not working,” Mel Smith, a spokesperson with the climate activist group 350.org and one of the lead organizers for last weekend’s march, told Zack. “We are not winning — which doesn’t mean that we still can’t win.”

That could mean organizing smaller gatherings across the country instead of trying for massive marches, for example, or paying social media influencers to promote clean energy, Zack wrote.

Seeing a losing battle against President Donald Trump, some groups are boosting their state organizing. One example is a “Make Polluters Pay” initiative that has seen New York state and Vermont pass laws meant to force oil, gas and coal companies to pay for damages from disasters like storms linked to climate change.

The Trump administration has asked a judge to strike the Vermont law, but organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council are pushing similar bills in Maryland, Illinois, California and New Jersey.

“People don’t have a lot of optimism that we’re going to make huge changes at the federal level,” Margie Alt, director of Climate Action Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups, told Zack. “The stuff this administration has done has really chilled people.”

Clean energy opportunity?

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking for leverage in government shutdown negotiations to fund clean energy, writes Amelia Davidson.

Congress left for a weeklong recess without passing a continuing resolution to keep the government open past Sept. 30. Now, Trump appears poised to meet with Democratic leaders — presenting an opportunity to negotiate, Schumer said Monday.

Democrats’ message, he said, is that “Trump is shutting down the government by not negotiating with Democrats on health care — we’re saying health care because everyone agrees with that — and clean energy.”

Revolution Wind can resume construction

A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind, throwing a lifeline to the embattled project, writes Benjamin Storrow.

The Interior Department halted the $6.2 billion project in August, citing national security concerns. But Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia called the order “the height of arbitrary and capricious.”

Revolution Wind, which is 80 percent complete, is the latest target of Trump’s anti-wind agenda. Lamberth said the issues Interior cited for stopping the project had been reviewed for years as part of the permitting process. The federal government, he said, failed to provide any factual findings for why it believed the project was no longer in compliance with its permit.

Big year for battery storage

Batteries that can store and release large amounts of electricity are seeing record growth as developers look for quicker options to meet increasing demand, Brian Dabbs and Christa Marshall write.

Battery storage is expected to account for a quarter of installations to the grid this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They’re providing backup to wind and solar, allowing users to tap them when they need power. That means they can take the place of fossil fuel plants that would normally be tapped for electricity at night.

“Batteries and solar are like peanut butter and jelly,” said Mark Dyson, managing director for carbon-free electricity with clean energy think tank RMI. “There’s a natural diurnal cycle to the sun, obviously, and also therefore to how batteries are going to be operating most economically.”

What's new: The Supreme Court ruled that fuel producers have standing to challenge California’s EPA-approved regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles because “commonsense economic principles” show the regulations caused harm to the fuel producers that could be redressed by invalidating the regulations. But the decision leaves open the question whether vacatur is a valid remedy under the APA.

Why it matters: This decision makes it easier for businesses indirectly affected by regulations to challenge them, reducing the need for expert or other evidence to prove standing.

What to do next: The decision leaves unresolved the limits of standing for entities further removed from direct regulation. It does suggest, however, that an entity further removed from a regulation can bolster its claim for standing with evidence in the record of a regulation’s impact on the entity.

__________

In Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court held that fuel producers have standing to sue the Environmental Protection Agency for approving California regulations that would require automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles than they would under ordinary market conditions. In particular, the Court held that the fuel producers showed redressability, because if the regulations are invalidated, automakers will likely manufacture and sell more gasoline-powered cars, thus increasing demand for liquid fuel.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court emphasized that when the possibility of redressability turns on the actions of third parties, courts may rely on commonsense economic principles to predict what those third parties are likely to do if the court grants the requested relief. That inquiry includes consideration of how actors will behave at various points along the chain of production.

The June 20, 2025, ruling is an important victory for businesses that, while not themselves directly regulated, nevertheless suffer economic injuries from, and may wish to challenge regulation up or downstream of their position in the marketplace. At the same time, the ruling contains reminders about the importance of nonetheless developing record evidence. It also leaves unanswered questions about the scope of vacatur under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

Background

The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set emissions standards for certain air pollutants from new motor vehicles. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7521(a)(1). To promote uniformity in those standards, the Clean Air Act generally preempts state standards “relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.” Id. § 7543(a). But there is one important exception: Subject to EPA approval, California may adopt more stringent emissions standards under certain limited circumstances, id. § 7543(b)(1)(B), and other states may choose to adopt California’s stricter emissions standards instead of hewing to the EPA’s standards, id. § 7507.

Since 2005, California has attempted to use its unique position to address global climate change by limiting greenhouse-gas emissions and encouraging the production of more electric vehicles, with mixed success. As presidential administrations have changed, so too have the EPA’s views. Under Republican administrations, the EPA has found that California’s authority to set its own emissions standards is limited to addressing local or regional pollution — and that it does not extend to combatting global climate change. But under Democratic administrations, the EPA has allowed California’s regulations to take effect.

History and Facts of Diamond Alternative Energy

This case involves California’s 2012 request for EPA approval of regulations that would require automakers to (1) limit the average greenhouse-gas emissions of new vehicles sold in California, and (2) manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles. Under President Obama, the EPA allowed California’s regulations to take effect in 2013. But during President Trump’s first term, the EPA rescinded approval in 2019. During President Biden’s administration, the EPA reinstated approval of California’s regulations in 2022. To date, 17 States and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s emissions standards, accounting for about 40% of the American market for new cars.

After the EPA reinstated approval of California’s regulations in 2022, several fuel producers sued the EPA in the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the EPA lacked authority under the Clean Air Act to approve the regulations because California’s emissions standards target not local pollution, as authorized, but rather global warming. These fuel producers manufacture and sell liquid automobile fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.

To support standing, the fuel producers argued that California’s regulations depress demand for their fuel because they require the manufacture and sale of vehicles that use less (or no) liquid fuel. Thus, the manufacturers argued, invalidation of the EPA’s approval of California’s regulations would redress their injury, at least in part, because car manufacturers would once again produce and sell more gas-powered vehicles.

California intervened in the litigation to defend its regulations, emphasizing their importance to “meeting California’s emissions-control goals.” For example, California argued that, without the regulations, it expected fewer electric vehicles to be produced and sold, meaning there would instead be more gasoline-powered vehicles that would in turn produce higher greenhouse gas emissions. After the D.C. Circuit granted California’s motion to intervene, however, California argued that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing because, it claimed, consumer demand for electric vehicles was “surging,” and vehicle manufacturers would not “make more gasoline powered vehicles” even if a court were to invalidate the regulations.

The D.C. Circuit agreed with California and held that the fuel producers lacked standing. That court reasoned that “redressability depended on how third-party automakers would act in the absence of California’s fleet-wide emissions standards and electric-vehicle mandate.” Since the fuel producers failed to demonstrate that the automakers would produce more gasoline-powered vehicles if the regulations were invalidated, the court concluded that the fuel producers lacked evidence of redressability to support Article III standing.

Majority Opinion

In an opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit’s decision, concluding that the fuel producers have standing to challenge the EPA’s approval of California’s regulations.

The Court began by explaining that the “‘irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements’: injury in fact, causation, and redressability” (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). Here, there was no real dispute that the fuel producers showed injury in fact or causation. The regulations likely caused monetary loss to the fuel producers by decreasing demand for gasoline and other liquid fuels. The only question was whether the fuel producers had shown redressability. As to that element, the Court concluded that, if the EPA’s approval of California’s regulations were invalidated, it would likely redress “at least some of the fuel producers’ monetary injuries,” because it would likely “result in more revenue for the fuel producers from additional sales of gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

The Court described this case as presenting the “familiar circumstances where government regulation of a business may be likely to cause injuries to other linked businesses.” In other words, “when the government regulates (or under-regulates) a business, the regulation (or lack thereof) may cause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others in the chain.” See FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 379 (2024). In those circumstances, the Court held, it is appropriate to consider “commonsense economic principles” when analyzing the predictability of third-party behavior for the purpose of redressability. And here, those commonsense economic principles supported finding that invalidating California’s regulations would likely redress the fuel producers’ injury. Following that relief, manufacturers would likely produce more gasoline-powered automobiles, leading, in turn, to greater sales of liquid fuels.

The Court observed that record evidence supported that commonsense conclusion. California estimated that its regulations would produce “substantial reductions in demand for gasoline,” and recognized that “fuel providers would likely be most adversely affected by the regulations due to the resulting substantial reductions in demand for gasoline.” And automakers who have invested heavily in electric vehicles and who intervened on the side of the EPA and California predicted that, “absent California’s regulations, other automakers would seek a competitive advantage over them by selling fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles.” Thus, the “totality of record evidence” “make[s] it sufficiently predictable that invalidating California’s regulations would likely redress the fuel producers’ injury.”

Importantly, the Court clarified that the fuel producers did not need to introduce expert evidence to show redressability — all they needed to show was “a predictable chain of events.” The upshot, in the Court’s words, is that “[t]he government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders.”

Dissenting Opinions

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the Court should not have granted certiorari to begin with. She suggested that the D.C. Circuit’s standing analysis relied on a misunderstanding about the duration of California’s regulations. Thus, in her view, the Court should “simply have vacated the case and remanded it to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its redressability analysis” with the corrected timing in mind.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, too, arguing that the Court has not applied its standing precedents “evenhandedly,” and that its failure to do so “erodes public trust in the impartiality of judicial decisionmaking.” In particular, Justice Jackson reasoned that the Court is more lenient with “moneyed interests” as opposed to “ordinary citizens.” The majority responded to this critique by citing standing cases over the last few years that, it said, disprove her argument, such as a case where the Court found that an inmate on death row had standing to challenge the prosecutor’s refusal to provide DNA testing, see Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), and a case where the Court found that several medical associations lacked standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, see FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 374 (2024).

Justice Jackson further asserted that this case did not warrant the Court’s attention because it “will soon be moot” because the EPA under the Trump administration is likely to change its position and revoke approval of California’s regulations anyway. Justice Jackson criticized the majority for stretching to find redressability in this case, and questioned what the majority of justices called “commonsense.”

Implications and Open Questions

The Court’s decision is important because it clarifies what unregulated entities must show to establish standing to challenge agency regulations that cause them economic harm. Specifically, the decision makes clear that courts may rely on commonsense economic principles about how rational actors will behave in the marketplace in order to predict the consequences of requested relief. Thus, unregulated entities who suffer economic injuries from the regulation of linked businesses can use commonsense inferences to establish redressability, and they do not need to present expert evidence to that effect.

“Predictable” versus “speculative” inferences. One open question, however, is how courts will draw the line between “predictable” and “speculative” inferences for potential plaintiffs that may be further attenuated from the regulated entity in question. For example, the Court suggested that a hot dog manufacturer would be able to sue if the government banned hot dog sales in stadiums, because the stadium regulation would adversely affect hot dog sales. But what about the hot-dog bun manufacturers? The condiment manufacturers? The company that makes the hot-dog sized disposable trays?

It is unclear to what extent courts will accept “common sense” in the place of record development, particularly where the questions become more speculative. Although the Court said expert evidence may not be necessary given common sense, the Court’s reliance on record evidence, and disagreement with the D.C. Circuit, are good reminders, to borrow Voltaire’s old saw, that common sense may not be so common.

Common sense was arguably clear in Diamond Alternative Energy: California’s about-face on the effect of its regulations underscored the obviousness of predictable economic results. In seeking to intervene before arguing that the producers lacked standing, California had itself emphasized those results — so much so that the Court’s response was reminiscent of the distaste it has expressed in other cases when a litigant “speaks out of both sides of its mouth.” Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 97 n.5 (2023). Most cases, in contrast, are unlikely to involve clear support for standing by the party opposing standing — and the Court’s ruling is a good reminder about the strategic and credibility concerns with making such contradictory (but not alternative) arguments.

Validity of vacatur. Another open question concerns the continued validity of the fuel producers’ requested relief: vacatur of the regulations under the APA. The APA permits courts to “set aside” agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), but there is an ongoing academic debate about whether that language permits courts to vacate agency action. The Court in Diamond Alternative Energy avoided wading into that debate, instead adopting the lower courts’ interpretation without endorsing it. In a footnote, the Court explained that “[u]nder D.C. Circuit precedent, setting aside EPA’s approval would mean that California may not enforce its greenhouse-gas emissions limits and electric-vehicle mandate for new vehicle fleets” — i.e., the court would vacate the EPA’s approval of the regulations.

That remedy, however, looks similar to so-called “universal injunctions,” which the Court in Trump v. Casa held “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.” Vacatur, like the universal injunction, enables a court to grant relief that is not tailored to the parties before it. The question thus remains whether vacatur is likewise unlawful.

As it turns out, the answer to that question is probably outcome-determinative here, because the fuel producers can obtain relief in this case only if the APA authorizes vacatur of the regulations. That’s because the fuel producers are not themselves a regulated entity — the automakers are. So an injunction barring enforcement of California’s regulations against the fuel producers would not afford the fuel producers relief because they aren’t regulated by California’s rules in the first place.

Instead, the fuel producers “can obtain meaningful relief only if the APA authorizes vacatur of the agency rule, thereby remedying the adverse downstream effects of the rule on the unregulated plaintiff” — here, the fuel producers. See Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). (See our September 2024 article “Supreme Court Decisions Curtail Regulatory Agencies’ Powers, Making It Easier To Challenge Rules.”) Indeed, the fuel producers recognized as much—counsel for the fuel producers admitted at oral argument that vacatur was the only way to redress their injury. Nevertheless, the Court assumed that vacatur is a lawful remedy and avoided wading into that thorny question here.

The “object” of a regulation. Somewhat relatedly, the Court left open the question of whether the fuel producers could be considered the “object” of the California regulations, because the regulations “explicitly seek to restrict the use of gasoline and other liquid fuels in automobiles,” even though they don’t regulate the fuel producers directly.

Whether a party is the “object” of a regulation matters because the Court has long held that, “[w]hen a plaintiff is the ‘object’ of a government regulation, there should ‘ordinarily’ be ‘little question’ that the regulation causes injury to the plaintiff and that invalidating the regulation would redress the plaintiff’s injuries” (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 461). Because the fuel producers demonstrated standing through common sense inferences and record evidence, however, there was no need for the Court to resolve that question in this case.

We will continue to monitor developments in the D.C. Circuit on remand and in other courts of appeals in response to the Court’s decision.

By Jamie Martin

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that small farms remain essential to both the national food system and the stability of rural communities. Faith Parum, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, explains that the USDA classifies a small farm as one earning under $350,000 in gross cash farm income annually. This figure reflects total revenue before costs. With typical expenses of about $200,000, many small farms ultimately earn only around $45,000.

Parum emphasizes that the term “small farm” is different from “family farm.” The former measures financial size, while the latter describes who owns and operates the farm. Nearly 86 percent of American farms qualify as small by income, and about 97 percent are family owned, whether by individuals or partnerships.

Beyond producing food, small farms serve as economic lifelines for rural regions. They create jobs, generate steady revenue, and help keep vital institutions such as schools, hospitals, and small businesses open. Parum notes, “They sustain these communities in terms of revenue into the community, but also jobs, workforce.”

By supporting services and providing employment, small farms ensure rural communities remain vibrant places to live and work. Their combined contributions prove that even with limited size and income, small farms are key to the health of the U.S. farm economy and the well-being of families across the nation.

Methane is a colorless, odorless gas and a significant driver of climate change as it is 28 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. New Mexico passed rules in 2021 and 2022 to require producers to track and capture 98% of the gases. The EPA issued additional rules under the Biden Administration, which President Donald Trump has vowed to roll back, prompting pushback from states, including New Mexico.

Lujan Grisham said she hopes the state can be a leader on the issue, as the federal government moves to implement more regulations cuts for industry.

“I don’t have a good ready statement except that I believe New Mexico won’t be one of those places that can be strong-armed to do the wrong thing for the people that we serve,” she said.

But the findings — which include data collected by nine satellites and validated by the Environmental Defense Fund — still show that New Mexico is projected to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than its 2030 goals set forth in an executive order issued by Lujan Grisham in 2019.

Efforts to enshrine those goals into law in recent sessions have failed, and the Lujan Grisham administration is running out of time to pass them, given the 2026 30-day session will be the last of her second term.

The Environmental Defense Fund noted that New Mexico’s methane emission rate is still “appreciably high,” and that additional efforts would need to be in place to reduce emissions. Oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled since 2020.

Lujan Grisham acknowledged that “we are seeing a drastic reduction in our greenhouse gases methane, but it’s not where we have to be by 2030.”

\New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney said the state would work with EDF to close the 9% gap and meet the 2030 emissions reduction goal.

“This partnership, this ability to work together, to develop the science, to work with regulators, to then implement what we’re learning will show that there is not a lack of leadership around climate in the United States – it’s actually happening within the states,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MLG-Presser-Sept.-22-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 19:00:23.712490

To drive growth in industries such as low-carbon steel, cement, chemicals, and aluminum, several countries in recent years have begun using contracts for difference policies.

Without greater federal support to advance domestic competitiveness, American manufacturing is at risk of falling behind in global markets that value energy-efficient, low-carbon industrial production. Contracts for difference could be an efficient tool for providing this support. However, to date, there is little experience in the United States with contracts for difference policy.

A group of experts across fields and organizations came together to write a report, published by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy today, that explores the potential of a US contracts for difference policy. It evaluates contracts for difference as a policy tool to boost innovation and low-carbon American manufacturing and outlines design considerations for policymakers. Our coauthors on the report are Seton Stiebert, Yuqi Zhu, William Shobe, Benjamin Longstreth, Aaron Bergman, and Chris Bataille.

Contracts for difference lower the risk of capital-intensive projects by providing price certainty.

In the context of industrial decarbonization, a contract for difference is a contract in which a manufacturer and a government agree on a guaranteed price—the strike price—over a given period for low-carbon products or materials for which the government seeks to increase production. The government agrees to pay the manufacturer the difference between the strike price and the market price. Unlike a long-term contract or power purchase agreement, however, the government does not procure the product or material; it simply provides the financial boost for innovation in the market.

For example, suppose a low-carbon steel mill has a contract for difference guaranteeing $600 per ton and the market price drops to $550 per ton for a given period. In this case, the producer receives an additional $50 per ton from the government for that period. In some cases, contracts for difference also require the producer to pay the government the difference if the market price rises above the strike price (as Figure 1 illustrates, this depends on whether the contract is designed to be one- or two-sided). The strike price is usually determined through a competitive auction in which the government awards the contracts to eligible projects with the lowest-cost bids.

As a first step, policymakers can examine whether there is authority to create a contracts for difference program under existing federal law. The most straightforward path, however, may be for Congress to enact federal legislation authorizing such a program.

Our report details the program elements that policymakers must consider, such as eligibility requirements, auction design, and the adjustability of the strike price, among others. It also compares contracts for difference to other policy options. While the program’s overall impact would depend heavily on its scope and the level of government investment, an ambitious, well-designed program could help jumpstart American innovation and put domestic manufacturers on a better path to compete and lead globally in industries central to the transition to a low-carbon economy.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2420518787_16x9.width-600.png,N,,2025-09-22 20:00:13.206597

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said.
Electricity prices also increased during the Biden administration, due both to inflation and increasing energy demand, but they had fallen from their high point by the time Biden left office.
Biden and the Democrats hoped that their signature clean energy policy, included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would help increase supply and make energy more affordable.
When asked if he believed that restoring support for clean energy could be included in a budget deal, Schatz said he felt it would take longer.","With U.S. households paying 10 percent more per kilowatt hour for electricity than they did at the start of this year, Senate Democrats sought Monday to tie the increasing pain for consumers to the Trump administration’s relentless rollback of clean energy policy.

“Trump and Republicans are doing what the American people hate most, and that is raise costs,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in a conference call from Climate Week activities in his home state. “From skyrocketing electricity prices to ever-increasing homeowner insurance premiums because of climate change to healthcare.

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said. “They’re making it much worse, and the American people are realizing it.”

Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a leading Democrat on climate policy, said the increase in power prices—now occurring at twice the rate of inflation—can be traced to the administration’s decisions to stop clean energy projects and Congress’ repeal of federal support for renewable energy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which it passed in July. Natural gas projects are backlogged because of supply chain issues and nuclear and geothermal power, which still get support under the new law, will take a long time to catch up with the increasing demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence.

“Even if there were no planetary emergency, the most logical energy to put on the grid, because it is the cheapest and the fastest to get done, is wind and solar, with battery storage,” Schatz said. “We are going to keep talking about this, because the unfortunate thing is that this doubling of energy prices against the rate of inflation, we’re kind of at the bottom of this mountain. It has been spiking, but this is before the real spike in load comes.”

The senators’ remarks come as the Trump administration has been escalating its assaults on clean energy—issuing a series of stop-work orders for offshore wind projects and putting a stop to coal plant retirements. That’s on top of the instability that is rippling throughout the clean energy industry due to the impact of the repeal of federal subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which many experts predicted would increase costs. Trump’s tariffs on raw materials also have raised costs throughout the energy industry.

Electricity prices also increased during the Biden administration, due both to inflation and increasing energy demand, but they had fallen from their high point by the time Biden left office. Biden and the Democrats hoped that their signature clean energy policy, included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would help increase supply and make energy more affordable.

The Trump White House and the Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks by Schumer and Schatz. But earlier this month, Jarred Agen, the executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, defended the moves to eliminate federal support for renewables.

“I think it was given unfair preferential treatment in the past, particularly in the last administration,” Agen said in a conversation at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank. “What the president and I think the team at the White House is the most against is, obviously, just the American taxpayer covering the cost of the intermittent energy that is not producing what it has promised to produce and there is not the return of investment.

“It’s the tax subsidies that have really kept these afloat for a long time and basically the president is saying enough is enough,” Agen said.

But the cost of renewable energy has plummeted in recent years, which has allowed it to better compete against fossil fuel power—especially coal. Most analysts expect clean energy to continue to grow when the subsidies are phased out, just not quickly enough to meet the U.S. climate goals that were set under Biden.

And it’s not only consumers but workers who are feeling the pain of Trump policies, the Democrats said. They pointed to a new report by the advocacy group Climate Power that calculated that more than 80,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the sector this year; $42 billion in private investment has been lost or delayed.

“We were blindsided by the news that the project was being halted,” said Tom Kilday, an apprentice electrician on the Revolution Wind project off of Rhode Island that was hit with a Trump stop-order work. A member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he joined the Democratic senators to describe how union workers were being affected.

“Thousands of workers like myself don’t know if we will still have a job in a week, or a month,” Kilday said. “And we’re a hard-working group of people … We’ve all taken hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of classes in our careers to develop our craft and expand our knowledge.”

Within a couple hours of the news conference, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered a stay of the Trump order that allowed work to restart—at least for now—on Revolution Wind, which is 80 percent complete and was expected to be providing enough electricity for 350,000 homes in New England by next year.

Schumer said that because the Inflation Reduction Act spurred even more clean energy projects in Republican and purple states than in Democrat-led states, he believed the issue of what is happening in the industry can and should be addressed in negotiations he has called for with Trump and Republicans in order to head off a federal government shutdown. Congress must pass either a budget deal or a “continuing resolution,” or CR, by Sept. 30 to keep the current budget in place.

So far it is not clear such negotiations will take place. When asked if he believed that restoring support for clean energy could be included in a budget deal, Schatz said he felt it would take longer. “We’re like 10 days before the end of the federal fiscal year, so an energy provision in a CR is, I think, vanishingly unlikely,” he said. “But I do think there’s deal space over the next six months to alleviate the pain.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2208599443-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 19:00:15.487269

Key Takeaways

The number of EV charging points in the U.S. grew from 15,000 in 2013 to an estimated 193,000 in 2024, more than a 12-fold increase in just over a decade.

By 2030, the U.S. is expected to reach about 550,000 charging points, with an average of 58,000 new chargers added each year.

As electric vehicles (EVs) gain traction in the U.S., the charging infrastructure to support them is racing to keep pace.

EV chargers are the critical piece in the EV ecosystem to enable more widespread adoption and everyday usability.

This visualization is part of Visual Capitalist’s VOLTage Week, sponsored by Tema ETFs. It visualizes the number of EV charging points in the U.S. by year from 2013 to 2024, with a forecast for 2030 using data from the IEA and J.P. Morgan.

EV Chargers in the U.S. Have Surged Since 2013

In 2013, the U.S. had just 15,000 EV charging points. That number has skyrocketed to 193,000 by 2024, and by 2030 the U.S. is forecasted to have 550,000 EV chargers installed across the country.

The data table below shows the total number of installed EV chargers in the U.S. every year from 2013 to 2024, along with a forecast for 2030:

YearEV Charging Points in the U.S. 201315,000 201420,000 201532,000 201639,000 201746,000 201861,000 201977,000 202098,000 2021113,000 2022129,000 2023160,000 2024193,000 2030F550,000

The surge of the past decade has been fueled by growing EV adoption as more companies enter the market, government incentives, and infrastructure programs aimed at reducing range anxiety and supporting green transportation.

EV Chargers’ Rapid Growth from 2020 to 2024

The growth in EV chargers has steadily accelerated since 2013, however since 2020 the number of added chargers each year has consistently been in the tens of thousands.

2020 was the first year where more than 20,000 chargers were added, with 21,000 added, and then between 2022 and 2024 alone, the U.S. added 80,000 new chargers.

The Road to 2030

Projections show the number of EV chargers in the U.S. reaching 550,000 by 2030. To meet this target, the U.S. will need to install roughly 58,000 new chargers annually.

While the annual installed average is around 16,100 since 2013, since 2020 the average is around 23,200.

While this is far off from the 58,000 figure, growth is expected to continue accelerating, and is essential to meet EV driver demand across the country.

Chart: What’s Powering New U.S. Electricity Generation?

This was originally posted on our Voronoi app. Download the app for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.

Key Takeaways

Between 2025 and 2026, renewables account for the lion’s share of new U.S. electricity additions.

Solar accounts for 50% of new U.S. electricity generation, driven by declining prices supporting its cost competitiveness.

By contrast, natural gas makes up just 8% of new additions, while remaining fossil fuel sources of energy make up less than 0.2% of the total share.

U.S. electricity generation is decarbonizing as demand for green power surges.

In the next two years, renewable sources will power 92% of new electricity capacity. Driving this shift are massive investments from big tech companies to scale their AI infrastructure, requiring a huge amount of power to run and cool data centers.

This visualization is part of Visual Capitalist’s VOLTage Week, sponsored by Tema ETFs. It shows where new U.S. electricity capacity is coming from, based on data from the EIA via J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Breaking Down New U.S. Electricity Generation

Below, we show planned U.S. electricity additions by source for 2025 and 2026:

Source% of Additions 2025-2026GW Added Solar50%63.3 Batteries30%38.0 Wind12%15.2 Natural gas8%10.1 Other0.2%0.3

Total Additions100%126.5

As we can see, solar power accounts for 50% of new capacity additions in the next two years.

While natural gas continues to be the leading source of electricity in the U.S., solar is rapidly growing. In 2024, solar power additions hit a record 37 gigawatts (GW) in new capacity compared to 1 GW of new capacity for natural gas-fired power.

With 30% of new capacity, battery storage follows next. In the next two years, new storage capacity is set to reach 38 GW of power, with projects concentrated in Texas and California.

Meanwhile, the majority of U.S. electricity retirements are coal (55%), natural gas (37%), and oil (8%) through to 2026.

The Louisiana Workforce Commission will also be able to disqualify people from receiving unemployment benefits if they don’t show up for a scheduled job interview.","Louisiana businesses will pay less in unemployment taxes following an across-the-board reduction to jobless benefits that took effect at the beginning of this year.

The employer tax will drop from approximately $98 to $89 per employee making at least $7,700 per year starting Jan. 1. For most businesses, the change should work out to approximately 9% in tax savings.

At the same time, maximum benefits for the unemployed will increase 2.5% from $275 to $282.

The changes are the result of the expectation that Louisiana’s unemployment insurance trust fund will reach $1.2 billion in August 2026. A projected balance of $1.15 billion automatically triggers the reduction in employer taxes and a boost in benefits under state law.

The modest bump in weekly unemployment payments won’t make up for a much larger cut in those benefits that went into effect at the beginning of this year, however.

Unemployed people eligible for maximum benefits will receive $84 to $140 more per year as a result of the discussed change, but those same workers are expected to lose over $3,600 in benefits this year.

Through a new law passed last year, Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana lawmakers reduced the cap on receiving unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 12 or 20 weeks, depending on the state unemployment rate.

As a result, people who were previously entitled to $7,150 in unemployment support annually will only be able to receive $3,384 to $5,640 per year moving forward. The length of time a person can receive unemployment benefits is now tied to the state unemployment rate.

When the average unemployment rate is under 5%, as it is now, a person can only receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 weeks. As the unemployment rate rises, the length of time a person can receive benefits lengthens until it reaches a maximum of 20 weeks when the rate is 8.5% or higher.

Another set of new requirements will also come into play Dec. 31 under another new law.

People seeking unemployment benefits will have to prove they have done five searches for work for every week they expect to access a payment. Currently, they are required to show three work searches under state rules.

BATWorks Bolsters Mayor Adams’ Efforts to Create a ‘Harbor of the Future’ in New York City, Fulfills Key Commitments in “Green Economy Action Plan”

BROOKLYN, NY—New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) today announced the next steps in advancing BATWorks, a cutting-edge climate innovation hub at Brooklyn Army Terminal (BAT) in Sunset Park, with Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) hosting a series of inaugural climate programming events during Climate Week NYC that more deeply tie LACI’s national programs to New York City and BATWorks. Throughout the week, LACI—a cleantech incubator created as an independent nonprofit organization by the City of Los Angeles—will host programming to bring industry leaders, climate entrepreneurs, investors, and the Sunset Park community together to spark new connections and raise opportunities for partnerships and financing, while exploring strategies to attract green businesses to operate at BATWorks or at the BAT campus. Additionally, event programming at BATWorks will share progress on the pilots soon-to-deploy across New York City in support of city-identified climate goals as part of the City Climate Innovation Challenge—helping cities solve challenges while helping startups commercialize technology, accelerate equitable climate action, and create economic opportunity. See a full list of the week’s events and programming.

As a complement to the introductory events hosted by LACI, NYCEDC unveiled new branding for the world-class innovation hub and new plans for a temporary BATWorks welcome and leasing center, ocated at the BAT campus entrance on 1st Avenue.

First announced in Mayor Adams’ 2023 State of the City address, the world-class BATWorks hub will provide start-ups with space for product research and development, as well as offer workforce training and job placement programming to New Yorkers. Last May, NYCEDC announced that a consortium led by LACI and the Cambridge Innovation Center (CIC) will design and operate BATWorks. NYCEDC’s $100 million investment in BATWorks will help create over 600 jobs, serve 150 startups over 10 years, and generate $2.6 billion in economic impact for the city. The hub continues Mayor Adams’ efforts to turn the city’s waterfront into a “Harbor of the Future” and support entrepreneurs and leaders developing, piloting, and deploying new solutions to combat climate change, and advances a key commitment in the Green Economy Action Plan.

“I cannot think of a more fitting way to kick off NYC Climate Week 2025 than with LACI officially launching programming at New York City's new cutting-edge climate innovation hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal,” said NYCEDC President & CEO Andrew Kimball. “Building on the city's Green Economy Action Plan, BATWorks will unlock new opportunities for startups, advance innovative climate solutions, fuel job growth, and strengthen Brooklyn’s green working waterfront, and NYCEDC is incredibly proud to see this vision coming to life.”

“We are thrilled to host inaugural events during Climate Week NYC to help NYCEDC introduce the future climate innovation hub at BATWorks,” said LACI President and CEO Matt Petersen. “These events will also showcase how the nation’s two largest cities are working together on climate innovation by bringing together key speakers from Los Angeles and New York City, as well as introduce LACI’s national programs including NCCEI, the LACI Debt Fund and the Challenge and how these programs are moving climate innovation forward across the country to better create opportunities for regional innovation organizations, help underrepresented founders access working capital, and work with cities and startups to scale key solutions.”

LACI is advising NYCEDC on climate programming, including future cleantech startup incubation and workforce development initiatives. Over the next 12 to 18 months, LACI will engage key climate and innovation organizations in the region as well as community leaders in Sunset Park. Starting in 2026, LACI will lead “Pilots at BAT,” a program where emerging climate technology companies can test their products in a live-built environment. While CIC—a global leader in building and operating innovation campuses—will design work and laboratory spaces as well as programming to support innovation and attract start-ups. The awarded consortium also includes The City University of New York (CUNY), New York University (NYU), and Perkins&Will.

NYCEDC announced plans for a temporary BATWorks welcome and leasing center located at BAT campus entrance on First Avenue, while construction is underway on the permanent hub. In the temporary hub, LACI will focus on activating the BAT campus through piloting, building programmatic partnerships at BAT across the city’s climate tech ecosystem, hosting events for an array of related stakeholder groups, and developing plans for startup incubation and workforce training to take place at BAT. The permanent BATWorks climate innovation hub will be located in BAT Building A and is currently scheduled to open in 2028.

Sunset Park’s waterfront district in South Brooklyn, with its rich industrial history, robust infrastructure, diverse tenants, and strategic access to major transportation networks, is uniquely positioned to serve as a hub for clean energy and sustainable manufacturing. BAT, as a whole, is home to over 100 tenants that collectively employ 4,000 New Yorkers. NYCEDC has invested nearly $450 million in the site to date—with more than $300 million of that investment currently in the pipeline—to bring new leasable space online and modernize this historic campus, as well as improve open space, common areas, and additional campus infrastructure.

BATWorks is a crucial part of the larger Harbor Climate Collaborative—a joint initiative between NYCEDC, the Trust for Governors Island, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation—to link together tech piloting, tenanting, and programming opportunities across all three organizations and promote climate innovation. By unlocking 6 million square feet of space, the Collaborative will support the creation of 5,000 permanent jobs, educate and train 2,100 students, and generate $55 billion in economic impact. In addition to the $100 million available for BATWorks, the Adams administration and NYCEDC are also transforming the nearby city-owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal into one of the largest offshore wind port facilities in the nation, which broke ground in 2024.

“BATWorks is an exciting step toward an economy where climate solutions and economic opportunity grow together, giving more New Yorkers access to promising careers,” said Brooklyn Workforce Innovations (BWI) Executive Director Aaron Shiffman. “BWI is proud to be collaborating with EDC and the BATWorks partners in this important work.”

“BATWorks at Brooklyn Army Terminal is an incredible opportunity to imagine the reuse of an historic building into a vehicle for the future of innovation and workforce development in New York City,” said Perkins & Will Managing Partner Robert Clemens. “With it's unique position along the waterfront, BAT is also poised to play a key role in the iterative evolution of the Blue Highway, an alternative concept to bring back the importance of water-borne transportation to link Brooklyn to greater New York and beyond. One of the key interventions that our whole team is envisioning is an iconic gathering space, unique to this project, where people can come hear about the innovation happening at BATWorks and also to gather as a community, reinforcing the identity of Sunset Park and it's vision of the future.”

NYCEDC’s work across Sunset Park builds on the Adams administration’s broader strategy to develop the Harbor of the Future—a reimagined network of innovation and growth across New York City’s waterways. The Harbor of the Future includes emerging innovation centers at the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx, the country’s largest offshore wind port at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, a new cutting-edge climate innovation hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park, modern maritime port and vibrant mixed-use community hub at the Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Red Hook, the Science Park and Research Campus in Kips Bay in Manhattan, new sustainable housing and public space on the North Shore of Staten Island, and an anchor research and educational partner with the New York Climate Exchange on Governors Island.",https://edc.nyc/sites/default/files/styles/1x1_md/public/2025-09/NYCEDC-Press-Release-BATWorks-New-Rendering.jpg?h=feffbd0b&itok=f-YD7r1f,N,,2025-09-22 22:59:07.697146

Same Driver, New Record

The company achieved the feat at the ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg track in Germany. Professional driver Marc Basseng, who set the previous EV speed record in 2024, was behind the wheel.

The track edition electric vehicle uses the same e4 Platform and DiSus-X core technical architecture as the commercially available U9 currently sold in China. The car also adds a 1,200-volt platform paired with advanced thermal management.

Quad-Motor System

Yangwang stated that the EV’s quad-motor system includes 30,000-rpm motors that can deliver peak power of 555 kilowatts each and a combined system output that exceeds 3,000 PS. According to the company, these specs grant the vehicle a power-to-weight ratio of 1,217 PS per metric ton.

Adjusting Wheel Torque, Suspension Height

The car also features an independent torque-vectoring system that minimizes traction loss and wheel slip by monitoring road feedback and adjusting the wheels’ torque more than 100 times per second. Additionally, the DiSus-X Intelligent Body Control System alters suspension height at each corner during hard cornering and rapid acceleration.

Other features include “body posture control,” an optional carbon-fiber splitter, and track-focused semi-slick tires.

Company to be Fully Funded with Clean Balance Sheet and Streamlined Capitalization Table, Super Charging New Era of Organic Growth and Opportunity to Expand into Crypto Economy

SANTA MONICA, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Super League (Nasdaq: SLE), a leader in playable media trusted by global brands to reach and activate gaming audiences through playable ads and gamified content, today announced the execution of definitive documentation for a private placement financing to be undertaken solely with accredited investors, anchored by a $10 million strategic equity investment from Evo Fund, an internationally recognized sponsor of digital asset treasury companies such as Metaplanet Inc, the 5th largest holder of bitcoin in the world. The Company expects to receive between $12.0 million and $20 million in gross proceeds from the private placement, consisting of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock. While no assurances can be given that the private placement will be consummated, the private placement is expected to close following the Company’s Annual General Meeting of Stockholders in October. Upon consummation of the private placement, Super League will have a strong financial foundation and will have removed all outstanding indebtedness. In addition to strengthening its balance sheet, the financing is expected to facilitate regaining compliance with Nasdaq’s shareholder’s equity listing requirements, completing the final step of the Company’s rapid corporate restructuring.

This marks a significant inflection point for Super League and a major step forward to increase shareholder value. As the company advances toward its stated goal of being EBITDA positive on a cash basis in the fourth quarter of 2025, closing this transaction will provide the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue new scalable initiatives. With Evo Fund’s worldwide network and integrated suite of financial holdings, Super League will be positioned to evaluate and pursue strategically differentiated, crypto-forward opportunities while also strengthening current operations.

“Today’s announcement marks a transformative milestone for Super League and its shareholders,” said Matt Edelman, CEO and President of Super League. “Upon closing the financing and having Evo Fund as a committed partner, we will emerge much stronger, ready to pursue growth opportunities with renewed momentum. Super League will be debt-free, fully capitalized, and ideally positioned to advance our core business while exploring ways to accelerate growth through a symbiotic digital asset strategy. With a fortified balance sheet, we will be able to focus squarely on achieving sustainable profitability - a welcome shift from having to balance our attention so heavily towards corporate health versus operational efficacy. Together with the recent reductions in our cost structure, this transaction will set us firmly on a path to creating durable, long-term value for our shareholders as a gaming media company poised to enter the crypto economy.”

Evo Fund’s investment reflects its confidence in Super League’s long-term trajectory and in the broader strategic opportunities being unlocked by a supportive regulatory environment and the rapid evolution of digital asset models.

“Evo Fund is proud to stand alongside Super League at such a defining moment in the company’s journey,” said Michael Lerch, Founder, President, and Chief Global Investment Officer of Evo Fund. “We believe deeply in the power of enduring partnerships between committed capital and executive leadership. We have known Matt for several years and seen firsthand his and his team’s resilience and accomplishments over the past six months. That has only reinforced our conviction in the opportunity to build a platform together. We have learned a lot as the leading investor in digital asset treasuries in Japan and are excited to break new ground in the U.S. market with Super League.”

The financing coincides with Super League’s successful efforts to simplify its capital structure, eliminating the complex layers of previously outstanding preferred stock and creating a clean foundation for business acceleration. For the first time in several years, the company has a capitalization table and equity structure designed to enable both strategic agility and staying power.

Aegis Capital will be acting as the exclusive placement agent for the transaction.

There is no guarantee that the private placement will be consummated. The private placement is subject to the completion of certain closing conditions customary for transactions of this type, and receipt of the approval of the Super League’s stockholders to issue the securities being offered and sold in the private placement. Super League intends to hold its annual meeting of stockholders in October, 2025, which will include a proposal to approve the issuance of the securities under the private placement.

The securities being issued and sold in the private placement are solely being sold to accredited investors, and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”). Accordingly, these securities may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Concurrent with the execution of the securities purchase agreement, Super League and Evo Fund entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which Super League has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, sold in the private placement.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, delivered two Explorer-class spacecraft to Kennedy Space Flight Center for NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory.

Last year Rocket Lab completed the design, build, integration, and testing of the twin spacecraft, named Blue and Gold , in just three and a half years, an accelerated timeline for a Mars mission. This achievement was made possible by Rocket Lab’s mature spacecraft manufacturing experience and its vertically integrated supply chain, which brings production of critical components like solar arrays, star trackers, propellant tanks, reaction wheels, radios, flight software, and more, in-house. ESCAPADE is based on Rocket Lab’s Explorer spacecraft platform , a configurable, high delta-V interplanetary variant of the Company’s advanced family of spacecraft.

ESCAPADE is part of NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, designed to deliver high-value planetary science at lower cost and on faster timelines. ESCAPADE will deliver critical Mars science at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional billion-dollar missions.

During a 22-month cruise to Mars, Blue and Gold will travel together before entering complementary elliptical orbits around the planet to conduct their science campaigns. The spacecraft will simultaneously capture data from two regions of Mars’ magnetosphere. This unique two-point measurement will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips atoms from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “ESCAPADE is a perfect example of why Rocket Lab exists – to make ambitious space science faster and more affordable. Delivering two interplanetary spacecraft on schedule and within budget for a Mars mission is no small feat, and it speaks to the determination and agility of our team. They’ve proven that we can take a concept from design to Mars readiness in just a few short years. This won’t be Rocket Lab’s last time at Mars, with concepts like the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter on the horizon, we’re laying the groundwork for more complex, capable, and essential missions that will support future human exploration.”

Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: “It's been a long road, but we are so excited to be launching Blue & Gold on their mission to understand the Martian space weather environment. Through the usual ups and downs, Rocket Lab has been right alongside NASA and UC Berkeley, supporting us every step of the way on this interplanetary journey.""

Upon arrival at Kennedy Space Center, Rocket Lab engineers will conduct post-transport inspections and functional tests in the cleanroom before propellant loading and vehicle integration. Launch is scheduled to occur no earlier than this fall on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket.

San Antonio, TX, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. ( NASDAQ : GROW ) (“the Company”), a registered investment advisory firm [1] with expertise in gold mining stocks and the airline industry, is pleased to announce that it will continue its payment of monthly dividends.

The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved payment of the $0.0075 per share per month dividend beginning in October 2025 and continuing through December 2025. The record dates are October 14, November 10 and December 15, and the payment dates will be October 27, November 24 and December 29.

Based on the September 15, 2025, closing price of $2.48, this monthly dividend represents an annualized yield of 3.63%.

Gold and Miners Are Shining in 2025

Gold has been on a historic run in 2025, setting repeated new all-time highs and exceeding its previous inflation-adjusted record, set in 1980. Central bank buying, sticky inflation and global political uncertainty have fueled demand for the precious metal as a store of value.

Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and Chief Investment Officer, comments on the opportunity for gold miners:

“In my 40+ years in capital markets, I’ve rarely seen an environment this strong for gold mining companies. With average all-in sustaining costs (AISC) hovering around $1,500 per ounce and spot prices more than double that, miners are enjoying extraordinary margins. The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index recently hit all-time highs, with many producers and mid-tier names posting triple-digit year-to-date gains. We believe this has made gold miners one of the most compelling stories in today’s markets, particularly against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and heightened political risk.”

GOAU at an All-Time High

For investors seeking targeted exposure to this trend, the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF ( NYSE: GOAU ) offers a rules-based approach. GOAU blends traditional gold producers with royalty and streaming companies—businesses the Company considers the “smart money” of the mining sector because they capture commodity upside without the full risks of mining operations.

“I’m pleased to share that GOAU hit a new record intraday high of $37.75 per share on Friday, September 19, approximately double the price since the start of 2025,” says Mr. Holmes. “Investors appear to be betting that the Federal Reserve is ready to start lowering interest rates, which historically has favored gold prices.”

As of June 30, 2025, GOAU held 29 companies with a weighted average market cap of $10.9 billion, including top royalty names like Wheaton Precious Metals and Franco-Nevada. By combining Smart Beta 2.0 screening with disciplined construction, the ETF seeks to capture the upside of rising gold prices while focusing on well-managed firms with sustainable profitability.

Performance data quoted above is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. For a portion of periods, the fund had expense limitations, without which returns would have been lower. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund’s prospectus which, if applicable, would lower your total returns. Performance quoted for periods of one year or less is cumulative and not annualized. Obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end at www.usfunds.com .

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

Because the fund concentrates its investments in specific industries, it may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. The fund is non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate a larger portion of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.

The fund invests in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The fund may invest in the securities of smaller-capitalization companies, which may be more volatile than those of larger, more established companies.

Interim Clinical Study Results for Cohort 1 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study Anticipated in Q4 2025

Enrollment of the First Subject into Cohort 2 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study Expected in Q4 2025

HAYWARD, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Benitec Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: BNTC) (“Benitec” or “Company”), a clinical-stage, gene therapy-focused, biotechnology company developing novel genetic medicines based on its proprietary “Silence and Replace” DNA-directed RNA interference (“ddRNAi”) platform, today announced financial results for its full year ended June 30, 2025. The Company has filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We remain incredibly thankful for our continued close collaboration with families, clinical researchers, and healthcare providers as we advance the BB-301 clinical development program. With increasing durations of clinical follow-up for Subjects enrolled into Cohort 1 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, our enthusiasm continues to be strong for the potential to develop BB-301 as a safe and efficacious therapy for the improvement of swallowing in patients diagnosed with OPMD with dysphagia,” said Jerel A. Banks, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Benitec. “We are also grateful to have received a favorable recommendation to continue enrollment into Cohort 2 from our Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board following the safe treatment of the sixth and final Subject of Cohort 1. We look forward to beginning enrollment of Subjects into Cohort 2 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, as well as providing additional interim clinical study results for Cohort 1 Subjects, in the fourth calendar quarter of this year.”

Corporate Highlights

In accordance with the protocol for the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, a meeting of the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was convened following the completion of the 28-day post BB-301 dosing visit for the sixth Subject enrolled into Cohort 1. At the conclusion of the meeting, the DSMB formally recommended the continuation of subject enrollment into the Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, which is expected to begin in calendar Q4 2025.

We look forward to providing additional interim clinical study results for Cohort 1 Subjects in the fourth calendar quarter of this year.

Financial Highlights

Full Year 2025 Financial Results

For the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company reported total expenses of $41.8 million compared to $22.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. Research and development expenses were $18.3 million in 2025, up from $15.6 million in 2024, and were primarily related to the ongoing clinical development of BB-301 for the treatment of OPMD. The increase in research and development expenses reflected the timing of contract manufacturing activities and payments associated with the OPMD Natural History and Dosing study.

General and administrative expenses totaled $23.4 million in 2025 compared to $7.0 million in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher share-based compensation of $14.5 million, as well as increases in legal fees of $492,000, consulting fees of $605,000, travel expenses of $219,000, and salaries and wages of $685,000.

The loss from operations for the year ended June 30, 2025, was $37.9 million compared to $21.8 million for the prior year. Net loss attributable to shareholders was $37.9 million, or $1.05 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $22.4 million, or $1.22 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $97.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.

About BB-301

BB-301 is a novel, modified AAV9 capsid expressing a unique, single bifunctional construct promoting co-expression of both codon-optimized Poly-A Binding Protein Nuclear-1 (PABPN1) and two small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) against mutant PABPN1 (the causative gene for OPMD). The two siRNAs are modeled into microRNA backbones to silence expression of faulty mutant PABPN1, while allowing expression of the codon-optimized PABPN1 to replace the mutant with a functional version of the protein. We believe the silence and replace mechanism of BB-301 is uniquely positioned for the treatment of OPMD by halting mutant expression while providing a functional replacement protein.

,EPA,2025-09-22 21:01:45+00:00,ww2.arb.ca.gov,CARB submits scathing critique of U.S. EPA's illegal effort to overturn the endangerment finding,Not Available,,,,,https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/carb-submits-scathing-critique-u-s-epas-illegal-effort-overturn-endangerment-finding,"SACRAMENTO — The California Air Resources Board (CARB) today submitted comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) illegal push to end federal responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions by overturning its 2009 endangerment finding.
The comments also note that EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.
“Let’s just say the quiet part out loud: EPA’s proposal is a stunningly sloppy and amateurish effort to sow doubt where there is no doubt,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.
In addition, EPA acknowledges that it is relying on the DOE report because it does not trust its own analysis.

The comments also note that EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.

“Let’s just say the quiet part out loud: EPA’s proposal is a stunningly sloppy and amateurish effort to sow doubt where there is no doubt,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “And EPA cannot simply repeal its own standards based on a political whim. The agency owes the American people straight, honest answers why it is proposing to carelessly risk their health, lives and property.”

CARB’s comments note that the U.S. Department of Energy report on which EPA is relying was assembled by a small group of self-described climate skeptics and is almost totally devoid of scientific evidence to support or explain how they reached their conclusions. Instead, the slim document relies on flawed, disproven assertions and data taken out of context. In addition, EPA acknowledges that it is relying on the DOE report because it does not trust its own analysis. EPA is shamelessly ceding its responsibility to another agency whose current mandate is to prop up fossil fuels at any cost, including public health.

""The Trump Administration wants you to believe that this is a battle about gas-powered cars versus electric ones. That’s a lie,"" said California's Secretary for Environmental Protection Yana Garcia. ""California is fighting for lives. Decades upon decades of science show that climate-warming gases produced by cars, trucks, power plants and gas facilities are killing people. The proof is clear—more smog, more asthma, and more emergency room visits. Instead of standing up for everyday people and businesses, Trump’s EPA is cannibalizing itself to dodge its responsibility to protect health, safety and the economy. There’s nothing patriotic about abandoning Americans.""

EPA’s proposal is also directly at odds with its own mission statement. That includes:

The promise that Americans are entitled to clean air.

National efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available science.

Federal laws protecting human health and the environment are administered and enforced fairly and effectively.

By any of these measures, EPA is obligated to address greenhouse gas emissions and adopt strong standards to reduce them.

CARB also points out that beyond the scientific and documentary evidence, EPA ignores the tragic and painful experiences of thousands of Americans who’ve been severely harmed by more intense wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters made worse by climate change. The proposal also discounts the billions of dollars in economic loss sustained each year by the country and the people who live here.

CARB further points out that EPA leaves no obvious paper trail leading to the environmental impacts of its proposal and therefore provides no opportunity for informed public comment on those impacts. That is fundamental to the sound development of environmental regulations and is illegal since it turns a blind eye to EPA’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.

Standing up for science

CARB Executive Officer, Dr. Steven Cliff, testified before EPA in August noting that the DOE arguments against the endangerment finding are attempting to refute science that even 5th grade students know is true. He also pointed out that DOE’s arguments are routinely rolled out by the oil industry.

In September, CARB filed comments with DOE specifically calling out the lack of actual science in the study and refuting its misinformation and falsehoods line-by-line.

CARB is calling for EPA to stand up for science, and facts, and to drop this thinly veiled attempt to rewrite established history.",https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-22 18:00:52.297537

The Supreme Court affirmed this responsibility in 2007, ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to regulation.
Indeed, in your own confirmation hearing, you acknowledged that the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants.
It fails to meet your statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act.
Sincerely, Gavin Newsom Governor of California California’s climate leadership Pollution is down and the economy is up.","Dear Administrator Zeldin:

I write to you not only as Governor of California — the fourth largest economy in the world — but as the leader of a state whose people must live with the daily consequences of your agency’s failures.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reverse the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare is not just putting politics over evidence, it is bad policy, a dereliction of duty, a moral abdication, and a betrayal of the very mission entrusted to you.

The Clean Air Act could not be clearer: EPA has an affirmative duty to protect public health and welfare from air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. The Supreme Court affirmed this responsibility in 2007, ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to regulation. Indeed, in your own confirmation hearing, you acknowledged that the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding recognizes that these emissions threaten the health and welfare of current and future generations. The evidence supporting this is well-documented and settled. And yet, you are now proposing to ignore binding law, overwhelming science, and lived reality.

That is not discretion — it is negligence. It is unlawful. It will cause great harm to the American people.

The cost of EPA’s surrender will be measured in human lives and economic devastation. In California alone:

Wildfires fueled by rising temperatures have killed hundreds, destroyed entire communities and tens of thousands of homes, and caused tens of billions of dollars in damages.

Extreme heat is now the deadliest climate impact, responsible for more annual deaths than wildfires and floods.

Drought has cost California’s agricultural economy billions, threatening food production nationwide and harming family farmers.

In recent years, climate-driven floods caused an estimated $5 billion in damages, devastating families and businesses alike.

Nationwide, the picture is no less dire: In 2023 alone, the United States endured 28 separate climate-driven weather disasters exceeding $1 billion in damage each — the highest number ever recorded — claiming more than 400 American lives and causing $92 billion in damages.

In the face of all that, you are suggesting that climate change doesn’t endanger us all. Seriously?

EPA’s decision to advance this proposal is not only inconsistent with science, it is inconsistent with the law. It fails to meet your statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act. It violates the principles laid out by the Supreme Court. It disregards the wealth of scientific evidence and research underlying the 2009 Endangerment Finding. And in doing so, it abdicates EPA’s responsibility to the American people.

By siding with polluters over science, EPA is telling wildfire victims to ignore the flames, flood victims to ignore the rising water, and parents of asthmatic children to ignore the dirty air that chokes their respiratory systems and takes their breath away. That is not leadership — it is an insult.

California will not stand by. We will continue to lead, because we have no choice; the lives and livelihoods of our people depend on it. But history will ask: where was the EPA — the agency created to protect Americans — when the nation faced the greatest environmental and public health crisis of our time?

You still have a choice: honor the law, follow the credible and established science, and fulfill your duty to the American people. Or go down in history as the administration that abandoned its mission, betrayed its mandate, and failed its country.

Sincerely,

Gavin Newsom

Governor of California

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period as California grew to become the world’s fourth largest economy.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy.

American Antimony Corporation (OTCID:XTPT), operating as Xtra Energy Corporation, is pleased to announce that Chairman & CEO, Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., has completed an on-site visit with the Company's field team at the IHX Zone, part of the flagship American Antimony Project in Nevada's historic Bernice Canyon District.

The visit focused on evaluating surface stockpiles and near-surface mineralized material across the IHX Zone and the adjacent King Solomon and Antimony King targets. During the review, the team identified and initiated further testing of approximately 6,700 tons of mineralized material at the IHX Zone, with the objective of commencing initial commercial sales of antimony ore.

Additional site visits are scheduled, during which the team will conduct inspections and volumetric assessments of the other stockpiles previously identified by the field team. These visits will also provide critical data for the permitting process required to support the timely, staged removal of the additional piles.

On-Site Assessment Highlights

Up to 6,700 Tons Targeted - Includes stockpiles identified during the 2025 drilling program and 2024 sampling campaigns.

Bulk Sampling in Progress - Representative material is being collected at the end of September to ship for mill scale recovery tests under Metallurgical Testing Agreements (MTAs) with a prospective mill partner and buyer.

3rd Party Lab Accredited Assay Results from Stockpiles: -

Antimony King: ~42.9% Sb (429,366 ppm Sb); Au 0.09 g/t; Ag 6.6 g/t; As 148 ppm

King Solomon: ~24.7% Sb (247,431 ppm Sb); Au 0.22 g/t; Ag 23.1 g/t; As 125 ppm

IHX: ~2.5% Sb (24,915 ppm Sb); Au 0.06 g/t; Ag 2.7 g/t; As 226 ppm

Low-Arsenic Advantage - Confirmed consistently across drill core and surface samples, arsenic levels remain in the tens to low hundreds of ppm, supporting favorable metallurgy compared to many global peers.

Commercial Pathway - Positive metallurgy and offtake results would position the Company to finalize direct sales agreements, establishing an early revenue stream from U.S.-sourced antimony ore while broader exploration and resource definition continue.

CEO Commentary

""Our on-site review at the IHX Zone underscores that the American Antimony Project is not only a world-class exploration opportunity, but also a near-term commercial pathway,"" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO. ""The antimony at IHX sits near the canyon entrance, making it readily accessible for shipment and processing. This oxidized surface stockpile is rich in stibnite, and further testing, validation, and permitting to lift up to 6,700 tons of material represent the next step in proving we can deliver clean, U.S.-sourced antimony to the market. This initiative is designed to enhance shareholder value by advancing early revenue generation while simultaneously expanding the Project's long-term resource base.""

Strategic Importance

Antimony is a federally designated critical mineral, essential for:

Defense applications (munitions, armor, flame-retardant systems)

Semiconductors and battery technologies

Energy storage and industrial alloys

With the United States currently 100% import-reliant on foreign antimony-primarily from China and Russia - the American Antimony Project is one of the few emerging domestic supply sources capable of strengthening U.S. critical mineral independence.

This update demonstrates that American Antimony Corporation is executing a dual-track strategy: near-term commercialization of high-grade stockpiles alongside long-term expansion of a district-scale antimony resource in Nevada.

Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract.
Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction?
The effects of climate change are in every continent.
What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change?","Climate debates often focus on the world’s largest economies and biggest emitters. But the work of adapting to a hotter planet is happening in countries that have contributed little to the problem but are nevertheless exposed to its consequences.

I spoke with six world leaders from these places and heard some common themes — the ravages of extreme weather, the difficulties posed by the Trump administration’s retreat. (The president withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement and denies the existence of climate change.)

But the conversations, which you can see in full, also show how varied environmental predicaments can be. Some of the interviews, condensed and edited, are here:

Talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by? Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel that the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? It is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? We have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

The Marshall Islands

This country, made from islands and reefs in the Pacific Ocean, is a few feet above sea level. Each year, the challenges grow. Mosquito-borne diseases have spread because of more frequent rainfall. Tuna — an economic backbone — are leaving for cooler parts of the Pacific. The water is rising. “We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part,” says President Hilda Heine, who has spent her career sounding the alarm.

What do developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that.

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation.

How much do you think international efforts on climate action have succeeded? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”

At The Times’s Climate Forward conference this week, we’ll hear from world leaders, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and activists like the actor Rainn Wilson. Sign up for the livestream here.

The Pentagon said on Friday that it would forbid journalists who cover the military from reporting any information that had not been authorized in advance for release. Eric Schmitt, who has spent 35 years covering national security for The Times, recounts some of the stories that might never have come to light under a policy like this.

Rigorous reporting on national security often relies on facts that are not publicly known. One of the most important parts of our job is to shine light on classified programs and operations that the American people need to know about. Some examples:

Caribbean boat strikes. My colleagues and I revealed in August that Trump had secretly authorized military force against certain drug cartels. Since then, U.S. strikes against suspected drug boats have killed at least 17 people.

Pentagon Papers. The Times published top-secret documents in 1971 showing how four presidential administrations deceived the public about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Nixon White House tried to stop their publication, leading to the court showdown you probably learned about in high-school history class.

Botched mission in North Korea. In 2019, Trump authorized a secret operation to spy on Kim Jong-un. Earlier this month, my colleagues were the first to report on it — and how it failed, leaving unarmed North Koreans dead. These military failures are often kept under wraps, leading the public to underestimate the extreme risks that American forces undertake.

We’ve published thousands more stories based on confidential information. It’s how The Times has done some of its most important reporting: on WikiLeaks, the Iraq War, N.S.A. wiretapping and more.

OPINIONS

Trump prefers his personal relationships to guide diplomacy. But in doing so, he risks misjudging his counterparts’ intentions, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Keren Yarhi-Milo write.

“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the U.S. administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” said Revolution Wind spokesperson Meaghan Wims in a statement.

Revolution Wind, along with the nearby Sunrise Wind and SouthCoast Wind projects, were perceived as relatively safe from federal interference under the second Trump administration.
This is a huge win not just for Revolution Wind, but for offshore wind projects up and down the East Coast that are being targeted by Trump.”","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Revolution Wind will be allowed to continue to build offshore wind turbines, thanks to a preliminary injunction granted to the company by a federal judge on Monday.

Judge Royce C. Lamberth, first appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Ronald Reagan in 1987, issued a stay on the stop-work order on the project imposed by the federal Department of the Interior on Aug. 22.

“Revolution Wind has demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of its underlying claims, it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, the balance of the equities is in its favor and maintaining the status quo by granting the injunction is in the public interest,” wrote Lamberth in his order.

Pending the outcome of its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Revolution Wind parent company Ørsted will be allowed to continue construction of its wind farm, which the company estimated prior to the stop-work order was 80% complete.

“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the U.S. administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” said Revolution Wind spokesperson Meaghan Wims in a statement. “Revolution Wind will resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as a top priority.”

The stop-work order took Ørsted – and Rhode Island officials – by surprise last month after it was issued by the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the agency within the federal Department of the Interior that oversees offshore wind lease areas and production.

The $5 billion, 65-turbine wind project 20 miles off the Rhode Island coast had been on track to supply renewable electricity to Rhode Island and Connecticut by 2027, but the stop-word order presented major disruptions, including the loss of specialized equipment and some union labor.

The Trump administration has not hidden its hostility to offshore wind projects, despite Revolution Wind originally obtaining federal approval from BOEM in early 2020 during the president’s first term.

Revolution Wind, along with the nearby Sunrise Wind and SouthCoast Wind projects, were perceived as relatively safe from federal interference under the second Trump administration. All three projects had their major federal permits already in hand, with the Biden administration issuing its final major permit approval for SouthCoast Wind just days before Trump’s inauguration.

Rhode Island needs the Revolution Wind project if it’s going to meet its renewable energy goals and reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with electricity consumption. Around 18.6% of all emissions produced in R.I. stem from resident and business consumption of electricity, most of which comes from natural gas-fired power plants located outside of the state.

Rhode Island’s Act on Climate requires the state to reduce its GHG emissions by 45% under 1990 levels by the end of this decade, a benchmark which becomes far more impossible to achieve without a major renewable energy generator supplying electricity to the state.

In a joint press conference with the entire state Congressional delegation and labor leaders held days after the stop-work order was issued, Gov. Dan McKee said the order would endanger union jobs in Rhode Island and threaten a committed source of renewable electricity the state was relying on to meet its energy needs and goals.

“J-O-B-S, jobs,” said McKee at the Aug. 25 press conference. “That’s what at stake in Rhode Island without this project.”

Just last week, on Sept 17, attorneys general from Rhode Island and Connecticut filed a 47-page motion in District Court arguing the project was almost complete, and without a stay the company faced “unsustainabe losses” from the stop-work order.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong had filed their own lawsuit in District Court against the Trump administration over its stop-work order to the Revolution Wind project.

In a release issued Monday, Neronha celebrated the preliminary injunction, saying it was a win for Rhode Island’s workers and families.

“This president cannot cancel clean energy projects just because he believes doing so is politically expedient for him,” said Neronha. “Indeed, the outcome here bodes well for our case in Rhode Island. Judge Lamberth’s decision to grant Ørsted’s motion aligns with our argument that this administration’s attempt to undermine the clean energy industry while eliminating thousands of union jobs is both arbitrary and capricious – in simpler terms, it came without warning, reason, or legal basis.”

Christian Roselund, who leads the Yes to Wind campaign for Climate Action Rhode Island, said Monday, “Trump is not a God, or a king. His administration often issues illegal orders, and they can be stopped. This is a huge win not just for Revolution Wind, but for offshore wind projects up and down the East Coast that are being targeted by Trump.”",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Yes-to-Wind.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 18:00:18.196015

More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.
His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.
Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first, large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.
Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.","A federal judge ruled Monday that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration can resume, dealing President Donald Trump a setback in his ongoing effort to restrict the industry.

Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut has been paused since Aug. 22 when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order for what it said were national security concerns. It did not specify those concerns at the time. Both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.

Danish energy company Orsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that would allow them to move forward with the project.

Judge Royce Lamberth held a hearing on that request Monday. Lamberth said he considered how Revolution Wind has relied on its federal approval, the delays are costing $2.3 million a day and if the project can’t meet deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse. After December, the specialized ship needed to complete the project won’t be available until at least 2028, he said. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.

“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,” Lamberth said, as he granted the motion for the preliminary injunction.

The Interior Department has said that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Orsted said Monday that construction will resume as soon as possible.

WATCH: Economic fallout mounts as Trump halts near-finished wind power project

On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the offshore wind industry as soon as he returned to the White House. He wants to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says.

His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first, large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said the judge’s ruling is a major win for workers and families, who need this project on track now so it can start to drive down unaffordable energy bills.

Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney, a Democrat, said a multibillion-dollar project that is 80% complete and was fully permitted with input by the Pentagon is not a national security problem. The Interior Department “should take the hint and let the thousands of construction workers finish the job,” he said.

Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Now, um in nuclear and we should mention you don't cover the sort of big legacy power generators that have the older nuclear plants.
Well, they they have a nuclear plant as well, an SMR be it's called the BWRX 300.
I mean what's available today, you know, NuScale has done arguably the best job getting into a position where they can sell a nuclear plant today.","And so, at the same time, I mean, let's talk investment playbook for a minute here because it sounds like there is an investible case for each of these buckets. We didn't talk about wind so much, but maybe we'll get to that in a minute. Um, so in each of these buckets, like let's take solar. What would be your top pick within solar?

Yeah, so on the utility scale side, I mean we really like First Solar as as the as the go-to. You know, they're America's manufacturing company for solar and they have all the tailwinds of, you know, if you if you go back to, you know, the OB3 back in July, they're sort of the winner of this all, I guess I would say, given their manufacturing footprint is is located in the US. They, you know, fully source 100% of their materials or they can in the US. And then they've got, you know, the competition's all importing. They're now facing tariffs. The competition also is, you know, either a Chinese domiciled company that is now facing restrictions next year in terms of what what they can sell here. And so that company stands out as as a potential winner, you know, very, very near term. There's dynamics going on with what I would say is, you know, uh call it call it uh a garage sale of of solar panels to get ahead of some of the restrictions that are coming in place next year, but um, you know, starting next year, I think first solar looks starts to look really really attractive.

Are they capacity constrained at all? Can they make enough to keep up with the demand that we're seeing, you know, out next year?

Yeah, so they're on the domestic supply piece, they're actually sold out through 2028. Now, they have opportunities to bring more manufacturing capacity into the US. You know, they they manufacture in in Southeast Asia and they're, you know, I think at least they're going to shift uh a line over to the United States so they'd, you know, within a year or so they'd potentially have more more supply on that can can they can sell.

Now, um in nuclear and we should mention you don't cover the sort of big legacy power generators that have the older nuclear plants. There aren't many choices on the new nuclear side. You cover NuScale. I think that if I'm not mistaken, that's the only one.

GE Vernova. Because they supply. Yeah. Well, they they have a nuclear plant as well, an SMR be it's called the BWRX 300. So it's it's sort of a a shrunk down size of the call it old school traditional traditional nuke. And you know, I guess from my perspective it's it's a huge opportunity. I mean what's available today, you know, NuScale has done arguably the best job getting into a position where they can sell a nuclear plant today. They went to there's, you know, the regulatory commission that that governs these things and they have approvals that say, hey, these, you know, the NRCs has reviewed all our docs. It takes many, many years, but they reviewed all the docs. They've agreed that this is safe and it's it's ready to go today. And I think from a company that's, you know, new to the market, that's a huge vote of confidence and you can take that to a potential customer and sell it.

And yet you're sector perform on NuScale.

Yeah. So and I think this really just comes down to more, you know, expectations around timelines and nuclear development takes a long time and, you know, even though NuScale has a, you know, design approval from the NRC, it still takes call it five, six years to build one of these. And, you know, our our opinion is that they'll get the the initial one green lit and they'll start construction, but then what happens over that time are are, you know, new investors and and new customers comfortable coming in and buying plant number two, plant number three, while the first one's still undergoing construction and, you know, one of the biggest risks in in this industry is, uh, you know, these developments cost two times as much as they're supposed to and they take three years longer. And so there is this sort of proof process that I think has to go on for for them and everyone else in the industry where they need to show that they're on time and on budget.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WAClrtCKzEkUdmPBQo3BTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/1487f8c0-93e3-11f0-aafc-b7b60164001c,N,,2025-09-22 20:00:27.916397

Newsom can't spin up the electric vehicle rebate program on his own; it would have required legislative action amid a large budget deficit.
The governor's pullback means that Sept. 30 will, indeed, mark the end of an era for Californians who want to purchase electric vehicles.","Gov. Gavin Newsom signed six energy and climate bills in San Francisco on Friday morning, after delivering an impassioned speech about the need for California to counter the ""environmental injury"" of President Donald Trump's federal government while also making life cheaper for state residents.

One pocketbook issue, though, was conspicuously absent from Newsom's speech and legislation. In November, the governor pledged that he would replace the federal government's electric vehicle purchasing credit with a state version, should Trump cancel the $7,500-per-new-car benefit. Trump did so, meaning electric vehicles will become much more expensive for Americans after Sept. 30. Now, it turns out that relief isn't actually on its way for Californians - Newsom said Friday that his administration won't be replacing the popular rebates.

""We can't make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits,"" Newsom told reporters at a brief press conference. He said state funds were instead being spent on physical infrastructure, and pointed to the tens of thousands of public electric vehicle chargers built in the state.

""There are billions and billions of dollars through 2045 in the cap-and-trade program that continue to make those infrastructure investments, but not the direct subsidies - that we cannot make up for - that were eliminated under the federal program,"" the governor said.

Newsom can't spin up the electric vehicle rebate program on his own; it would have required legislative action amid a large budget deficit. But the remarks are a complete turnaround from November, when his office published a news release saying, ""Governor Newsom commits to restarting state's [zero emission vehicle] rebate program if federal tax credit is eliminated,"" and pointing to the cap-and-trade program - extended in Friday's bill-signing - as a likely source of funds.

The governor's pullback means that Sept. 30 will, indeed, mark the end of an era for Californians who want to purchase electric vehicles. Trump and congressional Republicans, with the summer's so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" eliminated the credits that Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act had offered through 2032. The federal tax credits are worth up to $7,500 for a new car and $4,000 for a used car, bringing electric vehicles closer to price parity with gas cars and boosting their sale across the United States. But they won't be available come October.

California used to have its own version of the credit, the ""Clean Vehicle Rebate Project,"" which Newsom's team pointed to as a success story in the November news release. The program launched in 2010 and closed in 2023, after spending $1.49 billion across nearly 600,000 vehicles.

In July, a coalition of electric vehicle companies wrote to Newsom and a few of his agency heads asking that they enact state credits, to ""provide a stabilizing counterforce to recent federal shocks to the ZEV industry."" But it'll be gas companies pleased with the governor's Friday signings; he OK'd more oil drilling in Kern County as part of the package.

Trump's electric vehicle credit cuts aren't the only damage the federal government has done to California's ambitions in the industry this year; the U.S. Senate voted in May to block the state's push to ban new gas-powered car sales by 2035.

Newsom sounded optimistic Friday even as he doused hopes for a rebate program. He said that California now has more public chargers than gas nozzles, and he pointed to subsidies that helped Tesla and other companies grow, praising the state's electric vehicle progress: ""We've created an ecosystem and we've created a market. Ask Elon Musk.""

What the Bill Does

The GRID Power Act passed narrowly in the House, 216–206. The legislation directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to allow grid operators—including transmission providers, Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), and Independent System Operators (ISOs)—to fast-track dispatchable energy projects through the grid’s interconnection queue.

Supporters argue this change will help get critical baseload projects online faster, address shortages caused by retiring power plants, and better support the nation’s rising demand for electricity.

Balderson’s Push for Reliability

Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio), who introduced the bill, said the measure is designed to prevent a looming reliability crisis.

“With American power demand far outpacing our ability to generate more electricity, our grid is heading toward a reliability crisis,” Balderson stated after the vote.

He emphasized that the bill would clear the backlog of projects and provide grid operators with tools to bring new power online quickly. According to Balderson, the legislation ensures operators can still conduct feasibility and system-impact studies before approving interconnection agreements.

Oklahoma Delegation’s Support

Reps. Stephanie Bice, Josh Brecheen, Tom Cole, Kevin Hern, and Frank Lucas all voted in favor of the bill. Their support signals Oklahoma’s alignment with efforts to prioritize reliability and dispatchable energy—sources such as natural gas, coal, and nuclear that can run continuously—over intermittent renewable projects waiting in line.

What Happens Next with GRID Power Act

The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats and clean energy advocates have expressed opposition. They argue the legislation undercuts renewable expansion at a time when the U.S. needs more low-carbon energy sources to meet climate goals.

For now, the GRID Power Act’s passage in the House reflects a growing debate in Washington over how to balance grid reliability with the push for renewable energy growth.",,N,,2025-09-22 17:02:39.307209

Ferguson declared that every Maryland household will receive two bill credits equivalent to about $40 per utility bill. The Senate president said the first credit is expected to come as the summer closes and another in the cold months, around January or February, as heating bills are expected to be high.

This announcement comes after Moore signed legislation in 2023 to allow more eligibility for energy assistance. Automatic eligibility is allowed for those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or who receive income-based veterans benefits.

ELECTRICITY PRICES ROSE FURTHER IN AUGUST AS TRUMP BLAMES RENEWABLES

The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power.

Department officials initially cited other measures in place and repeated Prime Minister Mark Carney’s talking points, but eventually shared some data when pressed further.

Megan Nichols, one of five officials answering questions, said scrapping the consumer carbon price would add three megatonnes of emissions in 2030, while the impact of suspending the EV mandate for 2026 had not yet been calculated.

The questions came after federal ministers refused in recent weeks to commit to Canada’s 2030 emission reduction targets, and after the release of a Canadian Climate Institute report that suggested Canada’s 2030 target is now out of reach.

What you need to know: CalEPA Secretary Yana Garcia is at Climate Week NYC, underscoring the state’s global leadership on climate action and its resolve to maintain a sense of urgency despite federal attacks and rollbacks.

Sacramento – California’s leader for environmental protection, Secretary Yana Garcia, today joins fellow state officials, international delegates and global climate experts at Climate Week NYC. Her participation reaffirms California’s ongoing and decisive leadership in accelerating bold action amid the Trump Administration’s denial of science and incessant attacks on climate and economic progress.

“Climate threats are real. Hotter days, drier droughts and more devastating wildfires are making that clearer than ever,” said CalEPA Secretary Garcia. “California has long been out front on setting ambitious climate goals and staying the course to reach them. Armed with science and like-minded partners, we are keeping our focus squarely on fighting the long-term effects of climate change to protect health and wellbeing. Climbing to the fourth largest economy in the world proves that protecting people from environmental harm and economic innovation go hand in hand.”

While in New York, Secretary Garcia will participate in several convenings to share California’s leadership and expertise on climate policy. The state continues to invest in programs and policies that reduce pollution while driving clean economies:

Last week, Governor Newsom signed a historic package of climate and energy affordability legislation, including the extension the state’s Cap-and-Invest program (formerly Cap-and-Trade) to 2045, a timeline that aligns with the state’s world-leading carbon neutrality targets.

Nearly $33 billion has been raised from polluters to fund climate solutions in communities across the state with money from the state’s Cap-and-Invest program over the past 10+ years. These investments have delivered more than a half a million projects across the state, supporting over 122,000 jobs and cutting millions of tons of carbon emissions.Of the $12.8 billion already implemented, $9.2 billion has benefitted priority populations.

California leads the nation in transportation decarbonization. In June 2025, Governor Newsom signed an executive order reaffirming the state’s commitment to ZEV deployment and initiating the development of the Advanced Clean Cars III regulation to advance new strategies for emissions reduction and spur innovation. In August, state agencies released a report that charts a path to expand clean and ZEV adoption across all vehicle types, protect public health and maintain the state’s momentum in the face of federal rollbacks.

In 2025, California announced a major milestone — 67% of the state’s retail electricity sales came from renewable and zero-carbon electricity generation — compared to just 61% the previous year and around 41% a decade ago.

With more than 545,000 clean energy jobs, California is first in the U.S. for total renewable energy generation jobs and first for overall clean energy jobs.

Pollution is down and the economy is up. California’s greenhouse gas emissions are down 20% since 2000, while the state’s GDP increased 78% in the same timeframe.

This week, California is continuing its collaboration with global leaders to reduce pollution around the world. The state has built a decades-long legacy of forming partnerships that drive emission reductions and strengthen climate commitments among national and regional governments. Recent examples include:

In August 2025, in their continued partnership, California and Denmark signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Governor Gavin Newsom and Ambassador of Denmark to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen supporting green economy resilience, technology and innovation.

In May 2025, CARB and the Republic of Panama entered into a partnership on carbon pricing programs and climate investments.

In March 2025, California signed a new partnership with Sonora Governor Alfonso Durazo Montaño advancing cross-border action for cleaner air and clean energy.

While many RVs on the road feature lavish interiors and well-appointed exteriors, the fuel efficiency piece of the puzzle is often missing. That may be set to change with Entegra’s release of the Embark, the world’s first range-extended electric Class A motorhome.

Watt a concept

Enetgra, a subsidiary of the THOR Industries RV empire, has spent the past five years developing electrification tech fit for the demands of an RV. The result is the Embark, a first-of-its-kind prototype Class A motorhome that delivers up to 450 miles of range.

It’s important to note that the concept RV is not fully electric: its enhanced range is thanks to the low emission gasoline range extender, which recharges the ample electric battery system.

However, an impressive note is that the Embark is capable of 105 miles of range on electric battery alone, which is ideal for day trips.

The cutting-edge, range-extended electric chassis, manufactured by Harbinger Motors (which counts THOR Industries as an investor) delivers an 800V electrical infrastructure (powered by a center-mounted 140-kWh battery pack) for unparalleled performance.

Power on

The battery packs are mounted low, which improves the overall handling of the motorhome.

Entegra says the EV drivetrain “delivers instant torque, reduced sway and a quieter ride” — which, if you’ve ever driven an RV, is a definite upgrade from traditional models.

The system also allows for rapid charging at DC Fast Charger locations, which means less time stationary, and more time hitting the open road.

The batteries can also be charged at traditional camping sites or at home, offering greater flexibility to adventurers.

Speaking of home — the Embark is so powerful, it can be used as a mobile energy backup system to power your house in case of emergency. Pretty nifty.

Availability and pricing

The Embark electric motorhome concept is on display at the Elkhart Dealer Open House, the largest dealer event in North America, starting today in Elkhart, Indiana.

While pricing has not yet been announced, the Embark is expected to go into full production beginning next year. You can contact Entegra Coach for more info.

The ethanol industry's decarbonization efforts are no longer limited to reducing emissions; they now include capturing and repurposing carbon. Gevo, for instance, has pioneered Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) technologies to produce SAF from non-food industrial corn. Its SAF, compliant with ASTM D7566 standards, has demonstrated the ability to operate at 100% SAF in test flightsGevo HAUSH Ltd. SAF development[ 1 ]. Gevo's integration of blockchain-based carbon tracking and regenerative agriculture further solidifies its position as a “carbon-aware fuels company.”

Meanwhile, Summit Agricultural Group's partnership with Honeywell to develop an ethanol-to-jet facility through its Summit Next Gen platform is addressing the aviation sector's urgent need for scalable SAF solutionsSummit Agricultural Group and Honeywell partnership[ 4 ]. This initiative aligns with global SAF demand projections, which are expected to surge as airlines face stricter emissions regulations.

Financial Performance and Investment Potential

While strategic partnerships and innovations are reshaping the industry, financial performance remains a key metric for investors. Gevo's Q2 2025 results, which showed a net profit of $0.01 per share and $43.41 million in revenue, reflect the company's momentum in SAF developmentADM and Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline[ 5 ]. Analysts have upgraded their price targets, with UBS Group raising its estimate to $2.25 per shareADM and Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline[ 5 ].

Green Plains, despite reporting a Q1 2025 net loss of $72.9 million, is advancing its carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiative, with construction set to begin in Q4 2025Green Plains 45Z tax credit monetization[ 2 ]. The company's 45Z tax credit monetization is projected to generate $40–50 million in EBITDA in 2025, illustrating how policy-driven incentives can offset operational challengesGevo HAUSH Ltd.

Conclusion: A Carbon-Neutral Future Within Reach

The ethanol industry's transition to a low-carbon economy is being accelerated by strategic collaborations and technological breakthroughs. Companies like Gevo,

, ADM, and Petrobras are not only reducing emissions but also creating new revenue streams through SAF, carbon credits, and carbon-negative products. As the market grows at a CAGR of 3.37% through 2030 , investors should prioritize firms that combine innovation with scalable partnerships. The ethanol sector's ability to align with global decarbonization goals while delivering financial returns makes it a compelling investment opportunity in the energy transition.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758547731755.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-22 16:04:26.944011

PHOENIX – Attorney General Kris Mayes today joined a coalition of 23 attorneys general and seven counties and cities in filing a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed recission of its landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions, including from motor vehicles, drive climate change and endanger public health and welfare. That finding is known as the Endangerment Finding.

""EPA’s proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding is wrong on the science and is unlawful,"" said Attorney General Mayes. ""The EPA is obligated to consider the costs of climate change by using rigorous, peer-reviewed methods. Instead, EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting costs of climate change for all Americans, including devastating impacts to health and safety.""

Last month, the Trump Administration announced its proposal to rescind that 2009 Endangerment Finding, claiming that EPA lacks authority to regulate air pollution that contributes to climate change and eliminating all existing EPA vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards in one fell swoop. In August, Attorney General Mayes testified before EPA in opposition to the agency’s proposed rescission of its landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that drives climate change and endangers public health and welfare.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the direct result of the landmark 2007 Supreme Court opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA, which confirmed EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that threaten public health and welfare. In direct response to that opinion, and after more than two years of scientific review, EPA determined in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that harms public health and welfare in numerous ways.

As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) confirmed just last week, “EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” EPA’s new proposal, which relies on a flawed, unlawful, and unfinished report issued by the Department of Energy’s Climate Working Group, seeks to reverse that finding with no grounding in law or science.

Today’s comment letter is just one way that Attorney General Mayes and the coalition have recently fought back against EPA’s dangerous proposal.

2009 Endangerment Finding Comment Letter

In their 225-page letter submitted to the EPA today, the coalition argues that rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding would violate settled law, Supreme Court precedent, and scientific consensus, endangering the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans, particularly those in communities disproportionately impacted by environmental harms.

Scientific research has proven that every region of our country is experiencing the ongoing and significant harms of climate change and motor vehicle pollution, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise. Extreme summer heat, driven by climate change, is leading to increased rates of heat-related illness and death, particularly among vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, low-income individuals, and workers. Increasing rates of natural disasters – like wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts – not only have a devastating effect on public health and safety, but on state and local economies as well.

Not only does EPA’s proposed recission ignore those facts, which are backed by robust climate science, but it also violates EPA’s legal obligations under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. The coalition argues that EPA’s new legal interpretations are fundamentally inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and binding Supreme Court precedent, and that the proposal would mark a drastic reversal of its own longstanding findings without any explanation grounded in science. To make matters worse, the Climate Working Group report on which EPA relies is procedurally and substantively flawed, yet EPA blindly accepts its findings and disregards the scientific consensus, which was just reaffirmed by NAS last week.

In filing this comment letter, the coalition urges EPA to abandon its unlawful and unsupported proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

Joining AG Mayes in filing this comment letter, which was co-led by the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York, were the attorneys general of Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin; the Cities of Chicago, New York, and Oakland; the City and County of Denver; and the Counties of Martin Luther King Jr., California and Santa Clara, California.

Motor Vehicles Comment Letter

In withdrawing the 2009 Endangerment Finding, EPA also proposes to repeal all existing federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for all motor vehicle classes and all years. In a second letter submitted to the EPA today, which was joined by AG Mayes, the coalition explains that this proposed, unprecedented disruption to the regulatory landscape of the last fifteen years will be catastrophic for the States and Local Governments’ residents, industries, natural resources, and public investments. For instance, EPA projected last year that current motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards would prevent more than 8 billion metric tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions over the next 30 years, avoiding $1.82 trillion in climate harms. If those reductions from the federal motor vehicle greenhouse gas program alone were the emissions of a country, that country would rank 33rd on a list of the world’s top emitters.

A robust regulatory program for greenhouse gas emissions is also crucial to vehicle affordability, consumer choice, and the success of the American automotive industry. The greenhouse gas program for vehicles spurs automakers to innovate and create better cars, saving drivers hundreds of billions of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs, and helps support domestic manufacturing and jobs. Repealing that program, as EPA now proposes, will shutter factories, kill jobs, and wipe out billions of dollars in investments by Congress, States, and local governments to keep the American auto industry thriving and globally competitive. The best way to support drivers and auto workers, while also helping the planet, is to continue promoting innovation in the most cutting-edge vehicle technologies.

Joining AG Mayes in filing this comment letter, which was led by the attorney general of California, were the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin; the Chief Legal Officers of the City of Chicago, Illinois; the City of New York, New York; the City of Oakland, California; Martin Luther King, Jr. County, Washington; the Cities and Counties of Denver and San Francisco; the City and County of San Francisco, California; and the County of Santa Clara, California.

Climate Working Group Comment Letter

On September 2nd, AG Mayes joined a coalition of 22 attorneys general, three cities, and two counties in filing a comment letter opposing the CWG report that EPA relied on in its proposed recission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

In that comment letter, the coalition identified numerous procedural and substantive legal flaws in the Climate Working Group report. In creating the Climate Working Group, the Department of Energy selected five widely known climate change skeptics, ignored well-established scientific integrity standards, and failed to comply with Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) procedures, which require the disclosure of all committee-related records and that committee meetings be open to the public.

The report – written in less than two months and riddled with inaccuracies, factual omissions, and mischaracterizations of irrefutable climate science research – attempts to critique decades of peer-reviewed scientific research establishing that the emission of greenhouse gases causes climate change and endangers public health and welfare.

In filing the comment letter, the coalition urged the Department of Energy to withdraw the unlawful and misguided Climate Working Group report.

Infinity Two is a first-generation 350 MWe baseload power plant utilizing Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology. The parties argue that stellarator is currently the only fusion technology to have demonstrated “stable, steady-state operation” with high efficiency. Type One Energy is developing Infinity Two using today’s existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support near-term deployment of the technology. The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce.

TVA retired the coal-fired Bull Run Fossil Plant in December 2023, as part of its effort to fully retire its coal fleet by 2030.

“TVA is a leader in pursuing advanced nuclear technologies we need to power America’s economic prosperity and fuel artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing,” said Don Moul, TVA President and CEO. “We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies, and I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley. Our region is building a nuclear ecosystem that provides good jobs and opportunities for the people of the Valley.”

“We are really honored to be working with TVA on the world’s first private sector fusion power plant project,” said Christofer Mowry, Type One Energy’s CEO. “TVA is a best-in-class energy utility that knows how to build, operate, and maintain complex power generation technologies. This LOI with TVA, and the role it establishes for Type One Energy as the fusion technology provider for their Infinity Two project, is therefore fully aligned with our goal of pursuing the lowest-risk approach to commercializing fusion energy.”

Final decisions and definitive agreements regarding the funding and construction of Infinity Two, as well as any agreements to purchase the energy output, are subject to TVA Board approval, regulatory review, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes and American energy dominance strategy.

In February 2024, Type One Energy entered into a cooperative agreement with TVA to jointly develop plans for a potential TVA fusion power plant project in the Tennessee Valley region using Type One Energy stellarator fusion power technology. Infinity Two could offer a complementary source of base load electrical generation for the region as early as the mid-2030s, the parties claim.

The cooperative agreement expands on Project Infinity, first launched by Type One Energy, TVA, and the U.S. DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in early 2024, with support from the state of Tennessee. Originally centered on deploying the Type One Energy Infinity One stellarator prototype in TVA’s Bull Run power plant, the parties say Project Infinity now encompasses a “deeper, broader engagement” toward commercialization of fusion energy. TVA and Type One Energy will collaborate on Infinity Two fusion power plant siting studies, environmental reviews, and licensing, as well as development of project plans and financing from various sources. Type One Energy will support TVA in its evaluation and review of the project.

Nuclear fusion occurs when two atoms combine to form a single atom. The combined atom has less mass than the original two atoms, with large amounts of energy released in the process. Getting energy from fusion – the process that powers the sun and stars – has been a great challenge on Earth. Scientists have been trying to replicate it as far back as the 1930s.

While there have been breakthroughs at the lab level, many experts’ believe it will take multiple decades for nuclear fusion to generate large-scale energy.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cat-bulldozer.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 16:03:33.228751

These four actions build on the numerous actions the Adams administration has taken to protect New Yorkers from the effects of climate change.","NEW YORK – The City of New York today announced that — as part of a coalition of dozens of cities, counties, and states from across the nation — it has filed three comment letters opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed reversal of its 2009 “Endangerment Finding.” The landmark 2009 finding holds that greenhouse gas emissions — including those from motor vehicles — drive climate change and endanger public health and welfare. The new proposal — issued on August 1, 2025 — would deny the EPA’s authority to regulate harmful air pollution that contributes to climate change, harms public health, and would eliminate all existing EPA vehicle emission standards.

Additionally, earlier this month, the City of New York and a coalition of 19 attorneys general filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Environmental Defense Fund v. Wright, supporting the plaintiffs in a case challenging the authority of the Climate Working Group, convened by the U.S. Department of Energy in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act requirements, to prepare a report that purports to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change.

This announcement builds on the work the Adams administration has done to address climate change and comes at the start of “Climate Week NYC,” the world’s biggest climate event of its kind. In 2024, Mayor Adams introduced the city’s first-ever climate budgeting publication through the city’s Fiscal Year 2025 Executive Budget. Climate budgeting is a process that incorporates science-based climate considerations into the city’s budget decision-making process by evaluating how actions and spending today contribute to meeting longer-term climate targets and needs. New York City is the first big city in the United States to adopt climate budgeting, joining other global cities, such as London, Oslo, and Mumbai, to utilize the process.

“New York City is no stranger to the devastating effects of natural disasters. With more extreme weather events hitting the five boroughs more often, for our safety and to protect our economy, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change, including by putting in place stronger federal regulations of greenhouse gases,” said Mayor Adams. “Attempts to undermine this scientific consensus should not be the basis for undoing important regulations that mitigate future environmental damage that threatens lives, brings harm to our communities, and hampers our economies. We are proud to stand with our partners from across the nation in taking multiple actions supporting long-held scientific findings that protect against environmental disasters in our communities.”

“More than a decade ago, the EPA formally determined that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of the American people, and that emissions from motor vehicles and engines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution that threatens public health and welfare,” said New York City Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant. “Now, over the span of a few months, the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA have sought to manufacture a basis to reject this overwhelming scientific consensus, endangering all Americans and all New Yorkers.”

The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the direct result of the landmark 2007 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA, which confirmed the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that threaten public health and welfare. In direct response to that opinion, and after more than two years of scientific review, the EPA determined, in 2009, that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that harm public health and welfare.

Increasing rates of natural disasters — like wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts — not only have a devastating effect on public health and safety, but on state and local economies as well.

Climate change poses existential risks to New Yorkers’ health and safety. Sea level rise in New York City is putting communities and infrastructure at risk of regular flooding. Extreme weather events — such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Ida in 2021 — can result in injury and loss of life due to exposure, interrupted utility service, or lack of access to emergency services. Additionally, warming temperatures exacerbate or introduce health problems. On average, more than 500 New Yorkers die prematurely because of extreme heat in New York City each year.

Not only does the EPA’s proposed reversal ignore those facts, but it also violates the EPA’s legal obligations under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change.

The coalition argues, in today’s letter, that the EPA’s new legal interpretations are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and binding Supreme Court precedent, and that the proposal would mark a drastic reversal of its own longstanding findings without any explanation grounded in science.

Regulatory enforcement for greenhouse gas emissions is also crucial to vehicle affordability, consumer choice, and to the success of the American automotive industry. The greenhouse gas program for vehicles incentivizes automakers to innovate and create better cars, saving drivers hundreds of billions of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs, and helps support domestic manufacturing and jobs. Repealing that program, as the EPA now proposes, will shutter factories, kill jobs, and wipe out billions of dollars in investments by Congress, states, and local governments to keep the American auto industry thriving and globally competitive.

Climate Working Group Comment Letter

Earlier this month, on September 2, the City of New York joined another coalition of 27 localities from around the nation in filing a comment letter opposing the Climate Working Group report that EPA relied on in its proposed recission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

In that comment letter, the coalition identified several legal flaws in the Climate Working Group report. In creating the Climate Working Group, the U.S. Department of Energy selected five widely known climate change skeptics, ignored well-established scientific integrity standards, and failed to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s procedures, which require the disclosure of all committee-related records and that committee meetings be open to the public.

Climate Working Group Amicus Brief

On August 29, the City of New York and 19 attorneys general from around the nation filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Environmental Defense Fund v. Wright, supporting the plaintiffs in their effort to declare the Climate Working Group’s report unlawful.

In their brief, the coalition argued that the Department of Energy violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act by establishing and utilizing the Climate Working Group, and that this violation will harm state and local governments’ strong interest in ensuring that the federal government rely on the best available science to guide its climate policy decisions. In New York City, the New York City Panel on Climate Change uses federal climate data to develop its own reports and mapping tools, which inform many city policies, including the Climate Resilience Design Guidelines and zoning rules related to current and future flood conditions.

On September 17, the district court held that the federal government is not exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

Joining the City of New York in filing this amicus brief were the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

In addition to the actions described above, Elijah Hutchinson, Executive Director of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice, testified before EPA on August 21 to oppose its proposed recission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards.

These four actions build on the numerous actions the Adams administration has taken to protect New Yorkers from the effects of climate change. Just last week, Mayor Adams broke ground on a $218 million public safety project to protect Red Hook from coastal flooding and save hundreds of millions of dollars for residents in lost property costs. And, as announced in the Mayor’s Management Report last week, in Fiscal Year 2025, the city saw major environmental gains and savings, largely due to composting and recycling. Overall recycling tonnage increased 4 percent, and the diversion rate of recyclables rose for a third consecutive year to 21.8 percent, the highest since Fiscal Year 2011. Tons of refuse disposed to landfills decreased to the lowest level in at least 15 years, largely due to the tons of organic waste that were diverted, which increased nearly 29 percent. In 2023, Mayor Adams celebrated the passage of the “City of Yes for Carbon Neutrality” proposal, a historic set of citywide zoning changes that will facilitate climate action, clean energy, and resiliency.

UV Curing for Composite Manufacturing

Ultraviolet energy (UV) curing, also known as energy curing, has been used by the composites industry for some time, but it is still not quite as well-known as some other curing chemistries. The extremely rapid cure speed leads to high throughput and productivity, while the breath of physical properties of the cured resins allow them to be used in a variety of applications. The possibility of making lower VOC/styrene free formulations with very long pot life and reduced waste are also benefits of UV technology. In this presentation, allnex will briefly review what UV curing entails and compare the advantages and challenges of energy curing with thermally curing technologies (for example, peroxide curing of UP resins).

How They Can Help Microgrids Meet ...,Lisa Cohn,,,,,https://www.microgridknowledge.com/generation-fuels/article/55318140/these-carbon-free-technologies-still-get-the-itc-how-they-can-help-microgrids-meet-soaring-demand,"A developing thermal storage option Most recently, Fourth Power announced that it’s developing thermal energy storage systems that are eligible for the ITC with components sourced in the U.S.
The result is one-ton blocks of pure carbon that can store heat, said Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power.
Fourth Power uses special solar cells–thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells –to transform light from the glowing white-hot infrastructure into electricity.
Thermal energy storage at $25/kWh “The high temperatures allow you to get an unprecedented amount of power density,” Ganesan said.
Fourth Power is now building a demonstration project in Massachusetts Its first commercial deployment is expected in 2028.","Fuel cells, geothermal, energy storage and nuclear energy are all still eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s investment tax credit (ITC), while the Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out the ITC for solar, wind and electric vehicles.

The ITC provides 30% tax credits for projects that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Developers can claim bonus credits for projects in low-income communities, energy communities or those that use domestic content.

Energy companies developing the ITC-eligible technologies are finding ways to take advantage of the ITC and source their materials in the U.S., avoiding Foreign Entity of Concern provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill Act that make it difficult to obtain materials in China and other countries.

This means these companies can help microgrid developers crank out clean kWh more quick ly and cost-effectively to help meet soaring demand from data centers, electrification and AI, they say. And they can be deployed 24-7 as baseload power.

A developing thermal storage option

Most recently, Fourth Power announced that it’s developing thermal energy storage systems that are eligible for the ITC with components sourced in the U.S.

Thermal energy storage is energy stored in a material as a heat source or a cold sink and saved for use at a different time, according to the federal Department of Energy. The systems can store thermal energy from hours to weeks. The energy can be discharged directly to change building temperatures and don’t require conversions from thermal to electrical energy.

Fourth Power’s system is unique because the technology, developed at Georgia Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology–has high energy density. The company uses any form of generation to heat petroleum coke, a form of raw carbon that’s released as part of petroleum refinement, and puts it in a kiln at 2,400 degrees Celsius. The result is one-ton blocks of pure carbon that can store heat, said Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power.

He noted that the process doesn’t sequester carbon, but doesn’t combust it, either.

Fourth Power uses special solar cells–thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells –to transform light from the glowing white-hot infrastructure into electricity.

“TPV cells are always converting light into power because heat and light are fundamentally the same phenomenon,” explained Asegun Henry, Fourth Power's founder and chief technologist. “Every object in the universe constantly radiates light, including our own bodies.” As objects heat up, they emit more light and shift toward higher frequencies.”

The high temperatures created by the company’s process spark higher power density.

Thermal energy storage at $25/kWh

“The high temperatures allow you to get an unprecedented amount of power density,” Ganesan said. “The hotter, the more efficient and the smaller the system is.” The company can build a 1-GWh battery on an acre of land, which is a relatively small footprint, he said.

The company expects to deploy grid-scale systems at less than $25/kWh to store power and $1/watt to output the power. By comparison, with lithium-ion batteries, it costs about $250/kWh to store power, he said.

Solar and wind energy are the least expensive and quickest ways to charge the storage systems, he said.

Fourth Power is selling the systems in 25-MW blocks, Ganesan said.

Storage for microgrids and critical infrastructure

“You can stack up the blocks, and this can support microgrids and critical infrastructure,” he said. It can also power data centers. One option is to

use behind-the-meter generation paired with the system, which could avoid interconnection delays.

The company plans to focus first on front-of-meter applications, working with independent power producers, utilities and hyperscalers. The systems would be off-grid microgrids to avoid interconnection delays, he said. Fourth Power is now building a demonstration project in Massachusetts Its first commercial deployment is expected in 2028.

IBIS stands for ‘The Intelligent Battery Integrated System’ and is designed to improve vehicle space usage, faster charging times and improved efficiency.

The European giant is working in partnership with battery company ‘Saft’ and has fitted this new technology to a Peugeot e-3008 electric SUV.

The IBIS technology allows for the inverter and charging systems to be embedded into the battery itself, making the unit more compact. However, it can still be topped up from an AC and DC rapid charge – ensuring shorter charge times – and will be able to supply power to the car’s motors and full electrical systems. In addition, the system will be able to feed power back to the grid where possible.

Peugeot also claims that the new system lifts the electric motor’s power output from 201bhp to 230bhp, while it’s claimed to boost efficiency by up to 10%; however, an official electric range figure from the car has not been revealed. The battery is 40kg lighter than a standard unit, which should help improve overall efficiency.

Also, charging speeds improve too, taking six hours rather than seven hours to top up using a standard AC charger similar to those equipped at homes.

Ned Curic, chief engineering and technology officer at Stellantis, said: “By rethinking and simplifying the electric powertrain architecture, we are making it lighter, more efficient and more cost-effective. These are the kinds of innovations that help us deliver better, more affordable EVs to our customers.”

EREVs use an EV platform with a large lithium-ion battery, but add a gas engine to recharge that battery and offer additional range.

But Hyundai's CEO said the priority with EREVs will be larger vehicles, following the pattern seen by other automakers.

Hyundai is the latest automaker to bet on an old-school technology to boost electric-vehicle adoption: the gas engine. And when it launches its first extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) in 2027 with added power from fossil fuels, the Korean automaker will follow a familiar pattern.

Hyundai's EREVs will primarily be used on ""larger vehicles,"" Hyundai Motor Company CEO José Muñoz said at a media briefing last week after its annual investor conference. At that event, Hyundai offered a few key new facts about its EREV program, including a target of 600 miles of range, ""EV-like"" driving experiences and a smaller battery than many of its conventional EVs.

But the platform won't be used for smaller vehicles, Muñoz said.

""We see them more useful for larger vehicles, because basically, you remove your range anxiety, and then you can, you can get [the] longer distances which are driven by the American consumer,"" Muñoz said.

He added that the utilization Hyundai sees with many of its EV customers, especially in California, is day-to-day commuting. ""They save money on gas, and then [we see] the model of using it in the day and charging overnight, very simple, like your phone. So no problem.""

But Muñoz added, ""If you want to go for a long weekend and you have to make a lot of miles, you have certain anxiety, because you don't know if the charger is going to work, etc, etc. So then you need a different technology.""

Hyundai is actually taking two approaches there, he said. One is expanding owners' fast-charging access by being a partner in the Ionna network along with several other automakers, and adopting the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug type from the factory. The other approach, Muñoz said, is to branch into EREVs for people who crave more long-distance driving.

What form that will take at Hyundai remains to be seen. The automaker has not announced any specific models that will use its forthcoming EREV platform. Past rumors have indicated possible EREV pickup trucks and variants of the Hyundai Santa Fe and Genesis GV70, but that's far from official.

In doing so, Hyundai would join several other automakers in adopting the EREV approach for larger vehicles. Scout Motors announced the ""Harvester"" EREV to go with its electric trucks and SUVs, and has said that customer orders overwhelmingly favor that version over the all-EV one. Ram recently canceled an all-electric pickup truck to focus on an EREV version instead. And Ford CEO Jim Farley has said his company needs to get into the EREV game because, in his words, ""Americans love their big cars. They love their big trucks.""

While plug-in hybrids are essentially gas vehicles with EV-style components, EREVs work in reverse—they're EVs where the gas engine only exists to recharge the battery. While earlier small vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt and BMW i3 would be considered EREVs today, the technology is now mostly being applied to bigger vehicles, especially in China. EREV platforms are catching on quickly there for larger SUVs.

Large electric SUVs and trucks require big batteries to achieve their desired range. But then they run into issues with towing and hauling, which can be key activities for those owners. Thus, EREVs are seen as a potential way to mitigate the need for a massive battery pack and assuage customers' range fears. Over time, the gas engine could even be deleted from these platforms as the charging infrastructure grows.

Additionally, Muñoz said that Hyundai is counting on hybrids and hybrid-type vehicles like EREVs if the United States—its most important market—sees a downturn in all-electric sales as tax credits and fuel economy penalties go away. That's why its new Georgia Metaplant is designed to be flexible in what it produces, he said.

""I think by by 2030, you will see a good balance, I would say roughly 50/50, between hybrids and EVs,"" Muñoz said. Whether that will include EREVs too someday remains to be seen, but if Muñoz is banking on them being a hit with Americans, it could be a no-brainer.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9mp4R0/s1/hyundai-erev-post.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 16:02:54.175843

In their letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers urged the agency to uphold its climate protections, stressing the need to protect New Yorkers from the escalating costs, damage, and dangers associated with climate change.

“We are deeply concerned by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding and what that will mean for New York State and our constituents’ health and safety. By undermining the scientific and legal basis for EPA to protect people from the pollution that causes climate change, this proposal will condemn New Yorkers to a less safe, less prosperous, and less livable environment for generations to come,” the lawmakers wrote.

In the letter, the lawmakers emphasized that New Yorkers are already living with the consequences of climate change, from Montauk to Niagara Falls and Prospect Park to Plattsburgh. They warned that these impacts are projected to intensify in the decades ahead unless significant and rapid action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with global scientific consensus.

“Since the Endangerment Finding was issued in 2009, New York has experienced numerous destructive, climate-fueled extreme weather events, including Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Hurricane Ida in 2021, and historic snowstorms in Western New York in November and December 2022,” continued the lawmakers. “These natural disasters have caused devastation throughout the state, resulting in billions of dollars in damage to infrastructure, private property, and ecosystems.”

The lawmakers warned that rising temperatures will bring more dangerously hot days across New York, threatening public health and key industries like farming. They also pointed to warmer, more humid conditions fueling the spread of ticks and increasing cases of Lyme disease, raising health risks and costs for families.

Clean, renewable energy is the most affordable energy available today and uses little water resources.","AUSTIN, Texas – As the country faces a rapid and significant shift in its energy landscape due to the data center boom, the Sierra Club’s Dirty Truth report is exposing just how much cost and pollution utilities are passing on to customers. This year’s Dirty Truth, released today, shows that most Texas utilities aren’t doing enough to deliver affordable, clean energy, despite electricity bills increasing faster than inflation – particularly in the Lone Star State.

According to this Sierra Club analysis, developed using utility-reported data, the 75 utilities nationwide scored a collective F – the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021. Three major Texas utilities scored as follows:

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) got another F – after years of Fs – the lowest score of all utilities in Texas and a sign it is making no progress to lower prices and pollution. By keeping the Fayette coal plant open east of Austin, near La Grange, and planning for zero investment in affordable renewables, LCRA is failing customers. LCRA sells its power wholesale to 29 cities and 4 rural electric cooperatives across Texas, so its operations have far-reaching impact.

Xcel Texas has maintained its B grade, largely due to forward-looking plans to retire the expensive, dirty, and water-guzzling Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle as the Ogallala Aquifer continues to dwindle.

CPS Energy in San Antonio scored a C as it has made some investments in additional solar and battery storage and is closing one coal unit, but it is doubling down on gas as part of its current and future portfolio.

Statements from the Sierra Club

“LCRA professes a mission to enhance Texans’ quality of life while keeping open a dirty, expensive coal plant and investing almost nothing in the most affordable forms of energy,” said Cyrus Reed, legislative and conservation director of the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter. “In fact, LCRA got one of the lowest clean energy scores in the entire United States even though reversing course would help lower bills for its city and co-op customers. If LCRA wants to truly improve our lives and be a good steward of our water resources, it needs to retire coal and build more clean, water-conserving solar, battery storage, and geothermal resources and fewer water-hungry, polluting gas plants.”

“It’s clear when looking at the abysmal nationwide score that our utilities are failing customers during such a crucial time. It’s refreshing to see Xcel Texas get a B after its solid commitment to retire the Tolk coal plant earlier than planned,” said Josh Smith, senior attorney for the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program. “This was such an important step – largely driven by the region’s water scarcity and the plant’s immense water needs – and Xcel Texas is also planning significant renewables to provide affordable energy to its service area. This is a reminder that utilities do have choices when planning for a future with increasing demand – and they should be taking the road less costly.”

To produce each utility’s grade, Dirty Truth focuses on three metrics that gauge impacts on affordability and public health due to fossil fuel pollution:

Utility efforts to retire coal plants by 2030. Burning coal for energy is outdated, extremely expensive, and it releases toxins into the air that are detrimental to health.

Utility efforts to not build new gas plants through 2035. Gas prices are volatile, and gas power plants are much more expensive than solar, wind, and battery storage – and are a significant contributor to climate change.

Washington (September 22, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and 10 of his Senate colleagues today wrote to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, urging the agency to reverse course on the elimination of federal standards for greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars and medium and heavy-duty trucks. The EPA’s move is enabled by the Trump EPA’s proposal to get rid of the 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions threaten our health and welfare by contributing to climate change, which is the underlying basis for EPA’s regulatory ability to address tailpipe climate pollution. The Trump administration’s proposed clean vehicles rollback would decimate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution from cars; the current standards on the books are projected to prevent 2,500 premature deaths, as well as save drivers $6,000 over the next five years by cutting fuel costs.

In the letter, the lawmakers write, “If the Trump administration persists with eliminating federal vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards, it will be responsible for damaging the environment, hurting public health, costing drivers money, cutting American jobs

and competitiveness, and increasing our dependence on foreign oil.”

The lawmakers conclude, “Americans should be able to drive and share the road with cleaner, more efficient vehicles that help clean up our air, save families money at the pump, and strengthen American competitiveness and energy independence. We urge you not to destroy these life- and cost-saving vehicle emission standards on the basis of faulty science and unlawful attacks on the clean air statutes passed by Congress.”

The letter is cosigned by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Senator Markey has been a champion for clean vehicles since stronger standards were enabled by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which included fuel economy language co-authored by then Representative Markey. On July 13, 2023, Senators Markey, Tom Carper (D-Del.), and Padilla led nearly 100 colleagues in writing a letter to then-Administrator Michael Regan, urging the EPA to finalize the strongest feasible multi-pollutant vehicle emission standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles by the end of 2023.

Most generally, these comments explain various ways in which EPA’s Proposed Rule, and the draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) on which the Proposed Rule relies, are arbitrary and capricious.
Moreover, U.S. standards for motor vehicles can spur further emissions reductions in foreign countries, delivering even more climate benefits.
Therefore, critical mistakes in its RIA add to the arbitrariness of its Proposed Rule.
EPA also ignores most externalities in most of its cost-benefit scenarios, including climate effects and public health effects.","In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to repeal its 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from motor vehicles cause or contribute to dangerous air pollution (Proposed Rule). Most generally, these comments explain various ways in which EPA’s Proposed Rule, and the draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) on which the Proposed Rule relies, are arbitrary and capricious.

EPA distorts the plain meaning of “requisite technology” under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. In fact, the “requisite technologies” for compliance are widespread and efficiently address climate change. As EPA’s past analyses have shown, manufacturers can deploy a range of technologies, including hybrid vehicles and cleaner gasoline engines, that will deliver trillions of dollars in climate benefits that justify the standards’ costs. Moreover, U.S. standards for motor vehicles can spur further emissions reductions in foreign countries, delivering even more climate benefits.

EPA’s theory that existing GHG standards negatively affect overall safety and “economic freedom” is flawed. The claim is based on an outdated model of scrappage effects and an overestimate of price elasticity. That old analysis did not apply to medium- or heavy-duty vehicles, and overlooked countervailing effects that could improve safety. The standards could help promote the overall financial standing of lower-income consumers, especially as more efficient vehicles begin to enter the used-vehicle market.

Contrary to EPA’s assertion, its draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) informed its proposed regulatory decisions: EPA admits that part of its reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding included assessing the standards’ costs and their effectiveness. Therefore, critical mistakes in its RIA add to the arbitrariness of its Proposed Rule. For example, EPA ignores billions of dollars in effects by focusing only on the repeal of the 2024 standards but not the simultaneous proposed repeal of all prior standards as well. EPA also ignores most externalities in most of its cost-benefit scenarios, including climate effects and public health effects.

EPA arbitrarily devalues future consumer fuel savings by relying on specious theories and methods. Neither empirical evidence nor the weight of academic literature supports EPA’s theories that consumers selectively apply unusually high discount rates to future fuel savings, that consumers have strictly binding budget constraints that specifically prevent the purchase of more energy-efficient technologies, or that manufacturers would choose to tradeoff performance attributes for fuel economy without substantial savings on compliance costs. Instead, well-established market failures explain the energy efficiency gap and justify keeping the GHG standards in place. Erasing all fuel savings after the first 2.5 years, as in Scenarios 4 and 5, is an especially unjustifiable approach to cost-benefit analysis.

EPA’s new “revealed preference methodologies” in Scenarios 6 and 7 are riddled with errors, leading to overinflated estimates of compliance costs, consumer welfare effects, and effects to the electric grid.

EPA’s artificially lowered fuel prices in Scenarios 3 and 5 are internally inconsistent and inconsistent with historical evidence on supply-side effects on global oil prices.

EPA fails to support its claim that leakage significantly affects the contribution of new U.S. motor vehicles to climate change and the effectiveness of U.S. standards. EPA offers no evidence for its various vague theories of leakage, ignores how standards actually affect rates of driving versus other transportation options, ignores the positive international spillover effects of U.S. regulations, and ignores how consumers will likely efficiently sort their purchase and utilization of electric, hybrid, and gasoline-powered vehicles.",https://policyintegrity.org/assets/img/thumbnail.png,N,,2025-09-22 17:02:46.346535

We will continue to evaluate and pursue additional utility-scale opportunities across North America, leveraging our proven development expertise to build a diversified and resilient portfolio of clean energy assets.""

Project Overview

Project Capacity - 30 MWp solar project located in southern Alberta. A land lease agreement has been signed with one landowner for the entire Project area.

Development Status - the Project has been under development for the last two years and is considered to be at the mid-stage of development with site control completed along with various other permitting and interconnection works. The project is currently in the AUC permitting process with a decision on the permit approval expected by the end of 2025.

Development Program - the Company is targeting having the Project ready to build in early 2027, with commissioning targeted for mid-2028.

Financial Forecast - once fully commissioned, the Project is expected to generate annualized revenue in the range of C$5.6m to C$6.0m and EBITDA of between C$3.8m to C$4.2m. The current cost estimate to build the Project ranges between C$38m and C$40m, which will include a combination of debt, equity and the Investment Tax Credit of up to 30% available for renewable energy projects in Canada. The Company intends to update these forecasts closer to construction commencing and as the commercial arrangements for the sale of electricity from the Project are finalized. Revolve intends to build, own and operate the Project, which, once operational, will substantially enhance the revenue and cashflow profile of the Company. Construction on the Project is currently targeted for 2027, subject to interconnection studies and final permitting. This schedule aligns strategically with the targeted construction of the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows solar project in 2026.

Under the terms of the LOI, which was entered into on September 19, 2025, the Company will pay an upfront consideration of C$75,000 upon signing of the definitive ATA, which includes the reimbursement of certain development costs incurred in the development of the Project to date. The Company has also agreed to pay further consideration and reimbursement of historical development costs of up to C$1,479,750, subject to the final installed capacity of the Project and linked to the successful completion of various milestones including the commencement of construction and the commercial operation date of the Project. It is expected that these milestones will be met during the period 2026 to 2028. The transaction will be financed through existing cash resources held by the Company.

The Project acquisition, once completed, will add to the Company's growing portfolio of operating and development projects in Alberta. Revolve is advancing the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows Solar Project which was recently granted approval from the AUC. The Company also operates the 6 MW Box Springs Wind Project in Alberta.

Non-IFRS Measures

This press release refers to certain non-IFRS measures including Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""EBITDA""). Non-IFRS measures and industry metrics do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. The term EBITDA consists of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA calculated in accordance with IFRS is net gain or net loss. The term EBITDA margin consists of the percentage of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. These measures, have limitations, and are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our filings on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca and posted on our website.

Financial Projections

The Company's financial projections are inherently speculative and may prove to be inaccurate. Any financial projections provided in this press release have been prepared in good faith based upon the estimates and assumptions considered reasonable by management. However, projections are no more than estimates of possible events and should not be relied upon to predict the results that the Company may attain. Future oriented financial information in this press release includes statements with respect to forecasted revenues and EBITDA that are expected to be generated by the Project. There is a risk that the assumptions related to these revenue and EBITDA forecasts may not be met and that the Project will not meet the conditions to start construction. The projections are based upon several estimates and assumptions and have not been examined, reviewed or compiled by independent accountants or other third-party experts, including assumptions with respect to the anticipated expenses and future revenues from the Project. These assumptions may vary from the actual results. Accordingly, there is no assurance that future events will correspond to management's assumptions for the Project. Any variations of actual results from projections related to the Project may be material and adverse. Future-oriented financial information and financial outlooks, as with forward-looking information generally, are, without limitation, based on the reasonable assumptions of the Company and management as at the date hereof. Our actual financial position and results of operations and the Project may differ materially from management's current expectations and, as a result, our revenue, profitability, EBITDA may differ materially from any revenue, and profitability profiles provided in this press release. Such information is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our actual financial position or results of operations.

Revolve does not provide reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as Revolve is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or number of various events that have not yet occurred, are out of Revolve's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For these same reasons, Revolve is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

The transaction is consistent with our M&A strategy of targeting projects under 30 MW in the US and Canada, where we continue to see excellent opportunities to acquire, develop, build and operate quality assets with attractive returns. We will continue to evaluate and pursue additional utility-scale opportunities across North America, leveraging our proven development expertise to build a diversified and resilient portfolio of clean energy assets.""

Project Overview

Project Capacity - 30 MWp solar project located in southern Alberta. A land lease agreement has been signed with one landowner for the entire Project area.

Development Status - the Project has been under development for the last two years and is considered to be at the mid-stage of development with site control completed along with various other permitting and interconnection works. The project is currently in the AUC permitting process with a decision on the permit approval expected by the end of 2025.

Development Program - the Company is targeting having the Project ready to build in early 2027, with commissioning targeted for mid-2028.

Financial Forecast - once fully commissioned, the Project is expected to generate annualized revenue in the range of C$5.6m to C$6.0m and EBITDA of between C$3.8m to C$4.2m. The current cost estimate to build the Project ranges between C$38m and C$40m, which will include a combination of debt, equity and the Investment Tax Credit of up to 30% available for renewable energy projects in Canada. The Company intends to update these forecasts closer to construction commencing and as the commercial arrangements for the sale of electricity from the Project are finalized. Revolve intends to build, own and operate the Project, which, once operational, will substantially enhance the revenue and cashflow profile of the Company. Construction on the Project is currently targeted for 2027, subject to interconnection studies and final permitting. This schedule aligns strategically with the targeted construction of the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows solar project in 2026.

Under the terms of the LOI, which was entered into on September 19, 2025, the Company will pay an upfront consideration of C$75,000 upon signing of the definitive ATA, which includes the reimbursement of certain development costs incurred in the development of the Project to date. The Company has also agreed to pay further consideration and reimbursement of historical development costs of up to C$1,479,750, subject to the final installed capacity of the Project and linked to the successful completion of various milestones including the commencement of construction and the commercial operation date of the Project. It is expected that these milestones will be met during the period 2026 to 2028. The transaction will be financed through existing cash resources held by the Company.

The Project acquisition, once completed, will add to the Company's growing portfolio of operating and development projects in Alberta. Revolve is advancing the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows Solar Project which was recently granted approval from the AUC. The Company also operates the 6 MW Box Springs Wind Project in Alberta.

Non-IFRS Measures

This press release refers to certain non-IFRS measures including Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""EBITDA""). Non-IFRS measures and industry metrics do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. The term EBITDA consists of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA calculated in accordance with IFRS is net gain or net loss. The term EBITDA margin consists of the percentage of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. These measures, have limitations, and are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our filings on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca and posted on our website.

Financial Projections

The Company's financial projections are inherently speculative and may prove to be inaccurate. Any financial projections provided in this press release have been prepared in good faith based upon the estimates and assumptions considered reasonable by management. However, projections are no more than estimates of possible events and should not be relied upon to predict the results that the Company may attain. Future oriented financial information in this press release includes statements with respect to forecasted revenues and EBITDA that are expected to be generated by the Project. There is a risk that the assumptions related to these revenue and EBITDA forecasts may not be met and that the Project will not meet the conditions to start construction. The projections are based upon several estimates and assumptions and have not been examined, reviewed or compiled by independent accountants or other third-party experts, including assumptions with respect to the anticipated expenses and future revenues from the Project. These assumptions may vary from the actual results. Accordingly, there is no assurance that future events will correspond to management's assumptions for the Project. Any variations of actual results from projections related to the Project may be material and adverse. Future-oriented financial information and financial outlooks, as with forward-looking information generally, are, without limitation, based on the reasonable assumptions of the Company and management as at the date hereof. Our actual financial position and results of operations and the Project may differ materially from management's current expectations and, as a result, our revenue, profitability, EBITDA may differ materially from any revenue, and profitability profiles provided in this press release. Such information is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our actual financial position or results of operations.

Revolve does not provide reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as Revolve is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or number of various events that have not yet occurred, are out of Revolve's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For these same reasons, Revolve is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

New geothermal systems are beginning to threaten the status of fossil energy for firm 24/7 power delivery, but there’s a catch. Most of these systems are still in the early stages of testing and demonstration. It could be years before the technology hits the market, and the US needs more electricity right here and now. Oh, wait…

More Geothermal Energy, STAT!

The US geothermal energy profile barely registers on the meter today. Traditional geothermal systems rely on a scarce few locations in western states, where naturally occurring rock, heat, and water factors are optimal for electricity generation.

Within these limitations, further restrictions involve the availability of transmission lines and other electrical infrastructure, as well as proximity to willing off-takers.

Those obstacles are beginning to crack as geothermal stakeholders begin to deploy advanced drilling and exploration methods borrowed from the oil and gas industry to create human-made geothermal conditions underground. The result is a new industry that can spread into more areas of the US, far beyond its current limitations (see more geothermal background here).

Geothermal Energy & The AI Solution

The question is how quickly these advanced systems can deliver the fossil-free kilowatts, and the Utah-based startup Zanskar has an answer. The company surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar last year when it earned a spot in the energy-forward plans of the US Air Force, and they have not let the grass grow under their feet.

Unlike other firms in the advanced geothermal field, Zanskar is still betting that naturally occurring conditions offer a good opportunity to produce power-quality energy, but they have been hidden deep underground where they are undetectable by conventional methods. To identify deep-earth conditions, Zanskar deploys an economical suite of modern assessment tools including artificial intelligence, geoscience modeling, and data collection.

“Our vertically-integrated, AI-native approach to geothermal development is delivering the speed to discovery and speed to development necessary to meet the new paradigm of rapid energy demand growth,” explains Zanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland.

“These latest deep drilling results only further confirm what we’ve known all along: conventional geothermal resources are far more abundant and bigger than previously believed,” Hoiland said, “and are the lowest-cost route to delivering gigawatts of reliable, carbon-free, baseload power at scale.”

The Pumpernickel Discovery

Zanskar already has one deep well under its belt, the Lightning Dock facility in New Mexico. The project involved upgrading an existing, conventional geothermal site that was considered to be unproductive, putting Zanskar’s business model to the test.

That worked out well for Zanksar, which bills Lightning Dock as “the most productive pumped geothermal well in the U.S.” if not the entire world. Last week the company announced another successful venture at a second site, located at the Pumpernickel geothermal field in Nevada, near the eastern Sonoma Range in the northern part of the state.

The Pumpernickel area was initially explored for geothermal resources in the 1970s, with little success. In 2006 researchers with the Geothermal Resources Council issued a new assessment and found indications that it hosts “extensive, structurally controlled, relatively high temperature geothermal reservoir suitable for electric power production,” but the report failed to stimulate much activity. A company called Sierra Geothermal Power Corp. picked up an option to explore the site in 2006, only to drop it just two years later.

With its advanced detection systems in hand, Zanskar gave the site another go and they hit the jackpot. “Zanskar’s drilling results at ‘Pumpernickel’ in Northern Nevada have proven one of the top-ranked geothermal discoveries in the U.S. of the last decade,” the company enthused in a press statement on September 18, adding that the discovery puts the site “on a path to becoming one of the largest geothermal power plants in Nevada.”

If all goes according to plan, Zanskar anticipates a phased-in construction timeline aimed at delivering first power in just three years.

Follow The Money

As described b the company, that three-year timeline is “faster than anyone thought possible,” putting Zanskar on a good footing to compete against fossil power plants and nuclear energy, too. As for competing on cost, Zanskar is among those making the case for further improvements, much as the cost of wind and solar has dropped over the years. The company credits its suite of assessment tools with significantly reducing the cost of discovery per megawatt “by an order of magnitude” compared to conventional methods.

Zanskar is not alone. The prospect of introducing a significant, economical new non-fossil energy resource to the US power grid also has investors banging on the door. One example is another Utah-based firm, Rodatherm, which just closed out its Series A funding round after oversubscribing at $38 million, which it describes as “the largest first venture raise for a geothermal startup of all time.”

Leading the investor charge was the Canadian firm Evok Innovations, with participation from TDK Ventures, Toyota Ventures, TechEnergy Ventures, MCJ, Active Impact Investments, Renewal Funds, Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, and Giga Investments, among others.

Rodatherm claims that it can compete with fossil systems on cost, deploying a modular, closed-loop system analogous to a heat pump, achieving a 50% efficiency improvement compared to conventional systems based on water cycling. The company plans to focus its Series A haul on a pilot system in Utah, which is scalable to a full 100-megawatt facility.

Geothermal Energy Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

“Rodatherm’s advanced geothermal system is expected to achieve competitive levelized costs of energy with firm power, including fossil fuels, at early project scale and is designed to have a decades long operating life,” the company states.

Ouch! That sure sounds like Rodatherm expects to pull the rug out from under fossil fuels, though for some reason (maybe this one), US President Donald Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” plan has embraced geothermal energy with no discernible objection from fossil energy stakeholders.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, consider that some fossil energy stakeholders have already demonstrated their willingness to adopt geothermal energy into their portfolios as illustrated by the interest of two leading oilfield services firms in the the US geothermal startup Fervo.

The potential for one hand to wash the other is also in play elsewhere around the world, the German geothermal startup Factor2 Energy being one example. Factor2 has come up with a geothermal system that piggybacks onto CO₂ storage sites, a value-added proposition aimed at attracting dollars to the carbon capture and storage field. On September 19 the company announced a seed funding haul of $9.1 million, led by At One Ventures with High-Tech Gründerfonds, Gründerfonds Ruhr, Verve Ventures, and Siemens Energy Ventures participating.

Factor2 Energy has developed a geothermal system using stored CO₂ as a working fluid. The system was developed by three principles at the company, who initially worked on the project at Siemens Energy. The seed funding will go to a pilot project with the potential for scale-up.

Factor2 expects that its CO₂ solution will cut costs by leveraging existing underground conditions and eliminating the use of water and brine as a primary working fluid. The idea is to leverage captured CO₂ at deep underground storage sites, where it absorbs heat from the surrounding rock. “As it absorbs geothermal heat from the surrounding rock, its density decreases, initiating a buoyancy-driven circulation known as the thermosiphon effect,” Factor2 explains.

“As a result, the CO₂ rises naturally to the surface via production wells, eliminating the need for subsurface pumps and significantly reducing parasitic energy consumption and mechanical complexity,” the company adds.

The closed-loop system runs the CO₂ through a turbine at the surface to generate electricity. The CO₂ is then cooled and shunted back down to the storage site.

Attorney General James emphasizes that failing to act on climate change will have – and is already having – deadly consequences.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James is co-leading a coalition of attorneys general, counties, and cities in a series of actions opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) unlawful proposal to rescind its landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding, which established that greenhouse gas emissions drive climate change and pose a threat to public health and welfare. Attorney General James and the coalition assert that the administration’s proposal would irreversibly damage the nation’s efforts to combat the climate crisis by abandoning the fight to regulate harmful air pollution.

“Climate change is real, it is dangerous, and it is already hurting communities in New York and across the nation,” said Attorney General James. “With this reckless proposal, the EPA is ignoring science in favor of abandoning its responsibility to protect the American people. Rolling back these critical protections would worsen asthma, heart disease, and premature deaths, and put vulnerable communities at even greater risk. My office will always fight to defend science, protect public health, and hold the federal government accountable.”

In a comment letter submitted to EPA today, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that rescinding the Endangerment Finding would violate settled law, binding Supreme Court precedent, and overwhelming scientific consensus. The coalition warns that reversing course would endanger the health and safety of millions of Americans, particularly vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, low-income communities, and workers already disproportionately harmed by climate change and air pollution. The coalition points to harms like extreme heat, worsening storms, wildfires, and flooding as examples of the growing threats that would be impacted by abandoning these protections – protections that the EPA is legally obligated to uphold under the Clean Air Act, which requires EPA to regulate air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, that endanger public health and welfare.

In a second letter to EPA today, Attorney General James and the coalition emphasize the importance of preserving strong federal motor vehicle emissions standards. For decades, EPA has recognized that pollution from cars and trucks contributes to asthma, heart disease, impaired lung development, low birthweight, and premature death. Current standards are projected to prevent more than eight billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions over the next 30 years and avoid $1.82 trillion in climate harms. In today’s letter, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that rolling back these protections would violate the Clean Air Act and harm public health, hinder American innovation, and place U.S. automakers at a competitive disadvantage in global markets that increasingly prioritize zero- and low-emission vehicles.

Earlier this month, Attorney General James led a coalition in a separate comment letter opposing a flawed and unlawful report from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Climate Working Group, which forms the supposed scientific basis for EPA’s proposed rescission. The report was drafted in less than two months by well-known climate skeptics with no peer review, and the coalition argues that the final report ignores federal standards of scientific integrity and fails to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. They also allege the report is riddled with inaccuracies and mischaracterizations of decades of peer-reviewed climate science. In the letter, Attorney General James and the coalition urged DOE to withdraw the report entirely. Last month, Attorney General James and the coalition also filed an amicus brief challenging the report, arguing that the federal government cannot rely on such unlawful and unreliable findings to justify climate policy.

Attorney General James emphasizes that failing to act on climate change will have – and is already having – deadly consequences. In the past 20 years, the number of billion-dollar climate disasters in New York State has more than doubled compared to the previous 20 years. There have also been over 90 percent more fatalities due to extreme heat, severe floods and storms, and hurricanes. New York City alone now averages over 500 heat-related deaths each year, largely the result of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our climate.

These coordinated actions, which Attorney General James co-led with the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, reflect a broad coalition of states, counties, and cities united in defense of the Endangerment Finding, federal vehicle standards, and the scientific foundation of national climate policy. Together, the coalition is urging EPA to abandon its unlawful and unsupported proposal and to recommit to its duty under the Clean Air Act to protect public health and welfare from the harms of greenhouse gas emissions.

Joining Attorney General James in several of these actions are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. Also joining several actions are the Chief Legal Officers of the City and County of Denver, City and County of San Francisco, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and the Cities of Chicago and New York.",https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/oag-social-preview.png,N,,2025-09-22 15:02:55.657318

Jackson County leaders have been engaged in talks with NextEra Energy Resources to establish a new solar energy farm for years. The project, named Jeffrey Solar, is expected to cover hundreds of acres of space in the county with solar panels and generate millions in tax revenue for the county while also adding numerous work opportunities.

Not all local residents see the project as beneficial, or wanted, and are voicing their opposition to it. 27 News got in touch with both the energy company and locals to find out where people stand on the sweeping solar project.

NextEra Energy Resources

27 News touched base with NextEra Energy Resources on Sept. 9 to learn more about the company’s plans for the new solar project in Jackson County. NextEra spokeswoman Laura Gies said the company is focused on building strong relationships with the communities its projects border and supporting nearby residents.

“Renewable energy projects, like the proposed Jeffrey Solar are attractive to local communities, as they provide numerous economic benefits, including good jobs and the potential for millions of dollars in additional tax revenue, which can be used to enhance schools, roads and essential services,” Gies said.

Jeffrey Solar is expected to add an additional $136 million in tax revenue for local communities over the course of 30 years, create new employment opportunities during the construction of the solar plant and produce 500 megawatts of renewable energy, according to an economic impact study. Gies said NextEra is currently working with the Jackson County Planning and Zoning Committee prior to construction of the solar farm.

“We appreciate the Planning and Zoning Committee’s collaborative efforts in drafting the solar ordinance and look forward to adhering to Jackson County’s regulations as we advance the Jeffrey Solar project through the permitting process,” Gies said. “We will develop and submit an application for a project that the county can be proud of – one that creates homegrown, renewable energy, good jobs and economic growth for the local communities and the state of Kansas.”

Jeffrey Solar is currently scheduled to begin operations by February 2030, according to NextEra’s website. The entire project is set to take up 5,000 acres of space in the county, which equates to about eight square miles of land or nearly 3,800 football fields. NextEra states on the project’s website that solar projects create sources of renewable energy while also preserving clean water and air.

“For more than two decades, NextEra Energy Resources has been investing in Kansas,” Gies said. “We remain committed to continued energy development, leveraging all forms of energy across renewables, battery energy storage, natural gas, nuclear and other critical energy infrastructure.”

Local criticism and lawsuit

27 News got in touch with some locals in Jackson County to find out what opinions they hold about the solar project. Some have objected to the construction of the plant, claiming it would have several negative impacts on the nearby area and environment.

Local residents and the City of Rossville filed a lawsuit in early 2025 against the U.S. Department of Treasury (USDT) and Jeffrey Solar in an attempt to halt the project. The plaintiffs claimed the use of taxpayer funding for the project, in the form of tax credits, should require a review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regarding the impact the solar farm will have on the environment. However, a U.S. district judge later dismissed the suit in July, ruling the plaintiffs lacked standing.

“Plaintiffs’ claims, arguments, and requested relief have been difficult to analyze. They are trying to use the procedural requirements of NEPA as a roadblock because they do not like what Congress has chosen to incentivize and what regulations Jackson County is considering. But those challenges must be made to the legislative branch, not to the judiciary.”

Case 5:25-cv-04003-HLT-BGS excerpt

Tom Hoffman is one of the landowners who filed the lawsuit. In a statement to 27 News sent on Sept. 14, he claimed the project will “destroy 5,000 or more acres of land, at taxpayer expense” and cause damage to the environment.

“This project will lower non participating land owners quality of life, reduce their property use, possibly harm the health of those people nearby as well as lowering their property values,” Hoffman said.

Austin Nimocks with PNT Law Firm, speaking on behalf of Hoffman on Sept. 18, said the dismissal of the lawsuit left them “disappointed” but that it is currently being appealed in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He claimed that a big issue with the project is that it lacks an environmental review.

“The proposed industrial project in Kansas is not undergoing any significant environmental review, though it is planned for a sensitive environmental area containing endangered species and which is prone to flooding, among other things,” Nimocks said.

Documents for the “Working Solar Draft” listed on the county’s website for the solar project do mention the Jackson County Planning Commission, and other county officials, will take into consideration the impact the project will have on wildlife, the appearance of the local area, nearby agricultural operations and more. The draft places additional requirements on the project such as where it can be located and reducing the impact it may potentially have on “environmentally and historically sensitive lands.”

Terrence Kaufman, a local property owner, said he has been following the Jeffrey Solar project since 2022. He said his long-standing plan to build a home on his land is on hold due to the project, and he fears the arrival of numerous solar panels would be detrimental to life in the rural countryside.

“It would be totally unreasonable to build a home in the vicinity [of the project],” Kaufman said.

Matt DeVader, another local resident, said he lives on a farm not too far south of Holton and owns a small solar farm of his own. While a user of renewable energy himself, he believes the creation of a solar farm on the scale of Jeffrey Solar would be too great of an impact to the environment.

“The overall environmental costs to build large or numerous solar or wind components does not yet provide a net gain to the environment,” DeVader said. “It does in fact make an overall huge net damage to our environment.”

Public meetings

Jackson County locals are invited to attend two upcoming meetings on the solar project later this month and in early October at 400 New York, Room 104 in Holton. People are encouraged to share with county commissioners their thoughts and opinions on the project during these meetings.

6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 25.

6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 2.

The Jackson County Planning Commission will take comments into consideration but will not give out any comments of its own during these sessions. People are encouraged to follow several guidelines during the meetings to help ensure the discussions remain both orderly and efficient.

The conversation focused on liquified natural gas (LNG), or natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, which can reduce its volume to about 1/600th of its size as a gaseous methane molecule, making it transportable over long distances, particularly via shipping. Dan Byers, vice president of policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute, noted that on February 24, 2016, a tanker left Cheniere‘s Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana, marking the very first LNG export from the Lower 48 states. Since then, in less than a decade, the U.S. has become a leading exporter.

Filip Schittecatte, president of LNG market development at ExxonMobil Upstream Company, noted that the U.S. has a competitive advantage in transporting affordable natural gas produced in one area to demand centers worldwide. Plus, adding an LNG offtake market to the U.S.’s well-functioning domestic market was a smaller step to take than elsewhere in the world, where “there is not a lot of market locally, and so you really have to justify the entire investment in the upstream, as well as building the liquefaction unit, and then you’re in need of finding the customers to underpin the entire project.”

This will be particularly important for the U.S. on the road to mid-century: ExxonMobil estimates that by 2050, one-quarter of the entire world’s energy will come from natural gas, with 20% of that supplied through LNG, compared to just 12% through LNG today. Schittecatte said that this energy form has “a very strong growth prospect on a global level,” and the country’s ability to export it would “would actually, in our view, keep the U.S. proportional to the entire global market’s growth.” Over the past decade alone, according to Rob Jennings, vice president of natural gas markets at the American Petroleum Institute, global demand for LNG has increased by 60%, with the U.S. accounting for approximately one-quarter of both natural gas production and global LNG exports.

Over the past several years, this increasing demand has been driven by a growing focus on energy security. Referencing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Jennings explained, “A lot of countries took a look at their energy policies and realized that they may not have been thinking about energy security as much as they should have been.” Despite the U.S. taking the slot as the world’s number one natural gas producer, and there being an EU proposal on the table to phase out Russian imports completely, Byers claims they will not be able to do so unless U.S. LNG providers continue to come online: “These countries also want to have that optionality to have a trusted partner. And so really, in a way, the timing is just extremely fortuitous that our next wave of projects is coming along just as the geopolitics is heating up.”

At the end of the day, according to Jennings, the demand for LNG itself “sends an important signal to upstream producers like ExxonMobil that they still should be investing in upstream, and that midstream companies should still be investing in pipeline capacity, and that does help build that robust system… Our big, comprehensive, and well-built-out natural gas system that really underpins our energy security.”

LNG demand is also being driven by the trend toward decarbonization, as natural gas burns about twice as clean as coal, providing a cleaner alternative. Since 2005, the U.S. power sector alone has reduced emissions by about 40%. Jennings stated that “the biggest driver of that was the switch from coal to natural gas. In the power sector, we used to burn a billion tons a year of coal. Today we burn half that… What the U.S. LNG fleet allows us to do is export that template for reducing emissions that has worked so dramatically well here in the U.S.” Schittecatte added that 70% of LNG demand comes from the Asia Pacific, where buyers have come together to start the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement toward Net-zero (CLEAN) Initiative. The partnership, supported by the governments of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Australia, sees the world’s largest demand center asking producers to provide information on their emission management and reduction efforts, allowing the U.S. to demonstrate its advantages.

Not only does natural gas offer a decarbonized resource for American trade, but the industry has increasingly recognized its value. Exxon has achieved more than a 60% reduction in the methane intensity of its operated assets since 2016. “I think it feels natural for us to do because it addresses both sides of the end equation,” explained Schittecatte. “It provides the energy we’d like to supply to market, and doing so by also addressing the emissions.” Jennings said this can be seen in the rest of this ecosystem, as well: “The broader industry has reduced the methane intensity of U.S. onshore oil and gas production 59% since 2015. And one of the most remarkable things about that is that’s not been regulatory driven. Those changes have been industry-driven. That’s what shareholders want.”

Moving forward, one of the challenges highlighted was the importance of the U.S. continuing to show its leadership in the sector. Jennings mentioned that when President Biden introduced an LNG permitting pause, “it injected a ton of uncertainty,” after LNG had been “almost a bipartisan exercise for the first eight years.” Meanwhile, Byers commented, “I think there’s a fairly good consensus that LNG exports do not raise emissions, and, in fact, they decrease emissions, but that’s something that’s still not going away, so we have to sort of be diligent, and you’ll see continued progress in addressing methane through the value chain.” Additionally, the country should only pursue goals that do not impede our reliability as a trading partner. Schittecatte said the idea of having LNG exports shipped by U.S.-built and -flagged vessels is an endeavor that would hinder the industry because it would have to start from scratch.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/116243529_3276249455772478_2325338291113300235_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 00:58:09.596595

Kaufman, Stephen Lacey, Open Circuit",,,,,https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/will-utilities-deploy-next-generation-meters-to-support-a-smarter-more-flexible-grid/,"In the early 2000s, U.S. utilities began replacing analog electricity meters with so-called smart meters, which communicate with utilities wirelessly.
By 2022, 77% of U.S. homes and businesses had a smart meter installed, according to the Institute for Electric Innovation.
She called next-generation smart meters mini computers.
“In Michigan, I think roughly 95% of residential customers now have [1.0] smart meters,” she said.
Sherman said she would like to see regulatory oversight in Michigan that would push utilities toward proactive planning for upgrading to next-generation smart meters.","In the early 2000s, U.S. utilities began replacing analog electricity meters with so-called smart meters, which communicate with utilities wirelessly. This advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enables a range of utility benefits, from automated meter reading to outage detection and more efficient power restoration.

AMI grew nationwide after 2009, thanks to federal funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. By 2022, 77% of U.S. homes and businesses had a smart meter installed, according to the Institute for Electric Innovation. Research shows that for utilities, the investment paid off.

In recent years, however, smart meter technology has advanced. Laura Sherman, president of the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, a trade association that advocates for clean energy policy in the state, wants the state’s energy providers to keep up with the newest technology, and to ensure it helps consumers save energy and money.

She called next-generation smart meters mini computers. “What we have now in Michigan is like a flip phone,” she said during a recent interview on the With Great Power podcast. Those “flip phones” are like smart meters 1.0, whereas newer 2.0 models are more like iPhones, and are capable of running applications too advanced for deployed smart meter 1.0 networks.

Now, as more advanced smart meters are becoming available, the EIBC wants Michigan’s utility providers Consumer Energy and DTE to develop a roadmap for upgrading those networks. “In Michigan, I think roughly 95% of residential customers now have [1.0] smart meters,” she said.

While smart meter 1.0 technology has helped utilities improve the accuracy and frequency of meter readings, ”it hasn’t done a good job of providing customer benefits,” Sherman said. She blamed some of that on poor planning and coordination with other service providers. But she also pointed to meters’ limited capabilities, saying they don’t always support applications that would help consumers lower their energy usage and spending.

Smart meter transition

Sherman isn’t alone. As utilities around the country start to upgrade to next-generation smart meters, industry watchers — including the hosts of the Open Circuit podcast — want to ensure that they’re capable of supporting distributed energy resources like virtual power plants and demand response programs.

That’s becoming more important as more consumers install battery storage in their homes, or switch to electric appliances like heat pumps and other devices that have Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to energy applications. Electric vehicle charging also highlights the use of smart meters and applications that control the flow of electrons based on rates and demand.

If it means you’ll pay a lower rate and reduce grid stress, “you don’t really care if the utility shifts the charging from right when you get home to midnight,” Sherman said. “As long as you have enough [charge] in the morning.” The same is true, she said, of heating water in a home. “If you take a shower, you just want the water to be hot, but you don’t care if the water heater turns on the minute you stop.”

Sherman pointed to National Grid as a utility that is deploying next-generation AMI and leaning into customer-facing benefits. In 2023, National Grid’s Transformation Programs lead Carlos Nouel noted that although data collection from earlier smart grid deployments was seamless for the utilities, it wasn’t frequent enough to unlock the visibility needed to support responsive applications.

“In the past, we just had 15-minute interval data, but as an industry claimed we had real-time information. The reality is, when you’re 15 minutes behind — and you might even push it every hour at best, or even every eight hours — that’s not real real-time,” he said.

Sherman said she would like to see regulatory oversight in Michigan that would push utilities toward proactive planning for upgrading to next-generation smart meters.

“ I don’t want [utilities] to make investments in things that are not going to work or that are going to become obsolete,” she said. “But I really think that if the utility is able to look at the full benefits, and the regulators are able to push them to look at the full benefits, I’m hopeful that we can move the conversation along.”

She warned that just investing in new meters without building clear business and use cases could lead to a second round of underutilized meters that fail to deliver new benefits to users.

“We need to better understand how the investments… are going to then benefit customers. It was a promise that was made with the first generation [smart meters] and it didn’t bear out.”

Related: Would You Buy An EV After The Tax Credit Expires?

President Trump’s decision to axe the previous Biden administration’s $7,500 of tax credits against an EV purchase means the nationwide subsidies will cease at the end of this month. Some Californians, clean air campaigners, and several automakers had hoped Newsom would step in to offer state aid to replace the federal incentives, something he himself had previously pledged. But last week, he told reporters it was unaffordable.

No Safety Net from Sacramento

“We can’t make up for the federal vandalism of those tax credits [by the Trump administration],” Newsom said at a press conference when asked what he was planning to do about replacing the expiring credits.

“But we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure,” he continued, highlighting that the state now has over 200,000 public chargers compared with only 120,000 gas pump nozzles.

Newsom claimed in 2024 that he would step in to replace the federal EV aid if it was ever eliminated, but following through on that promise has proved impossible due to California’s growing budget deficit. An earlier state subsidy program ended there in 2023, though after Newsom’s latest speech, his office reportedly said it could be reintroduced next year, potentially by using cash generated by California’s carbon-trading scheme.

A Broader Fight Over Clean Air

In addition to railing against Trump’s work to sabotage California’s nearly 60-year fight to clean up automobile pollution, Newsom slammed GM and other automakers. He accused them of being complicit in the push to block California’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles set to take effect in 2035.

The Trump administration has let RFK Jr loose on the energy sector in the US","The United States added 14.5 GW of power to the grid in the first half of 2025, thanks to the increased reliance on solar power in America. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced that 91% of new US electrical generating capacity added in the H1 2025 can be attributed to solar and wind energy, which proves that the renewable energy sector is becoming a crucial staple of the American energy sector, despite the best efforts of the Trump administration. The current President has bolstered the coal and gas sector while making significant moves to dampen the renewable energy sector.

Solar power holds the lead for new energy capacity for 22 consecutive months

There is no doubt in our minds that solar is the fastest and most crucial form of energy production in the United States energy sector. Despite the executive orders that the Trump administration has signed into order that aim to keep the ageing coal and gas sector thriving, the evidence from the FERC points to solar as the most dominant force in the energy sector in the United States.

In June alone, solar power provided 82% of new capacity, making it the 22nd consecutive month solar held the lead among all energy sources. For the first half of this year, solar played an integral part in the growth of the energy sector in the United States, adding 14,567 MW of utility-scale during the first six months of 2025, which was 74.9% of the total new capacity placed into service by all sources.

Wind and natural gas are failing to match the potential of solar power in the United States

The other renewable energy sources pale in comparison to solar. Wind, for example, expanded by 10.53 GW while natural gas increased by just 2.73 GW. Further strengthening the standing of solar power in the energy sector in the United States. FERC also reports that solar will continue to grow and has forecasted that net “high probability” additions of solar between July 2025 and June 2028 total 92,660 MW.

The renewable energy sector continues to grow as the US requires more power from the energy sector

While wind and nuclear power remain an essential part of the American energy sector, they can not keep up with the growing embrace and acceptance of the potential that solar power presents to the average American.

The total installed capacity of solar power (11.34%) is now nearly equal to wind (11.83%), which means that if the current rate of energy production is taken into consideration, solar will easily surpass the wind sector to become the dominant renewable energy sector in the United States.

“Clearly, we need more incentives to quickly increase the use of wind and solar power; they will cut costs, increase our energy independence and our national security…” – Ralph Nader

At the current rate of expansion, by July 1, 2028, renewables would account for 38.1% of total available installed utility-scale generating capacity. One finds it challenging to understand the Trump administration’s hatred towards the solar and wind sector, especially considering the innovation taking place in the solar sector as of late.

Blue Ridge’s website states it has more than 700 employees. Blue Ridge Power is not part of Blue Ridge Energy or Blue Ridge Electric.

Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has used his second term to end projects related to wind and solar energy.

Developers and analysts predicted that the legislation would slash the installation of renewable energy over the next decade.

Blue Ridge cited changes in the industry as the cause of the layoffs.

“Blue Ridge Power has experienced market headwinds similar to those impacting the entire renewable energy industry, requiring Pine Gate Renewables to dedicate significant resources to support the organization.

Using a range of public data sources, it visualizes power transmission hubs in megawatts (MW), highlighting where the electric grid is already working hard, and where future pressure may build.

The table below highlights counties that use the most power for data center facilities:

Loudoun County, Virginia (home to “Data Center Alley”) tops the list with nearly 6,000 MW of active capacity and another 6,300 MW planned.

Why Are Data Centers Located Where They Are?

It’s tempting to assume that large populations drive data center development, but that’s often not the case. Instead, it comes down to a mix of factors:

Electricity availability and cost: Data centers consume vast amounts of power. States like Virginia, Texas, and Oregon offer competitive electricity pricing and stable infrastructure.

Access to water: Many facilities use water for evaporative cooling, so proximity to aquifers or rivers can be crucial.

Fiber networks: Low latency is king. Proximity to fiber optic infrastructure and subsea cable landing stations is critical.

Zoning and incentives: Tax incentives and permissive local zoning laws can make or break a deal.

With this in mind, here are a few areas on the map worth highlighting:

Ashburn, VA and Surrounding DC Suburbs

The data center cluster around the DC suburbs, especially Ashburn, is known as the “Data Center Capital of the World” and “Data Center Alley.” It hosts the largest concentration of internet infrastructure globally, where about 70% of the world’s internet traffic flows daily. This area offers abundant and reliable power from Dominion Energy, dense fiber connectivity, aggressive state tax incentives, and proximity to major government and enterprise customers, making it the preferred hub for hyperscale cloud and data companies.

The I-85 Corridor

This region, which roughly runs from Atlanta up into Virginia, is emerging as a strategic data center hub. The corridor benefits from improved transmission infrastructure, and growing local tax incentives. Atlanta’s proximity to major East Coast markets and Virginia Beach’s new subsea cable landing stations make this region a digital on-ramp to global networks.

West Texas

Known for its vast open spaces and powerful winds, West Texas offers some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. It’s also home to major renewable energy projects, including wind and solar farms that help data center operators meet clean energy goals. This has drawn attention from major players like Microsoft and Meta.

Eastern Washington and Oregon

The Columbia River powers a dense cluster of hydroelectric dams, which in turn support energy-hungry data centers in towns like The Dalles and Quincy. The cool, dry climate further reduces the need for mechanical cooling, making this region one of the most cost-efficient for data center operations.

Can the Grid Keep Up?

U.S. data centers already consume 2-3% of the country’s electricity. According to WRI, this could double by 2030, especially with AI workloads driving GPU server farms that are far more energy-intensive than traditional ones.

Meanwhile, the pressure is on utilities and policymakers to expand grid capacity faster than ever before. Interconnection queues are long, and power disputes are already delaying projects in places like Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley.

Yet, the demand shows no signs of slowing, making the power grid one of the most important tech battlegrounds of the next decade.

According to InvestingPro analysis, the company operates with significant volatility, reflected in its beta of 2.21, making it more than twice as reactive to market movements as the average stock. As the company leverages its strong market position and focuses on innovative solutions, it must also contend with policy uncertainties and potential shifts in the competitive landscape.

Market Leadership and Financial Performance

Sunrun has established itself as a dominant force in the residential solar sector, boasting a significant market share in both solar panel installations and storage solutions. While the company maintains its leadership position with annual revenue of $2.13 billion and 3.27% year-over-year growth, InvestingPro data reveals some financial challenges, including a substantial debt-to-equity ratio of 4.84 and rapid cash burn. These metrics are among the 13+ key insights available to InvestingPro subscribers, helping investors make more informed decisions about this volatile solar player.

In the second quarter of 2025, Sunrun reported revenue of $569.3 million, representing an 8.7% year-over-year increase and surpassing consensus expectations of $559 million. This growth was primarily driven by consumer agreements, which saw an 18% year-over-year increase to $458 million. The company added 28,823 customers in Q2, marking a 22% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.3% rise year-over-year.

Notably, Sunrun’s Net Subscriber Value, a key metric indicating the value created per customer, increased significantly to $17,390 from $10,390 in the previous quarter. This improvement reflects the company’s ability to enhance its value proposition and operational efficiency.

Strategic Initiatives and Future Outlook

Sunrun’s strategic focus on storage solutions and grid services positions the company well for future growth opportunities. The company has been proactive in its approach to potential regulatory changes, implementing a safe harbor strategy for equipment that could provide a significant competitive advantage post-2025.

The introduction of new product offerings, such as the ""Flex"" product, aims to capture additional customer consumption post-solar installations, potentially enhancing margins over time. This strategic move aligns with the company’s goal of diversifying its revenue streams and increasing customer lifetime value.

Sunrun’s emphasis on storage-first solutions is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses the growing demand for energy resilience and grid stability. The company’s strong market share in U.S. residential storage installations (42%) provides a solid foundation for capitalizing on this trend.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Impacts

The regulatory landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for Sunrun. The company is navigating the uncertainties surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and potential changes to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential solar systems. Despite these challenges, analysts tracked by InvestingPro project positive earnings of $1.30 per share for fiscal year 2025, though the company’s overall financial health score remains weak at 1.49 out of 5, indicating potential vulnerabilities to policy shifts.

The proposed elimination of the ITC in the U.S. House budget bill passed on May 22, 2025, has raised concerns about the potential impact on annual installations. However, Sunrun is exploring strategies to mitigate these risks, including structuring Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to capture ITC benefits and seeking state-level policy support.

The company’s safe harboring strategy for equipment could prove advantageous, potentially extending the benefits of solar tax credits through 2030. This proactive approach may provide Sunrun with a competitive edge in navigating policy changes and market transitions.

Competitive Landscape and Market Dynamics

As the residential solar market evolves, Sunrun faces both opportunities and challenges. The potential market contraction in 2026 due to policy changes could lead to a shift towards leases and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), areas where Sunrun has a strong foothold.

The company’s scale and market leadership position it well to navigate market transitions and potential regulatory changes. Sunrun’s ability to leverage its strong balance sheet and negotiating power with suppliers could lead to market share gains, particularly as smaller competitors may struggle with capital constraints.

Bear Case

How might the elimination of residential solar tax credits impact Sunrun’s growth?

The potential elimination of residential solar tax credits, particularly the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), poses a significant risk to Sunrun’s growth trajectory. The ITC has been a crucial driver in reducing costs for homeowners adopting rooftop solar systems, and its removal could lead to a substantial decrease in annual installations.

Analysts project that the residential solar market could decline by 25% to 50% in 2026 if these credits are phased out. Such a contraction would directly impact Sunrun’s customer acquisition and revenue growth. The company may face challenges in maintaining its current installation volumes and could experience pressure on margins as it attempts to keep solar systems affordable for consumers without the benefit of tax incentives.

Furthermore, the elimination of tax credits could disrupt Sunrun’s financing model, which heavily relies on tax equity tied to these credits. This could lead to increased costs of capital and potentially impact the company’s ability to offer competitive pricing to customers.

What risks does Sunrun face from potential regulatory changes?

Sunrun operates in a highly regulated environment, and potential changes in policies at both federal and state levels present significant risks. The uncertainty surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its implementation could affect Sunrun’s long-term planning and investment strategies.

One key risk is the potential for more stringent safe harboring rules, which could impact Sunrun’s ability to extend the benefits of current tax credits to future projects. This could lead to increased costs and reduced flexibility in project planning and execution.

Additionally, changes in net metering policies at the state level could affect the value proposition of solar installations for homeowners. If states reduce the compensation for excess energy fed back into the grid, it could make solar less attractive to potential customers and impact Sunrun’s growth in those markets.

Lastly, the potential for new tariffs on imported solar components could increase Sunrun’s costs and put pressure on margins. The company is already facing $100-$200 million in tariff-related costs, and any further trade restrictions could exacerbate this issue.

Bull Case

How could Sunrun’s strategic safe harboring benefit the company long-term?

Sunrun’s proactive approach to safe harboring equipment could provide significant long-term benefits, particularly in navigating policy uncertainties and market transitions. By securing equipment early, Sunrun has positioned itself to potentially extend the benefits of current tax credits through 2030, even if policy changes occur.

This strategic move could give Sunrun a competitive advantage over cash-strapped peers who may not have the resources to engage in extensive safe harboring. As the market potentially contracts in 2026 due to policy changes, Sunrun’s ability to offer more competitively priced systems could lead to market share gains.

Furthermore, the safe harboring strategy provides Sunrun with greater visibility into its future costs and supply chain, allowing for more effective long-term planning and potentially smoother project execution. This could result in improved operational efficiency and potentially higher margins over time.

What opportunities does the shift to storage-first solutions present for Sunrun?

Sunrun’s focus on storage-first solutions aligns well with growing consumer demand for energy resilience and grid stability. The company’s strong market share in U.S. residential storage installations (42%) positions it favorably to capitalize on this trend.

The shift to storage-first solutions presents several opportunities for Sunrun:

1. Increased revenue per customer: By bundling solar with storage solutions, Sunrun can increase the average contract value and potentially improve customer lifetime value.

2. Enhanced grid services revenue: With a growing fleet of distributed energy resources, Sunrun can expand its participation in grid services programs, creating new revenue streams and deepening relationships with utilities.

3. Improved customer satisfaction: Storage solutions provide customers with greater energy independence and resilience, potentially leading to higher customer retention and positive word-of-mouth referrals.

4. Differentiation in a competitive market: As storage becomes increasingly important, Sunrun’s expertise and scale in this area could set it apart from competitors who may be more focused on traditional solar installations.

5. Potential for margin expansion: As storage technology improves and costs decrease, Sunrun may be able to capture higher margins on these value-added services.

By leveraging its leadership in storage solutions, Sunrun could not only mitigate some of the risks associated with policy changes but also create new growth opportunities in an evolving energy landscape.

On his first day as president, Donald Trump issued an executive order halting new approvals for wind farms. A few months later, his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (OBBB), signed last July, phased out some of the key tax credits for solar and wind projects much sooner than what had been decided under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Eligibility for these projects now requires either starting construction before 4 July 2026 or completion by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, other offshore wind projects that had already secured permits and begun development have also suffered a severe blow from the use of the executive power to revoke them.

In addition to those measures hurting solar and wind projects directly, the OBBB proposes the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits and hydrogen production credits after 2025.

The renewable supply chain’s reliance on Chinese inputs also implies vulnerabilities, given that the recent ""foreign entity of concern"" provisions included in the OBBB now limit access to components from adversary countries.

In addition, the executive order to boost the ""clean coal industry"" indicates a notable shift in US energy policy towards fossil fuels and critical minerals, likely redirecting funding and regulatory support from solar and wind towards coal, oil, gas and uranium production.

This comes in addition to other headwinds rattling the economic environment of the sector, such as high interest rates increasing financing costs, and surging prices for key materials like steel and copper, as well as components – notably as a consequence of the introduction of new import tariffs.

As a result, even though the upcoming phasing-out of tax credits under the OBBB should hasten the start-up of projects ‘under discussion’ or the completion of those already ongoing in the short term, and provide a temporary boom within the sector, US solar and wind energy developers must contend with a perfect storm of policy and business environment challenges.

Other clean energies face a brighter future

Fortunately, the entire clean energy sector is not set to face the same adverse climate. Non-solar and wind technologies such as storage, hydropower, nuclear and geothermal have been spared under the OBBB. Expanded tax credits remain in place, until at least 2033, when a progressive phase-down is foreseen for some industries. These technologies are now drawing significant investor interest.

Another driver of innovation is the surging power demand from tech giants. After years of stagnant electricity consumption, data centres and artificial intelligence (AI) development are fuelling rapid growth in electricity demand. In the USA, demand is projected to increase by 2.2% and 2.4% in 2025 and 2026 respectively, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), more than twice the average growth rate observed over the past decade. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that the US economy, driven by AI use, is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminium, steel, cement and chemicals. Yet the specific energy needs of AI and data centres – demanding constant, high-capacity power – cannot be covered adequately by the variable output of solar and wind. Consequently, companies like Google are investing in advanced geothermal startups, and tech firms are also betting on next-gen small-modular nuclear reactors, signing deals with startups in the field.

In spite of this interest in alternative clean tech, natural gas – which is currently the largest source of electricity for data centres in the United States (see graph below) – is expected to continue to play a significant role in the additional power supply driven by data centre needs, followed by renewables, according to the IEA (April 2025). As a result, fossil fuels like natural gas and coal are still expected to power more than half of data centre capacity until 2030 in the USA.

Traditional power plants unlikely to replace stalled renewable projects

Given the current increase in power demand and the challenges facing solar and wind energy deployment, adequately bridging the gap created by delayed renewable projects with gas and nuclear power facilities may prove challenging. Indeed, with almost one fifth of gas power capacity in development already earmarked for data centres, new gas-fired projects face long waits (up to five to seven years) for specialised turbines. Nuclear plants are also slow to build, and advanced designs are only just reaching the prototype stage.

Renewables as a buffer against rising electricity prices

With electricity prices already rising (see graph below) due to surging demand from data centres and a recent increase in gas prices, growing energy demand and supply constraints should continue to push US electricity prices higher in the medium term. In this context, accelerating renewable energy deployment could curb prices, as it offers the lowest-cost option for new power generation and can be built faster than gas plants.",https://credendo.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_large/public/media/images/2025-09/itp-energyusa-september2025.jpg?itok=x3_obkDw,N,,2025-09-22 16:03:38.122651

About AETC AETC is a woman-owned, privately held business which conducts operations out of the greater Chicago area.","Zentek Ltd. (""Zentek"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:ZTEK)(TSXV:ZEN), an intellectual property technology development and commercialization company, is pleased to share an update from its wholly owned subsidiary, Albany Graphite Corp. (""AGC"") on its Critical Minerals Innovation Fund (""CMIF"") grant-funded activities. AGC in collaboration with American Energy Technologies Company (""AETC""), has successfully purified a second batch of Albany graphite deposit flotation concentrate to an ultra-high 5N purity level of 99.9992 wt.% C. Subsequent elemental analysis of this material yielded a calculated Equivalent Boron Concentration (""EBC"") of 2.60 ppm which is below the 3 ppm specification required by the nuclear industry. The findings indicate that the electrothermal Fluidized Bed Reactor (""FBR"") purification process developed by AETC has the potential to produce reproducible results, and that ultra-high purity Albany Graphite could be suitable for use in the nuclear energy industry; a field traditionally dominated by synthetic graphite.

Highlights

AETC successfully purified a second batch of Albany graphite to an ultra-high 5N purity level (99.9992 wt.% C), indicating potential reproducibility and suitability for nuclear applications. These results are helping to establish Albany graphite as a rare natural material able to reach the stringent purity required for nuclear applications, traditionally a domain reserved for synthetic graphite.

Elemental analysis yielded a calculated EBC of 2.60 ppm, which is below the 3 ppm specification required by the nuclear industry. Achieving this low EBC is crucial, as it ensures the graphite's suitability for safe, reliable use in nuclear reactors, where boron contamination and other elemental contamination can impact reactor performance.

The FBR purification process developed by AETC achieved consistent results without the use of halogen gases. This is significant because halogen-free processing reduces costs, environmental risks and operational hazards, offering a cleaner and safer route to high-purity graphite.

Ongoing nuclear graphite testing includes measurements of particle size distribution, compressibility, resistivity, and coefficient of friction, along with the production and assessment of near-net-shaped graphite bricks for reactor lining applications. These efforts are important as they ensure that Albany graphite not only meets chemical specifications but also performs reliably in real-world reactor environments.

Additional testing will also evaluate Albany graphite's suitability for lithium-ion battery anodes and as a cathode conductivity additive, supporting further advancement in nuclear and battery-grade graphite materials. This versatility is unique, positioning Albany graphite as a promising candidate for multiple high-growth, high-purity markets.

The thermal purification was conducted at AETC's Wheeling, IL facility utilizing a batch-scale electrothermal FBR at 2,800°C and under an inert gas atmosphere without the use of halogen gases. The EBC value was calculated according to ASTM C1233-15: Standard Practice for Determining Equivalent Boron Contents of Nuclear Materials and was further customized to the present-day industrial application based on AETC's knowledge of the current specification that is required by an operational nuclear plant. The calculated EBC value is the most critical test of purity for nuclear industry use.

These results align with increased investment in nuclear energy. In Canada, Ontario is constructing a grid-scale Small Modular Reactor (""SMR"") at the Darlington site, which marks a step toward clean energy production. Additionally, Prime Minister Carney recently unveiled a list of five ‘nation-building' projects, which included a significant investment in Darlington's New Nuclear SMR Project in Clarington, Ontario.

Similarly, the United States and other countries have prioritized expanding domestic nuclear energy capacity and further highlights the importance of nuclear-grade graphite.123

Next Steps

Additional downstream processing and material characterization is in progress and will involve the following measurements to confirm that additional nuclear specifications are met:

Air Jet Sieve Yield: Meeting a specified particle size distribution and D50 is an important requirement.

Compressibility: Achieving a high compact density along with a low elastic expansion is desirable for matrix graphite powder used in the nuclear industry.

Four-Point Resistivity: Provides an indication of the degree of graphitization of the graphite powder and is a critical test for graphite used in pebble-bed reactors. A low resistivity and therefore a high degree of graphitization is desirable.

Coefficient of Friction (""CoF""): A low CoF is desirable for lubricants.

Test work will also involve the production of near-net-shaped graphite bricks using a mixture of synthetic graphite, ultra-high purity Albany graphite and coal-tar pitch. These solid shapes are typically used to line nuclear reactors. Upon the successful production of the test bricks, AETC will characterize the properties of the composite to confirm that nuclear industry specifications have been achieved.

AETC will also be performing a lithium-ion battery suitability testing program which will involve spheroidization, coating and subsequent coin cell tests to characterize the electrochemical performance of Albany anode material. Spheroidization fines will also be processed and tested as a cathode conductivity additive. Results will be shared as the testwork evolves and they become available.

Emily Schmidt, project manager and business development representative at AETC was quoted as saying, ""AETC is very excited about the successful confirmation that Albany graphite material can be upgraded to nuclear purity graphite without the use of halogen gas in processing. Meeting 5N purity is a necessary but insufficient condition for qualifying graphite for nuclear applications. One needs to also achieve a stringent specification on EBC which in the case of Albany natural graphite material was demonstrated to be at the level of 2.60 ppm compared to the industry spec of 3 ppm. Albany graphite has the potential of being used in market segments of fuel encapsulation, reactor linings, and specialty uses within nuclear plants that include lubrication, repair and maintenance, and other critical needs that support the operation of the plant. Work is currently ongoing on qualifying material from the Albany graphite natural resource in some of these market segments.""

Eric Wallman, Board Chair of Zentek, commented: ""This is an exciting development as we continue to gather information on the potential of the Albany project. The ability to consistently reach ultra-high purity and meet strict nuclear specifications is a promising sign for both the graphite industry, the potential value of the Albany Graphite Deposit and Zentek's ongoing commitment to innovation. This milestone not only demonstrates the quality and versatility of Albany graphite but also showcases the strength of our partnerships and the dedication of our team. As we move forward, I am eager to see how these results open new doors for technological advancement, sustainability, and global competitiveness. We remain committed to supporting rigorous testing and further development to ensure our products meet the highest standards of excellence.""

(NASDAQ:FSLR), a leading manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of regulatory changes, tariff uncertainties, and evolving market dynamics. As the largest solar manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere and the only significant U.S. producer of solar modules, First Solar’s position in the industry is both enviable and precarious. According to InvestingPro data, the company maintains strong financial health with a GOOD overall score and operates with a moderate debt level, evidenced by a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.12.

Recent Financial Performance and Guidance

First Solar’s first-quarter results for 2025 fell short of expectations, with revenue of $845 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.95, below analyst estimates. While the company’s gross margin of 40.8% disappointed investors, InvestingPro data shows the company maintains a healthy trailing twelve-month gross margin of 42.76%. Despite recent challenges, eight analysts have revised their earnings expectations downward for the upcoming period, one of several key insights available through InvestingPro’s comprehensive analysis platform.

The revised guidance for fiscal year 2025 now stands at:

Revenue: $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion (down from $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion)

EPS: $12.50 to $17.50 (reduced from $17.00 to $20.00)

This adjustment reflects the impact of global tariffs implemented earlier in the year and uncertainties surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provisions. The company’s bookings have also been pressured, with only 0.6 GW of net bookings reported in the quarter.

Regulatory Environment and Tariff Impact

The solar industry, and First Solar in particular, is grappling with a complex regulatory environment. The imposition of a 10% global tariff on imported solar modules has significantly impacted First Solar’s operations, especially affecting imports from its facilities in Vietnam, Malaysia, and India.

The U.S. Department of Commerce’s final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) investigations have resulted in higher rates than initially anticipated. The all-in weighted average rate of approximately 330% for solar cell and module imports from certain countries could potentially benefit First Solar in future price negotiations.

However, the uncertainty surrounding these tariffs and potential ""reciprocal"" tariffs has led to a cautious approach from both First Solar and its customers. The company is considering renegotiating prices on contracts pending clarity on tariff levels and IRA provisions, and may even idle capacity in Southeast Asia if reciprocal tariffs are implemented without cost-sharing from customers.

Manufacturing Capacity and Expansion

First Solar’s strong domestic manufacturing capacity positions it well to serve the U.S. market. The company has a significant backlog of approximately 66 GW through 2030, providing long-term visibility. However, the potential idling of overseas facilities due to tariff issues could impact the company’s global production strategy.

The company is also benefiting from Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which limit competition from Chinese manufacturers. This regulatory environment allows First Solar to potentially increase its average selling prices (ASPs) and strengthen its competitive moat.

Market Positioning and Future Outlook

Despite the challenges, many analysts remain optimistic about First Solar’s prospects. The company’s position as the only large-scale domestic solar module manufacturer in the U.S. provides it with a unique advantage as the country seeks to boost its clean energy manufacturing capabilities. This optimism is reflected in the company’s market performance, with InvestingPro reporting a remarkable 61.81% price return over the past six months. Based on InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis, the stock currently appears slightly undervalued. For deeper insights into First Solar’s valuation and growth potential, including access to over 10 additional ProTips and comprehensive financial metrics, explore the full InvestingPro platform.

Analysts project significant growth in earnings and revenue over the next few years:

FY 2025E: Revenue of $5,056 million, EPS of $15.63

FY 2026E: Revenue of $6,618 million, EPS of $25.54

FY 2027E: Revenue of $6,529 million, EPS of $26.14

However, these projections are subject to considerable uncertainty due to the fluid policy environment and potential changes in global trade dynamics.

Bear Case

How might potential changes to IRA provisions affect FSLR’s competitive advantage?

First Solar’s current competitive advantage is heavily tied to the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly the domestic content requirements and tax credits. If these provisions were to be significantly altered or removed, it could erode First Solar’s pricing power and market position.

The company’s earnings are substantially boosted by Advanced Manufacturing Credits (AMC) under section 45X of the IRA. Any reduction or phase-out of these credits could materially impact First Solar’s profitability. Moreover, if the domestic content rules for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) were to be relaxed, it could allow for increased competition from foreign manufacturers, potentially reducing First Solar’s market share and pricing power.

What risks does FSLR face from increasing domestic solar manufacturing capacity?

As U.S. cell capacity grows to meet demand, First Solar’s price premium over imported panels may diminish. The company currently benefits from a scarcity of domestic manufacturing, but this advantage could erode as more competitors enter the market or expand their U.S. operations.

Analysts have noted a 37% increase in year-end 2026 cell capacity expectations for the U.S. market. As this new capacity comes online, it could lead to increased competition and potentially lower ASPs for First Solar’s products. The company may need to invest heavily in research and development to maintain its technological edge and cost competitiveness in an increasingly crowded market.

Bull Case

How could FSLR benefit from stricter FEOC restrictions?

Stricter Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions could significantly benefit First Solar by further limiting competition from Chinese manufacturers and other foreign entities. These restrictions, which are part of the broader effort to secure the U.S. solar supply chain, could create a more favorable competitive landscape for domestic producers like First Solar.

If FEOC restrictions are tightened, it could lead to higher ASPs for First Solar’s products, as customers would have fewer alternatives that comply with U.S. regulations. This could allow First Solar to capture a larger market share and potentially increase its profit margins. Additionally, stricter FEOC rules might incentivize more U.S. solar project developers to secure long-term contracts with domestic manufacturers, further strengthening First Solar’s position.

What potential upside exists for FSLR if tariff issues are resolved favorably?

A favorable resolution to the current tariff issues could provide significant upside for First Solar. If reciprocal tariffs are not implemented or are set at a lower rate than feared, it would allow First Solar to continue utilizing its overseas manufacturing capacity efficiently, potentially leading to higher overall production and sales volumes.

Moreover, if the final tariff structure creates a more level playing field for U.S. manufacturers without overly burdening the broader solar industry, it could lead to increased demand for solar installations. This could benefit First Solar both in terms of volume and pricing power. A clear and stable tariff environment would also allow the company to make more confident long-term planning decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive expansion and innovation strategies.

What We Tried Before and Why It Did Not Work Back in 2005, Congress tried to smooth the path for new transmission.","Recently, I joined the Right of Way podcast to talk about something that usually hides in the background of our energy debates but quietly determines whether the lights stay on: transmission.

When most people think about electricity, they imagine either the power plant that generates it or the wires that carry it into their home. But the system actually has 3 distinct parts:

Generation: the power plants where electricity is produced

Transmission: the high-voltage lines that move power across long distances

Distribution: the smaller lines that branch out through neighborhoods and deliver electricity to your home or business

Transmission is the ​“middle child.” It is not as visible as power plants or as familiar as the poles outside your window, but without it, the whole system grinds to a halt.

Why Transmission Matters Now

We are currently living with the grid of the 20th century, even as the technologies of the 21st — advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, electrification of all sorts of appliances — are taking off. Many power lines that crisscross the country today are 50, 70, or even 100 years old. They have held up remarkably well. But as demand for electricity surges and as the mix of energy sources changes, the old grid is showing its age.

If we cannot move power from where it is made to where it is needed, we are in trouble. Even if we build the most affordable, reliable generator in the world, it is useless if the electricity cannot reach customers. Unless we relearn how to build large transmission lines, we are, to put it in technical terms, hosed.

The 3 P’s: Permitting, Planning, and Paying

On the podcast, I talked about the so-called ​“3 P’s,” the 3 main barriers to building new transmission.

1. Permitting: Before a shovel goes in the ground, developers must navigate an obstacle course of approvals: federal environmental reviews, state approvals, local siting authorities, and land-use agreements. It is common for projects to spend years or even decades in limbo. In the western half of the United States, lines like SunZia and TransWest have been delayed for around 20 years. Nationwide, about a third of Environmental Impact Statements completed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) between 2010 and 2018 for energy projects were for transmission lines, and many of those projects ended up in court.

2. Planning: There is no clear way to propose a new transmission line, even one that provides serious benefits to the system, and have it evaluated systematically and approved on a reasonable timescale. The process is patchy and inconsistent. Some regions have done better than others. For example, the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) created a portfolio of ​“Multi-Value Projects” that actually got built (mostly) on time and on budget. That is the exception, however, not the rule.

3. Paying: Every line must be paid for, ultimately, by the customers who use the power grid. The challenge is figuring out who benefits and making sure the costs are shared fairly. Black-letter case law says that costs should be allocated ​“roughly commensurate” with the benefits. That sounds straightforward, but in practice, disputes and a lack of legal clarity over cost allocation can tie up projects indefinitely.

What We Tried Before and Why It Did Not Work

Back in 2005, Congress tried to smooth the path for new transmission. It created ​“National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors,” gave the Power Marketing Administrations new authority to participate in projects, and it even set up a way to consolidate environmental reviews.

On paper, these updates looked promising. In practice, not a single line has been completed under those authorities. Courts limited the government’s ability to step in when states blocked projects and also created the infamous ​“double NEPA” problem for federally sited transmission — 2 full environmental reviews for the same project.

The result: 20 years later, we are still stuck.

What Real Reform Could Look Like

So how do we move forward? There have been a number of proposals in Congress, including the bipartisan Energy Permitting Reform Act sponsored by Senator Barrasso (R‑WY) and former Senator Manchin (I‑WV), which passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year on a bipartisan vote of 15 – 4.

Just this week, the 49 members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus voted to approve a broad permitting framework geared at unleashing all kinds of American energy infrastructure, including transmission.

A Chance for Common Ground

A closing observation I shared on the podcast is that once a particular energy technology scales up, it often becomes politically divisive. When a technology is still emerging, it tends to enjoy broad support. Transmission is unusual. It is both urgent and still widely recognized as something that helps bring new generation and power new demand.",https://assets.arnoldventures.org/uploads/Feature-Images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Arnold-Ventures_Infrastructure_Energy-Transmission.jpg?mtime=1758566401,N,,2025-09-22 19:00:19.999964

Since our last update in January, several key developments across multiple jurisdictions have occurred, including the beginning of several state programs.

Legislative Developments

When we last reported at the start of 2025, five states had passed EPR legislation: Maine, Oregon, Colorado, California, and Minnesota. The tally has now reached seven. Following the publication of its needs assessment in February, Maryland passed SB 901 in May, establishing a full EPR program for packaging. Washington, one of the states already imposing post-consumer recycled content and other requirements for plastic product packaging, enacted SB 5284 on May 17, establishing the seventh EPR program.

Momentum continues to grow in additional states. Since the beginning of 2025, two states, Hawaii and Rhode Island, have passed legislation tasking state environmental agencies with conducting needs assessments to evaluate the potential for an EPR program. Hawaii Governor Josh Green signed HB 750 on May 27. Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee signed H6207 on June 30. In addition, in Massachusetts, an EPR Commission was established to recommend and propose EPR policies to the General Court, Massachusetts’s legislative body. The commission will host six public meetings and make initial recommendations and related findings no later than January 15, 2026.

Meanwhile, some states with existing EPR programs are exploring updates to their statutory programs. On June 20, Maine, the first state in the nation to pass an EPR for packaging law in 2021, passed SP 579, updating the program with the intent of reducing regulatory costs associated with the program, aligning the program with other states’ programs, and clarifying select definitions. On March 17, Minnesota introduced SF 2619 in an attempt to exempt all paper products from the list of materials covered under Minnesota’s EPR program. Despite initial buzz, the bill has not moved out of committee.

New York, which has been working on passing EPR legislation for several years, again failed to pass an EPR program this legislative session; however, the bill will remain active for the 2026 session.

Regulatory Developments

States with existing EPR legislation have been working on developing their regulatory programs. After California Governor Gavin Newsom declined to accept draft regulations in March, citing high costs for small businesses, CalRecycle went back to the drawing board. On August 22, CalRecycle submitted to the Office of Administrative Law a new proposed rule aimed at simplifying fee structures, clarifying definitions, and expanding product exemptions. The public comment period is open until October 7.

Multiple states continue to refine their plans regarding what materials must be collected by municipalities and the fees that will be required from producers for different packaging categories. These decisions depend, in large part, on whether circular solutions are currently available or whether more resources (generated from producer fees) are still needed to develop them. In August, Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection held a stakeholder meeting on the updated draft Packaging Material Types List that was issued in July. This list designates which types of packaging will be considered “readily recyclable,” “reusable,” and “compostable.” Similarly, on August 15, CAA issued a proposal that seeks to amend the “responsible end market” provisions in Oregon. This proposal is undergoing public comment until October 15.

Ecomodulation provisions are another area of ongoing activity. On May 16, Circular Action Alliance (CAA) issued a proposal seeking to amend the ecomodulation provisions of the Oregon Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) plan. This proposal, which underwent public comment and is now awaiting a decision by the Department of Environmental Quality, would create “bonus” opportunities for producers that transition from single-use packaging to refillable packaging. On August 14, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) opened a public comment period on draft amendments to the regulations focusing on ecomodulation. The proposed amendments specify the circumstances under which producer fees may be reduced (e.g., use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) content produced in Colorado, among other criteria). Notably, although the Advisory Board recommended approval of the proposal, its recommendation letter noted “significant concern” with CAA’s proposal to use mass balance accounting to support claims that covered materials contain PCR content and recommended that CDPHE request the Solid and Hazardous Waste Commission to conduct a rulemaking process on the allowance or disallowance of free allocation accounting in verifying PCR content. The outcome of this process could have a substantial impact on producers’ ability to claim incorporation of PCR into plastic packaging sold in Colorado.

Programmatic Developments

So far, Circular Action Alliance has largely cornered the market as the PRO in states with EPR programs, having now been selected in Colorado, Oregon, California, and Minnesota. There may be growing potential for sector-specific PROs to advance more tailored compliance plans, however. In August, Colorado approved the Lubricants Packaging Management Association as a PRO for certain petroleum and automotive products.

Oregon leads the nation on implementation of its program plan and its first disbursement of funds to communities. Producers reported data to CAA earlier this year, and CAA anticipates the program will cover 415,000 tons of material over the course of the two-and-a-half years covered by the current PRO Plan (ending in December 2027). In Colorado, producers were required to report by the end of July. Minnesota producers had to register with CAA by July 1, and CAA “encouraged” California producers to register by December 5.

Key Tasks for Producers

Producers should continue to focus on the following tasks in 2025:

Develop or refine data collection plans.

Assess opportunities for fee reduction by leveraging ecomodulation provisions and lifecycle assessments.

Identify “pain points” or areas of programmatic ambiguity that may warrant engagement with CAA or state agencies.

Monitor state enforcement activity.

Continue to monitor new legislation, regulatory processes, and updates from CAA.

(lailluminator.com) — In a defiant tone, Gov. Jeff Landry said nothing has changed about Hyundai Motor Group’s plans to open a massive $5.8 billion steel plant in Donaldsonville, even after an immigration raid on the South Korean company’s facility in Georgia sparked outrage back home.

“I would think that whatever they did that they weren’t supposed to do, I’m sure they are not going to do it here in Louisiana,” Landry said Tuesday (Sept. 16) an economic development news conference.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents threw the United States’ relationship with trade partner South Korea into turmoil when they conducted a raid Sept. 4 at the Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. Federal authorities detained more than 300 South Koreans working at the factory.

After the immigration sweep, U.S. officials released a video showing detained South Koreans shackled in chains. Some complained they were kept in unsanitary conditions while in custody.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned this week that South Korean companies might be reluctant to invest further in the U.S. following the raid, The Associated Press reported. The South Korean government also plans to investigate whether American officials committed human rights violations against the detainees.

But a spokesman for Hyundai Motor Group said last Tuesday the company will stay the course with its plans in Louisiana.

“There are no changes to our previously announced plans. We have a strategic long-term commitment to the U.S. market,” Michael Stewart, director of public relations and communications at Hyundai Motor North America, wrote in an email.

Some of the South Koreans were working at the Georgia plant illegally, U.S. officials have said.

South Korean officials have criticized the U.S. visa process, particularly the cap on specialized worker visas, which they said makes it difficult for their companies to operate in America, according to The Washington Post.

In Baton Rouge, Landry refused to answer a reporter’s question about whether foreign nationals would work on the steel plant project in South Louisiana.

“I mean, it’s a pretty trick question, I mean, it’s a pretty big project,” the governor responded.

“I don’t expect anybody illegally to be working on the project,” Landry added.

President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone Sunday in a Truth Social post that addressed fallout from the Georgia raid. He welcomed foreign companies to bring foreign workers into the U.S., at least on a temporary basis.

“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,” Trump wrote. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometimes into the not too distant future!”

In an interview Tuesday, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said she expects South Korean nationals will work at the Donaldsonville site. But their positions will not count toward the more 1,300 jobs Hyundai Steel has committed to creating in Louisiana as part of its project, she said.

“Could there be foreign nationals here? I assume there could be,” Bourgeois said. “But absolutely, Hyundai Steel is committed to using Louisiana labor on that project.”

Bourgeois said her team met with Hyundai Steel officials shortly after the Georgia raid to talk about logistics and progress on the Donaldsonville project. At that time, no concerns were raised about the immigration sweep having an impact on the company’s Louisiana plans, she said.

“They have not taken their foot off the gas pedal,” she said.

The project is Hyundai’s first steel plant in the United States and was announced with a lot of fanfare at a March event held at the White House with Trump and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton. It’s expected to supply automobile factories in Alabama and Georgia with steel for the production of several hundred thousand cars per year after it is completed in 2030.

Louisiana officials have devoted $600 million in state and local taxpayer funds to support the facility, according to The Times-Picayune, in part because it is expected to be transformational for the Donaldsonville area. Officials have said the 1,300 jobs affiliated with the plant will have an average salary of $95,000, far above Louisiana’s $58,000 median household income.

State Rep. Ken Brass, a Democrat who represents Donaldsonville, said he is confident Louisiana citizens will be hired for jobs at the plant and at other smaller businesses that open up to support the facility.

A new community and technical college branch in Donaldsonville that will train plant workers was included in the incentive package used to lure Hyundai to Louisiana. The state already has design plans for the $30 million training facility, Brass said.

“There is definitely a commitment for training for local jobs,” he said in an interview.

By Delaney Nolan, The Lens, and

Emily Sanders, ExxonKnews

(Special) — London Toussaint, 8, points to the sugarcane field just behind her home.

“That’s where we play at,” she says, “Me and Lyric, my best friend.”

For children in rural St. James Parish, Louisiana – which straddles the Mississippi, about an hour upriver from New Orleans – the sugarcane fields that dot the area are perfect for games of hide-and-go-seek, running down the rows between the tall plants.

They like to play there during the cooler months, said London’s mother, Nylah Toussaint, as she hoisted her one-year-old daughter Dream up to her hip. Nearby, there’s a berry tree they like to sit under.

But unknown to the Toussaints, Exxon has quietly pushed through a plan to bury a controversial pipeline in their playing field – one that experts say will be seriously under-regulated, and far too close to homes like the Toussaints’.

“We wasn’t informed,” Nylah Toussaint said, frowning. “I never knew anything about a pipeline.”

With little public input, Exxon received local government approval to install the pipeline here, in the area widely known as “Cancer Alley,” the 85-mile span of the Mississippi River lined by nearly 200 petrochemical plants, stretching from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The new eight-mile, 24-inch-wide pipeline would transport highly-compressed carbon dioxide through this part of St. James Parish, passing just 155 feet from a business and 355 feet from the nearest residence.

The proximity might be worrisome for any pipeline, but CO2 pipelines are particularly concerning, critics say, because carbon dioxide is a transparent, odorless asphyxiant that doesn’t dissipate like natural gas.

Pipeline will feed CO2 into the nation’s fast-growing carbon-capture transport network

The CO2 running through the eight-mile St. James pipeline will be captured within the parish, from the Nucor steel manufacturing plant in Convent. It will be piped northwest from Convent, will turn west to cross underneath the Mississippi River, and then pass near a commercial area of St. James until it reaches CF Industries, in Donaldsonville, in neighboring Ascension Parish. There, it will be fed into an existing carbon capture and transport network.

The Toussaint family lives along that pipeline’s path in St. James, where rental homes, apartments, and an RV park surround the quiet Sugar Hill residential neighborhood.

St. James Parish councilmembers waved through the proposal, which is now in the hands of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its streamlined permitting process for CO2 pipelines.

It’s all part of a national CO2 pipeline buildout that is accelerating under Trump.

Industry representatives say carbon capture – when CO2 is captured from smokestacks and other industrial processes and piped elsewhere – reduces emissions. But across the country, residents, advocates and safety experts are raising the alarm about planned carbon pipelines’ proximity to people, the potential for disaster if an incident were to occur – and the lack of public input, as local boards rubberstamp the projects, like the St. James Parish Council did in July.

In 2023, Exxon purchased carbon dioxide pipeline operator Denbury, and now owns most of the carbon pipeline infrastructure in Louisiana. The state has become the epicenter for deploying carbon capture technology, as petrochemical companies claim to use it to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Thanks to the new pipeline, Nucor will be able to sell “low-carbon steel” for higher prices. Exxon originally suggested the CO2 captured from Nucor would be transported 100 miles away and stored underground in Vermilion Parish.

But the Trump administration recently increased tax credits that incentivize using captured carbon to drill for more oil in a process known as enhanced oil recovery, where companies inject high-pressure CO2 underground to force out more crude oil. Since that change, Exxon reportedly indicated to the St James Planning Commission that the CO2will instead be transported to Hastings, Texas, for enhanced oil recovery.

Internally, Exxon officials have assumed that carbon capture and storage won’t be effectively deployed at a large scale anytime in the near future to reduce emissions. Instead, advocates warn that CCS increases net emissions. Still, the corporation continues to market it as a climate solution to the public, spending at least $50 million to date lobbying for the technology’s expansion.

For residents, part of a lifelong fight against industry

Barbara Washington, 74, can trace her family roots back to emancipation here, in the small river town of Romeville that neighbors Convent.

Once primarily a farming town, Romeville is now blanketed by pollution from chemical facilities and oil and gas infrastructure. It sits in the center of Cancer Alley.

After cancer and respiratory illnesses hit dozens of her family members, friends, and neighbors, Washington saw ties between the medical problems and high rates of pollution. A few years ago, she co-founded the St. James-based environmental justice group Inclusive Louisiana, to organize local residents fighting industrial development.

Washington can see the Nucor Steel facility and its smokestacks from the window of her home. Soon, it will mark the start of Exxon’s new CO2 pipeline.

Carbon capture projects will exacerbate the health problems here, Washington fears, by expanding industry’s license to pollute by claiming to be low-carbon. She worries about Exxon placing CO2 pipelines so near to her community, and fears it will put people at further risk.

Ashley Gaignard, an environmental advocate with Rural Roots Louisiana in Ascension Parish, where the St. James pipeline would terminate, expressed similar concerns. Gaignard has fought several carbon capture projects in her region and doubts the confident claims of industry, especially given their track record of toxic pollution and recent buyout proposals in the parish.

“They’re going to build our community out of the area,” she said. “They’re going to be the reason that we won’t have a community. I just wish that our political leaders could walk away with some integrity and do the right thing.”

Exxon is trying to skirt public feedback on the plan, advocates believe.

The parish council gave residents less than one day’s notice for Exxon’s appeal hearing, when the company managed to move the pipeline proposal forward after failing to get approval from the local planning commission. “We get in the room and it is full of industry people, people from out of the area, like they had weeks of notice to get their scripts and everything together,” said Jack Green, campaign manager at local advocacy group Rise St. James.

Gail LeBoeuf, who co-founded Inclusive Louisiana with Washington, had the same impression.. “It sounds like a public hearing here tonight and only Exxon people knew about it,” she told the council.

Earlier in the year, the legal advocacy nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) had notified the parish council that they may be violating local and state conflict of interest laws. Because Parish Council President Pete Dufresne owns several properties in the path of the proposed pipeline, he stands to benefit financially from servitude agreements with Exxon. CCR never received a response.

The parish council did not respond to requests for comment.

Lifelong residents like Washington and LeBoeuf harbor doubts that the community is prepared. For instance, like many other rural communities facing new carbon dioxide pipelines, the St. James Fire Department is volunteer-run. Even now, Washington said, residents sometimes wait hours before firefighters arrive on scene.

Washington worries that the volunteer firefighters are not equipped for a carbon dioxide rupture. “God forbid that any explosion would happen – we know if there was a rupture, that it would be devastating for us,” she said. “We would be a little wiped-out town.”

CO2 pipeline rupture and emergency unpreparedness

When another carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured in 2020 near Satartia, Mississippi, a cloud of gas flowed into the small town, displacing oxygen, choking the engines of emergency vehicles, and initially bewildering first responders.

At least 45 people sought medical attention at hospitals. Some residents still reported symptoms of hypoxic brain injury years later.

After that incident, advocates and pipeline safety experts pushed for updated regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Regulations proposed in the final days of the Biden administration would have mandated new leak detection requirements and established emergency planning zones for two miles surrounding the pipelines, among other rules. But they were all scuttled by Trump earlier this year.

The disaster in Satartia highlighted grave concerns over emergency responders’ ability to respond to CO2 pipeline incidents.

The pipeline operator, Denbury, didn’t notify Sataria emergency responders about a leak. Instead, emergency crews had to call Denbury themselves to learn that the gas cloud contained CO2. Most did not yet fully understand the impact that carbon dioxide can have on people and even emergency vehicles. First responders who dealt with the incident have said that electric emergency response vehicles are necessary near carbon dioxide pipelines, since CO2 choked the engines of their vehicles, rendering them inoperable.

Federal regulators investigating the rupture found that Denbury had committed several violations. The company had failed to notify first responders that the pipeline was experiencing a pressure loss. And in its dispersion model, which would inform emergency responses, the company had underestimated the areas that could be impacted by such a rupture.

Denbury paid a $2.8 million penalty. Then, earlier this year, PHMSA proposed another $2.4 million fine against Denbury after its workers allegedly harassed federal inspectors who came to monitor the replacement of the damaged section of pipeline.

Louisiana CO2 pipeline threats

Near the town of Sulphur, in southwest Louisiana, where Exxon has another CO2 pipeline, Fire Chief Todd Parker is in regular contact with the company, and his firefighters are attending trainings funded by Exxon to prepare them for how to respond to CO2 leaks. The training curriculum is based in part on guidance from the American Petroleum Institute.

Exxon’s pipeline near Sulphur sprung a small leak last year. Exxon was failing to monitor the pipeline – the facility’s surveillance camera wasn’t working – and operators didn’t arrive to fix the leak for more than two hours, The Guardian reported. Afterwards, multiple local residents reported they had only learned of the leak through social media.

The bigger picture behind these incidents are not lost on residents of St. James.

If Exxon’s pipeline in St. James ruptured, the CO2 could reach people’s homes in a fraction of the distance it traveled in Mississippi.

And as a state, Louisiana has a poor track record.

In a 2022 analysis, the nonprofit Healthy Gulf found that Louisiana has more high-pressure gas pipeline incidents per mile than any other part of the country – more than twice the national average of oil and gas pipeline incidents per mile.

“It’s a lot more than I believe the St. James Parish emergency response can handle even though they have publicly said they can – we would like to see it in writing,” said Scott Eustis, a science director with Healthy Gulf.

Earlier this year, at three hearings with the St. James Parish Planning Commission, the municipal body that would have to rezone land for industrial use along the pipeline route, Eustis and other local environmental advocates raised concerns about emergency preparedness and about the risk of an incident with this particular pipeline route.

The pipeline would cross tectonic fault lines, where plates shift, Eustis said. It would also run under levees that shift when the river is at flood stage. “These pipelines are subject to a lot of forces and fatigue that you don’t see in other parts of even Louisiana,” Eustis said.

In response to the technical concerns, Exxon added a few safety precautions to its proposal. Company officials promised to build the pipeline seven feet underground, rather than four. They also added an extra automated shut-off valve to isolate the gas in the event of a rupture.

But ensuring safety “depends on a rapid response to a leak,” said Ted Schettler, science director at Science and Environmental Health Network, “which did not occur in Satartia or Sulphur.”

Exxon representatives downplayed concerns. If CO2 did rupture from the pipeline, “you’re going to be able to see it, and you’re going to be able to walk away from it,” Exxon representative Michael Smith told the parish council.

Threatening Louisiana communities

The St. James pipeline threatens places where people live, work, worship, and play, residents say. It runs less than 350 yards from Nylah Toussaint’s neighborhood, Sugar Hill Crossing; along with the nearby Sugar Hill RV Park; a juvenile detention center; at least one playground; and a church. It would pass a half mile or less from the Ascension Parish Jail and a second church.

Many of Toussaint’s neighbors have health problems and are unable to move quickly on their own, she said. “They’ve got a lot of old people who use oxygen and all kinds of medical problems, people that go to dialysis,” she said, noting that many are disabled or don’t have cars.

Those without means to evacuate would be transported by bus, said Eric Deroche, director of Emergency Preparedness in St. James Parish. But St. James Emergency Management doesn’t own any electric emergency response vehicles, as recommended by Mississippi officials.

Though St. James stopped using its community air sirens because of high operational costs, the parish’s phone emergency alert system would warn people in the area, even if they aren’t signed up for emergency alerts, he said. Exxon is paying for the parish to purchase gas meters that would detect CO2, Deroche said, and has facilitated third-party training on CO2 leaks for local emergency responders. But the department doesn’t yet have a copy of Exxon’s emergency response plan, which isn’t required on file until next year, when the pipeline goes into operation.

Deroche also has not received Exxon’s dispersion models, which show the potential dispersion of high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the event of a rupture. Though those models, if accurate, could help emergency personnel and communities prepare for possible incidents, Exxon officials argued that such models would “provide misleading information to the public” and pose a security risk.

In a statement, an ExxonMobil spokesperson said, “These projects take years of planning and testing, with strong oversight and round-the-clock monitoring. CO2 pipelines have a good safety record, and in the rare case of an emergency, we’ve taken steps to make sure local first responders are trained and ready to act.”

Unlike states and municipalities, federal regulators at PHMSA cannot enact distance requirements for pipelines. Louisiana representatives introduced legislation for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state, which included the creation of distance requirements from residences, but the bills failed to move out of committee. Some Louisiana parishes also tried to pass local carbon capture laws and moratoriums, only to find them blocked in the courts. In July, Exxon sued Allen Parish over a local ordinance that would have required local permits for carbon capture projects. The parish then rescinded the ordinance.

Though industry officials report confidence in CO2 pipelines, the risks are too great, said Gaignard, of Rural Roots Louisiana.

“They claim they’ve been doing these projects for years and years, but they have never ran carbon capture pipelines under residential communities before,” she said.

We’re pleased to share Bill McKibben’s firsthand account—written the night of the celebrations—from his The Crucial Years Substack.

Your correspondent is…bushed, so excuse typos, lapses of thought, and imprecise prose. But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith.

Those were powerful memories that will last my life.

Sun Day, a day of action celebrating the power of clean energy, took place September 21 across the United States. We’re pleased to share Bill McKibben’s firsthand account—written the night of the celebrations—from his The Crucial Years Substack.

Your correspondent is…bushed, so excuse typos, lapses of thought, and imprecise prose. But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith.

Those were powerful memories that will last my life. But I was also taken by the pictures that showed quieter moments—for instance, people huddled in basements so that they could see their neighbor’s heat pumps or solar inverters, demystifying the whole process of converting to clean power. This is from South Carolina—and it’s how we’re going to turn people into solar consumers across the country.

That proclivity for hydrogen has enabled the sector to forecast significant growth for the years leading up to 2030.
Rising costs in the energy sector have led to a recent wave of project delays and cancellations.
Despite the new approach to the energy sector being led by the Trump administration, hydrogen remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States.
The IEA reported that low-emissions hydrogen production now has the potential to reach up to 37 million tonnes per year by 2030.","The International Energy Agency has released its 2025 edition of its annual Global Hydrogen Review. The IEA has announced lower-than-expected production levels for the first half of this year, but expects significant growth in the years to come. Hydrogen has become a key energy source in both the renewable and non-renewable energy sectors, thanks to the low costs associated with using hydrogen to power the existing fossil fuel sector. That proclivity for hydrogen has enabled the sector to forecast significant growth for the years leading up to 2030.

The International Energy Agency states that worldwide demand for hydrogen is on the rise

Hydrogen has so much potential that is yet to be fully explored. Rising costs in the energy sector have led to a recent wave of project delays and cancellations. Despite the new approach to the energy sector being led by the Trump administration, hydrogen remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States. Whether the current administration likes it or not.

The global usage of hydrogen in the energy sector is on the rise. The worldwide demand for hydrogen has increased to almost 100 million tons in 2024, which is up 2 percent from 2023.

The vast majority of that hydrogen usage in 2024 comes from the fossil fuel sector, where most projects state that they do not have any carbon-capturing systems in place. The biggest consumers of hydrogen have been in the oil refining industry.

Despite the current administration’s disapproval of hydrogen, the forecast looks promising

In the past few months, since Donald Trump started his second term as the President of the United States, the federal government has cancelled or halted projects that aim to increase the standing and usage of renewable energy in the industry. Several projects have had federal funding pulled or been ordered to halt construction while the Trump government assesses the permits and regulations of the Biden era.

Despite that, the forecast for the future of hydrogen looks very good indeed. The IEA reported that low-emissions hydrogen production now has the potential to reach up to 37 million tonnes per year by 2030. We suspect that the analysis comes as the Trump Presidency will end in 2028.

The end of the Trump presidency could boost the standing of the hydrogen sector worldwide

Once that happens, the IEA has reported that the hydrogen sector will continue to grow and become the world’s most dominant energy source. The Biden-led government instituted a tax credit for companies in the hydrogen sector, but the Trump administration has plans to roll back that tax credit.

The IEA reported that if the current trend continues, hydrogen could boost capacity to 4 million tonnes per year, with a further 6 million tonnes possible if effective policies are introduced once Trump vacates the Presidency.

“Investor interest in hydrogen jumped at the start of this decade thanks to its potential to help countries deliver on their energy goals. The latest data indicates that the growth of new hydrogen technologies is under pressure due to economic headwinds and policy uncertainty, but we still see strong signs that their development is moving ahead globally.” – Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director

Many were hoping the promise made before wasn’t empty, but it turns out people who shell out for an electric car won’t be able to make their neighbors help pay for a portion of it.

The Subaru Legacy is no more.

This news comes as the September 30 deadline for the federal EV tax credits approaches. It turns out the reason for this rather unsurprising development is rather fundamental.

It all comes down to one thing: cost. The state of California can’t foot the bill for such a measure, reports Bloomberg. According to Governor Newsom, the removal of the tax incentives by Republicans is “federal vandalism.”

Considering under the federal program people who lived in other states helped finance vehicle purchases for people living in California, we’re not sure how that even makes sense. But most politicians get rather testy when they’re told they can no longer raid private citizen’s earnings for their pet programs.

Some automakers were really banking on California offering the $7,500 EV tax credit, picking up where the federal government is leaving off. There was a proposal for a $5,000 incentive, but California can’t even float that much.

After all, the Golden State is out of cash, running a budget deficit was it keeps spending money like crazy. It’s almost like there are consequences to actions.

During a speech announcing the disappointing development, Governor Newsom made sure to threaten GM CEO Mary Barra, accusing her of “selling out” his state by pushing on US Congress to end the EV mandate in California.

However, Newsom has made a fresh batch of promises, saying next year California will offer a new EV subsidy program, even though it hasn’t had one since 2023. We can’t wait to see who he blames when that also falls apart.

The U.S. is the largest importer of coffee in the world. Brazil, the top source for U.S. coffee, has faced a 50% tariff under the Trump administration’s tariff policy, contributing to a surge in prices. U.S. retail coffee prices increased by nearly 21% last month compared to the same month last year. The No Coffee Tax Act will bring coffee tariffs back to the level they were the day before Trump took office. That level was 0% on everything other than coffee substitutes containing coffee.

“Americans started a revolution over a tax on tea. U.S. coffee prices have increased significantly in the last year, in part due to Trump’s tariffs. If you drink coffee every morning, how can you not be mad about that? Our bipartisan bill is simple: it removes Trump's tariffs on coffee to bring down costs,” said Representative Ro Khanna.

“Families across America are feeling the cost of higher coffee prices, which are already up 21 percent, and tariffing a product we can't grow at a large, commercial scale, only makes it worse. Tariffs are simply a tax on American consumers, raising the price of everyday goods without creating jobs or bringing production on-shore. Article One of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the authority to set tariffs, and this legislation begins to reclaim that authority. I look forward to working with Rep. Khanna to introduce this bipartisan bill and believe it can help spark the broader debate about Congress reclaiming its constitutional role in tariff policy.” said Representative Don Bacon.

“Millions of Americans are paying a new tax on coffee every morning thanks to President Trump's tariffs. Our bill would stop it,” said Representative Don Beyer.

Instead of the thrill that comes with careening through twists and turns, industry professionals on this ride are likely going to be contemplating significant shifts in their business plan and navigating the world of layoffs, downsizing and potential business closures.

Those seeking to climb to the crest of the next hill are looking at several years of business innovation and uncertainty while anticipating another shift in federal policy that will help the US regain its standing in renewable energy deployment. If the impacts of this bill on jobs, investment and energy costs align with the forecasts from SEIA and others, a future change in leadership is likely to open the door to correcting course.

In the interim, the US will need to focus its efforts on advancing a clean energy future, state by state. While federal tax policy has had a significant role in advancing renewable energy investment, state-level energy policy and regulation are also substantial drivers. There are ample local opportunities to advance clean energy priorities that address short-term needs while creating a regulatory environment that is better prepared for expansive growth than the one we have today.

In this article, we explore the opportunity and imperative for reforming interconnection policy for distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar, energy storage and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and how such efforts can address near-term challenges while readying the US for a streamlined transition to clean energy.

The need for DER interconnection reform

In January 2025, the Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2X)—a programme of the Department of Energy—released its ‘Distributed Energy Resource Interconnection Roadmap’ [2], which highlights key actions that can be taken in the next five to ten years to address DER interconnection challenges. Priorities include increasing grid transparency, streamlining utility approval, including interconnection in grid planning processes, and supporting grid reliability, resiliency and security. The authors argue that effectively addressing these priorities will provide significant benefits, including reducing interconnection approval timelines, increasing approval rates, improving interconnection queue data, ensuring DERs do not impact transmission-level reliability and reducing customer grid interruptions.

As highlighted in the roadmap, “[if] the potential for DER deployment is to be realised … interconnection processes must evolve to handle large and growing volumes of DER interconnection requests”. While the pace of interconnection requests is expected to slow down in 2026, this reduction in volume will not alleviate the challenges that individual projects face.

Distribution grids have a finite amount of capacity for hosting DERs. With each subsequent project, the risk of interconnection challenges increases. Effective interconnection rules adopted by state utility regulatory commissions are essential to ensure that future projects are able to fully utilise existing hosting capacity and that processes are in place to pay for investments to modernise the grid equitably.

In 2023, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) highlighted the scale of regulatory reform needed in the US through its ‘Freeing the Grid’ evaluation [3], which grades the strength of each state’s interconnection rules (see Figure 1). Thirteen states scored an “F” because they do not regulate DER interconnection, and another 16 states scored a “D”, indicating a need to significantly update their interconnection procedures to streamline review processes, reduce costs and improve transparency.

In summary, nearly 60% of states in the US need drastic improvements to their interconnection procedures to address existing barriers to DER deployment, let alone to achieve the goals highlighted in the i2X roadmap.

Change takes time

One of the challenges of regulatory reform is that its timelines are typically measured in years. Take New Hampshire, for example. Interconnection customers knew well before the most recent update to ‘Freeing the Grid’ that improvements were needed. In January 2022, the state legislature passed Senate Bill 262 to address interconnection delays by directing its Department of Energy to investigate the state’s interconnection procedures. That bill resulted in a year-long proceeding and a December 2023 report to the legislature that concluded working groups would be needed to identify regulatory changes.

Recognising that a formal rule-making would be required to address ongoing concerns, the legislature ordered the Department of Energy in January 2024 to instead initiate a formal rule-making proceeding to align the state’s interconnection rules with national best practices and cited IREC’s ‘Model Interconnection Procedures’ [4] as a resource. A final revised rule is expected to be approved by April 2026.

New Hampshire’s four-year process is not unique. Massachusetts began considering changes to include energy storage in its utilities’ interconnection tariffs in May 2019. Over six years later, these improvements are currently being considered by the state’s Department of Public Utilities. New Mexico, the only state to score an “A” in the 2023 edition of ‘Freeing the Grid’, overhauled its interconnection rules in November 2022 following passage of a grid modernisation bill that was signed into law in March 2020.

Similarly, it took Maine over two and a half years to significantly amend its rules following the passage of interconnection legislation in March 2021.

How change happens

Reforming interconnection regulation requires prioritisation of the issue— typically either by the legislature or the utility regulatory commission—and formal public regulatory processes that evaluate whether any proposed changes will impact the utility’s ability to maintain grid safety and reliability. The time requirements of these processes are better aligned with solving forward-looking challenges, but the reality is that a large majority of regulatory proceedings are reactive. As a result, a discrete interconnection issue can impact a market for years. And while that particular issue is being solved, numerous others can arise.

Whether a deficiency in a state’s interconnection procedures is addressed depends heavily upon legislative or regulatory advocacy. Efforts may be initiated by a legislator who is contacted by a constituent or contractor who is experiencing considerable delays or is required to pay for significant upgrades to the grid to accommodate their projects. Or a regulatory commission may notice a pattern of complaints or receive a filing from a utility seeking guidance on how to comply with the state’s interconnection rules for a particular set of circumstances.

In very few instances do regulatory changes proactively seek to address issues experienced in other jurisdictions that are expected to arise locally in the future.

Often, interconnection issues experienced by utility customers never reach the key decision makers who can initiate needed change. Some solar contractors, when faced with an interconnection challenge and strong demand for projects from other customers, may avoid investing the considerable time needed to try to resolve the issue and instead abandon the project. Or they may try to resolve the issue with the utility and fail to find a reasonable pathway to resolution.

If the contractor is successful in identifying an opportunity to resolve the issue, their customer may decide to cancel the project due to delays or uncertainty. Other customers may shoulder excessive costs or an excessive delay on a single project without raising the broader issue that, if addressed, would prevent similar issues for other customers. In extremely rare cases, negotiation between local industry and utilities can lead to resolution outside of formal regulatory proceedings.

Given the market disruption likely to occur in 2026, DER interconnection challenges need to be more visible and addressed promptly. Project cancellations due to interconnection challenges are likely to be more impactful to solar contracting firms and project developers. The importance of high interconnection approval rates increases with market contraction, and the ability to shoulder the costs to resolve interconnection disputes decreases with a smaller revenue base.

Additionally, once the pendulum of federal policy swings again and the solarcoaster takes another exhilarating ride, it is critical that states don’t spend years resolving interconnection bottlenecks that are very foreseeable today.

Prioritising regulatory reform during challenging times

With the burden of responding to very real and impactful market pressures, it may be difficult for individual solar companies to ramp up their activity in legislative and regulatory arenas where they may not see direct and immediate economic benefit. Even in good times, most of the companies engaging in interconnection reform do so with a specific project in mind. Durable interconnection reform requires a broader approach, one that may seem a significant luxury during lean times.

Yet, interconnection strategy and regulatory engagement are fundamental to the success of companies that weather the impacts of the Budget Reconciliation Bill. For those committed to the long-term success of their business or their state, here are some tips for advancing interconnection reform:

Identify the core interconnection issues facing your state. If you work in the solar industry and are experiencing specific interconnection challenges, evaluate your state’s interconnection procedures and determine whether the challenge is due to utility non-compliance with the rules or a deficiency in the rules themselves. If you are not experiencing interconnection issues and instead seek to be proactive, review your state’s scorecard from ‘Freeing the Grid’ to identify where there are opportunities for improvement.

Learn from other states. Unless you are in California or Hawai’i, there’s a strong likelihood the challenges you’re seeing have been experienced elsewhere. IREC’s ‘Model Interconnection Procedures’ represent a baseline model of effective DER interconnection provisions that have been adopted in states around the country. If your state scored a “D” or “F” in ‘Freeing the Grid’, a strong goal could be to adopt or revise your state’s rules in alignment with the IREC Model. If customers are experiencing issues that aren’t addressed in the IREC model, reach out to colleagues in other states to see whether they’ve experienced similar challenges or contact IREC directly.

Identify areas of strength. Regulatory reform requires broad expertise and benefits from collaboration. Once you’ve identified the challenges to address, identify what you can bring to the table. Are you a technical expert who can evaluate interconnection solutions from other states and how they apply in yours? Do you have expertise in the interconnection process, and what specifically needs to be improved? These insights are highly complementary to parties who want to advance local clean energy solutions and may be more familiar with the regulatory or legislative processes.

Build alliances. Interconnection reform requires people with influential networks, people who can motivate decision makers to act, lawyers or other regulatory policy specialists who can write compelling comments in formal proceedings and practitioners who can make and dispel technical arguments. Common advocates include individual DER companies, trade associations, nonprofit groups focused on climate or clean energy issues, energy agencies in states with climate goals and IREC. You may find collaborators in places you might not expect, such as with utilities. There are often renewable energy champions working on the front lines at utilities who also want to see processes improve. Building strong relationships with utility staff can help strengthen regulatory outcomes by more specifically identifying the barriers to change and the shared benefits of streamlined interconnection procedures.

Take the long view. In the states where interconnection reform has taken years to advance, the pathway was rarely a straight line. And even once those changes have been implemented, interconnection rules need to be updated regularly to address emerging challenges and opportunities. Engaging in these issues, either directly or through collaboration with other parties, is increasingly becoming part of doing business for those in the solar industry.

The second-best day to advance interconnection policy is today

There is an adage that the best day to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second-best time is today. The same holds true for developing strong DER interconnection regulation. While a majority of the states across the US would be better positioned to weather the interconnection challenges of today and tomorrow by initiating reform of their interconnection procedures two, four or even ten years ago, starting today is the next best time to remove barriers to solar and storage projects.

Such efforts will reduce the burden on customers and companies seeking to connect DERs to the grid during what is expected to be a particularly challenging time for the advancement of solar technologies. Interconnection reform is also necessary to streamline processes ahead of the wave of projects that will come when a federal commitment to clean energy returns. The consequences of waiting are predictable and will further hamper US deployment of solar power.

The Sept. 25-28 auto show at the Anaheim Convention Center will feature plenty of electric, hybrid and traditional models from more than 27 automakers and offer dozens of street test drives featuring models from Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Ram and Toyota.

Attendees will get a taste of what driving an EV is like at the SoCal Electrified Ride Experience. It will showcase rides with professional drivers behind the wheel of new EVs — from Cadillac, Ford, Kia or Nissan — that will hum along on a large indoor track at the convention center.

Sackrison concedes that these are challenging times for auto buyers.

“I think October is going to be an interesting month,” said Sackrison. “If 27% of our county’s sales are battery electric vehicles, and those sales are going to be significantly reduced after the tax credits go away, it’s going to create a big challenge, because it’s a big part of the Orange County and California markets.”

The new vehicle sales outlook in California is expected to fall in the second half of 2025 due to inflation, stagnant household disposable income and higher tariffs putting pressure on vehicle prices, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Sackrison cited statistics from CNCDA showing that total new vehicle registrations in 2025 are predicted to fall just short of the 1.75 million vehicle sales seen in 2024.

EV sales have slowed, with some of that stall coming from a backlash over billionaire Elon Musk’s unabashed involvement in cutting jobs in the Trump administration. The share of zero emission vehicles in the state fell to 19.5% in the first six months, down from 22% in the same year-ago period — largely due to the drop in Musk’s Tesla sales.

While OC Auto Show attendees may see an opportunity to get under the wire with buying or leasing an EV, Irvine-based electric carmaker Rivian’s latest R2 SUV model won’t be at the show to see.

Neither is Tesla coming.

Both of these EV automakers have different levers to pull for marketing that rely on showrooms in upscale settings where they can reach wealthier buyers.

A Rivian spokesperson says the company — which recently laid off 200 workers — is all “heads down on bringing the R2 to market in the first half of 2026.” On Tuesday, Sept. 16, Rivian broke ground on a $5 billion plant east of Atlanta, Georgia, where it will begin assembling the R2 in 2028.

“It’s a loss,” said Sackrison of Rivian’s absence from the show, even though the automaker has never attended since landing in Orange County five years ago. “I think they are missing a great opportunity to connect with the largest audience of car buyers in a market that buys more EVs than 45 states. Rivian’s market share is only about 1% in Orange County, so they would really benefit from the more than 350,000 in-vehicle experiences that take place at the show.”

There’s still a silver lining for what is billed as one of the nation’s first auto shows — including Southern California venues in Los Angeles, scheduled for Nov. 21-30 and San Diego on Jan. 1-4.

“The turmoil is going to lead some people to want to trade in or trade up,” said Brian Moody, executive editor of Kelley Blue Book, an Irvine-based vehicle valuation and automotive research company. “As an example, if you had an electric car mainly for the purpose of getting into the carpool lane, and now you don’t get to do that, do you really love the electric car that much, or would you maybe rather have something else?”

People who visit the auto show at the Anaheim Convention Center will kick the tires on a variety of so-called green energy vehicles. They’ll see plug-in hybrids that can run on gas and an electric-powered battery to get an extra bump of 30 to 50 miles of driving, or EVs that use only rechargeable batteries to power electric motors for propulsion.

The hybrid vehicle category may be the lone bright spot in California’s auto market after the tax incentives go away.

In California, registrations of hybrid vehicles that run on electric and gas engines increased 54% in the first half of 2025 and accounted for 19.2% of the market, totaling 181,192 registrations, according to CNCDA.

Turning a new leaf

“It’s probably the first auto show that the consumer is going to get a look at the all-new Nissan Leaf, an inexpensive electric car,” Moody said.

The third-generation 2026 electrified Nissan Leaf features a range of 303 miles, starting at $29,990 for the S+ model, considered one of the least expensive EVs on the market.

Also getting a first-time look at the show will be the 2026 Ram 1500 with a 5.7 liter HEMI V8, reintroduced in the Ram lineup after being dropped in the 2025 model year. Ram acknowledged it made a mistake by discontinuing the legendary V8 and reversed course due to strong customer demand for the engine’s 395 horsepower.

Attendees also will get a sneak peek of the Dodge Duragon SRT Hellcat, a 710-horsepower 6.2 liter HEMI V8 engine that has three rows of seating to accommodate a larger number of passengers, typically up to seven people.

Other new models to be seen at the show include:

Toyota Prius Nightshade and Toyota Crown Nightshade, both of which come as hybrids (Prius also has a plug-in version) featuring blacked-out exterior accents on wheels, window trim, door handles and other trim pieces.

Dodge Charger’s twin-turbo SIXPACK with an engine that produces 550 horsepower.

Honda Ridgeline TrailSport, an off-road-truck with a slightly raised ride height;.

Honda CR-V TrailSport, a hybrid for light off-road use.

Ford F-150 Lobo, with lowered rear suspension, 22-inch gloss black wheels and powered by a V8 engine producing 400 horsepower.

Chevrolet Suburban Premiere, a carry over from the 2025 line that offers updates to the entertainment and in-car camera systems, the latter of which allows the driver to monitor activity in the back seats.

Jeep Cherokee hybrid, an SUV that provides 210 horsepower and an estimated 37 MPG.

Exotic cars roll in

The exotic vehicle display at the auto show offers an up-close look at ultra-high-end vehicles from automakers such as Bentley, Lamborghini and McLaren. A local dealership in Irvine, Lamborghini Newport Beach, plans to roll up with a sporty Lamborghini and McLaren, both priced at more than $400,000.

The Pacific Coast Corvette Club will also feature a showcase of Corvettes, spanning every generation from the classic C1 that debuted in 1953 to the cutting edge C8 unveiled at the Tustin blimp hangar in 2019.

‘Glamping’ market

According to Sackrison, the outdoor vehicle recreation market — sometimes referred to as “overland” — is a growing niche for the show. These so-called OVR vehicles are pitched for outdoor enthusiasts who drive overland in remote areas — oftentimes along rugged and boulder-strewn trails and fire roads in mountains — just to get to a backcountry spot to sleep under the stars, or park next to a river.

The global off-road vehicle market size was estimated at just over $22 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% from 2023 to 2030, according to Grand View Research, and cited by Sackrison.

“It’s definitely a market that is growing,” said Mark Han, co-founder and manager for the Torrance-based OVR website, whose company rented 22,000 square feet at the convention floor to show off more than 20 off-road vehicles rigged for the outdoors lifestyle. “When we first started doing these shows two years ago at the LA auto show, 90% who came over to our space said the overland market was new to them. Now we’re speaking to the indoctrinated.”

For automation suppliers, the surge represents both a challenge and an opportunity: robots are emerging as critical tools in building the next generation of energy infrastructure.

Kuka, the Augsburg-based industrial robot maker, says automation is becoming essential for meeting demand at scale while maintaining quality and controlling costs.

Its systems are already being deployed in projects spanning cell assembly, battery pack production, and recycling.

At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, for example, Kuka robots are part of the AgiloBat project, which uses “mini-environments” to assemble cells.

These enclosures reduce the reliance on large, energy-hungry dry rooms while still ensuring precise environmental control.

In Nuremberg, Kuka Systems has installed a modular production hall at MAN Truck & Bus that can build 50,000 battery packs annually, with scope to double that output.

The facility uses autonomous mobile robots and decoupled stations to increase flexibility, giving manufacturers more room to adapt as technologies and volumes change.

Robotics are also beginning to play a role in disassembly and recycling. In the DeMoBat project at Fraunhofer IPA, Kuka robots are used to dismantle used battery packs, handling diverse designs under real industrial conditions to recover valuable materials safely and efficiently.

The battery market is attracting growing interest from automation suppliers who want to be part of the build-out, working alongside manufacturers to develop scalable production systems.

Comau, the Italian robotics and automation company, has joined the SPRINT project, part of the EU’s Horizon Europe programme, to help develop quasi-solid-state sodium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage.

Although the work is focused on energy technologies rather than robotics, Comau’s role highlights how automation expertise is being drawn into the sector.

The 46-month project is exploring manufacturing processes for sodium-ion cells that use sodium iron phosphate and polymer electrolytes.

Comau is tasked with feasibility studies, process optimization, and designing roadmaps to scale production into industrial environments.

The aim is to cut costs per kilowatt-hour, extend battery life cycles, and increase European autonomy by using materials available in the region.

By engaging in projects like SPRINT, Comau is aligning with European strategies for electrification and sustainability, even if robotics is not the headline element.

The company is already active in industry associations such as the European Battery Alliance and Batteries European Partnership Association, positioning itself to play a role in how Europe builds its energy storage base.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-09-22 15:31:23+00:00,WIRED,Louisiana Hands Meta a Tax Break and Power for Its Biggest Data Center - WIRED,Roshan Abraham,,,,,https://www.wired.com/story/louisiana-hands-meta-a-tax-break-and-power-for-its-biggest-data-center/,"Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta’s massive new data center in Richland Parish.
A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.
Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion.
In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.
“That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.” She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer.","Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta’s massive new data center in Richland Parish. When it’s done, the 4-million-square-foot facility will require more than 2 gigawatts of energy to run.

On August 20, Louisiana’s Public Service Commission voted four to one to approve the construction of the plants, which will be run by the utility company Entergy Louisiana. The decision was met with criticism from members of the public who testified against Entergy and Meta’s plan, claiming that the process was rushed. They voiced concerns about rising energy bills and water shortages.

Documents viewed by WIRED show that state authorities agreed to grant Meta tax breaks and incentives without the company explicitly guaranteeing any full-time jobs for local workers.

Opponents of the plan were angry about the sped-up approval timeline: Entergy submitted its application in 2024, and the vote originally could have taken place this October, to give the commission’s administrative law judge the chance to issue further recommendations. But Entergy filed a motion to move the vote to August, claiming that some of the parties that had previously opposed the project were now in agreement. The rescheduled vote left no time for changes.

Critics also claim the deal doesn’t include stipulations like a cap on how much Entergy could charge utility customers for the construction of the gas plants and transmission lines in Meta’s data center build-out—a concern as massive AI data centers can cause utility bills to spike. While Meta agreed to finance the first 15 years of a 30-year loan to construct the gas plants, the construction of the transmission line will be paid for by utility customers.

“We wanted the commissioners to attach conditions and reasonable safeguards, such as a cost cap, but they instead came to this extremely disappointing and baffling decision,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposed the Entergy application.

During the approval vote, Entergy and Louisiana’s economic development officials repeatedly pointed to the projections shared by Meta, which suggest that the project would bring a $10 billion investment and upwards of 300 to 500 well-paying jobs. In its original 2024 application for the plants, Entergy referenced Richland Parish’s low income levels—one in four residents lives below the poverty line—as a reason to authorize the plan.

“There has never been a better time to lift our residents out of poverty. There has never been a better time to give people in our region better jobs,” said Rob Cleveland, the CEO of Grow NELA, an economic development firm representing northwest Louisiana who testified in support of Entergy’s gas plants, at the hearing.

Meta’s Jobs Pledge

Louisiana politicians sought to rewrite zoning laws and shifted a tax rebate for broadband into a tax exemption for data centers, all to win Meta’s support in late 2024, according to January reporting from Nola.com. But the public had little time to scrutinize Louisiana’s economic development promises. They also heard little from Meta, which was not legally required to take part in the hearings on Entergy’s new gas plants, despite the fact that the gas plants and a new $550 million transmission line connecting energy to the data center and upgrades to a local substation (also approved on August 20) are being built entirely for the company—the latter entirely paid for by Louisiana taxpayers. Repeated attempts to force Meta to produce documents that critics claim they have not received were unsuccessful, including a July subpoena attempt.

One of Meta’s tax incentive agreements with the state, which was signed last fall and viewed by WIRED, does not stipulate that Meta subsidiary Laidley, which is running the data center project, will focus on local hiring, although it does require that all jobs be fulfilled on site. (Separately, Entergy said Meta submitted a letter to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April saying that it will make “a concerted effort” to hire locally, but this assurance is not binding.)

And the tax incentive agreement does not actually require any of the jobs to be full-time to receive state incentives. Instead it defines “full-time job” to mean any 40-hour workweek fulfilled through any number of part-time jobs. Meta would need to hire these 500 “full-time” jobs by 2035 if it wants to receive the highest level of tax breaks, an 80 percent reduction on the full amount. It does require the jobs to provide health insurance and says the pay for all jobs should average out at $82,000 a year. The contract also charges Meta an “administrative fee” of $10,000 for every $1 billion it spends in the state.

When reached for comment, Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the state’s economic development authority, said that the agency still expects Meta to create 500 full-time, permanent jobs, per previous announcements. “Meta is expected to create 500 direct new jobs at the facility, which in economic development terms means permanent, full-time jobs,” Litten says.

Entergy’s critics claimed the utility was reluctant to provide specifics on Meta’s job numbers in the lead-up to the August vote, refusing to explain what types of jobs will be created or how Meta estimated 300 to 500 new hires. In an email to WIRED, Entergy only referred to an impact report from Grow NELA but answered no other direct questions.

“We continually asked for analysis with how they came up with this number of jobs, and Entergy has no idea about how many people will be hired,” says Susan Stevens Miller, an attorney representing the Union of Concerned Scientists and Alliance for Affordable Energy, which opposed the application.

In an August 7 filing, Entergy urged the rushed vote on its final agreement with several parties, saying Meta’s subsidiary and the tech industry “prize speed to the market as vital to its competitiveness” and that “the Commission has the flexibility and agility to act at the new speed of business, while reasonably balancing the interests of other Louisiana customers.” Entergy said in a filing it had submitted ample public testimony and the public had a chance to ask questions and that moving quickly was, “the difference between securing the Project for Louisiana or missing out on this massive economic development opportunity, likely to another state willing to move at the speed of business.”

But when several members of the public asked questions during the August 20 hearing about the project, particularly around Meta’s assurances of jobs, they received few details. None of the agreements between Meta and the state of Louisiana that were viewed by WIRED are available in the commission’s public dockets. An earlier, six-page term sheet laying out hiring incentives was published by Power magazine in November, but it did not include further details about whether jobs could be part-time or any other details in the 93-page agreement viewed by WIRED. Advocates with the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists contacted by WIRED said they had never seen the full agreement until it was sent to them by WIRED.

Louisiana resident Angelle Bradford Rosenberg spoke at the August 20 approval meeting, expressing concern about the impact of the data center’s water usage and its impact on local farmers. She also questioned the impact of jobs on the local economy.

“I want local businesses to be thriving,” she said during the meeting, “but if the average data center permanent jobs are 12 to 15, and y’all saying it’s going to be 500, do y’all have a promise that they’re going to be local jobs? ... Do we actually know that they’re hiring people from Monroe, Rayville, Delhi, Holly Ridge, or are they just saying 500 jobs and they’re bringing in these folks from other places?”

But the tax exemption agreement secured between Meta and Louisiana officials did not secure any guarantee of local hiring. Litten, with Louisiana Economic Development, told WIRED that separate state tax breaks that all companies in the state are eligible for do require local hiring. They include the Quality Jobs Rebate, which provides a 6 percent rebate on payroll expenses, a program set to replace it called High Impact Jobs program.

Most data centers hire specialists from out of state for the technical jobs, according to Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst who studies data center tax breaks at the nonprofit Good Jobs First. She says data centers employ a mix of low-skill and high-skill technical workers to manage servers in addition to security guards and maintenance roles. She says that while construction is happening, data centers often hire specialist electricians who travel from state to state to set up servers.

For this reason, she says, Meta is not the only tech company hesitant to guarantee local hiring when negotiating data center contracts. “They know that some of these jobs require skills that people in the local community just don’t have.”

In response to questions from WIRED, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said, “We make a concerted effort to source labor locally and provide substantial contributions directly to the community.” Clayton said that for part-time construction roles, its contractors were “working on hiring local talent” and that they would host information fairs early next year. For permanent data center jobs, Clayton said Meta would be hiring “technical operators, electricians, air-conditioning and heating specialists, logistics staff, security, and more.”

Meta’s Louisiana Tax Breaks

The state’s agreement with Meta makes clear that as public land, the property Meta is leasing is exempt from traditional taxes. It creates a menu of options for what the company would potentially owe in “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT), a common agreement that lets local governments offer tax breaks with provisions attached. The agreement offers Meta qualified exemptions from both sales tax and property tax.

To get the lowest level of property tax exemptions, Meta would need to invest $5 billion into the state and hire the equivalent of 300 full-time employees. At this level, Meta would have to pay 40 percent of the assessed property tax. If the company invests at least $10 billion by December 2032, it would get the highest exemption, paying 20 percent of the assessed property tax.

The agreement sets out hiring timelines that the company must also hit to receive these tax incentives: Meta can receive the highest property tax exemption as long as it hires the equivalent of 300 “full-time” jobs by 2030, 450 by 2032, 475 by 2033 and 500 by December 31, 2034.

Louisiana’s agreements ask for more than some other states’ tax subsidies. According to Good Jobs First, nearly half of state tax subsidies for data centers don’t require any new jobs to be created. But Miller has concerns that the tax breaks were not necessary at all to entice a company as large as Meta. “While everyone likes to avoid taxes, they’re not going to hire people in Richland [Parish] just because they’re going to get a tax break,” Miller says.

Louisiana had already amended a tax rebate to create an exemption for data centers in 2024 to entice Meta; in its latest iteration, it says data centers can receive a full sales tax exemption for equipment purchases in the state as long as they hire 50 full-time jobs and invest at least $200 million by July 1, 2029. A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.

Good Jobs First says that at least 10 states have subsidies for data centers that are worth more than $100 million each, and “have suffered estimated losses of $100 million each in tax revenue for data centers,” according to its data. In total, these states forgo more than $3 billion in taxes annually for data centers. Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion. In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.

The Franklin Farms site in Holly Ridge, the area of Richland Parish where Meta’s data center is being built, was purchased by Louisiana specifically for economic development projects. In its ground lease with Meta, Louisiana offered the 1,400-acre plot to the company for $12 million, which the lease says was the cost to the state of acquiring and maintaining the land. The lease also says Meta’s $732,000 a year “rent” is “credit toward the Base Purchase Price,” meaning the company will have paid for the property by a little over 16 years into its 30-year lease.

The price for the potential sale would be slightly higher if Meta does not reach minimum hiring and investment thresholds: As an example, the lease says if Meta only spends $4 billion in the state instead of $5 billion, the property would end up costing it $19 million. Louisiana Economic Development reserves the right to reclaim the property if Meta doesn’t invest at least $3.75 billion and hire the equivalent of 225 “full-time” jobs by 2028. When asked if Meta plans to purchase the property, Clayton said, “We’ll keep you updated on our future plans for this site.”

Meta’s presence has already caused land values to jump. A nearby tract of 4,000 acres of land in Holly Ridge is for sale for $160 million, or $40,000 per acre—more than 4.5 times the price paid by Louisiana for the data center’s site.

But there’s also a concern that Meta could delay or abandon the data center project. The PILOT agreement its subsidiary signed with the state says the company’s timeline will depend on “numerous factors outside of the control of the lessee, such as market orientation and demand, competition, availability of qualified laborers to construct and/or weather conditions.”

“My general fear is that too many data centers are being built,” Miller says. “That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.”

She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer. “Essentially, the state will be stuck with this warehouse full of computers,” Miller says.","https://media.wired.com/photos/68af58f4246764e1f361e9d1/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/What-Meta-Doesn't-Want-You-To-Know-Data-Center-Business-2194360641.jpg",N,,2025-09-22 12:06:54.156332

Cape Town depot upgrade

In South Africa, EV charging solutions provider Autel Energy announced its MaxiCharger DC Fast technology will support the electrification of Cape Town’s bus fleet. Autel will install 50 new charging units at the Arrowgate Depot, where it previously provided 30 units, supporting 120 electric buses. It is the largest public EV bus charging hub in South Africa.

UK firm scores 50 bus supply deal, First Bus adds to its fleet

Elsewhere, UK-based technology company Equipmake has signed a deal with Brazilian vehicle manufacturer Agrale SA to supply it with electric drivetrains for 50 buses.

The £5.45 million order (US$7.35 million) comes after an initial order Agrale made for five zero emission drivetrains in August 2024. Under the terms of this new agreement, Equipmake will deliver fully integrated electric drivetrain systems, combining an electric motor, inverter, control systems, and battery pack, in batches between now and mid-2026.

Brazil recently pioneered a world-first initiative to operate a regular service of fully electric bi-articulated buses.

Also in the UK, Norfolk County Council and First Bus will bring 24 electric double-decker buses to the road in Norfolk, UK, adding to an already operating fleet of 76 electric buses.

Through a £13.8 million investment, £8.9 million of which comes from First Bus, with the remainder provided as part of Norfolk’s Bus Service Improvement Plan grant, will upgrade two depots to support a larger electric fleet.

The Caister Road depot, in Great Yarmouth, will support 10 ebuses and the Vulcan Road depot in Norwich will accommodate 14.

Indian government pledges to double ebus fleet

In India, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta announced that the number of electric buses operating in the City will double by next year. Currently, 3,000 ebuses operate in the Indian capital, and Gupta committed to increasing the fleet at a ceremony marking the beginning of construction of a Delhi Transport Corporation depot, which will feature 84 charging stations for ebuses.

Gupta said that the project is part of the Delhi government’s vision of a Vikshit (developed) Delhi with “stronger transport and better last-mile connectivity”.

EBRD backs Egyptian ebuses

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), meanwhile, is backing the launch of an inter-city electric bus fleet in Egypt with a €10.6 million (US$12.4 million) loan to Go Bus for Transport, the country’s first privately owned inter-city bus company.

Through its European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus initiative, the European Union will provide 10% first-loss risk cover for the loan, which will enable Go Bus to acquire 30 new buses, six electric micro-buses and three other EVs for intra-city journeys.

Other EV infrastructure funding by EBRD saw €60 million committed to finance construction of 600 EV chargepoints across the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, due to be fully installed by the end of 2027.

Under the modified ordinance, users of city charging stations will be charged 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for Level 2 charging stations and 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for Level 3 charging stations.

Currently, Batavia has just one Level 2 charging station in the west parking lot at City Hall, per the city. But it’s set to get two Level 3 chargers soon: one downtown and another at Batavia High School, a project partially funded by state grant money.

Level 3 charging, or direct-current fast charging, essentially provides more miles of range with a shorter charge time, according to the Alternative Fuels Data Center from the United States Department of Energy.

Batavia’s new downtown station was originally planned for Shumway Avenue near Flinn Street, but, at a recent meeting, Batavia’s Electric Superintendent Steve Allen said the city is looking for a new location.

The city is aiming to have the Batavia High School chargers go live at the end of the month, a city spokesperson told The Beacon-News on Friday. The city has not yet settled on a downtown location for the second new charging station.

The city first installed a charging station at City Hall in 2018, according to Allen, but he said the current rate of 40 cents per kilowatt-hour is now “much too high.” So, to make rates comparable to nearby communities, he suggested reducing the rate for the Level 2 chargers and instituting a rate of 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for the new Level 3 charging stations.

At the Batavia City Council Committee of the Whole meeting on Sept. 9, council members also discussed instituting a grace period for customers moving their vehicles out of the charging spots and whether to implement a fee for those who leave their cars in the spot beyond it reaching a full charge.

Allen originally suggested a 10-minute grace period, but Ald. Abby Beck suggested increasing it to 20 to 30 minutes.

The council also discussed a fee of $1 per minute that a user would be charged for leaving their car in the space past the grace period to move their vehicle.

Ald. Christopher Solfa said the overage fee seemed “a bit aggressive.”

Ald. Alan Wolff, on the other hand, said that the app customers use to pay for charging prompts customers when their vehicle is finished charging to ensure that the next person can use it.

“It’s not like we’re looking for money to have a parking space there,” Wolff said. “It’s to keep the thing charging cars. When one’s done, move it, get another one in there.”

Allen also indicated that the stations are not intended as a way for the city to generate money.

“I don’t think these are an economic boon, unfortunately,” Allen said. “I just think they’re a great thing for our community to have.”

These conversations are happening as Batavia is considering other aspects of its energy future. Recently, for example, the city passed an updated energy policy meant to guide where the city chooses to source its power from, what kinds of sources it relies on and sustainability goals.

The city currently gets its energy via an agreement with the Northern Illinois Municipal Power Agency, or NIMPA, a joint action agency made up of Batavia, Geneva and the city of Rochelle, according to past reporting. NIMPA is a partial owner of the Prairie State energy campus, according to its website, and power from Prairie State is distributed to NIMPA members, including Batavia.

Prairie State, a coal-fired power plant in southern Illinois, has previously been ranked one of the top 10 biggest polluters in the country, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting, Beck also expressed support for the charging stations, in particular the locations in the city.

“Having it be a draw, like, ‘Oh, and I can go get a cup of coffee or I can get something while I’m charging,’ is just fantastic,” she said.

The council ultimately landed on considering a 30-minute grace period and the $1 per-minute charge after that, but the details generated further debate from the council when the matter headed to a final vote on Sept. 15.

At that meeting, Ald. Dustin Pieper floated the possibility of putting a cap on how much a person would get charged for leaving their car in the spot and mentioned the possibility of whether a car would be towed if left in one of the spots for a long period of time. He also suggested adding signage that instructs users to contact the city if there’s an extenuating circumstance that prevents someone from moving their car.

Ald. Kevin Malone said he was in support of a cap on an overage fee.

“I think we can set it at a rate that makes it hurt enough that they don’t forget again, but also isn’t … us kind of price-gouging,” Malone said.

The council also discussed modeling the fee after the fee charged when someone parks in an accessible parking space.

Ald. James Fahrenbach said there should be a cap on the fee levied, but said it should be high and noted that the risk of an electric vehicle breaking down is pretty low compared to a non-EV.

Asked by Wolff how this would be monitored, Allen said that use of the charger is monitored through the machine at the charging station, but if someone chose to return to their car to disconnect the charger from the car but leave their car parked there, the city would be reliant on surveillance methods or complaints to enforce compliance.

Beck asked about how many minutes they would enforce the $1 per-minute fee for, and several council members discussed whether situations like this had come up.

Most Batavia residents don’t have electric vehicles currently, per the results of a recent citywide survey of residents. Only 10.6% of just under 800 respondents indicated that they own or lease an electric vehicle, and more than half of respondents said they don’t intend to buy one, according to past reporting.

Allen said the city hasn’t received complaints of cars parked at the charging station while not charging.

Ald. Leah Leman noted that the council was discussing two different situations: a user of the charging station leaving their vehicle in the spot beyond it reaching a full charge, versus a non-EV driver using the space for parking.

Batavia Police Chief Eric Blowers pointed to state statute, which stipulates a $75 fine for parking a non-EV at an EV charging station, and allows municipalities to increase that fine to $100.

Wolff suggested utilizing the $100 fine for a non-EV parked in a city-owned charging station and a $120 cap on the per-minute charge for an electric vehicle staying in the space beyond the grace period, as well as having the city provide a link or QR code at the charging stations to the city ordinance so users are aware of the rules. Malone also supported the $120 cap.

The new rates, along with the 30-minute grace period and a $1 per-minute overage fee, were ultimately approved by the council unanimously on Sept. 15.

Scientists agree that harnessing the energy released as atoms fuse together could produce incredible amounts of low carbon power.
Whichever confinement process is used, the goal is to sustain the fusion reaction long enough and with enough energy to achieve a new power gain.

The remainder of the funding, about $6.1 million will go to the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program to support 20 projects intended to accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said he believes the United States could be harnessing fusion energy electricity in the next decade.

In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, Wright said, “I believe we will know the commercial pathway to fusion during the Trump administration.”

“Commercial electricity from fusion energy could be as fast as eight years and I’d be very surprised if it’s more than 15,” he added.

The comments by Wright, who studied nuclear fusion while attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of California, Berkeley, are similar to statements he made to the BBC earlier this month.

During that interview he said, “With artificial intelligence and what’s going on at the national labs and private companies in the United States, we will have that approach about how to harness fusion energy multiple ways within the next five years.

“The technology, it’ll be on the electric grid in eight to 15 years,” he said.

Scientists agree that harnessing the energy released as atoms fuse together could produce incredible amounts of low carbon power. However, they are generally far less confident than Wright on the timeline for that happening.

The challenge is the complexity of the process. While nuclear fusion occurs all the time in outer space, replicating the process on Earth involves heating atoms to temperatures many times hotter than the sun.

To get a little more technical, it involves heating deuterium and tritium to over 100 million degrees Celsius to create a plasma and then confining this plasma using strong magnetic fields in a tokamak or by applying immense pressure with lasers.

A tokamak is an experimental device that uses powerful magnetic fields to confine plasma in a doughnut shape.

Whichever confinement process is used, the goal is to sustain the fusion reaction long enough and with enough energy to achieve a new power gain.

And it was only three years ago that researchers at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California announced they were able for the first time to produce a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed.

But the Energy Department remains committed to the cause.

Earlier this month, it announced it was committing $134 million to two programs “designed to secure U.S. leadership in emerging fusion technologies and innovation.”

At the time Wright said, “Fusion power holds the promise of limitless, reliable, American-made energy” and he said the programs – the Fusion Innovation Research Engine collaboratives and the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy would “ensure our innovators have the tools, talent and partnerships to make it a reality.”

Of the total, the Fusion Innovative Research Engine collaboratives will receive about $128 million in funding to be divided among seven teams that are creating a fusion energy science and technology innovation ecosystem composed of virtual, centrally managed teams.

The teams have been charged specifically with creating a bridge between the basic science research programs of the DOE’s Fusion Energy Sciences initiative and growing fusion industries.

The remainder of the funding, about $6.1 million will go to the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program to support 20 projects intended to accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities.

The projects selected include research in materials science, laser technology development, high temperature superconducting magnet assessment, artificial intelligence learning for fusion modeling and simulation, and enabling technologies to move toward achieving economical fusion energy.

On the private sector side, the potential of fusion energy has led to sizable investments from billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and more recently, sovereign wealth funds and national wealth banks have been throwing their resources behind the effort.

Under the non-binding deal, the EU committed to importing $250 billion annually of US energy, or $750 billion in total, by 2028, with LNG expected to anchor this expansion. The deal covers natural gas, oil, and nuclear fuels, paired with an additional $600 billion of investment in the US economy.

However, GECF labels these targets as unrealistic and believes the deal could face the same fate as the energy targets of the 2019 US–China trade deal, which remained unmet since the deal created no legal obligation for either side, much like the deal in question.

The Forum bases its analysis on several factors, including, among others, the decline in EU gas demand, infrastructure bottlenecks, and the fact that the EU’s climate policies conflict with deeper fossil fuel dependence, as recently echoed by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).

Background

The US introduced hefty new tariffs in April 2025 to shield domestic industries from foreign competition and to realign international trade in favor of US economic interests. GECF sees this as happening in a context of a seismic shift in the global trade system toward protectionism.

A baseline 10% tariff on imports from 185 countries was introduced, with a 20% country-specific tariff applying to EU member states. These higher tariffs have been repeatedly suspended, which GECF interprets to signal their use as leverage rather than as a permanent trade measure.

The tariffs were paired with an Executive Order providing for the reduction of tariffs if a trading partner takes “substantial steps” to address the US trade deficit. Since the EU represents 18% of total US imports, it emerged as the focal point of the US’s discussions with partners to address trade imbalances.

In late July, the duo worked out a framework trade deal in which most EU goods would be subject to a 15% import tariff. Additionally, the EU committed to importing $750 billion of US energy by 2028 and investing an additional $600 billion in the US economy.

Since the US exported around $70 billion worth of energy to the EU in 2024, the $250 billion annual commitment would represent more than a threefold increase for the EU, whose total energy import bill reached $407 billion in 2024.

Between 2021 and 2024, the share of pipeline gas in total EU consumption dropped by 20%, from 70% to 50%, while LNG’s share rose by the same amount, from 20% to 40%. This enabled the US to boost its gas exports to the EU from 6% to 19% and LNG from 28% to 45% over the same period.

The trend accelerated in the first half of 2025, when LNG imports surpassed pipeline gas imports in the EU for the first time. The North American country’s LNG exports to the EU amounted to $20 billion in 2024.

Possible issues

While the EU’s imports from the US could reach record levels by the year’s end, the report states the trade deal’s targets are highly ambitious, noting that both sides seem to be overpromising what can realistically be bought and sold.

The US currently has 105 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of operational LNG capacity, with an additional 115 Mtpa under construction and 100 Mtpa of planned capacity targeting FID.

Some notable projects in the development stage include Woodside Energy’s Louisiana LNG project, which is said to be 22% complete, and Venture Global’s CP2 LNG, for which $15.1 billion in financing was recently secured.

Therefore, a maximum of 100 Mtpa is theoretically available for future deals. This is expected to be even lower in practice as Asian countries have expressed their interest in purchasing US LNG, for example, in the case of Alaska LNG.

Supplying the full 100 Mtpa at current spot prices would generate only $60 billion annually for the US, which is well below the levels needed to make a meaningful contribution to the EU-US trade agreement, the report states.

An additional issue is the EU’s lack of gas demand to absorb additional LNG volumes from the US. Regional gas consumption fell sharply from 400 bcm in 2021 to 313 bcm in 2024, driven by a combination of structural and cyclical factors.

With the Union’s gas demand expected to remain flat or even decline slightly by the end of this decade, a major expansion of US LNG supply to the EU market could be limited.

Additionally, even though the EU is approving new LNG projects, capacity utilization rates remain around 50% because of the limited gas interconnection infrastructure. One example of this is Spain. While having the largest regasification capacity in the EU, the country lacks pipeline connections with neighbouring countries, so LNG cannot be distributed regionally.

The report further states that substituting spot and short-term LNG volumes from other suppliers is the best course of action for boosting US LNG exports because the majority of gas and LNG imports in the EU are tied to long-term contracts and are not easily redirected. However, there is limited scope for this to happen since a large share of spot and short-term LNG volumes already came from the US in 2024.

Another potential problem highlighted in the report is the fact that, whatever the authorities agree on, the final commercial decisions will rest with private companies. GECF explained that the EU companies base their decisions on profitability, and governments can only signal support or provide incentives, not compel them to buy US gas.

A final consideration is the fact that a boost in US LNG imports is at odds with the EU’s long-term climate objectives and net-zero objectives. The EU methane regulation is an additional factor complicating the situation and making the increase in US LNG imports difficult to achieve.

GECF feels that Europe could be at a disadvantage with the deal, as it could undermine climate credibility, increase the risk of stranded assets, and complicate the clean energy transition intended to support sustainable economic growth.

In conclusion, the organization believes that while the EU–US trade deal could theoretically have an impact on the global LNG market, it is more likely to function as a political signal of solidarity than as a major commercial driver of energy trade growth, particularly in the LNG segment.

“Moreover, roughly 250 Mtpa of LNG export capacity is under construction worldwide, and overall supply is expected to grow in line with rising global gas demand under stable prices. This expansion provides sufficient room for all major LNG suppliers.

“With Asia driving the bulk of future LNG import growth, any additional US LNG directed to the EU is likely to be offset by increased supplies to Asia from other producers, primarily GECF member countries, thereby maintaining overall market equilibrium,” the report concludes.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/29073650/Louisiana-LNG-1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1745905011,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:58.916852

This summer, Florida was the No. 1 economy in the country in CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings. The achievement comes thanks to the bold leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis and our state leaders, the illustrious businesses that call this state home and the hard-working families that make it all possible. Recently proposed utility rate hikes would only put an undue burden on the working families that are foundational to Florida’s success.

The day President Donald Trump took office, he vowed to unleash affordable and reliable American energy to curb the rising energy costs that “devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.” Florida should be following the president’s lead.

I work alongside families, businesses and community leaders across the state, and I’ve seen the negative impact of high energy costs firsthand. Florida must continue innovating and preparing the power grid for growth and storms, but higher utility bills are not the answer, and they fly in the face of Trump and DeSantis’ leadership.

A recent proposal before the Public Service Commission would hike rates by 10.5% for millions of Floridians. Even a modest monthly increase can push working families and seniors on fixed incomes to choose between necessities and will work against our state’s nation-leading economic growth. Further, rate increases have historically failed to deliver on their promised results, a fact commissioners should remember.

The commission should require greater accountability and provide more public transparency before approving new increases. Families, seniors and small businesses deserve assurances that their needs will come first and that any increase truly leads to stronger service and long-term value.

The good news is that we have smarter options.

Florida communities have shown that it is possible to strengthen resilience and reliability without raising household costs. When modern infrastructure and innovative technology are put to work, families benefit from lower electric bills and service they can count on, even when severe storms hit.

These kinds of forward-looking investments prove that innovation can protect both pocketbooks and peace of mind for Florida families. Florida leaders could explore even more market-based approaches to lowering household utility bills by increasing transparency and allowing more public input into the energy resource planning process.

Florida can modernize its grid, expand cleaner and more cost-effective technologies, and prepare for future growth without saddling families with higher bills. Affordability, reliability and innovation must go hand in hand if we want to secure a brighter energy future for Florida.

The U.S. clean energy workforce now stands at 3.56 million. In 2024, 7% of all new jobs in the United States were in clean energy, and clean energy represented 82% of all new energy sector jobs.

Despite these strong numbers, the nearly 100,000 jobs added marked a significant slowdown, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023. E2 attributed the slowdown to federal policy uncertainty and an overall slowing economy. Find the full jobs report and methodology here.

In 2025, job growth slowdowns and investment cancellations persist. E2 research shows that since January 2025, businesses cancelled more than $22 billion of planned clean energy factories and projects that were expected to create 16,500 jobs. Analysis by Energy Innovation suggests that more than 830,000 jobs could be lost due to policy rollbacks created by the Trump Administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

(Read: Trump: “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying solar”)

The E2 report said clean energy jobs now represents 42% of all energy jobs in America and 2.3% of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers, said the report.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17%, which far outpaces the fossil fuel industry’s creation of jobs and triples the broader U.S. job growth rate over the five year span.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce.”

On May 29, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill No. 3809 into law, adding new provisions to the Texas Utilities Code that impose decommissioning and financial assurance requirements for certain battery energy storage facility agreements in the state [H.B. 3809]. Shortly thereafter, on June 20, 2025, Governor Abbott signed House Bill No. 3228 into law, creating similar decommissioning and financial assurance obligations for wind and solar facility leases [H.B. 3228].

Both bills took effect on September 1, 2025, and apply only to agreements entered into on or after that date [Section 3 of H.B. 3809; Section 8 of H.B. 3228]. Solar, wind, and energy storage developers operating in Texas should ensure that their lease forms reflect these new obligations.

Battery Energy Storage

Under H.B. 3809, battery energy storage facility leases, other than those involving an electric utility, must include specific obligations for the tenant relating to the decommissioning of the facility, including the safe removal of facility and storage resources and the recycling of all recyclable components [New Sections 303.0004(a)-(b) of the Tex. Util. Code]. Additionally, tenants must provide financial assurance to the landowner before the earlier of the facility lease’s termination date or the 15th-anniversary of the battery operation date [New Section 303.0005(e) of the Tex. Util. Code]. The assurance amount must be sufficient to cover the cost of removal, recycling or disposal, and property restoration, less the salvage value of the facilities and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [Id. at subsection (b)].

Wind Power Facilities

As amended by H.B. 3228, Section 301.0003 of the Texas Utilities Code now requires that wind facility leases include specific obligations for the tenant to recycle or reuse all recyclable components and to dispose of the remaining components at authorized facilities [New Section 301.0003(a-1) of the Tex. Util. Code]. H.B. 3228 also expanded financial assurance requirements for wind projects [New Section 301.0004 of the Tex. Util. Code]. The amount of financial assurance must be sufficient to cover the costs of removal, recycling or disposal, and restoration costs, less the salvage value and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [Id. at subsection (b)]. Updated cost and salvage estimates must be provided at least once every five years for the duration of the agreement, with the tenant responsible for all costs associated with compliance [Id. at subsection (c)].

Solar Facilities

As amended by H.B. 3228, Sections 302.0004 and 302.0005 of the Texas Utilities Code impose similar obligations for solar power facility agreements [New Sections 302.0004-.0005 of the Tex. Util. Code]. Solar power facility agreements must now require tenants to recycle or reuse all recyclable components and to dispose of all other components at designated facilities [Id. at Section 302.0004(a-1)]. Additionally, the amount of financial assurance provided must be sufficient to cover removal, recycling or disposal, and restoration costs, less the salvage value and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [New Section 302.0005(b) of the Tex. Util. Code]. The first updated estimate is required on or before the tenth anniversary of the commercial operations date and further updates must be provided at least every five years [Id. at subsection (c)(2)]. The tenant is responsible for all associated costs [Id. at subsection (d)].

Conclusion

When taken together, H.B. 3809 and H.B. 3228 impose new requirements for storage, solar, and wind projects in Texas to remove, recycle, and dispose of such facilities [H.B. 3809; H.B. 3228]. Because all leases entered into after September 1, 2025, are required to comply with these new requirements, developers should check their site control forms to ensure that they are compliant with the current version of the Texas Utility Code [Section 3 of H.B. 3809; Section 8 of H.B. 3228].","https://images.passle.net/fit-in/400x400/filters:crop(0,0,2306,1298)/Passle/671960b986748a978b266239/SearchServiceImages/2025-09-22-14-58-02-222-68d163fac4095be329b8b384.jpg",N,,2025-09-22 13:06:59.841212

Dive Brief:

North American utilities are “increasingly looking to distributed resources” to meet data centers’ rapidly growing power demand amid ongoing challenges for large-scale generation deployment, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said last week.

Their interest spurred a surge in virtual power plant deployments last year, Wood Mackenzie Global Head of Grid Edge Ben Hertz-Shargel said in a Sept. 17 note. The numbers of active company deployments, unique offtakers for VPP capacity and monetized VPP programs all grew by at least one-third year over year, according to WoodMac’s data.

But overall VPP capacity in North America grew only 13.7%, to 37.5 GW, indicating “a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening” due to persistent barriers to adoption, Hertz-Shargel said.

Wood Mackenzie counted 1,940 North American virtual power plant deployments this year, up 33% from 2024. Its count of monetized VPP programs — which pay distributed energy resource owners to dispatch energy or curtail consumption — showed the number of programs rose 35% year over year, from 321 last year to 433 this year.

The number of unique offtakers for VPP capacity increased 38% this year from 2024, WoodMac said. More than half of all offtakers increased the number of VPP deployments serving them by at least 30% year over year. And the top 25 offtakers each procured 100 MW or more in 2025.

WoodMac attributed the increased offtake, in part, to an emerging “independent distributed power producer” business model. Independent distributed power producers, it explained, are electricity retailers that finance third-party-owned energy storage offerings through grid service revenue and energy arbitrage — charging batteries when electricity prices are low and discharging them when prices are high.

Third-party-owned energy storage retains relatively favorable regulatory treatment under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republican budget law that curtailed hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

WoodMac’s research suggests a correlation between growth in VPP offtakers and utility commitments to data center capacity. The consultancy found particularly robust VPP offtake in the PJM Interconnection and Electric Reliability Council of Texas regions, both of which have substantial existing and projected data center capacity. In July, American Electric Power said its utilities expect to interconnect 18 GW of data center capacity by 2030, largely in ERCOT and PJM.

In his note, Hertz-Shargel said the correlation could set up a win-win-win for utilities, data center operators and distributed energy resource owners.

“This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection,” he said. “Homeowners and business owners [with onsite energy resources] might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.”

But the modest increase in capacity relative to deployments, offtakes and monetized programs reveals obstacles that must be overcome before VPPs can reach their full potential, Hertz-Shargel said.

Those obstacles include enrollment caps on utility VPP programs, power market reforms that reduce VPPs’ capacity accreditation and market barriers for small customers, he said.

Brattle Group principal and distributed energy resources expert Ryan Hledik said the findings align with what he’s seeing in the distributed energy market. But he’s optimistic that VPP capacity will scale soon, given the urgency utilities and data center operators feel to source electrons wherever they can find them.

“Data center load growth appeared almost overnight, and the industry’s appreciation that VPPs could play an important role in that area has emerged even more recently than that,” said Hledik, who was not involved in Wood Mackenzie’s research.

Hledik said VPP providers, utilities and data center companies “are still gearing up to align on the right solutions,” but that work hasn’t significantly impacted overall VPP capacity yet.

“My hunch is that the growth over the next 12 to 18 months will be more noticeable, and over the next three to five years the growth could be explosive,” he said.

Hledik added that some individual VPP programs in states like California are rapidly adding capacity. He pointed to a Brattle Group report last month that showed California’s Demand Side Grid Support VPP discharged 539 MW of average output, or about half the output of a large nuclear reactor, on the evening of July 29. The report said DSGS could provide net system cost savings of between $28 million and $206 million through 2028.

The California legislature unexpectedly zeroed out funding for DSGS earlier this month. A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested the program is less important now amid a surge in new generation deployments.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4ZrlU_-atHM1ekQWXlKPXqq6QPJivnU6LUq-kXrqq8c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk1MzEwMzY3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 12:05:48.804519

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.

But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.

So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.

Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.

And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”

“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.

He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.

Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.

But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.

Currently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.

While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.

Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

They arrive in waves to ravaged areas ready to respond.

First in are the personnel trained to navigate the immediate crisis. Emergency managers run local shelters and coordinate on-the-ground response efforts, medics provide urgent medical care for those in need, and police, firefighters, and other public safety workers conduct search and rescue. Next, the skilled tradespeople show up, ready to restore and repair. Crews of utility linemen reconnect downed power lines, wastewater technicians fix damaged sewage infrastructure, and debris removal workers clear blocked roads and waterways.

Relief workers representing federal agencies, nonprofits, and humanitarian groups set up services to provide things like shelter, food, and water. And then there are crisis counselors, animal rescue units, hazmat crews, contractors, environmental scientists, and many others.

A legion of essential jobs contribute to America’s disaster workforce. As the world burns, floods, and melts around us, those jobs — and the people who do them — have never been more important.

Grist talked with more than a dozen people spread out across the United States who have worked on the ground following catastrophic disasters. We asked them to tell us about their jobs, why they do what they do, and what they’ve learned responding to extreme weather events.

Immediate Relief

Emergency manager

Last October, hours before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida, the Highlands County Emergency Management operations center was abuzz with tension. Staffers, first responders, and volunteers huddled around a large television broadcasting the weather radar. Their eyes were glued to the screen when tornado warnings blared on roughly 60 phones all at once.

The tornadoes were developing on the outer bands of the Category 4 storm, sending county emergency manager Corey Amundsen and his team into a mad dash. They raced to open last-minute shelters, conduct search and rescue operations, and warn community members to stay off roads. A total of 14 warnings were issued for the county; seven tornadoes touched down.

“We could actually see the debris balls from the tornadoes. I’ve got goose bumps now thinking about it,” said Amundsen. “We always hear tornadoes are possible in a hurricane,” but, he continued, “we weren’t expecting the amount of tornadoes. We actually had never seen that before.”

This hurricane season, Amundsen has implemented some new rules: His team is now mandated to begin ramping up operations at least 96 hours before a hurricane is expected to make landfall — up from 72 hours — to take into account the risk of pre-storm tornadoes. Amundsen has also since created step-by-step instructions on how to identify the safest locations for shelters amid tornado warnings and inform county residents where to go that’s out of the path of the storm.

“I’m one person,” he said. “When we go under a local state of emergency, I’m the guy who is supposed to have a plan for everything. I’m supposed to know everything, and I’m supposed to know what to do, how to do it, where to get it. It’s a lot of stress.” Amundsen has worked as an emergency manager for three years now, after seven years spent as a paramedic. “You have to be able to handle the worst possible stress you can without showing it to everyone else. If I look scared and I’m freaking out, then everyone is just going to follow suit, and then you’re going to have pure chaos.”

First responder and firefighter

In the nearly 40 years he’s been a volunteer firefighter in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, Chris Westveer has responded to every type of call imaginable. Fires, medical cases, hazmat incidents, car wrecks, floods. Westveer says the town’s volunteer-run fire station is “basically an all-hazards department.”

In all that time, though, nothing has ever come close to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene in 2024, which maintained remarkable force by the time it reached North Carolina. “We weren’t caught off guard by its arrival,” he said. “We were caught off guard by how bad it was.”

It was 1:30 a.m. when Westveer was first called in to respond. The historic storm was in the process of dumping more than 2 feet of rain on Spruce Pine, washing out roads, toppling trees, destroying homes and businesses, and cutting power and water service. For the next few days, the tiny mountain community was isolated from the outside world, and Westveer worked nonstop.

The bulk of that period was spent in rescue mode: He pulled people out of homes damaged by mudslides or trees, and helped paramedics save someone having a seizure during the storm. He then focused on trying to clear blocked roadways and beginning to assess the unbelievable damage. “There are literally hundreds of moments that will be, unfortunately, forever etched in my mind,” said Westveer. “Dealing with people that have either lost loved ones or lost their entire belongings, or houses gone — it was a complete gamut of emotions every day.”

The experience prompted Westveer’s department to make significant changes to how seriously it takes hurricane forecasts and how it responds in the storms’ aftermath. Before Helene, not even Westveer had an at-home hurricane preparedness plan. Now, everyone does, and his department has spent the last year investing in updated equipment and resources, including generators for the stations, as well as new brush trucks and four-wheel drive engines to expand their ability to respond. They’ve also supported other public safety departments in the Spruce Pine community that have hosted trainings on how to develop emergency evacuation plans, how to fortify homes and businesses, and what should go into disaster kits, among other things. Those plans are now ready to be put to the test this storm season.

“This year, we’re very vigilant,” he said. “I mean, every time I hear of a storm approaching, I’m watching the news.”

Emergency food worker

In the wake of the July 4 floods in Texas, no two days were the same for Samantha Elfmont. She works as the global response director for the nonprofit World Central Kitchen and arrived in Hunt, Texas, the day after the disaster struck. She immediately jumped into project management mode. She directed mobile units on what to do and where to go; connected with local food banks, chefs, and restaurants for supplies; and communicated with her teams around the world. She spent almost three weeks feeding communities in Hill Country after the floods.

Every morning, she rolled out of bed around 5 a.m. and immediately checked her phone to catch up on any messages she missed from colleagues based around the world during the few hours she was able to sleep.

When Elmont is deployed somewhere, her job is to coordinate whatever resources are needed to make sure people are fed. In Texas, that meant much of her time was spent communicating with vendors and local chefs and ordering thousands of meals that she and her team handed out everyday, all while traveling around the hardest-hit areas to hand out lunches and talk with survivors and first responders. “For me, it’s always that bigger picture: What is our transition plan? Have we worked with the community to see what else they need?” said Elfmont. They also distributed grocery store gift cards for survivors who lost their homes, community members who had lost jobs because their workplaces were destroyed, and volunteer first responders who hadn’t been paid.

As someone who has worked in the humanitarian aid sector for over a decade, Elfmont says her biggest takeaway is that “you just cannot predict anything.” And as the frequency of disasters escalates because of climate change, so does the need for food in moments of emergency. But in those moments, Elfmont said, “It doesn’t matter where it is in the world. What matters is when people need food, and they don’t have access to food.”

Wastewater systems mechanic

Cricket Logan has worked for the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, for 21 years as a wastewater management mechanic. Logan is almost always in motion — identifying where the problems are in his assigned section of the plant that cleans St. Pete’s water, removing debris from pipes using high-pressure fluids, and racing to weld makeshift replacements while figuring out the best possible plans for repairs. “Most of it is straightforward mechanical work,” he said.

Logan’s facility is the only wastewater treatment plant in the city that handles solids. If it goes down, the city’s sewage pipes back up. Logan said it “really doesn’t take near as long as you think” before that sewage begins spilling out into homes and streets.

That’s why, every storm season, Logan and his colleagues are on call before, during, and after hurricanes, while most other residents are hunkered down. Come June, Logan knows he needs to stash about a week’s worth of food and clothes in his locker in preparation. “It’s part of my job,” said Logan, “we’re considered ‘emergency essential.’”

Not much about working in hurricane response had ever rattled Logan — until Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the same stretch of St. Petersburg just weeks apart last fall. The night Helene touched down, Logan’s crew was instructed to leave. “For the first time I’m aware of, in probably 50, 60, 70 years, we shut down the entire plant completely and jumped in our work trucks and drove downtown [to shelter],” he said. “And then at three in the morning, they came in and said, ‘Get back out there.’” The hurricane was still raging on as he rushed back into work.

With the crew off duty, the wastewater systems had failed. Untreated sewage overflowed from dozens of manholes throughout the city and seeped into homes. Residents in some sections of the city were advised not to flush toilets or drain sinks for at least 48 hours after the storm to prevent more backups. “We’re really in a moment that nobody has seen,” he said.

Federal response worker

It was late September 2017, and Hurricane Maria had just lashed Puerto Rico, causing devastating damage to the archipelago, including its hospital infrastructure. As a member of the U.S. Disaster Medical Assistance Team, a subsidiary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Sue Anne Bell was deployed to San Juan, where she spent six weeks providing emergency medical care. Every night, she’d treat up to 80 patients in the tents of a field hospital.

Many patients just needed medication refills. Others needed help with physical injuries caused during the storm or cleanup. Then there was the treatment for conditions likely triggered by the trauma of the hurricane and limited food resources available, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

Underlying it all was resource strain. Three weeks after Maria roared through Puerto Rico’s main island, a young child and their mom showed up to Bell’s emergency center tent. The child was experiencing a serious asthma attack. Bell and her team didn’t have the facilities to help them. The few hospitals that hadn’t been damaged by the storm denied their requests to transfer the patient because they were under-resourced and understaffed. “I just remember thinking, ‘What will we do if this child’s condition worsens?’” she said.

Bell remembers spending 10 or so hours monitoring the child’s dangerously deteriorating condition in the tent, repeatedly calling hospital after hospital. Finally, they lucked out when one a few miles away agreed to take them.

It’s a situation Bell finds over and over in the field. In the wake of disasters, local hospitals and clinics are quickly overwhelmed. Issues like a lack of power or water send droves of patients to field hospitals that may lack adequate tools or resources to help people. “These other hospitals were saying, ‘We can’t safely care for this patient.’ We’re saying, ‘We can’t safely care for this patient,’” she said. “And so we had to work out, ‘Where can they get the best care they can? And how do we make that decision?’”

Medical specialist

After 35 years as a registered nurse and hospital manager in Sarasota, Florida, Mary Mitchell is no stranger to hurricane response and recovery. Mitchell has lived and worked through dozens of major storms, and in time, she developed a routine for when a hurricane approaches: Walk her team through the hospital’s disaster preparedness checklist, make sure everyone has a personal evacuation plan, prepare backup copies of patient medical records in case of power loss, and pack an overnight bag in case she needs to stay long-term at the hospital.

But when Hurricane Ian barreled through southwestern Florida on September 28, 2022, her regular disaster playbook was thrown out.

The morning after the Category 4 storm hit, killing at least 148 people, Mitchell drove to a disaster response zone assembling outside of a local hospital to handle the large number of patients needing medical care after the storm. She spent four days supporting the work being done in the mobile medical tent, figuring out care logistics, technical and operational necessities, and helping medical staff.

Mitchell vividly remembers seeing “dazed looks” on the faces of those who stopped by the tent for care. “They were pale, and you could tell they were exhausted,” she said. Many of them, mostly elderly, were covered in wounds inflicted by Ian. Others were visibly dehydrated. She couldn’t help but wonder if they had family there to help them, or if they had any neighbors or friends who were aware they had been hurt. “You’re hearing these stories. You’re seeing these patients,” said Mitchell. “Everybody was affected.”

Utility lineman

Zach Wood has worked as a lineman for about a decade, installing and repairing power lines for a number of utility companies across the country. The danger and physical risk is a big downside of the job, he said, but the demand and pay has been growing rapidly in recent years as the planet warms and climate disasters get worse. “The more intense and more frequent storms definitely work out well for linemen. We’re making more money every year that the weather gets crazier,” said Wood.

Last year, Wood took a new approach: He did what he calls “storm chasing.” He moved from job to job on short contracts based on the weather, showing up after everything from hurricanes to winter storms in more than seven states. The days were long and brutal — Wood worked 16-hour shifts on average. He dug holes, reset downed power lines, shimmied up poles, and cleared debris that had fallen on wires. “In a storm, the goal is to get everybody’s lights back on … as fast as we can,” he said. “But I’ve seen many people get hurt and injured because they are moving too fast.”

For someone like Wood, who gets paid more when the damage is worse, it’s easy to feel somewhat conflicted about the progression of climate change. “We know that hurricanes damage people’s lives and stuff, but it’s our livelihood,” he said. “So we’re sitting here, like, rooting for it to turn into a Category 5 and really tear some stuff up, because we’ll get two months of storm pay out of it, which sounds heartless and mean, but … it’s our paycheck. It’s like the funeral business.”

Rebuilding and Recovery

Debris removal crew

When Hurricane Helene tore through Asheville, North Carolina, last September, it dispersed millions of pounds of debris throughout one of the world’s oldest rivers. The French Broad River was “absolutely demolished,” said Jon Stamper — so much so that it prompted the local nonprofit MountainTrue to create his job as a post-Helene river cleanup coordinator.

“It’s really hard for me to describe the scale of the devastation here,” he said. Everything from trees to whole houses was swallowed up by the storm’s high-velocity floods. “It’s photos, it’s trophies, it’s Grandma’s plate set, it’s stuffed animals, it’s toys and playground equipment. I mean, it’s just anything that you could ever think of that existed somewhere in a town, in a home, in a community, or in a factory.”

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and private contractors removed most of the large-scale debris, like houses and cars, from the waterways they littered. That left the rest to local crews like Stamper’s.

On December 4, just a few days on the job, Stamper hosted his first organized cleanup of the watershed. With a donated SUV and a dump trailer, Stamper and 25 volunteers began the grueling work of clearing a sliver of French Broad River by hand. “There are islands on the river that have apartment-sized debris jams, logs, and intertwined PVC pipe that we’re actually out there cutting out,” said Stamper.

Since that first cleanup, his team has removed what Stamper estimates to be 800,000 pounds of debris. The job is a new direction for him: Stamper is a combat veteran of the war in Afghanistan and served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He says he “found his home on the river” after struggling upon returning from military service. His goal is now to protect those places. “This is really hard, tedious work, picking up trash,” he said. “It’s also emotionally taxing. We’re talking about picking up people’s lives. There is no playbook for this.”

Disaster response expert

Jorge Vera was a 34-year-old disaster specialist for the American Red Cross when Hurricane Andrew hit Florida on August 24, 1992. Within 48 hours, he was boarding a military airplane to Miami. When he landed, the scene took his breath away.

“It looked like a bomb had dropped,” he said. “Miami was literally devastated. All of the basic infrastructure in the community was gone. It was chaos.”

For Vera, the next three weeks were a blur. People needed food, medical attention, and a secure place to sleep. Vera’s job was to set up Red Cross shelters equipped to provide all of that and more.

“You have a plan A, plan B, plan C, and then try to sort out which is the better one at the time you respond,” he said. “There’s nothing romantic about it. There’s no room to kind of check yourself, or go, ‘Oh my God, what’s happening?’ Or, ‘What am I doing?’ It’s just go, go, go, go. There’s no time, whatsoever.”

While still working to respond to Andrew, Vera was hired to lead emergency services as a director for the Red Cross in Miami and the Florida Keys. Though he “fell” into the career, in part incentivized by the Red Cross’ tuition reimbursement program, which paid for him to go to college, he ended up working for the organization’s disaster response outfit for nearly a decade.

“The rhythm of the work, and the mission of the work … it appealed to my sense of service,” said Vera. “You find things out about humanity. The best and the worst comes out at times of disasters.”

As the planet warms, and disasters grow in frequency and severity, Vera sees the demand for this type of position growing, too. Back in the ‘90s, when he was responding to Andrew, climate change wasn’t being discussed in the world of disaster relief, he says. That’s no longer the case. “Climate change is changing everything, everything — the world as we know it,” he said. “We already see it.”

Crisis counselor

Priscilla Dass-Brailsford was just four years into her career as a trauma psychologist when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. The floodwaters hadn’t yet begun to recede when she got a call from someone at the Medical Reserve Corps asking if she would travel to Lafayette, Louisiana, to serve as a disaster mental health responder. She boarded a plane from D.C. and landed in a city entirely torn apart by the cataclysmic storm.

For two weeks, Dass-Brailsford helped run a triage mental health clinic in a football arena in Lafayette. She worked shifts at a folding table with a handwritten sign taped to it: “MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.” The line never seemed to end. Dass-Brailford consoled one person who heard from a neighbor that their missing father “had been seen on the dock with a tag on his toe.” She listened to children who just wanted to go home, but had nowhere to return to.

At night, Dass-Brailsford slept in one of the arena’s stadium box rooms alongside dozens of other volunteers.

Crisis counseling looks different for everyone, she said. With one grief-stricken 8-year-old girl, for instance, Dass-Brailsford’s session didn’t require much talking at all. They simply sat, side-by-side, coloring with crayons — a bubble of peace in a space otherwise marked by mayhem.

It wasn’t long before they attracted other kids, who asked if they could color, too. She told them to first ask the little girl if it was okay. “The child had lost all her sense of power. That’s what disasters do. They make you helpless,” said Dass-Brailsford. By the time they finished coloring, some 20 minutes or so later, the girl was beaming.

“People go through traumas and they get resilient,” she said. “Watching them come through something horrific and get to the other side, it gives me tremendous purpose.” A year later, Dass-Brailsford would help launch a mental health walk-in clinic in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. Katrina “had such an impact on me professionally and personally,” she said. She continues to work with disaster survivors in her private practice, and has since published journal articles and books about her experiences counseling in the aftermath of Katrina.

Hazmat manager

In the summer of 2022, the McKinney and Mill fires burned more than 64,000 acres in northern California over nearly two months. When the blazes were snuffed out, six people had been killed and more than 400 structures damaged.

In the months that followed, Shannon Vanella spent each work day outfitted in a hard hat, safety shoes, and other protective clothing, visiting every single parcel of burned land. When a property is incinerated, it leaves remnants of everything that once made that structure a home, from polyester furniture fabric to plastic tupperware to car batteries to solar panels. Vanella’s job with Siskiyou County’s waste management department is to make sure that she and her crew find all leftover hazardous debris and dispose of it correctly. They then test the soil for toxins.

Throughout the process, she’s the person who talks with property owners, gets them to sign the paperwork needed for waste removal, answers questions, and keeps them posted on the crew’s progress. She also produces technical reports documenting each inspection.

“We all have the right to live on clean ground and have clean water and air,” said Vanella. “I can at least make sure that there’s not any heavy metals in somebody’s soil and that the river they live beside isn’t getting runoff from all of the debris.”

Right after the McKinney and Mill fires, there was a local meeting to help fire victims understand available relief and recovery services. While Vanella was there, she ended up in conversation with an older man, who had worked as a firefighter before he retired. “He said, ‘I realize that the place I grew up in will never look the same in my lifetime, and I don’t know if I can live here anymore,’” she recalled. “Then he put his head down in his arm, and he just started sobbing. It was just all I could do to hold it together.” The experience informed how she has since handled communicating with the people in her line of work.

“Whenever you’re working with survivors like that … they don’t process information the same, and they don’t remember things that you’ve said to them,” she said. “You just have to be really patient and give them the time. It’s not the easiest thing to allow the government on your property to scrape up every belonging you ever had and throw it in a trash can.”

Animal rescue

On a Friday night in May 2007, a tornado with wind speeds over 200 miles per hour tore through Greensburg, Kansas. It was one of 22 that developed in the area in the span of five hours.

After seeing the devastation on the news the next morning, veterinarian Christen Skaer, who lived several hours away in Wichita, called the town’s animal control department and asked if it had a plan for affected animals. It didn’t, the person on the line told her, and the city could use all the help it could get, so Skaer sent out an unofficial SOS to her local network of vets and then hit the road.

What she found was appalling. “There were horses with [pieces of] two-by-fours sticking out of their sides. Cats with eyeballs hanging out. There were lots and lots of wounds,” said Skaer. First responders had simply been scooping up wandering dogs and cats and moving them out of the disaster zone. Some animals were literally dropped onto the other side of a fence, just to be moved out of the way.

So Skaer and her volunteer team improvised a response plan. Their top priority was to care for the animals in direst need and treat the ones they could.

Later, they began the onerous process of trying to reunite farm animals and pets with their owners. They posted announcements on social media and in local vet networks. Some people attempted to falsely claim animals — Skaer says this brand of “pet theft” unfortunately tends to happen after disaster events — and in the frenzy, she noted, many animals “just disappeared.” So they began asking for vet records and photos of the animal, and they tested whether animals responded to owners with familiarity.

In the end, they rescued 350 animals displaced from the tornado.

“It was a trial by fire,” said Skaer. But their experiences demonstrated the need for formalizing a disaster unit specifically for animals. Two such units were born after the 2007 tornadoes — the Sedgwick County Animal Response and the Kansas Animal Response Team. Skaer volunteers for both, and they still use much of the base response plan they cobbled together all those years ago.

Emergency Manager

By 6 a.m., the morning after Hurricane Helene, the severity of the storm’s damage in the region around Saluda County, South Carolina, prompted Josh Morton, the county’s emergency director, to pull all his emergency crews off of the road, with the exception of life safety missions. Thirty minutes later, two firefighters en route to respond to a structural fire were killed after multiple trees fell onto their truck. By 7 a.m., there wasn’t a single passable road left in the county.

He and his team knew it would be a long recovery process — clearing roads, opening additional shelters, distributing food, water, and fuel.

There was also the near-total loss of all communications technology. “The one thing we didn’t really have a good plan for was how to effectively go back 100 years and get information out without the use of the internet or cellphones,” Morton said.

In the year since the storm, he and his team have been making plans to be better prepared for the next one. They’ve been printing off pamphlets with information about where to get help, food, or shelter and pasting them on public buildings. Earlier this fall, they also applied for a federal hazard mitigation grant to set up physical communications hubs throughout Saluda County, though they won’t know the outcome of that until next year.“The idea is to have these established sites so that people know, ‘Hey, if there’s a disaster and I can’t get information, here’s where I can go get it,’” said Morton.

“We just want to make sure that never happens again.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/disaster-workforce-recovery-labor.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-22 16:06:20.628302

Among the most closely watched measures are proposals tied to billions of dollars in property tax cuts for both homeowners and businesses.

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature approved the package with a two-thirds majority, authorizing the amendments to appear before voters. The Legislature also passed the state’s two-year budget, which allocates $51 billion specifically for property tax relief.

The funding comes largely from recent budget surpluses, driven by inflation and temporary federal COVID-19 stimulus dollars. Lawmakers have increasingly turned to these surpluses in recent years to finance major tax relief efforts.

Supporters of the measures, including Governor Greg Abbott, argue the tax cuts will strengthen Texas’ reputation as a business-friendly, competitive state, encouraging investment and long-term economic growth. Abbott and other proponents also stress that lowering property tax burdens directly benefits homeowners while creating a more attractive environment for employers.

Voter approval is the final step in the process, and November’s outcome will determine whether these tax cuts and other amendments become part of the Texas Constitution. For Texans, the election represents not only a decision on property taxes, but also a broader choice about how the state leverages its surpluses and shapes its fiscal future.

On November 4, Texans will decide on 17 constitutional amendments, each presented as a statewide proposition. These amendments range from tax relief measures to funding priorities and constitutional clarifications.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): Funding for Texas State Technical College.

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): Ban on a state capital gains tax.

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): Bail reform.

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): Water infrastructure funding.

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): Tax exemption on animal feed.

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): Ban on a state securities tax.

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): Tax exemption for surviving spouses of veterans.

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): Ban on an inheritance tax.

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): Inventory and equipment tax exemption.

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): Property tax exemption for homes destroyed by fire.

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): School tax exemption for elderly or disabled homeowners.

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): Changes to the State Judicial Conduct Commission.

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): Increased school tax exemption for homeowners.

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): Funding for dementia research and prevention.

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): Codifying parental rights.

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): Clarifying citizenship requirement for voters.

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): Property tax exemption for border security infrastructure.

Together, these propositions reflect Texas lawmakers’ focus on property tax relief, infrastructure investments, and constitutional safeguards. Voter approval will determine whether these measures take effect.

What began as a routine enforcement operation has escalated into an international incident that threatens to disrupt domestic battery production timelines, strain the EV supply chain, and potentially reshape foreign investment in America's clean energy transition.

The raid's impact on US battery production

The Georgia facility—a cornerstone of US efforts to secure domestic EV supply chains—now faces significant delays. LG Energy Solution has announced that construction at the plant will remain on hold until the first half of 2026, setting back production by several months and potentially impacting automakers counting on battery deliveries to meet their EV production targets.

Hyundai Motor Chief Executive José Muñoz confirmed the disruption would delay the battery plant's opening by at least two to three months. The facility was set to be a key component of Hyundai's $12.6 billion investment in Georgia, with plans to produce batteries for up to 500,000 hybrid and electric vehicles across the company's portfolio of brands.

""The South Korean workers that were deported were specialized workers in the joint venture battery plant,"" Muñoz told reporters on September 18. ""The company has had to move workers from other plants to make up for the lost labor.""

The raid: Emerging details

On September 4, approximately 400 state and federal law enforcement personnel descended on the Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction in Georgia. The operation resulted in the detention of 475 workers, including more than 300 South Korean nationals. According to the search warrant obtained by the Savannah Morning News, the raid initially targeted just four Mexican nationals as ""targeted persons,"" as reported by Forbes.

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney representing 11 individuals arrested in the raid, noted that ICE agents did not bring Korean language interpreters—suggesting the South Koreans were not the intended targets. Nevertheless, agents decided on-site to arrest all South Korean workers after determining they had entered on B-1 visas or through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).

""One of Kuck's South Korean clients had just arrived the night before and was sitting in a conference room in a business suit, attending a meeting, when arrested by ICE,"" Stuart Anderson wrote in Forbes.The Miller quota connection

Multiple sources point to a White House-imposed arrest quota as the driving force behind the mass detention. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, had publicly stated a goal of 3,000 immigrant arrests per day—a dramatic increase from the previous average of about 660 arrests daily.

""The arrest of the South Koreans was entirely driven by Stephen Miller's arrest quota,"" Kuck told Forbes. ""ICE agents screwed up by arresting people who did not abuse the visa, were eligible to engage in the type of work for which they were admitted, but ICE considered it a successful operation because they met Miller's quota.""

NBC News confirmed that ""The raid was part of a broader deportation drive by the Trump administration, which the White House has described as central to fulfilling U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, has pushed for 3,000 arrests a day.""

Diplomatic fallout

In response to the growing diplomatic crisis, the Trump administration has engaged in damage control. Christopher Landau, a top US diplomat, expressed regret over the immigration raid during meetings with South Korean counterparts, promising that South Korean workers would face no disadvantages in reentering the US and that Washington would work to prevent similar incidents, according to Dylan Butts of NBC News.

The raid has severely strained US-South Korean relations. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called the incident ""bewildering"" and an ""unjust infringement on the activities of our people,"" warning it could discourage future investment in the United States, as reported by both NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.

South Korean media reaction was particularly harsh. Paul Krugman, in his Substack newsletter, cited one South Korean editorial that declared: ""The sight of our workers being led out in chains resembles images of African slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries being dragged out by their owners.""

Investment uncertainty for the battery sector

The raid has raised serious questions about future foreign investment in U.S. battery manufacturing. Charles Kuck told Forbes, ""The ICE raid in Georgia is going to have a massive economic impact. Other attorneys and I are hearing from companies in Asia and Europe who say, 'Maybe we should hold off on big investments in the U.S. for at least three years.'""

This concern directly contradicts the bipartisan goal of building a robust domestic battery supply chain. Many South Korean tech giants, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, have been investing billions into facilities in the US as part of reshoring efforts. The raid could potentially slow this momentum at a critical time for the US battery industry.

Despite these concerns, Hyundai on September 19 confirmed it is moving forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, committing $2.7 billion and 3,000 new jobs to phase two of the complex. This recommitment suggests the company is working to maintain its US investment strategy despite the setback.

Visa challenges exposed for the battery tech sector

The incident has highlighted longstanding challenges with U.S. visa policies for skilled foreign workers in the battery technology sector. Currently, the US allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in ""specialty occupations"" under its H-1B visa program; however, the system is highly selective due to an annual cap and a lottery system, as explained by NBC News.

Matters became more complicated on Friday, Sept. 19, when President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee for H1-B visas granted to skilled foreign workers, leading to what the New York Times termed “a weekend of chaos,” as businesses hurried to try and bring their H-1B-issued employees who were out of the country back to the US before the new rules kicked in on Sunday. On Saturday, the Trump administration announced that the new fee would only be applied to new H-1B applicants.

South Korean President Lee has urged the U.S. ""to normalize the visa process related to investment, whether by securing sufficient visa quotas or by creating a new category of visa,"" according to Forbes.

LGES North America President and Chief Strategy Officer Bob Lee noted that difficulty obtaining visas has long been a challenge for companies like his. ""That was something many people understood, but now, after this crisis, the fact that we're placing attention on it will be a very good thing,"" he said to the Wall Street Journal.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp suggested that the raid may ultimately lead to improvements in the visa system. He told reporters on September 17 that the incident might ""wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States.""

Implications for the US battery industry

As the US works to establish itself as a major player in global battery production, incidents like the Georgia raid highlight the complex interplay between immigration policy, international relations, and industrial development. For the battery technology sector, several key questions remain:

As the situation continues to unfold, the long-term impact on US-South Korean relations and foreign investment in American battery manufacturing remains to be seen. What is clear is that the raid has exposed significant tensions between aggressive immigration enforcement policies and America's battery technology development goals, creating a complex challenge for the industry on both sides of the Pacific.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt9e22d2ca52b3eca2/68d155927e504efa32d78e54/Korea-ICE-raid-protest-2234262981.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-22 13:05:45.651585

“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”

“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.

Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.

The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.

“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”

The demand for rare earth elements specifically from EV motors reached an impressive 37 kilotons in 2024. This figure is projected to accelerate further, climbing to 43 kilotons in 2025. The scale of production is immense, with the total number of EV motors produced in 2024 reaching 22.9 million units. A significant forecast sees this number growing to 28.1 million units in 2025, highlighting the sector's explosive growth.

The dominant motor technology, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs), accounted for 19.7 million of these units in 2024 in the permanent magnet market. The adoption of PMSMs is set to continue its upward trend, with an expected 24.1 million units in 2025. Leading the charge, Tesla's production of EVs surpassed 2.1 million units in 2024. In the same year, competitor BYD’s production exceeded 3 million EV units, with both automakers relying heavily on rare earth magnets for their powertrain efficiency and performance.

Renewable Energy Transition Fuels Unprecedented Growth in Magnet Consumption

The global pursuit of clean energy solutions is creating substantial demand for the permanent magnet market, particularly from the wind energy sector. Large permanent magnets are essential for the efficiency of direct-drive wind turbines. China’s commitment to wind power is evident, with its new installations in 2024 totaling a massive 80.45 gigawatts. Forecasts for 2025 anticipate a continued expansion, with 87 gigawatts of new installations planned. This translates directly into significant magnet consumption.

The demand for Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets from China's wind sector alone stood at 9,735 metric tons in 2024, illustrating the sector's material-intensive nature. Technological advancements are also pushing demand boundaries. In a significant development, Siemens Gamesa launched a new offshore wind turbine model in 2024. This powerful turbine has a 15 MW capacity and relies on high-performance neodymium magnets, setting a new benchmark for the industry and reinforcing the link between renewable energy goals and the Permanent magnet market.

Automation and Advanced Electronics Drive Widespread Miniaturized Magnet Demand

High-performance magnets in the permanent magnet market are the invisible engines powering modern industrial automation, robotics, and consumer electronics. In manufacturing, it is projected that China's industrial robot production will reach an incredible 941,000 units in 2025. These machines depend on magnetic sensors for precise position feedback and magnetic encoders for accurate motion control. Furthermore, magnetic grippers are employed by robotic arms in automated warehouses, and magnetic levitation systems are revolutionizing automated conveyors by eliminating friction.

In the consumer sphere, the trend of miniaturization ensures consistent demand. Global smartphone shipments reached nearly 1.3 billion units in 2024, with each device containing multiple tiny magnets. The demand for NdFeB magnets from mobile phone production is expected to reach 3,698 metric tons in 2025 across the global permanent magnet market, with production projected at 1.85 billion units. In 2024, air conditioner production, another major consumer, hit 270 million units, creating a demand for 21,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnets. Permanent magnets are now integral to a vast range of devices, including tablets, earbuds, VR headsets, and wireless chargers.

Western Manufacturing Expansion Projects Intend to Diversify Global Supply Chains

In a strategic response to supply chain vulnerabilities, significant investments are being made to establish magnet manufacturing capabilities outside of Asia permanent magnet market. Neo Performance Materials' facility in Estonia is a key project, set to begin commercial production in 2025 with an initial capacity of 2,000 tons per year of NdFeB magnet blocks. A planned second phase aims to increase this capacity to 5,000 tons per year. GKN Powder Metallurgy is also making ambitious moves, planning to establish a total capacity of 4,000 tons per year of rare earth magnets across Europe and North America, with a pilot plant in Germany scheduled to be operational in early 2025.

The United States is a focal point of this diversification. The U.S. Department of Defense has invested heavily, awarding over $439 million since 2020 to establish domestic rare earth supply chains. Key projects include MP Materials' plant in Fort Worth, Texas, which will have a first-phase production capacity of 1,000 tons per year. In parallel, E-VAC Magnetics is establishing a commercial-scale rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in South Carolina, aiming to be fully operational by 2025, significantly boosting the resilience of the North American permanent magnet market.

Circular Economy Initiatives Emerge as a Critical and Viable Solution

Magnet recycling is rapidly transitioning from a niche concept to a critical component of a sustainable supply chain, mitigating raw material risks. HyProMag USA is at the forefront of this movement, aiming to capture 10% of the U.S. domestic NdFeB magnet demand within five years, starting from 2025. Its Texas Hub facility has an ambitious target for annual production, including 750 metric tons of recycled sintered NdFeB magnets and 807 metric tons per annum of associated NdFeB co-products.

The total payable capacity of the HyProMag facility will reach 1,557 metric tons of NdFeB annually. The financial viability is compelling, with an incremental capital cost of approximately US$7 million for the facility's expansion. Highlighting its environmental benefits, a carbon footprint study in March 2025 confirmed a remarkably low CO2 footprint of just 2.35 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of its recycled NdFeB product, showcasing a sustainable path forward for the Permanent magnet market.

Defense and Aerospace Applications Underscore Magnets’ Immense Strategic Importance

The strategic value of permanent magnets is nowhere more apparent than in their critical role within advanced defense systems. The material requirements are substantial: each Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyer requires 5,200 pounds of rare earth elements. A single Virginia-class submarine needs an even greater amount at 9,200 pounds of these materials. Furthermore, the technologically sophisticated F-35 aircraft requires more than 900 pounds of rare earth elements for its complex systems to function in the permanent magnet market.

Recognizing this dependency, the U.S. Department of Defense has set a clear goal: to have a sustainable, mine-to-magnet supply chain capable of supporting all U.S. defense requirements by 2027. To achieve this, targeted funding has been deployed. As of March 2024, the DOD had awarded $28.8 million to Noveon Magnetics for a facility in Texas. Other awards include $2.3 million to TDA Magnetics to produce qualified magnets and a substantial $94.1 million award to E-VAC Magnetics to establish commercial-scale magnet manufacturing by 2025.

Innovation and Policy Are Actively Shaping the Future Market Trajectory

The future of the Permanent magnet market is being actively shaped by technological breakthroughs and supportive government policies. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a significant advance in iron-nitride (Fe-N) based permanent magnets, presenting a potential rare-earth-free alternative. The pace of innovation is reflected in intellectual property, with a patent for an iron-rich permanent magnet issued on January 15, 2024, and another granted to Hangzhou Magmax Technology on September 17, 2024, for a novel demagnetization identification method.

Simultaneously, the permanent magnet market is exploring alternatives, evidenced by Valeo and MAHLE launching a magnet-free electric motor in 2024, signaling a potential long-term technological diversification. Policy is also a powerful catalyst. A U.S. bill introduced in February 2025, the Rare Earth Magnet Security Act (REMSA), proposes a production tax credit of $20 per kilogram for magnets manufactured in the United States. This incentive powerfully increases to $30 per kilogram if the component rare earth material is also sourced or recycled domestically.

Two CSU students co-founded a startup called Envirofit International that has evolved into a global leader in designing and manufacturing clean cookstoves and other technologies that enable clean energy access in the developing world.

These technologies help solve critical human health and environmental problems.

Company innovations include both cooking technologies and business models that help make products and services accessible to users.

How do you go from building clean snowmobiles in a campus lab to manufacturing clean cookstoves that help millions of people worldwide?

Ask Tim Bauer and Nathan Lorenz.

The two entrepreneurs started their work as Colorado State University students and rose from the tech transfer ecosystem to deliver 2.5 million clean cookstoves that benefit an estimated 12 million people living in low-income households around the globe, most in Africa and India.

Their 22-year-old social enterprise, Envirofit International, is based in Fort Collins and has grown into a global leader in the design, development and delivery of high-performing clean energy cookstoves that combat toxic indoor air pollution, save lives and reduce carbon emissions across the developing world.

“I could not have imagined, when we were wrenching on snowmobile engines, that we would end up here,” said Lorenz, Envirofit’s chief technology officer. “What we’re doing now has global impact.”

Envirofit’s global reach, especially into the developing world, is unique and notable, said Richard Magid, vice president of technology transfer at CSU STRATA, the university’s tech transfer organization.

“To achieve that impact, they’ve paired technical innovation with incredibly innovative business and financing operations,” Magid said. “Because traditional venture financing won’t generally support social enterprises like Envirofit, they’ve worked with foundations and impact investors to raise capital, as well as being on the cutting edge of carbon credits.”

In 2002, Bauer and Lorenz were undergraduates in mechanical engineering and, as part of a senior capstone, entered a national competition to build cleaner snowmobiles, which are notorious for spewing pollutants from standard two-stroke engines. Working at what is now the Powerhouse Energy Campus, Bauer and Lorenz developed a retrofitting kit to convert a two-stroke carbureted snowmobile engine into one with direct in-cylinder fuel injection – leading to increased engine efficiency and lower emissions. In fact, they built the cleanest snowmobile engine on record at the time.

With that win, Bauer and Lorenz realized that developing nations – teeming with vehicles with two-stroke engines – represented the biggest market for their invention.

So, in 2003, as they were entering graduate studies in mechanical engineering at CSU, the students co-founded a nonprofit startup called Envirofit International with two of their professors, Bryan Willson in mechanical engineering and Paul Hudnut in business. The group explored commercialization of the engine retrofitting kit and even secured initial funding from the Bohemian Foundation, a Fort Collins family foundation.

They might have continued down that path. But other work at the Powerhouse Energy Campus focused on reducing emissions from smoky cookstoves, and the charitable Shell Foundation suggested a partnership to accelerate this cookstove work. Soon, Envirofit added cookstoves to its product portfolio and formed a long-term alliance with the Shell Foundation. The cookstove business overtook the two-stroke business.

Then, in 2012, Envirofit transitioned to a for-profit social benefit corporation and went on to raise multiple rounds of equity and debt financing to enable scale-up.

Backed by investor partnerships, Envirofit tackled a critical problem: An estimated 2.1 billion people worldwide – a quarter of the globe’s population – cook with open fires and inefficient stoves, most often using solid fuels, such as wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and livestock dung, according to the World Health Organization. Many live in poverty in rural parts of the developing world.

Each year, 3.7 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributed to household air pollution caused by incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking. Particulate matter and other pollutants lead to fatal heart disease, stroke, respiratory infection, pulmonary disease and lung cancer, which disproportionately affect women and children who spend more time in noxious home environments, WHO reports.

Meantime, household air pollution is a major contributor to outdoor air pollution – notably, carbon emissions that drive climate change.

To help solve these problems, the Envirofit team developed a line of cookstoves that use wood, charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas, a mix of propane and butane, as fuel. These stoves use less fuel, reduce toxic emissions and cook food quicker than traditional models.

Cost savings on fuel combined with subsidized pricing – largely possible with carbon market strategies – are key factors allowing families to afford the cookstoves, said Bauer, Envirofit president and chief operating officer. Many people in the company’s target market live in energy poverty, spending perhaps 30% of their household incomes on fuel. That has prompted Envirofit to focus much of its business planning on energy access.

“What we’ve really developed is the business model to get these products into people’s lives,” Bauer said. “The key challenge to scale-up is not the product development but rather the business model to enable it.”

Central to its business planning was Envirofit’s move to deal in high-quality carbon credits, which is possible because of significant emissions savings with the company’s products. This allows the company to provide products at a 50% subsidy, which improves affordability and adoption.

Meantime, Envirofit has grown to about 60 employees, has several international offices and is in its fifth consecutive year of profitability.

The company’s goal is to help move people up the “energy ladder” – from using less efficient and higher emitting technologies to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. That means moving from solid fuels to liquefied petroleum gas, a switch that yields benefits for households and the climate alike.

Envirofit has developed a trademarked SmartGas technology to meet that goal: Customers receive cylinders of liquefied petroleum gas and, with a unique valve system, use their smartphones to pay incrementally for daily fuel needs. The “pay-as-you-cook” model keeps costs affordable for customers who cannot buy entire tanks of fuel.

These days, Envirofit is looking ahead to new ways it can provide clean energy access beyond designing and manufacturing cookstoves. As Bauer put it: “We are an energy technology company creating scalable, climate-smart solutions for emerging markets.”

The company has been honored for its solutions. For instance, the Economist, a British news journal, named Envirofit’s founders its 2013 Energy and Environment Innovators.

Willson, a company co-founder, is executive director of CSU’s Energy Institute, which is housed at the Powerhouse Energy Campus – Envirofit’s incubation grounds.

“We have this mantra of science to solutions to scale, and Envirofit embodies that goal,” said Willson, who is also a member of the company’s board of directors. “Envirofit has a unique ability to improve the lives of millions of people, and that’s really cool.”",https://source.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Envirofit-SmartGas_Customer3.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 14:01:17.678751

We Energies earned an F grade at a score of 6 percent in this year’s report.
This is the worst grade We Energies has earned since the Dirty Truth Report began in 2021.
“It is alarming that for the first time since 2021, utilities are regressing on their clean energy transition,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender.
As energy costs rise and extreme weather becomes more frequent, now is the time to phase out polluting, volatile, expensive fossil fuels and invest in stable, reliable, and affordable, clean energy.” ###","MILWAUKEE, Wis. – Today, the Sierra Club released its annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This report shows that—despite their promises—We Energies is still overwhelmingly not planning for the clean energy transition and millions of Americans are facing the consequences of a grid powered by polluting fossil fuels. At the same time, electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

We Energies earned an F grade at a score of 6 percent in this year’s report. This is the worst grade We Energies has earned since the Dirty Truth Report began in 2021. WEC Energy Group, We Energies’ parent company, also earned an F grade this year.

“I would be embarrassed if I brought home an ‘F’ on my report card year after year. But We Energies has no shame; they’ve continued to put corporate profits ahead of people, sticking customers with higher utility bills and greater air pollution by building new gas and delaying the Oak Creek coal plant closure time and again,” said Jadine Sonoda, Campaign Coordinator, Sierra Club Wisconsin.

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress–if any–the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

“It is alarming that for the first time since 2021, utilities are regressing on their clean energy transition,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender. “By adding more gas and keeping costly coal plants online, utility companies are ignoring renewable energy—the cheapest form of energy—and forcing their customers to pay more.

Purchasing a new car is often the second most expensive purchase many Americans make. President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) offers new benefits to prospective car buyers that might entice some to buy a car.

However, personal finance expert Suze Orman warned in a recent article on her website of the dangers of using the new benefits to justify an unplanned purchase. Here’s why Orman believes the tax law changes aren’t a license to drive off with a new set of wheels.

Also see the best and worst days of the week to buy a car.

What Are the New Tax Changes?

The OBBBA provides three key tax changes relative to car buying. According to the IRS, one key change is a temporary tax deduction of interest on car loans through 2028. The maximum annual deduction is $10,000, and it phases out with modified adjusted gross income surpassing $100,000 for individuals ($200,000 for joint filers) annually.

Orman also noted two other changes, aimed at ending clean energy credits. Those include ending the federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle (EV) and ending the $1,000 maximum credit on the installation of an at-home EV charging station. The credits now expire on Sept. 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026, respectively.

As with most taxes, there are various carve-outs that may make qualifying for deductions or credits difficult to obtain.

Orman cautioned about what Americans might see as a result of these tax changes. “By the time you read this, I expect we may already be pummeled with advertisements touting the tax breaks if you buy now. Car lots will have plenty of signs touting cars made in America,” Orman said.

Why Benefits Aren’t a Reason To Purchase a New Car

The average cost of a new car is over $49,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, and tariffs may drive prices higher. Deductions or rebates may entice Americans to rush out to purchase a new car.

“A tax break is not a reason to make such a big investment. If you absolutely need a new car, then yes, taking these new car-related tax rules into account makes sense. But what I have no patience for is you using these rules as a rationalization to buy a new car,” Orman said.

Instead, Orman advised driving your car until it’s no longer reliable and focus on setting aside money in a savings account to purchase a car in the future.

Following recommended maintenance protocols is the best way to keep your current car reliable. Failing to do this and rushing to take on a car loan can have significant consequences not only for your budget but also for your long-term goals.

When Should You Buy a Car?

Although tax benefits could be good, they aren’t the only thing that should drive you to purchase a new car. A purchase should occur at the right time for your finances.

“If you truly need a car, I have no problem with that. But your goal should be to buy the least expensive car possible, finance it for the shortest time possible, and then drive it for as long as possible,” Orman said in a different article.

Ideally, you should have a minimum down payment of 20%. Furthermore, your total monthly transportation costs likely shouldn’t exceed 15% of your budget. It’s also wise to have an emergency fund before purchase. If you can reach or exceed these numbers and your car is no longer reliable, it becomes more feasible to justify the purchase.

Tax changes that benefit you can be beneficial. However, using them as justification to make an unplanned, expensive purchase can have serious ramifications. Review your finances thoroughly before jumping into action.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suze-Orman-shutterstock-editorial-BLU_A104812.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 15:02:48.021320

The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion.

The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey.

The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water.

“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release.

Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed.

She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard.
Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers.
“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said.
Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.” “Everyone breathing in California depends on it,” he said.","The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles President Donald Trump's administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I've worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I'm ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph's air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn't have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She's always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There's not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration's attacks on all of California's efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California's authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, speaks during an EVgo fast charging station launch event at El Mercado Plaza Shopping Center in Union City on Sept. 25, 2023. The event highlighted California achieving its goal of installing 10,000 direct current fast chargers for electric vehicles. Photo by Loren Elliott for CalMatters Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what's working — and what's not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that's not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state's top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board's recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 21

Final Rules: 62

2025 Total Pages: 45,217

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$77.1 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$626.6 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week – by a wide margin – was the EPA proposal on “Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.” The proposed rules specifically seeks:

To amend the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the distribution segment of the petroleum and natural gas systems source category (subpart W—Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems), and suspend program obligations for the remaining subpart W segments until reporting year 2034.

The agency estimates that eliminating these reporting requirements will cut 2.6 million hours of paperwork and $303 million in associated costs each year from 2025 through 2033. When discounted out under a 7-percent rate across a 10-year horizon, EPA finds that the total net present value comes out to roughly $2 billion in cost reductions.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

There wasn’t much in the way of major regulatory policy announcements from the White House, but there were some interesting developments on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front. First, on Tuesday, the Senate voted down the motion to proceed on S.J. Res 60, a resolution introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) seeking to repeal a Trump Administration rule. This marked the first formal legislative action on a CRA resolution introduced by a Democratic lawmaker this term.

There was also another batch of CRA resolutions introduced across both chambers and parties. H.J. Res 123 was yet another resolution of disapproval introduced by a Democratic representative directly addressing a Trump-era rule. There were, however, some others with more unique circumstances. H.J. Res 125 (and its Senate companion S.J. Res 82) would repeal a March 2025 Trump-era rule that originally seemed as though it might fall outside the purview of CRA consideration. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the Act did apply, however. GAO’s determination also factored into the introduction of H.J. Res 124/S.J. Res 80, a pair of resolutions addressing a Department of Interior “Record of Decision” (ROD) from 2022. Despite a years-long gap since the ROD came down and the fact that it was not a typical rulemaking document, a more recent review by GAO led to the determination that “it meets the definition of a rule under APA [Administrative Procedure Act] and no CRA exception applies.”

The American Action Forum (AAF) CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 61 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

One of the benefits to purchasing a new electric vehicle (EV) — in addition to the reduced environmental impact, as well as cost savings due to not spending on gas — is the EV tax credit.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was passed in 2022, this measure provides up to $7,500 in applicable tax credit with the purchase of a qualifying new EV, as a means to incentivize car shoppers into buying an environmentally-friendly EV instead of a gas-powered internal-combustion vehicle.

Find out below when the EV tax credit expires and how to get the tax credit.

What Is Happening to the $7,500 Credit?

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA essentially set the economic agenda for Trump’s second administration by extending a number of tax cuts from his first administration, as well as cutting funding to several programs such as Medicaid and the EV tax credit.

As a result of the OBBBA, the $7,500 EV tax credit will now expire on Sept. 30.

How Can You Still Get the $7,500 Tax Credit?

Following the OBBBA’s passing, auto manufacturers initially assumed that car buyers would have to sign a purchase contract, make a down payment and physically receive their new EV by or before Sept. 30 in order to receive the credit.

However, the IRS has created something of a loophole in the credit’s expiration, per Yahoo Finance. “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” according to the IRS.

In short: As long as an EV buyer signs a purchase contract and pays a deposit (or the full purchase amount) by or before Sept. 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

What does this mean for you?

Monkey Island LNG, the company behind the forthcoming eponymous LNG liquefaction facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, has awarded McDermott a master services agreement to provide front-end engineering and planning services on the project, according to a Sept. 8 news release.

Monkey Island LNG plans to invest $25 billion into the facility across two phases, which makes it one of the largest developments of its kind in North America, said Greg Michaels, founder and CEO of Monkey Island LNG, in the release.

“By leveraging LNG mega-modules, we dramatically reduce the site footprint required for world-scale LNG production, which drives down project costs and risks,” said Michaels.

The companies did not disclose the contract value of the MSA.

McDermott, headquartered in Houston, will provide engineering, execution planning and pricing for the facility’s engineering, procurement and construction phase, according to the release. Next, Monkey Island will issue a final EPC contract aligned with the timing of Monkey Island LNG’s financing activities.

Phase 1 of the Monkey Island LNG facility will include three LNG trains with a capacity of 5.2 million metric tons per annum each and a combined production of 15.6 MTPA, according to the release. Future expansion plans include two more trains that would bring the plant’s total capacity to 26 MTPA.

McDermott, which generated $8.9 billion in revenue in 2024 and was the ninth largest builder in the U.S. by that metric, will flex its modular LNG train design on the job. Rob Shaul, senior vice president of low carbon solutions at McDermott, echoed the sentiment.

“This award underscores the depth of expertise of McDermott in LNG and modular design,” Shaul said. “Our integrated delivery model—including self-perform construction and a global network of McDermott-owned fabrication yards—positions us to deliver a solution that maximizes value while minimizing risk.”

Officials expect engineering and permitting to begin in 2026 with the first LNG production slated for the early 2030s, per the release. The project will be led by McDermott’s Houston team, supported by its engineering group in Gurugram, India.

McDermott isn’t the only firm that’s capitalizing on growth in the LNG space — Bechtel, based in Reston, Virginia, got the green light to proceed on the $6.7 billion Train 4 at Rio Grande LNG in Brownsville, Texas, earlier this month.

For more than a decade, these incentives have played a central role in artificially propping up EV sales, coaxing buyers toward electric cars with taxpayer-funded subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phased them out, and the marketplace is preparing for a major shift. Let the free market be just that, free. Buyers should buy what they want, and not what the states or the federal government want.

For buyers, the deadline creates a clear choice: purchase an electric vehicle now and secure the last available credits, or wait and face a market where EVs must compete without federal assistance. For dealers and automakers, the end of this program marks the beginning of a new chapter in how vehicles are marketed, priced, and sold in the United States. This is actually good news for everyone.

The EV tax credit was originally introduced to jumpstart demand for electric vehicles and help manufacturers reach economies of scale, and entice car buyers to consider an electric vehicle. Automakers like Tesla, GM, and Nissan were among the first to benefit, as subsidies encouraged early adopters to experiment with new technology. Over time, the credit became a standard talking point for dealerships and a cornerstone of federal and some state government policies aimed at accelerating the transition to EVs and the goal of eliminating gas and diesel-powered vehicles.

But the credits also sparked controversy. Critics argued they disproportionately benefited wealthier households, who were more likely to afford EVs even without subsidies, and actually be able to take advantage of the tax credit. Many Americans pointed out that taxpayers who never purchased an EV were footing the bill for those who did. By 2024, as EV sales slowed despite the ongoing credit, questions grew louder about whether the program was delivering meaningful results.

Under the OBBBA, the federal EV tax credit ends September 30, 2025. After that date, buyers will no longer be able to claim the tax credit of up to $7,500 on new EVs, $4,000 on used ones, or the $1,000 credit for a home charger. This change eliminates the point-of-sale rebates that dealers have leaned on heavily to close EV deals.

The immediate impact is urgency. Dealers are moving quickly to advertise “last chance” opportunities for buyers to lock in the tax credit. Automakers with qualifying models are pushing aggressive campaigns to clear inventory before the deadline. Dealers fear they will be stuck with a fleet of electric cars and minimal sales. Buyers who act now could save thousands, but once October arrives, those savings vanish.

Without federal support, the EV market faces a test. Will demand hold steady, or will sales cool once the financial incentive disappears? Industry analysts are divided. What’s my analysis? I see a sharp decline in EV adoption, especially among cost-conscious buyers. I expect the demand to be below a 4% purchase rate in the US. Others believe the market will gradually stabilize as more affordable EV models reach production and as states continue offering their own incentives. The issue is battery costs, increased insurance rates and huge price escalation in electricity prices.

Dealers are preparing for the possibility that EV sales will slow way down. Many are already shifting focus to hybrids and traditional gas-powered vehicles, which remain central to American driving habits. There is another way to save some money for new car buyers, an auto loan interest deduction under the OBBBA, available for U.S.-assembled vehicles of all types, have become a more important sales tool than the expiring EV credit.

One overlooked consequence of the EV credit’s end is its impact on manufacturing strategy. Automakers have spent years aligning production to maximize eligibility, ensuring that vehicles meet North American assembly requirements to qualify for the credit. With that incentive gone, companies will have greater flexibility in where and how they produce EVs. Car companies took massive losses on every vehicle they sold. For lost $40,000 on every Lightning truck, other brands took equal losses. This is not the way to do business. It caused car makers to increase costs on all their vehicles making it harder for many to afford a new car.

At the same time, the OBBBA’s focus on U.S.-assembled vehicles for loan interest deductions keeps domestic manufacturing in the spotlight. Buyers financing new American-assembled cars (whether electric, hybrid, or gas-powered), stand to gain valuable tax savings even after September 30. In effect, the policy is shifting the incentive away from what type of vehicle you buy, and toward where it is built.

For consumers, timing matters. Buyers who are serious about purchasing an EV should act before the deadline to capture the last available credit. However, it’s equally important to evaluate whether the vehicle makes financial sense in the long term without subsidies. Factors such as charging infrastructure, battery replacement costs, and resale value remain significant considerations. Resale value on used electric cars is not good.

Some households may find greater value in waiting. As the market adjusts, automakers may respond with price cuts, new financing options, or incentives of their own to sustain demand. Dealers will be very motivated to move EVs off lots if inventory slows, potentially creating better deals. Leasing would be your smartest move at that point.

The phase-out of EV tax credits is more than a budgetary or political change. It’s a signal of a broader shift in bipartisan policy. For years, Washington used subsidies to push the auto market toward electrification. If they failed to meet the numbers they were fined billion of dollars. Now, the emphasis is moving toward empowering buyers with broader tax relief, such as the new loan interest deduction, while reducing federal dependency on technology-specific incentives.

Whether this results in a more balanced marketplace or a setback for EV adoption remains to be seen. What is certain is that the market will now have to stand on its own. Automakers that can deliver reliable, affordable vehicles that do not rely on subsidies and can produce what consumers want.

September 30 is a clear turning point. For buyers, it is the last chance to claim thousands of dollars in federal support for an EV purchase. For automakers and dealers, it is the end of a crutch that has shaped sales strategies for over a decade. And for the broader economy, it marks the beginning of a new approach – one that rewards American manufacturers and consumer choice rather than federal pressure for a single technology or type of propulsion.

Can the EV market maintain momentum without subsidies, especially in North America? What is for certain, we have a big win for customer choice.

However, personal finance expert Suze Orman warned in a recent article on her website of the dangers of using the new benefits to justify an unplanned purchase. Here’s why Orman believes the tax law changes aren’t a license to drive off with a new set of wheels.

Also see the best and worst days of the week to buy a car.

What Are the New Tax Changes?

The OBBBA provides three key tax changes relative to car buying. According to the IRS, one key change is a temporary tax deduction of interest on car loans through 2028. The maximum annual deduction is $10,000, and it phases out with modified adjusted gross income surpassing $100,000 for individuals ($200,000 for joint filers) annually.

Orman also noted two other changes, aimed at ending clean energy credits. Those include ending the federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle (EV) and ending the $1,000 maximum credit on the installation of an at-home EV charging station. The credits now expire on Sept. 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026, respectively.

As with most taxes, there are various carve-outs that may make qualifying for deductions or credits difficult to obtain.

Orman cautioned about what Americans might see as a result of these tax changes. “By the time you read this, I expect we may already be pummeled with advertisements touting the tax breaks if you buy now. Car lots will have plenty of signs touting cars made in America,” Orman said.

Why Benefits Aren’t a Reason To Purchase a New Car

The average cost of a new car is over $49,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, and tariffs may drive prices higher. Deductions or rebates may entice Americans to rush out to purchase a new car.

“A tax break is not a reason to make such a big investment. If you absolutely need a new car, then yes, taking these new car-related tax rules into account makes sense. But what I have no patience for is you using these rules as a rationalization to buy a new car,” Orman said.

Instead, Orman advised driving your car until it’s no longer reliable and focus on setting aside money in a savings account to purchase a car in the future.

Following recommended maintenance protocols is the best way to keep your current car reliable. Failing to do this and rushing to take on a car loan can have significant consequences not only for your budget but also for your long-term goals.

When Should You Buy a Car?

Although tax benefits could be good, they aren’t the only thing that should drive you to purchase a new car. A purchase should occur at the right time for your finances.

“If you truly need a car, I have no problem with that. But your goal should be to buy the least expensive car possible, finance it for the shortest time possible, and then drive it for as long as possible,” Orman said in a different article.

Ideally, you should have a minimum down payment of 20%. Furthermore, your total monthly transportation costs likely shouldn’t exceed 15% of your budget. It’s also wise to have an emergency fund before purchase. If you can reach or exceed these numbers and your car is no longer reliable, it becomes more feasible to justify the purchase.

Tax changes that benefit you can be beneficial. However, using them as justification to make an unplanned, expensive purchase can have serious ramifications. Review your finances thoroughly before jumping into action.

“There’s this optimism, this feeling that something better could be just over the horizon,” Julien said. “In the background, though, that destruction remains. Behind every smile and every laugh, there’s a temporary moment of pause.”

This isn’t just any time of year in the North Carolina mountains. Helene struck at the most lucrative time for the region: the changing of the autumn leaves. This is when folks in the mountains make their “hibernating money,” as Jackson puts it. They did not get the chance to make that money last year.

Earning a living in a post-Helene NC

Employment has bounced back one year after the storm. Since January, the jobless rate in Buncombe County, home to Asheville, dropped from 6.8% — North Carolina’s highest at the time — down to 4.1% this summer. That’s a sign of a healthy economy returning.

“The health of the body before any injuries is really important to how you recover,” said Clark Duncan, director of the Asheville Chamber of Commerce. “Luckily, we were in robust economic health before the storm.”

Still, many small businesses in the mountains are on shaky ground one year later. They desperately need an injection of money but can’t stand to take out another loan.

In downtown Asheville, however, Meghan Rogers, director of the Asheville Independent Restaurant Coalition, sees reason for cautious optimism.

“I am feeling positive and hopeful, and I tend to be a glass-half-empty kind of girl,” Rogers told CPP.

“I have seen the gumption and the grit that our independent restaurants have shown to get reopened and to hire back. I’ve been overwhelmed at what it takes, what they’ve shown from day one through an entire year. Please come and see us.”

Some businesses and restaurants have even reopened in Asheville’s devastated River Arts District one year after Helene. But the continued health of the small business community relies heavily — perhaps too heavily — on the success of this fall.

“People are on a really thin margin right now,” Jackson said. “We need our fall to behave. We need sunny days and a lot of tourists.”

Visiting a post-Helene NC

The loss of tourism dollars over the past year has been devastating for the region. The immediate loss of the most valuable months was reinforced by the prolonged perception that the mountains were not open for business.

One year later, park visitation at Grandfather Mountain is down nearly 20% compared to this point in 2024.

The leisure and hospitality industry in Asheville is down 10% in terms of employment, Duncan said.

Rutherford County lost up to 50% of is average tourism revenue. The Rutherford County Tourism Development Authority had to lay off three employees, according to director Don Cason.

“It is pretty devastating,” Cason said. “Businesses have had to recover and survive without hardly any income.”

In the destruction, though, Rutherford County sees opportunity to reimagine itself. Before the storm, the upper portion of the Broad River was 100 feet wide. One year later, its banks are 600 feet apart, according to Cason. The county is planning to build hiking and biking trails in that extra space, hopefully attracting more visitors.

Businesses and local governments across the mountains are welcoming everyone back with open arms.

“We need you,” said Jeff Kaplan, director of Venture Asheville. “We are not going to make it back, to build a stronger, better Asheville in the future, without our visitor support. Everyone here benefits from visitors. Please come back.”

Unfortunately, visitor spending across the state has been slow this year so far, according to Marlise Taylor, director of tourism research at VisitNC. That’s due to an uncertain economy and fears of recession — many are closing their pocketbooks and staying put.

Living in a post-storm Western NC

Those economic uncertainties are plaguing folks in the mountains as well one year after Helene. A significant portion of Western North Carolina's population is still struggling to meet basic needs.

Access to food and shelter was already strained in parts of the North Carolina mountains. The storm deepened those insecurities. In communities like Spruce Pine and Swannanoa, grocery stores have not yet reopened. Food banks and housing services are serving record numbers of people.

MANNA Foodbank is seeing more than 170,000 visits per month across its 16-county service area. That’s the most the foodbank has served in its 42-year history.

“This is due to the storm, as well as the rising cost of goods and the stagnant wages in our region,” Micah Chrisman, spokesperson for MANNA, told CPP.

“People are having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They’re choosing between buying their medicine or paying for groceries or paying rent. The cost of living is just too high. Businesses in our area may be open, but they are not able to pay livable wages. Rich and poor people are coming to our pantries.”

The increased demand isn't just from people who lost jobs or homes in the storm. One year later, Sarah Banks, health director for Haywood County, describes seeing teachers, nurses and middle-income families accessing county services for the first time.

In Spruce Pine, where the town’s only dedicated grocery store remains closed due to catastrophic flooding, traffic at the local food bank is staggering.

At Mitchell County Shepherd’s Staff, director Starli McDowell says she served 1,979 households in August. The population of Spruce Pine is only 2,192.

McDowell says Shepherd’s Staff is still giving out clean water just as fast as they can get it, and helping folks pay their bills, fix their wells and repair their homes.

Those with homes to repair count themselves lucky. The housing crisis, which already plagued Western North Carolina, continues to fester one year after the storm.

Evictions are on the rise, according to David Bartholomew, an attorney at Pisgah Legal Services. Rents briefly declined immediately after the storm but quickly returned to pre-Helene levels and have remained elevated. Activists were lobbying for an eviction moratorium in the aftermath of the storm, but it never materialized. Bartholomew says as the months pass, landlords and property managers are becoming less inclined to work with assistance programs.

Last week, 100 people in danger of eviction were lined up at the door of Grace Covenant, an Asheville church that has dedicated itself to rent assistance. On that day, Grace Covenant dedicated $50,000 of its funding and $15,000 from the Long-Term Recovery Group to stop evictions, according to pastor Marcia Shoop.

“There are a lot of people on the edge,” Shoop told CPP. “And there are so many kinds of edges people can fall off.”

One year after Helene, street homelessness has increased measurably in Asheville. According to Asheville homeless agency Homeward Bound, point-in-time count data from January 2025 showed 328 unsheltered individuals in the Asheville area, up from 219 in 2024 — an increase of 50%.

Meanwhile, the number of people in transitional housing decreased from 250 to 157. Temporary solutions are running out faster than permanent ones can be found.

Many of Homeward Bound’s clients navigated the everchanging deadlines and extensions for FEMA hotel and temporary shelter vouchers that have now expired.

“That created a lot of instability for our clients, many of whom we are still in the process of rehousing,” said Ansley Carter, spokesperson for Homeward Bound. “A year later, we still see people at the lowest income level struggling to move from those temporary situations into stable housing.”

A year of contradictions

The economic recovery in the mountains defies easy conclusions.

In many ways, the region has bounced back remarkably. Unemployment rates have returned to healthier levels. Most businesses have reopened. Infrastructure is largely restored. The mountains bill themselves as open for business.

But those facts obscure a complex reality. At the one-year mark, much remains to worry about. Food banks are serving more people than ever before. Street homelessness has increased 50% in Asheville. Teachers and nurses are relying on assistance programs. In Spruce Pine, nearly as many households visited the food pantry as live in the town.

Still, hope abounds.

“This is going to sound like a cliché, but it isn’t,” John Mitchell, Henderson County manager, told CPP.

“The residents of this county, the folks who work in emergency management, the churches, everyone else: they have looked after our neighbors. They’ve done the hard work to get this community back on its feet.

“There is still suffering. There is no doubt about that. But this recovery has been profound.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/044400f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2762x1450+0+189/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2Fc9%2F49ff6c8044bbb3869f7ad434fd6b%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-22-at-9-07-18-am.png,N,,2025-09-22 11:04:17.957246

TVA issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) signaling interest in deploying Type One’s “Infinity Two” stellarator fusion technology once it reaches commercial readiness.

Infinity Two is designed as a first-generation baseload fusion plant, employing stellarator technology—a fusion approach already proven to achieve stable, steady-state plasma operation. Type One Energy emphasizes that the plant will use existing materials and technologies, aiming for faster deployment compared with rival fusion concepts that remain in the experimental stage. The LOI also envisions potential training uses for the plant’s prototype facilities, positioning Oak Ridge as a hub for workforce development in advanced nuclear.

TVA President and CEO Don Moul said the project could make Tennessee the home of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion facility, underscoring TVA’s role in supplying reliable, carbon-free energy to support surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.

For Tennessee, the project bolsters Governor Bill Lee’s broader push to develop a “nuclear ecosystem” in the state. Oak Ridge already has a storied history in nuclear research, and officials say this next phase could deliver both economic growth and high-value jobs in the Tennessee Valley.

Type One Energy, founded in 2019 and venture-backed in 2023, is pursuing what it calls a low-risk commercialization pathway, blending computational physics, advanced manufacturing, and high-field superconducting magnets. The company’s FusionDirect program is designed to shorten the timeline for delivering market-ready plants. CEO Christofer Mowry described the TVA partnership as “the world’s first private-sector fusion power plant project.”

The agreement remains preliminary. Any final commitment to build Infinity Two will require TVA Board approval, regulatory clearance, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes. The LOI does not yet include funding or offtake contracts for the plant’s energy output.

The announcement reflects broader momentum in the U.S. toward advanced nuclear innovation, as utilities explore options beyond fission to meet demand. While fusion remains unproven at commercial scale, the TVA–Type One partnership highlights growing confidence that the technology could move from laboratory experiments toward real-world power generation within the next decade.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/3270883a29ee4206fc51ec8bddba327e,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:40.755056

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Looking ahead, the Wood Mackenzie report identifies “regulatory pushback” as a key obstacle to further VPP integration, pointing to utilities’ practice of rate basing distributed energy resources – including the cost of distributed energy systems in the utilities’ asset base, from which they can earn a return – as one that limits opportunities for new distributed energy investment.

In most states hosting Microsoft facilities, grid electricity remains at least 50% fossil fuel-generated, and new data centers will instigate additional coal and gas consumption.
“The sheer scale of Microsoft’s AI data center buildout could have global implications for the climate, and it also comes with serious impacts for local communities.
These data centers contribute to higher electricity rates and raise concerns over water supply in the regions where they are clustered,” said Rachel Kitchin, Senior Corporate Campaigner at Stand.earth.

SEATTLE (Traditional Puget Sound Salish and Duwamish Lands) — A new report released today by environmental advocacy group Stand.earth finds that Microsoft’s rapid expansion of AI data centers is set to lock in massive new fossil fuel infrastructure, undermining the company’s 100% renewable energy and carbon-negative commitments, and threatening community health across the U.S.

The report, titled Global Ramifications, Local Impact: Microsoft’s AI Pollution Footprint, finds that Microsoft’s electricity demand for AI data centers will surge over 600% by 2030, which is enough to power the entire New England region, or 12% of all homes in the U.S. Despite the company’s significant investments in renewable-energy generation, the report also reveals that most of Microsoft’s North American data centers still draw at least 50% of their power from coal and gas grids — which will result in utilities planning new gas plants, pipeline expansions, and coal-plant life extensions to meet the growing load.

The report’s key findings include the following:

North American electricity demand from Microsoft data centers will surge over 600% by 2030 — enough to power 12% of all homes in the U.S., or almost the entire electricity consumption of the New England region (i.e., Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont).

In most states hosting Microsoft facilities, grid electricity remains at least 50% fossil fuel-generated, and new data centers will instigate additional coal and gas consumption.

Microsoft’s data center pollution (i.e., Scope 1 and 2) reached over 7.87 million metric tons of CO₂e (i.e., carbon dioxide equivalent) globally in its 2023 fiscal year — an amount that exceeds the annual climate pollution generated by the state of Vermont.

Colocation deals obscure the full scale of pollution: Microsoft leads all hyperscalers in pre-leased third-party capacity, but provides 0% dedicated reporting on its energy use or pollution.

“The sheer scale of Microsoft’s AI data center buildout could have global implications for the climate, and it also comes with serious impacts for local communities. These data centers contribute to higher electricity rates and raise concerns over water supply in the regions where they are clustered,” said Rachel Kitchin, Senior Corporate Campaigner at Stand.earth. “If Microsoft is set to demand as much energy as an entire U.S. region, the least the company can do is ensure that demand isn’t met with fossil fuels that pollute local communities. Microsoft can’t hand-wave away community concerns with sleight-of-hand promises of future clean energy, or greenwash its ongoing love affair with fossil fuels — these new data centers must be backed by new, locally sourced, 24/7 renewable energy before they go online.”

A case study included in the new report analyzes proposals underway in Person County, North Carolina, which is home to multiple coal plants, including one of the largest coal plants in the U.S. As a result, its communities have dealt with decades of toxic pollution, including groundwater with high levels of arsenic, chromium, cobalt, and selenium, as well as radioactivity 11 times the maximum contaminant concentration limit. A planned AI build-out in the county has prompted Duke Energy to propose new gas turbines, pipeline extensions, and even consider extending coal-plant operations — threatening air quality, water supplies, and community well-being in a historically marginalized region. While Microsoft has not formally announced that this site will house a data center, at a spring 2025 hearing held by the North Carolina House Committee on Energy and Public Utilities, an American Petroleum Institute representative gave a presentation that identified this site as a Microsoft data center.

“Big companies like Microsoft can make their own clean energy and work with the utility to make sure that everyone has enough reliable power – and regular customers shouldn’t have to pay for expensive dirty power plants and pipelines when our needs can be served by clean energy,” said Steph Gans, Assistant Director of Clean Water for North Carolina. “It’s like asking us to pay for Bill Gates’s electric bill. If Microsoft really didn’t want their data centers to be used as an excuse to build more fossil fuel projects and charge customers for it, they would intervene in North Carolina’s carbon plan proceedings, they would speak out against lobbyists who use their projects as a reason to push gas-friendly legislation, and they would already have a plan to use clean energy for their projects.”

The report concludes with the following recommendations:

New data centers must be powered by 24/7 renewable energy: To ensure new data center energy demand isn’t being met by fossil fuels or false solutions that pose new risks, Microsoft must make a commitment to build out local, additional 24/7 renewable energy infrastructure before its data centers begin operation.

Increase transparency around hourly matching energy procurement: Microsoft should publicly report granular data around the implementation of hourly matching to ensure the energy needs of its data centers are met by renewable power at all times of the day.

Scale up community benefit programs: Microsoft should ensure timely, active, and good-faith outreach to communities where it wants to establish data centers.

Establish and enforce these same renewable energy, transparency, and community benefit standards for colocation data centers: As a large user of colocation facilities, Microsoft should use its power to pressure the colocation data centers it contracts with to follow the same protocols it implements to reduce environmental and community harms.

Strengthen voluntary and regulatory reporting standards: Leading AI companies must advocate in support of ending reporting loopholes in global target-setting initiatives such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which permit low quality renewable energy procurement, and support a shift to granular (i.e., 24/7) energy accounting.

“Right now we’re at a crossroads. The direction Microsoft chooses for its AI strategy will directly impact both the global climate and local communities across the U.S.,” said Kitchin. “Done correctly, Microsoft and other leading AI providers have a chance to rapidly accelerate our society’s shift to a renewable energy future with a new type of climate commitment fit for the age of AI. Microsoft can provide real benefits to the communities and grids where they operate, and make itself a major force for positive change on both a local and global scale.”

The coming fleet of data centers will feature some of the largest individual sources of electricity demand and while there is substantial uncertainty about exactly how much electricity data centers will consume, growth toward 10 percent of U.S. electricity within this decade is a reasonable estimate. Such growth has raised questions about how the United States can adequately supply electricity to power this technology while maintaining grid security, affordability, and progress toward environmental goals.

Powering AI will surely impact electricity demand, and it is increasingly likely that AI itself will transform electricity grid operations. Modern AI tools can process large amounts of data, explore and optimize solutions to complex problems, and be used by centralized and decentralized decisionmakers to find local and global optima. AI should therefore be particularly helpful in the electricity sector, which is replete with data and clear performance metrics (e.g., price, reliability, revenue, and efficiency). These interventions would be welcomed and timely for the sector, which is now challenged with meeting multiple imperatives and has emerged as a priority issue for policymakers on both sides of the aisle.

Grid Applications of AI

There have been some excellent and in-depth reviews of AI applications to the electricity sector, which have informed and inspired this analysis. In particular, a recent systematic review of papers documenting how AI and machine learning tools can be applied to energy systems found dozens of examples where AI was providing documented improvements over existing practices and key insights for how they can be classified in terms of specific AI technologies and maturity, as well as issues for public policy. Additionally, the Department of Energy published a comprehensive report highlighting AI applications to modernize the grid, and the International Energy Agency published an in-depth study of both the energy demands of AI and its potential applications within energy.

This analysis is not intended to comprehensively identify all potential contributions of AI to the electricity sector, but rather to highlight the near-term solutions readily scalable to help address the three core challenges facing the electricity sector: reliability, operational efficiency, and rapid growth.

Managing AI Induced Grid Vulnerabilities

As these applications demonstrate, AI has the potential to mitigate immediate challenges facing today’s electricity grid. However, implementing these tools requires careful attention to the inevitable new risks that arise from deploying new technologies. Because the electricity sector is so critical, complex, and sensitive, appropriate measures must be put in place to ensure these benefits are safely realized.

The key challenge for policy makers is to strike a balance between encouraging AI adoption where it most enhances reliability, efficiency, and growth while safeguarding critical infrastructure with appropriate governance and oversight mechanisms. Implementation at scale will need appropriate safeguards for maintaining cybersecurity.

Risks from AI integration with the grid span the value chain. In the case of real-time decision support, AI systems are considered black boxes, making it difficult to verify and validate tool outputs before implementing system-wide changes. Faulty or poorly trained models could amplify, rather than reduce, reliability concerns. Similarly, because AI systems themselves are so complex, pairing them with the already complicated grid architecture could lead to new failure modes. Existing literature has sought to highlight these risks and recommend mitigation measures. For example, the DOE Office of Cybersecurity, Energy, and Emergency Response wrote a report on the potential risks of expanding the use of AI in critical energy infrastructure.

Due to the criticality of the grid, electricity planners, regulators, utilities, and operators are historically risk adverse. Integrating AI solutions at scale—especially those informing real-time and automated operational responses—will be a slow process without policymakers supporting clear objectives, industry working together to iterate and learn quickly, and appropriate safeguards in place for consumers and the grid.

Effective risk mitigation will be essential for building confidence in AI applications on the grid. Protecting customer privacy through data anonymization can reduce exposure to misuse of sensitive information, such as household occupancy patterns. Establishing clear industry standards will give utilities and regulators a shared foundation for evaluating tools, while maintaining human oversight in critical decisions can ensure accountability. Robust testing environments, digital twinning, and regulatory sandboxes will allow new applications to be trialed safely before widespread deployment, and system redundancies can provide additional safeguards to preserve reliability if AI-enabled systems fail. Together, these measures can help translate technical innovation into trustworthy practice.

Key Observations and Policy Recommendations

America's AI Action Plan identifies the “limited and slow adoption of AI” as a key bottleneck to realizing its potential economywide impacts, citing “distrust or lack of understanding of the technology, a complex regulatory landscape, and a lack of clear governance and risk mitigation standards.” These barriers are evident in electricity, where AI tools show clear promise but remain at the pilot stage.

Although AI offers significant opportunities for improving reliability, cutting costs, and permitting growth, adoption has been uneven. A Federation of American Scientists report identified 12 high-value AI applications for the grid, yet even the most technically mature are not applied at scale in the United States. Surveys from the International Energy Agency confirm this globally: Grid operators reported using AI for asset management and planning (70 percent) or grid development (54 percent), while fewer than one-quarter (23 percent) reported deploying AI in daily operations such as load forecasting. Operators expressed skepticism about relying on AI for critical decisions, preferring advisory roles for software and maintaining traditional standards.

To realize the benefits of AI in energy, the United States must balance the try-first experimentalism preferred in the digital economy with the stringent safety and reliability demands of the power system. Achieving this balance will require political leadership from the federal government to prioritize strategic projects, support near-term demonstrations, and promote best practices through standards and information sharing.

Some immediate policy recommendations are as follows:

Develop standards to capture reliability benefits of AI. The AI Action Plan calls for a coordinated federal approach to domain-specific efforts led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In doing so, NIST could lead in adapting its AI Risk Management Framework—a voluntary framework that guides the safe and trustworthy design, deployment, and use of AI—to grid applications for load forecasting, fault detection, and other operational matters. Working with the DOE, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and industry, NIST could define standards that would give operators and their regulators a shared basis for validating AI’s performance and reliability, building confidence in the tools that are developed so that they can be widely adopted. The DOE and states could use those standards in supporting grid enhancement projects and implementation initiatives with grants and loans.

Allow FERC to incorporate AI into grid planning and expansion. Prolonged interconnection processes are stalling the development of new generation. Demonstrations have shown how they can be sped up with AI tools for document management and simulations of the power grid. Defining how these tools can be used by grid planners is a key task for regulators and thus should be a FERC-led process. The Federation of American Scientists recommends that a FERC-DOE-RTO working group convene to “clarify the regulatory pathway for AI use cases in grid planning,” a proposal which would bring the right parties into the process and provide clarity on how AI-enabled tools can inform long-term investment and expansion decisions.

Define priority regions for demonstration projects. The DOE has existing authority to support grid enhancements and projects that would implement AI in applications such as dynamic line ratings. With substantial expertise in grid flows and data center development, the DOE can define priority areas where congestion is exacerbating electricity rates and limiting growth. Deploying AI-assisted tools such as dynamic line ratings and distributed energy resource management in high-impact contexts will build confidence, generate replicable models, and demonstrate the value of federal leadership.

Support demand flexibility, large and small. The AI Action plan cites data center flexibility as a key tool for improving grid efficiency and accommodating new demand. Federal support should extend this principle to encourage distributed participation through virtual power plants and other distributed resources. Expanding demand-side options will give utilities and regulators more tools to deploy during periods of peak load, and consumers access to the benefits ofa more dynamic grid.

Economy-Wide Energy Effects

This paper has thus far focused on what AI can do in support of the electricity sector and highlighted several areas where AI tools can address the challenges that sector faces today. Resolving these issues through the application of AI and broader reforms to the energy sector will be important for a thriving economy in the future. But AI can and will affect energy use more broadly.

AI tools will help deliver efficiencies across energy intensive sectors of the economy, where firms adopt practices to reduce costs and increase output. In its AI and Energy report, the International Energy Agency estimated energy savings across key subsectors by 2035 that could be achieved with AI applications (See Table 2). Based on projected 2035 U.S. demand, AI applications could save nearly 2,500 petajoules (PJ) of energy for the U.S. if fully realized. This translates to approximately 4.5 percent of 2035 demand in the three most energy intensive sectors.

Applications for AI thus create opportunities to make industry, transportation, and buildings more productive in terms of total energy usage (not just electricity). And since these sectors have traditionally been labeled hard to abate because they are difficult to electrify, AI-driven energy reduction could provide another pathway towards marginal decarbonization.

Whether AI can provide tools to accelerate larger increases energy productivity of the economy, in the same way economists expect it to increase labor productivity, is an important question beyond AI’s own energy consumption or applications to the grid.

Conclusion

AI tools are uniquely positioned to address problems in energy, a sector replete with data, complex optimization problems, and multiple layers of governance. The tools already under development will enhance efficiencies, save companies and consumers money, and help realize new business models and technologies. However, without appropriate safeguards and regulatory oversight, the same AI solutions that could enhance grid operations could unleash new vulnerabilities to this critical infrastructure. The question facing policymakers is how those tools might be utilized to solve immediate problems facing society, and how those can be prioritized and accelerated while moderating the degree of additional risk.

The United States has adopted a strong stance toward winning the AI race, recognizing the economic and security stakes of being at the front of the line in this new technology. The country is now rushing to enable that victory by increasing the availability of electricity for datacenters through vigorous investment, accelerated permitting for individual projects, and infrastructure strategies. As that is done, applying AI solutions to the energy sector could help reduce friction in expanding and operating an increasingly complex grid. Reliable and affordable electricity at the scale necessary to meet the needs of innovative industries of the future is key to U.S. economic security and competitiveness. AI is a driver of challenges to the grid but should also be seen as a tool that can be leveraged to enhance the grid and allow the electricity sector to rise to the challenge.

Temperatures flare

Climate change may be a nonstarter for the Trump administration, but activists and scientists haven’t taken their feet off the gas pedal as they pressure the rest of the world to live up to previously agreed climate commitments — a pressure campaign that will be out in full force this week in New York.

Except the specifics of those commitments are largely MIA at the moment.

This year, all countries that signed the Paris Agreement are required to submit their new climate pledges. These nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, must be sent every five years to demonstrate each country’s commitments to help the world stick to the goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Usually, NDCs are submitted long before UNGA, but this year, only 36 out of 197 countries have published their NDCs, writes my colleague Jesse Chase-Lubitz, who will be at Climate Week. Still missing from the list are some of the world’s biggest emitters, including India, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, and Indonesia.

A high-level meeting of 40 heads of state on Sept. 24, when each leader will give a preview of their country’s NDCs, will be the first window into the missing commitments.

“This is an important moment,” Marcos Neto, assistant administrator at the U.N. Development Programme, tells Jesse.

He’s not especially worried about the number of NDCs still to be submitted — pointing out that there has been a consensus throughout the U.N. that “quality and ambition is more important than doing it in a hurry” and that so far the NDCs submitted are “fundamentally a better set of NDCs.”

Those that have already been sent in, he says, are “better, more ambitious, more investible. They take cost into account, and are far more whole-of-society than before.”

Forced reform

Back to UNGA (expect to hear that a lot this week). An overarching theme will be reforming the U.N. itself, motivated in no small part by U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget cuts, which have forced the U.N. to slash its own budget, fire staff, and consolidate agencies, as my colleague Colum Lynch has been detailing for months.

Trump’s fingerprints on the process have engendered deep skepticism among U.N. staffers and experts, who claim the reforms are a hasty cost-cutting exercise rather than a carefully thought-out blueprint for making the U.N. more relevant.

“I have no doubt there’s a lot of efficiencies to be had, and people should be brave and try to tackle it,” Elizabeth Campbell, the executive director of ODI Global Washington, told Colum during a recent Devex Pro Briefing with Richard Gowan, the U.N. and multilateral diplomacy director at the International Crisis Group. “I am highly skeptical that the U.N. itself can effectively pursue that kind of reform. I don’t really see it able to do it,” Campbell said.

For his part, Gowan argues that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ consolidation project has been hindered by internal bureaucratic resistance, a lack of clarity in U.S. plans for the U.N., and a dwindling timetable as Guterres enters his final year as head of the world body.

“When you talk to diplomats, most of them will say: Yeah, we support UN80. This needs to happen just to keep the ship afloat, but we’re going to wait for the next person, whoever she is, or whoever he is, and we’re going to see if we can find a new secretary-general who will have the time and the political capital to really drive a much bigger strategic review of where the U.N. is going.”

Fine line

When does sexual education for teenagers cross the line? What is that imaginary line anyway? Who draws it and who has the power to erase it?

There are no easy answers, but it’s a constant battle of wills in today’s culture wars. One of those confrontations is playing out at UNICEF, which scrubbed its website of guides meant to help teenagers navigate their bodies and relationships, after a conservative U.S. advocacy group accused the agency of pushing “sexually explicit programs targeting children.”

For the Center for Family and Human Rights, or C-Fam, UNICEF’s sexual education publications normalized LGBTQ+ relationships, promoted masturbation, and encouraged girls to explore their anatomy, among other things.

For some UNICEF staff, it was critical information that’s now been censored — setting a worrying precedent.

“What do children and young people want and need? That should be the core of what we do — a lot of what was taken down had been designed and discussed with them and with their caretakers,” a staffer tells my colleague Ayenat Mersie.

But Lisa Correnti, C-Fam’s executive vice president, tells Ayenat that taking down web pages did not amount to a win: “The removal of its public-facing material cannot be regarded as a success if the agency continues to promote the same controversial issues and materials in a less visible manner.”

All-nighter

Back in Washington, D.C., lawmakers in the U.S. Congress have been engaged in their own pitched political battles. One notable debate that the development community kept a close eye on was the reauthorization of the U.S. Department of State, which is managing the foreign assistance portfolio it inherited from the U.S. Agency for International Development.

After a nearly 36-hour marathon session, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a set of bills that would not only reauthorize the State Department, but also put in place a new organizational structure and set of policies, including how it would focus foreign assistance — assuming the bills become law.

That’s a long way away. Historically, State Department reauthorizations have been a bear, so getting this latest one out of committee is merely a first step. The full House still needs to approve it. Then the Senate will have its own proposal, which would have to be reconciled with the House version and then approved again by both houses of Congress. Then it heads to Trump’s desk.

Still, the nascent bills offer a useful window into what foreign assistance might look like in its new home. Among other things, they would create an undersecretary for foreign assistance, a director, and an Office of Foreign Assistance Oversight.

Republicans cheered — and pushed through — the passage, while Democrats booed it.

On the overall restructuring of the State Department, Rep. Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, said, “The administration has already showed this model delivers faster, more effective assistance while strengthening U.S. credibility abroad.”

But Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, criticized the bills for “rubber-stamping the Trump administration’s illegal action to shutter USAID.”

The partisan divide mirrors the larger schism over federal spending, which will consume both chambers over the next few weeks, so don’t expect the reauthorization to be a priority, especially as the U.S. government careens toward a shutdown if no budget deal is reached by Sept. 30.

How to Join: Purchase the product in-store or online, share your vision of a fossil fuel–free future through Lush’s interactive activity, and sign up with OCI to keep building the movement.

Every person deserves clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, and a stable climate to live in. But fossil fuel executives knowingly destroy our planet for profit and frontline communities are paying the highest price.

The fossil fuel industry makes billions in record profits, while wildfires choke our air, heat domes scorch our cities, and floods wipe out homes. This isn’t an accident, it’s the cost of their greed.

At Oil Change International (OCI), we fight to stop it. For twenty years, our mission has been to expose the real cost of oil, gas, and coal, and fight for a fast, fair, and funded phaseout of fossil fuels. We’re data-driven, people-powered, and justice focused.

Communities over fossil fuel executives

The climate crisis is a justice issue. Indigenous, Black, and low-income communities are often hit first and worst by climate disasters. They’re also leading the charge for change.

From Louisiana to Nigeria, we partner with frontline organizers who fight back against fossil fuel expansion. In California, we’ve worked alongside youth activists pushing for an end to neighborhood oil drilling. In Japan, we support campaigns to stop dangerous new fossil fuel projects and hold governments and companies accountable.

And we don’t just fight fossil fuels—we follow the money. OCI exposes how governments pour billions into oil and gas projects, even as they make empty climate promises. Our advocacy helps power movements and our research brings the receipts.

The science is clear

To avoid climate collapse, governments must stop approving new fossil fuel projects.

And we can afford it. The billions in fossil fuel subsidies handed out each year could instead fund real climate solutions: renewable energy, green jobs, and investments in the communities hit hardest.

But fossil fuel companies don’t just block action, they sell dangerous distractions. From carbon capture to gas, their techno fixes are just new ways to keep polluting. We’re calling them out and helping people see through the greenwashing.

Hope

All over the world, people protect their homes and families. Communities organize, youth lead. The pressure is mounting. The era of fossil fuels is ending, it’s just a matter of how quickly, and how just the process will be.

A fossil-free world isn’t just possible, it’s necessary. And it’s already being built.

Among all renewable energy generation technologies, solar alone accounted for 6,012 new jobs (between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024) thus expanding its cumulative to 370,556, according to the report by the environmental advocacy group.

The US clean energy jobs now account for 42% of all energy jobs and 2.3% of overall national workforce in the country. E2 shares that now more people work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

Clean energy and clean vehicle sectors added more than 520,000 jobs with an increase of 17% over the last 5 years, ‘far exceeding’ the gain in employment in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles as well as the overall US economy.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said E2’s Executive Director, Bob Keefe. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Citing US Bureau of Labor Statistics, E2 says that at the beginning of 2025, clean energy was expected to remain one of the fastest growing segments of the US economy. Wind turbine technician and solar installation jobs were projected to be the fastest-growing jobs in America.

Recent Trump administration policies have slowed renewable energy growth by cutting tax credits, canceling permits, and adding regulatory hurdles. While the E2 report does not reflect these actions, analysts believe that significant job losses have already taken place in the industry and may lead to more.

Broadly speaking, state lawmakers should strongly consider deploying mandatory GHG emissions reporting programs where they don’t already exist.","In a new phase of the Trump administration’s assault on the federal government, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced last week that it plans to largely dissolve the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The GHGRP is an important, high-quality data resource for federal agencies, industry stakeholders, community advocates, and many others working to advance the clean energy transition, cut pollution, and protect public health.

You can’t manage what you can’t measure, and this move is an extension of the Trump administration’s broader assault on sources of truth. The public has a right to know how much dangerous, planet-warming pollution is being emitted by large industries, and policymakers need these numbers to make informed decisions. Eliminating the GHGRP would limit access to unbiased information on pollution in communities across the country—an intentional move to slow climate progress and let major polluters off the hook.

But states can step up to fill the gap, and advocates can still push back. The comment period on EPA’s decision to eliminate the GHGRP is open until November 3, 2025. This is a moment for vocal resistance, before the White House’s decision is finalized.

What Is the GHGRP, and Why Does It Matter?

The Obama administration established the GHGRP in 2010 as an initiative to track climate-warming pollution from the nation’s biggest emitters. For the last 15 years, the program has collected emissions data on more than half a dozen greenhouse gases from roughly 8,000 of the highest-polluting industrial facilities across the U.S. GHGRP’s datasets. These publicly available emissions records are a treasure trove for lawmakers, businesses, and climate advocates. They can use them to track and compare facilities’ emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, and develop informed climate policies. Economists have even found that the GHGRP, by forcing transparency and accountability for major polluters, has helped deter greenwashing and encouraged meaningful corporate environmental initiatives.

If we want to tackle the climate crisis, we need to know where climate pollution is coming from. Pollution monitoring is often a priority for environmental justice advocates and frontline communities because cutting pollution requires understanding its sources. The GHGRP provides that foundational knowledge to empower emissions mitigation initiatives, and closing it down will broadly obscure our visibility into where climate pollution is coming from in the U.S. This move advances the Trump administration’s imperative, backed by the oil and gas industry, to undermine any attempts to combat the climate crisis. But we have the tools to respond.

States Can Fill the Gap Left by the GHGRP

States can establish their own greenhouse gas reporting programs—and several already have. California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Massachusetts, and New Jersey all require some set of major polluters to report their GHG emissions to state agencies. Each state lays out its own methodology for tracking emissions and sets its own thresholds for which entities are required to report, but the ultimate outcome is the same: an entirely state-based program collecting the kind of data that EPA will no longer track.

Those reporting programs are a valuable tool to help states measure their progress toward decarbonization targets, and California and Washington’s enable them to implement nation-leading cap-and-trade initiatives. California’s reporting rule has been on the books since 2007—three years before EPA established the GHGRP. There is a strong precedent for states acting on their own to track major pollution sources.

Other states are lining up for similar initiatives, with greenhouse gas reporting programs currently in development. Earlier this year, for example, New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation released its own draft rule to establish a mandatory GHG reporting program. The rule incorporates lessons learned from the EPA GHGRP and other state reporting programs. Building on those precedents, New York will soon have its own program in place to require annual emissions reporting from the state’s largest polluters—a model that can be replicated by any number of other states looking to maintain high-quality GHG emissions data after the GHGRP is shuttered.

Individual state programs aren’t the only pathway to collecting emissions data without federal buy-in. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has set up a similar system (PDF) across nearly a dozen states. RGGI sets a regional cap on carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from the power sector and creates an interstate market in emissions allowances, which are distributed to polluters through quarterly auctions. In order to set up and run that allowance market, every RGGI member state sets rules for the covered energy facilities to monitor and report their CO2 pollution.

While these state and regional programs are more limited in scope than the federal GHGRP, they demonstrate clearly that state lawmakers have all the tools at hand to effectively replace the GHGRP for facilities within their jurisdiction. A rollback of the GHGRP would be a major blow to our ability to measure the problem we’re facing, but states can step up to gather and report their own high-quality pollution data without relying on the Trump administration.

What Comes Next?

Broadly speaking, state lawmakers should strongly consider deploying mandatory GHG emissions reporting programs where they don’t already exist. In doing so, they can draw on the reporting rules already written in more than a dozen states; there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

In the immediate term, states with reporting programs already in development—New York foremost among them—should also accelerate their rulemakings to fill data gaps before GHGRP winds down. As the Trump administration eliminates climate protections across the board, states can take up the mantle of leadership.

Climate advocates also have the opportunity to push back during the open comment period on the decision to shutter GHGRP, which closes on November 3, 2025. Public comments provide a crucial opportunity to build a record of opposition that can slow down the Trump administration’s rollbacks. Adverse comments on Trump’s rollbacks can support legal challenges down the road and serve as extra hoops for agency officials to jump through, because they are legally required to respond to substantive objections. Losing the GHGRP is a setback, but we aren’t left helpless. State leaders and concerned citizens can and must act.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was passed in 2022, this measure provides up to $7,500 in applicable tax credit with the purchase of a qualifying new EV, as a means to incentivize car shoppers into buying an environmentally-friendly EV instead of a gas-powered internal-combustion vehicle.

Find out below when the EV tax credit expires and how to get the tax credit.

What Is Happening to the $7,500 Credit?

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA essentially set the economic agenda for Trump’s second administration by extending a number of tax cuts from his first administration, as well as cutting funding to several programs such as Medicaid and the EV tax credit.

As a result of the OBBBA, the $7,500 EV tax credit will now expire on Sept. 30.

How Can You Still Get the $7,500 Tax Credit?

Following the OBBBA’s passing, auto manufacturers initially assumed that car buyers would have to sign a purchase contract, make a down payment and physically receive their new EV by or before Sept. 30 in order to receive the credit.

However, the IRS has created something of a loophole in the credit’s expiration, per Yahoo Finance. “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” according to the IRS.

In short: As long as an EV buyer signs a purchase contract and pays a deposit (or the full purchase amount) by or before Sept. 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

What does this mean for you? Well, if you’ve been planning to purchase an EV and you can affordably make a down payment on an EV between now and Sept. 30, you’ll still be able to receive the IRA’s EV tax credit before it expires for good.

Engineering innovation, customer centricity and collaboration are helping industries meet the challenge.

By Ruben Alvarez, CEO of John Crane

At John Crane, we work with customers across a wide range of industries – from oil and gas to renewables, chemicals and power generation – giving us a front-row view of how the energy transition is taking shape around the world.

From large scale industrial players to regional innovators, there is an urgency, complexity and opportunity involved in decarbonising operations, a process to be engineered in a way that supports the critical systems the world relies on every day.

Facing real-world hurdles on the path to cleaner energy

Transitioning from traditional fuels to cleaner technologies isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. There’s legacy equipment to adapt, regulations to navigate, mandatory legislation to comply with – all while keeping operations safe, reliable and increasingly low-emission.

For many organisations, that means balancing operational performance with the urgent need to decarbonise, reduce fugitive emissions and improve energy efficiency across everything from process equipment to storage.

While traditional energy systems remain essential in many regions today, the focus is shifting toward cleaner, more sustainable solutions, with traditional fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG) playing an important role along the way.

There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution. The energy transition looks different in every country, and even every facility. But that’s also where the opportunity lies. If you can solve these challenges, you go beyond ticking boxes and start to shape the future of energy.

One of the most effective ways to decarbonise existing fossil fuel power plants is through post-combustion carbon capture, which removes CO₂ from flue gas after combustion. According to the International Energy Agency, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could reduce energy-related emissions by 13%, with global capture capacity set to grow by 35% and storage by 70% by 2030.

Across the industry, more companies are making CCUS a practical part of their decarbonisation strategies. This technology is rapidly progressing from pilot projects to large-scale operations, often in demanding environments.

First CO2 volumes successfully stored at Northern Lights

Putting customers at the heart of innovation

So, how do we help companies make this shift? It comes down to listening to what customers need and then working with them to deliver real solutions.

The lessons we’re learning from hydrogen projects in Europe are already helping customers in North America and Asia. In water-scarce regions, we’re helping operators use less and recycle more by reducing process losses and improving system efficiency. And in remote locations, our teams are finding ways to keep critical equipment running longer and more reliably. It’s a two-way street: we learn as much from our customers as they do from us.

Take our work with Franco Tosi Meccanica in Italy, for example. Together, we’re supporting a pilot project on supercritical CO₂ power cycles – a technology that could make power generation cleaner and more efficient. Our job is to engineer sealing solutions that can perform under the demanding conditions of advanced power generation systems. It’s a great example of how collaboration is driving real progress.

Innovation is about responding directly to what keeps our customers awake at night.

Growth with purpose

So, what’s next? For me, it’s about growth, but not just in terms of numbers. It’s about growing our impact: helping more customers reach their sustainability goals, investing in our people and nurturing the wider industry, while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Our partnership with the University of Sheffield in the UK is one example. We’re working with researchers to push the boundaries of sealing technology for high-pressure hydrogen storage and other low-carbon applications. It’s not just about new products. It’s also about investing in the next generation of engineers and making sure the industry has the talent and ideas it needs to thrive.

We’re also seeing growing interest in LNG as a transitional fuel in several markets. While not the end goal, it can offer a practical bridge in reducing emissions where renewables are not yet scalable, and we are helping customers operate these systems more cleanly and reliably.

As the world undergoes this energy transition, engineering advancements and specialised sealing technologies will play a vital role in ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of both renewable and fossil fuel power generation systems.

New energy landscape means new opportunities

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that progress in this industry doesn’t come from standing still. It comes from rolling up our sleeves, collaborating across borders and being open to new ideas.

The road to a cleaner energy future isn’t always smooth, but it’s absolutely worth the effort.

The future of energy is being written right now, all over the world, and I’m excited to see where we can go together.

Dive Brief:

Based on low, medium and high emissions scenarios, the U.S. will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26%-41% in 2040 compared with 2005 levels, according to Rhodium Group’s Taking Stock 2025 report.

However, the pace of decarbonization will slow dramatically, partially due to recent and potential policy changes by Congress and the Trump administration. Under the high emissions scenario, Rhodium estimates that average annual U.S. GHG emissions reductions were 1.1% from 2005 to 2024. That figure is now projected to fall to just 0.4% from 2025 to 2040, a 64% relative decline.

“The outcomes we report throughout Taking Stock this year are subject to considerable uncertainty, including an incredibly dynamic policy environment and persistent non-cost barriers to clean energy deployment,” the Sept. 10 report says. “These factors will continue to shape how the energy system and GHG emissions evolve in the coming years.”

Dive Insight:

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have adopted or proposed a wide range of policies that are likely to increase climate pollution compared with policies under the Biden administration. Those changes include a second withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, ending federal tax credits for electric vehicles and altering other clean energy credits, eliminating federal rules limiting GHG emissions from fossil fuel power plants, blocking wind and solar projects and more.

“The effects of these policy shifts are compounded by rapid growth in electricity demand driven predominantly by the growth in large AI data centers, a weakening macroeconomic outlook, and an increasingly export-driven fossil fuel sector,” the report says.

Additionally, Rhodium said its estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, given the unstable economic and policy environment.

“Emissions outcomes vary due to a range of expectations for economic growth, future fossil fuel prices, and clean energy cost and performance trends,” according to the report.

Under the medium and low emissions scenarios, decarbonization would likely continue to accelerate rather than slow with annual GHG emissions declining 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, according to the report.

The power, transportation, and oil and gas sectors are driving emissions reductions in GHG.The power sector is projected to emit 15%-43% fewer emissions in 2040 compared with 2024 levels, despite growing electricity demand, the report found.

“Renewables grow substantially in all three emissions scenarios through 2030 to claim the expiring clean electricity tax credits, but deployment diverges after that,” according to Rhodium.

Transportation emissions, meanwhile, will fall 8%-20%, as zero-emissions vehicles comprise a larger share of the U.S. vehicle fleet, according to Rhodium. The report attributes the increased market share to falling battery prices and greater consumer acceptance.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/KgfDHOMT72pDBeY1K71Kg4sqswL2NkOy789TLOf_T_c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yRUFIQUJULmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:04.574279

Pilot Company has opened electric vehicle charging sites at more than 200 of its travel centers across almost 40 states, according to a Sept. 9 announcement.

Recent openings include Pilot’s first EV charging stations in Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.

This puts the program, which is being developed through a collaboration with General Motors and charging infrastructure company EVgo, nearly halfway to its goal of 500 locations and 2,000 charging stalls.

Dive Insight:

Pilot is building many of its chargers in rural areas because fewer than half of rural counties had any public EV charging infrastructure, the company noted in its announcement. These could not only be a resource for customers in more remote areas, but can also encourage stops from road-trippers with electric vehicles.

Pilot travel centers are typically located along interstates, which carry more than 20% of total traffic in the U.S., according to the announcement. Its travel centers, which offer on-site restaurants and free WiFi in addition to their 350 kilowatt fast chargers, give customers plenty to do while their cars charge. They also feature Plug & Charge payments for compatible EVs.

“Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

To date, Pilot has received $15 million in funding help from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. While the Trump Administration has made some changes to the NEVI program, that funding could still help Pilot, GM and EVgo build more sites.

Pilot said it expects to reach 1,000 stalls in 40 states by the end of this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SU47PJuWrsEUqrg0rvP-iooQhdu8PmlIL_VpYMuNcVw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QSWxvdF9HTV9jaGFyZ2luZ185LjIxLjI1LnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:55.988871

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average score across the country was 15 out of 100.

Missouri utilities advocated for a law passed earlier this year that will make it easier to increase utility bills for new gas-burning power plants and future projects approved by regulators who are appointed by the Governor. Kansas passed as similar law last year. Customers will see new rate increases to pay for new gas plants years before they provide service, largely in the name of economic development for multibillion dollar tech companies building power-hungry data centers.

The price of new gas-burning power plants is outpacing inflation, and the trend is likely to continue according to new analysis. Duke University research notes that new demand for electricity, for example from data centers, can be flexed to avoid building expensive new gas plants while maintaining electric grid reliability.

Ameren Missouri earned a 5% (F), an 11% decrease from the previous year. Ameren owns and plans to operate its Labadie coal-burning power plant until 2042, which is the one of the largest, dirtiest, and deadliest power plants in the country, because it lacks all modern pollution controls. Ameren admits its Sioux coal-burning plant is unlikely to operate at least 20% annually, meaning it could be offline when needed as customers continue to pay for the asset. Last year, the Sierra Club told utility regulators that Ameren over-inflated the price of renewable energy when critiquing the cost of Sioux’s extended operation.

AECI earned a 0% (F), which is the same score the utility earned the previous year. AECI is throwing good money after bad at its Thomas Hill coal plant in northern Missouri that has a recent history of breaking down. Thomas Hill didn’t operate for more than six of the last twelve months, including this past January when it was needed to power the grid during a polar vortex. AECI can be more secretive about its financials because it’s not a monopoly utility regulated by the state, nor is it a municipal utility that is overseen by locally elected officials.

Evergy earned a 9% (F), a 3% decrease from the previous year. Evergy was spotlighted in the report because of the utility’s multi-year backslide from renewable energy investments toward extending coal plant operations and building new gas-burning power plants. CEO David Campbell’s pivot toward more coal-burning and gas-burning saw the utility quietly drop its 70% greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030 goal from its website and regulatory filings as the company continues greenwashing its image.

In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress–if any–the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

Statement from Ty Gorman, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizing Strategist in Kansas:

“The dirty truth is that Evergy is extending uneconomic coal plants and building loads of new gas-burning power plants that will extract a massive amount of wealth from hardworking Kansans and benefit their worldwide shareholders. CEO David Campbell is responsible for this problem, and we need communities to come together and demand that his monopoly utility address its harms. Multibillion dollar tech companies with climate goals must fund clean energy, like Google, because Kansas communities are subsidizing new gas-burning power plants for their power-hungry AI data centers.”

Statement from Brian Smith, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Missouri:

“I’ve talked to cooperative members throughout Missouri, and the dirty truth is that the average person has no clue that AECI exists, let alone the massive influence it has over the rates and power sources for their regional electric cooperatives. Knowing that AECI exists would be like the average cooperative member knowing that Pepsico owns Doritos—choice is an illusion.”

The annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York comes more than a month after a deadline passed that Trump imposed on his Cabinet to identify international organizations that the U.S. should quit, defund or reform.

Since establishing the deadline in February, the president has intensified his attacks on global establishments that were created to combat rising temperatures, while also reversing domestic regulations, laws and commitments designed to expand clean energy and reduce climate pollution.

Now, his administration could be weighing whether to leave the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a move that would reshape international efforts on global warming for years to come, according to former Trump officials and environmental advocates.

The 1992 treaty, known as the UNFCCC, serves as the international structure for efforts by 198 countries to slow the pace of rising levels of greenhouse gases. It’s also the underlying framework for the Paris Agreement, which Trump moved to abandon on his first day in office.

Since then, his administration has dissolved the State Department office responsible for leading U.S. climate negotiations, dismembered a program that tracks the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and thwarted clean energy policies in favor of expanding oil, gas and coal. Those actions are antithetical to the goals of the UNFCCC.

A high-profile departure from the global framework on climate change would be a marked escalation of Trump’s moves to divorce the U.S. from the nearly unanimous sentiment globally that climate change poses economic and natural upheaval. It would also be the most enduring step that Trump has taken so far, his allies argue.

By comparison, the 2015 Paris Agreement can be left and reentered on the whim of whomever happens to be president. Reentering treaties, such as the UNFCCC, could be more challenging.

“There is zero benefit to remaining in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change,” Steven Groves, a former Trump official who’s now at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an email. “Leaving the Convention would prevent future Democrat administrations from circumventing Senate advice and consent on treaties, as President Obama did with the Paris Agreement.”

Groves, who served as chief of staff to Nikki Haley when she was ambassador to the U.N., said he doesn’t think Trump would use his U.N. speech to withdraw from the climate treaty. Such a move would be “trivial” compared to Trump’s focus on trade, investment and peace deals, Groves said.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said Trump would lay out a vision “for a safe, prosperous, peaceful America and the world” in his speech.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, our country is strong again, which has made the entire globe more stable,” Ingle said. “In only eight months, the President has brokered seven peace deals, secured historic trade deals and investments, and strengthened alliances across the world.”

The White House did not answer questions about whether the U.S. would withdraw from the UNFCCC or whether it was up for discussion.

‘Contrary to American interests’

The UNFCCC was ratified by then-President George H.W. Bush and supported by the Senate — one of the strongest commitments made by America to the climate fight. The United States’ connection to the Paris Agreement is more tenuous. Former President Barack Obama entered into partnership with that pact through an executive action, a move that has continued to irk conservatives.

If Trump does withdraw, it would raise questions about whether the U.S. could reenter the UNFCCC in the future.

Some legal experts say the Senate’s consent does not operate in perpetuity after the U.S. has left a treaty. Others argue that if a president can unilaterally leave a treaty that has earned support from two-thirds of the Senate, they could rejoin it without a new vote.

“Otherwise, you’re just handing this huge amount of power to a president to forever cancel the act of the Senate,” said Jean Galbraith, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written about treaties.

Regardless of the legal pathway, Galbraith said withdrawing from the treaty could pitch the global effort to grapple with rising temperatures into turmoil.

“First, it takes the United States out of the main forum for a crucial conversation about how to save our planet,” she said. “And second, it is a kind of potential path to a lot of instability going forward.”

Whether the review over quitting international fora has risen to Trump’s attention is unclear.

Eugene Chen, a senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation, said the U.S. could reshape global plans on energy and environment even if Trump decides against quitting the UNFCCC.

Staying in the treaty, he said, could “have the benefits of being able to influence discussions and gum up the works if they so choose.”

Brett Schaefer, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who produced his own assessment of which organizations he thinks the U.S. should leave, argued that Trump should withdraw from the UNFCCC in part because the U.S. is not behind the more substantive agreements it underpins, including the Paris Agreement.

“If the United States is not going to support the prescriptive agreements, that casts questions over whether we should be participating in that process,” he said.

The review that Trump ordered has made its way through the State Department, according to two former officials who were asked for input during the process about how different organizations and treaties have benefited the United States. That feedback fed into a spreadsheet containing the names of treaties and institutions that included questions about their costs and benefits and asked for quantitative rankings.

It’s unclear where the review stands now. Trump’s February executive order instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to deliver it to the White House by early August.

A State Department spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions about the status of the review.

“President Trump ordered a review of U.S. participation in and funding for international organizations to ensure U.S. investments in international organizations are not contrary to American interests,” the spokesperson said in an email.

The executive order also called for input from the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Mike Waltz, who was confirmed for the position Friday, indicated during his Senate hearing that he believes the U.S. is spending too much attention and money on U.N. initiatives, including on climate change.

“It’s quite a list,” Waltz said, adding, “I think it is incumbent on this administration to say, ‘What’s it doing?’”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ee/e2/55507aaa448b97ee7c46587e2f2a/trump-82212.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:08.137069

During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.” Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada.
Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.
Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.","Nevada is the only state in the nation that can deliver on every phase of the lithium life cycle – from mining to recycling.

Industry experts in the state say that selling point has the potential to make Nevada a leader in the lithium battery supply chain that powers everything from electric vehicles to the data centers driving AI growth.

Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo emphasized the importance of lithium for diversifying Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy at his second annual Nevada Lithium Summit Friday.

The lithium industry, however, has been hammered by falling prices in recent years due to softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally, which has made mining the metal in the U.S. less attractive to investors.

On the second day of the lithium summit, Politico reported the Department of Energy (DOE) was reevaluating a $2.3 billion loan to the Thacker Pass lithium project, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border. The energy agency cited the drop in price as a key factor in their rethink of the loan.

During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.”

Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices. Earlier this year, mining developer Ioneer Corp. lost a $490 million investment to their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County after their investing partner backed out of the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.

Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.

“Commodities ebb and flow,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a press conference at the summit.

Despite falling prices, Burns said Nevada’s position as the only state in the nation with a complete “Lithium Loop” that could offer mining and processing to battery manufacturing and recycling gave the state an edge for investment.

More investment from the federal government isn’t off the table, said Burns. President Donald Trump has made reducing foreign critical mineral dependency a major priority, citing national and economic security concerns. Nevada is poised to meet that need, said Burns.

“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” Burns said. “I think you’ll see that in Nevada.”

“Specifically, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy has an interest in making sure those are produced here,” Burns continued.

Nevada Battery Coalition CEO Caleb Cage said industry experts believe the growing demand for lithium and battery storage will increase and stabilize prices for the metal over the next decade.

“Looking at it long term, the remarkable demand for lithium in particular should have the market effect of adjusting that price to make some of these projects more viable,” Cage said.

“The demand for battery storage is only growing right now,” Cage said.

Growing battery storage demand has already boosted Nevada’s economy. A decade ago, about 100 people were employed in the battery manufacturing industry, according to GOED. In 2025, more than 14,200 were employed in the industry.

Manufacturing grew by about 83% in Nevada from 2015 to 2025, significantly more than the 13% national average. That growth was largely driven by the battery manufacturing industry boosted by electric vehicles and clean energy demands.

Several companies have invested in battery manufacturing and recycling facilities in Nevada, including Tesla and Redwood Materials.

Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.

Electricity demand in the U.S. has continued to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. Those data centers will need battery storage systems to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

Growing adoption of renewable energy sources, sustainability objectives, and need for energy efficiency is also driving the transition away from traditional lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion batteries in data centers.

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy to build low-cost energy-storage systems that can meet surging power demand from AI data centers. The company said it’s already powering a modular data center in Sparks, Nevada for AI infrastructure company Cursoe at an energy cost lower than the grid.

“They’ve got that proof of concept out in Northern Nevada right now, and that model is going to be something that they want to replicate,” Cage said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lithiumboom-1024x7681758542925.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=EFWYOxzu,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:41.716904

University of Exeter researchers studied 121 marmalade hoverflies that landed on an oil rig in the Britannia oil field.","Matt Weiner, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group Megafire Action, wants to bring some urgency back. This week, the organization launched a six-figure ad campaign in Washington, D.C., aimed at spurring senators to get back to working on wildfire resilience and forestry reform. Though the bill’s approach is divisive — the House version drew initial pushback from more than 100 environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and League of Conservation Voters, for opening up large tracts of federal forest to logging, among other concerns — Weiner told me “there’s no huge substantive holdup in the Senate that is keeping it from getting to 60 votes.”

I caught up with Weiner this week to learn more about where things stand with the Fix Our Forests Act and talk through some of the bill’s more controversial regulatory rollbacks. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Catch our readers up: Why the Fix Our Forests Act, and why now?

We’re looking at a generational opportunity to change the way we do land management. This is the most significant change Congress has considered since the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, and maybe even since the original National Forest Act.

The smoke impacts of wildfires are killing more people than the flames. Wildfires are the most significant driver of PM 2.5 emissions growth in the country right now. The clean air community has done a fantastic job of reducing industrial emissions of PM 2.5, which has had real public health impacts, but those gains are in danger of vanishing because of the growth of wildfire smoke exposure.

Then there’s the climate. If you care about carbon emissions, this is a huge opportunity at a time when a lot of other climate issues seem to be on the backburner. The 2020 fire season in California — a particularly bad year — released enough carbon to undo 20 years of the state’s emissions reduction progress. The 2023 Canadian wildfires, if treated as a country, would have been the third-largest emitter in the world that year. And if you start thinking about Alaska and the Boreal burning in the way the West has been burning, it could potentially be game over for the climate. It’s important that people understand that this is an existential climate issue and that we have an opportunity to make progress in a bipartisan way.

You and I have chatted before — we first spoke about the Fix Our Forests Act almost a year ago, now. What’s happened in the past 12 months with the bill?

The bill passed the House right after the Los Angeles fires. The last time we spoke [in October 2024], the bill had passed the House in the previous Congress with a bipartisan margin. But this time, it got a much bigger bipartisan show of support: 64 Democrats and all the Republicans in the House.

The bill saw some changes and improvements to focus on the immediate needs in Los Angeles County [after the January 2025 fires] — things like improving the ability of a city like Los Angeles to gain access to Community Wildfire Defense Grant funding and improvements to the Wildfire Intelligence Center targeted at making sure it plays a role in helping local governments make decisions on where to place assets before a high risk event.

Then the bill went to the Senate, but instead of moving the House bill through, a group of senators came together to write a bipartisan version with some changes. Senator Curtis from Utah was the lead, along with Senators Padilla, Hickenlooper, and Sheehy. Their version included changes to the litigation section from the House bill, which had raised concerns among a lot of environmental organizations, as well as modifications to the permitting section. That earned the bill the support of more environmental organizations than the version from the House — they have the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Audubon Society, and the National Wildlife Federation on board, as well as a lot of local organizations and wildfire groups like the Alliance for Wildfire Resilience.

But then a lot of the oxygen in the Senate was taken up by the reconciliation package. That put a pause on things through the August recess, and now they’re looking to hopefully mark up the bill during the October work period. We’re very optimistic about being able to get floor time. We think there’s a clear path to 60 votes in the Senate for this bill, and if there’s a good, constructive markup, it could be much more than that. There’s no substantive holdup as much as there is the ever-present fear of stasis and losing momentum. That’s why we launched an ad campaign with an eye toward building the urgency back up.

How did the ad campaign come together?

The idea was that this is a bipartisan issue, so where is the support? We didn’t need to launch a big persuasion campaign; we needed to highlight the absurdity of the fact that, eight months after Los Angeles, we still haven’t had any meaningful action from Congress. There is an opportunity before them that would make a big difference in wildfire policy writ large.

I’m interested in your focus on using “state-of-the-art science” and “new and innovative technologies” to address wildfires and forest health. What have you seen in this space that has made you excited?

The bill is about improving the planning and implementation of wildfire policy — especially mitigation work like treatment projects, but also in the built environment. A big cornerstone of that would be the creation of a new Wildfire Intelligence Center, which would use the most advanced technology to understand what our risk profile is on the ground across landscapes and jurisdictions. Right now, there is no one entity in government responsible for taking a comprehensive look at risk across landscapes, what we’re doing on the ground, and how that buys down risk.

At the same time, one of the things we’re negotiating is making sure that the Forest Service and the Department of Interior are positioned to work with some of the companies doing advanced modeling, detection, and tracking work — as opposed to having the government try to build its own clunky system. We’ve modeled it after successful efforts elsewhere in government, such as the Defense Innovation Unit and other Department of Defense and NASA programs that have been great at harnessing private sector innovation for government use. There’s also a new pilot program in the bill, in Section 303, that would create a pathway for the Forest Service to start identifying and piloting new technologies and give them a path to scale across the agency if they find that it helps them do the job better, faster, and cheaper.

The timber industry has collaborated with the Forest Service on fire suppression since the 1920s. In the decades since, “forest management” has at times been used as a euphemism for industry-friendly practices like tree thinning, which many ecologists say would allow invasive species and brush to flourish, and would actually worsen wildfires. How would cutting the red tape around “vegetation management activities” not be a handout to the timber industry?

We all know that the best tool for mitigation is good fire, prescribed fire, beneficial fire, and — where appropriate — managed fire, as well. Unfortunately, because we’ve taken fire out of these landscapes, forested landscapes in particular are so overgrown that you couldn’t introduce good fire even if you wanted to. So mechanical thinning has to be a part of this.

One of the tensions here is that the timber industry wants merchantable timber. They want the big trees, and in a lot of cases, those are the ones we want to keep in the ground with these projects. What we’re focused on is invasive species, overgrown areas, and dead trees from morbidity events like recent droughts so that we can reintroduce good fire at scale. If we all let it burn, like some have proposed, you’d end up with hundreds of thousands of acres of landscape burning at a time, like we saw in the [2021] Caldor fire, where nothing will grow back in a way we recognize for at least decades — and given climate change, maybe not ever.

It’s important to make sure that we don’t go back to the timber wars [of the 1980s and 1990s between environmentalists and loggers in the Pacific Northwest], but at the same time, we need to recognize that the biggest threat to our forests right now is catastrophic fire, not the timber industry. We want to deal with the threat at hand and make sure the pendulum that swung during the timber wars — for very good reason — against the timber industry comes back a little, but doesn’t swing too far in the wrong direction, either. The Senate bill strikes the right balance there.

A number of major environmental groups initially came out in opposition to the Fix Our Forests Act over numerous concerns, including that it erodes Endangered Species Act protections by exempting the Forest Service and BLM from the requirement to adjust land management policies as new information about how projects could affect threatened species arises. What is the other side of this tradeoff? How would limiting the consultation requirement advance the goal of reducing wildfires?

The biggest challenge right now is that, because of all of the regulatory hurdles, it can take upwards of a thousand days to get a project off the ground anywhere in the country. One great example of that is in the Angeles National Forest. They announced a fuel break maintenance strategy in 2020, but they were not able to get the requisite approvals until the start of December 2024. It took four years — and then the last of the permits that were most relevant to Altadena didn’t get approved until March, two months after the fire. There are very real consequences to this kind of delay, both for the environment and for human health and safety, that need to be taken into account.

If you take a step back and look at the bill, the main tool that it uses is not broad NEPA exemptions or writ-large changes in the law. It utilizes categorical exclusions, a method that has been used for energy projects in other areas and is increasingly sought after to advance targeted projects with public benefits.

One great example is the Tahoe categorical exclusion, on which a significant portion of this bill is based. It was a 10,000-acre CE created in 2016, which allowed for work that protected communities and ecosystems and got good fire on the ground. It’s work that directly saved South Lake Tahoe from the Caldor Fire. But one of the challenges right now is that the current level for CE is 3,000 acres, and when we’re talking about landscapes in forests that are hundreds of thousands of miles big and a fireshed that nationwide is 50 million acres, then 3,000 acres is not enough for it to be worth it for the Forest Service and Park Service and DOI officials to go through the CE process — which takes six months and is very rigorous.

But we also wanted to show restraint here for environmental purposes. We wanted to make sure that this was as targeted as it needed to be, and not overly expansive.

The decision drew swift blowback from climate groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which called the pipeline a “climate and affordability boondoggle.” The utility’s “own demand forecasts confirm there is no imminent reliability need — capacity is more than sufficient to meet peak demand well into the 2040s, even under unusually cold temperatures,” Chris Casey, the New York utility regulatory director at NRDC, said in a statement. “The Commission’s decision to signal its support for this fracked gas pipeline very likely contradicts state law, is not in the public interest, and will be vigorously challenged.”

2. California Democrat says Interior Department halted solar approvals

Representative Scott Peters, the Democrat who represents part of San Diego, accused the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management of halting permitting on solar projects in California. At a press conference Thursday to promote a bipartisan proposal he drafted along with the Colorado Republican Representative Gabe Evans to ease federal energy permitting, Peters said he had just been told that the agency would not approve any more panels. “It’s hard to get a deal unless we resolve that,” Peters said, according to a post on X from Politico reporter Joshua Siegel.

The proposal is a framework for a bill, essentially a blueprint of what members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus feel constitute reasonable compromises. For Republicans, the agreement offers fewer bureaucratic roadblocks to all kinds of new infrastructure, including gas pipelines. For Democrats, it charts a path for building more of the transmission lines that are key to adding more renewables to the grid. “It’s a big step to have our caucus, which is a pretty significant number of Republicans and Democrats, sign on to a pretty detailed set of policy principles,” Peters said. But as Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin wrote last month, “unless Democrats trust the Trump administration to actually allow renewables projects to go forward, his proposal could be dead on arrival.”

3. New climate tech coalition forms

On Thursday, a new coalition that includes Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, consulting giant McKinsey, and Stanford University’s Doerr School of Sustainability launched the Climate Tech Atlas. The proposal maps out ways to decarbonize different sectors of the economy, and lists priorities for innovation. The idea is not to eliminate potential solutions, Heatmap’s Katie Brigham reported in her scoop about the project, but rather “to enable the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, researchers, policymakers, and investors to really focus on where we felt there was the largest opportunity for exploration and for innovation to impact our path to net zero through the lens of technology,” according to Cooper Rinzler, a key collaborator on the initiative and a partner at the venture capital firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

4. Microsoft unveils ‘the world’s most powerful AI data center’ in Wisconsin

Microsoft has announced “the world’s most powerful AI data center” in southeastern Wisconsin. The project, called Fairwater, “is a seamless cluster of hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GB200s, connected by enough fiber to circle the Earth 4.5 times,” CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a post on X. “It will deliver 10x the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen.” He said Microsoft would match “all of the energy that is consumed with renewable sources.”

That power generation could prove more popular than the data center itself. Just 44% of American voters would support or strongly support a data center being built near them, while 42% would oppose or strongly oppose it, according to a Heatmap Pro poll Matthew covered last week. That mere 2% of net support compares to net support of 34% for a gas plant, 19% for a wind farm, 34% for a solar project, and 11% for batteries.

5. Climeworks inks largest-ever carbon removal deal with Schneider Electric

The carbon removal startup Climeworks just signed its largest-ever deal. By 2039, the Switzerland-based company, one of the biggest direct air capture developers in the world, agreed to suck 31,000 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere on behalf of Schneider Electric, the French industrial giant. Schneider said it remains committed to slashing the direct emissions from its operations by 90% in the next 25 years, and that this deal addresses “future neutralization needs while pursuing aggressive emissions reductions, and supporting the scale-up of an industry crucial for achieving net zero.” In a statement, Schneider’s sustainability chief Esther Finidori said that “both carbon removal and carbon reduction are fundamental to achieving our climate goals, as well as those of the planet.” For Climeworks, the deal is a “milestone,” said CEO Christoph Gebald.

THE KICKER

The speed of climate change may be throwing the insect world out of whack. But a new study has put offshore oil rigs in the North Sea to work identifying the vital role a migratory insect plays. University of Exeter researchers studied 121 marmalade hoverflies that landed on an oil rig in the Britannia oil field. The rig off the coast of Scotland was far from any vegetation or land, so the pollen found on 92% of hoverflies “shows they can transport pollen over great distances, potentially linking plant populations that are hundreds of kilometers apart,” according to a press release. “By analysing the pollen samples and wind patterns, we estimate that many of the hoverflies had flown from places including the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark — over 500 kilometers away,” Toby Doyle, Exeter’s Centre for Ecology and Conservation in Cornwall, said in a statement.

Speaking at the 6th CII International Energy Conference & Exhibition, Joshi said the milestone was achieved five years ahead of schedule. “We have already achieved over 50 per cent of our installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, and we have done it 5 years ahead of the timeline. We have also crossed 50 per cent of the 500 GW target (252 GW),” he said.

The minister said nearly 20 lakh households had benefitted from solar under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana and that schemes such as PM-KUSUM and PM-JANMAN had enabled farmers and villages to access solar pumps and off-grid power. “We are not just giving people free electricity, we are empowering them to become energy producers,” he said.

On investments, Joshi said his ministry had secured commitments worth ₹32.45 lakh crore from banks and industry for clean energy initiatives. He added that insurance surety bonds had been permitted as an alternative to earnest money deposits and performance bank guarantees for renewable projects.

He said India had achieved an installed module manufacturing capacity of more than 100 GW. “So far, almost ₹50,000 crore has been invested under the PLI scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules, creating more than 12,600 direct jobs,” he said.

Joshi said the government had set a target of achieving domestically manufactured solar cells by 2028, along with a plan for wafers and ingots. “I have also given my ministry clear directions to come up with a trajectory for domestic polysilicon production,” he said.

On tariff levels, Joshi said Madhya Pradesh had recently discovered a price of ₹2.70 per unit for solar with battery storage and ₹2.15 per unit without storage in auctions. “Today, solar-plus battery is costing much less than thermal power,” he said.

This edition of Projects Weekly is highlighting several new solar projects in development in the United States and Canada, plus a healthy dose of financing news. We start off with news from Catalyze, which partnered with CS Energy to develop 27 MW of distributed solar projects in New York. Plus, PowerBank is expected to receive interconnection results soon on three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, while the company also has secured all required municipal approvals for two brownfield solar projects in Skaneateles, New York.

On the financing front, Macquarie Asset Management has committed $350 million to support Nexamp’s utility-scale solar and battery storage expansion in the United States; and Soluna has secured $100 million from Generate Capital to expand green data centers.

Finally, air conditioning manufacturer Daikin has tapped ENGIE to advance the company’s unified solar power strategy across Texas.

Catalyze adds 4 new community solar projects to New York

Catalyze has completed four community solar projects in central and western New York. Developed in partnership with CS Energy, the 27 MW of solar energy adds to Catalyze’s robust New York footprint, helping the state reach its goal of installing 6 GW of distributed solar ahead of schedule.

The projects leveraged standardized design, a consistent racking system, and trusted subcontractor relationships, allowing the Catalyze and CS Energy teams to accelerate schedules and bring power online. At the same time, construction access and laydown areas were carefully managed so that farmland could return to its pre-existing condition, allowing landowners to continue farming outside the solar arrays. These four completed sites represent the first half of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze and CS Energy. The remaining projects, totaling more than 25 MW, are scheduled for completion over the next year.

Cool factor: The four projects — located in Pavilion, Phelps, Fonda, and Fabius, New Yrok — were designed to integrate seamlessly with the local grid and built with prevailing wage labor, supporting both reliability and clean energy workforce development. The installations were supported by New York State programs, including the Inclusive Community Solar Adder and the Community Adder, which help ensure reliable energy access to low-to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers and disadvantaged communities.

“This milestone is about more than megawatts, it’s about taking action,” said Andrew D’Amico, chief operating officer at Catalyze. “We are seeing businesses move fast to lock in the long-term benefits and cost advantages of solar power while federal tax credits are still in place, with states offering incentives designed to expand access.”

The timing of these projects highlights the importance of acting quickly to secure federal tax incentives. Current solar investment tax credits cover 30% of project costs, with potential bonuses of 10% for domestic content and an additional 10% for projects in designated energy communities.

PowerBank makes progress on solar projects in Nova Scotia and New York

PowerBank Corp. expects receive interconnection results within the next 30 days for three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, plus the company has secured all required municipal approvals for two brownfield solar developments in Skaneateles, New York.

The three projects in Nova Scotia, located in Sydney, Brooklyn, and West Petpeswick, are owned by AI Renewable Flow-through Fund and PowerBank is the lead developer and builder. If the interconnection results are positive and the projects are financially feasible, the PowerBank expects to begin construction in the Spring of 2026. PowerBank will partner with local Nova Scotia engineering firm, Trimac Engineering, to deliver the projects. Over the projects’ lifetimes, they will generate up to a combined $6.95 million in electricity savings for the local communities.

The two projects in New York are located on industrial brownfield sites in Skaneateles, which is in the state’s Finger Lakes Region, in Onondaga County. The projects have secured all required municipal approvals, including variances, site plan approval and special use permit. The projects will now pursue NY Department of Environmental Conservation approval to enter construction.

Cool factor: The Canadian Federal government and the Province of Nova Scotia are very supportive of Community Solar, with a number of incentives, including the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program (SREPs), Indigenous-Led Clean Energy Stream, and the Low Carbon Communities program.

Following receipt of the necessary permits and financing for the two New Projects, PowerBank intends to commence the construction. Once completed, each of the sites will be operated as a community solar project.

Macquarie Asset Management commits $350 million to support Nexamp projects

Macquarie Asset Management has facilitated $350 million of long-term financing to Nexamp Inc. to support the construction of the company’s first utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.

“We believe this relationship will allow the team to realize rapid success in the utility-scale energy transition market,” said Harlan Cherniak, head of Americas infrastructure debt at Macquarie Asset Management. “Through this $350 million facility, we will continue to solidify our credit and insurance division as a global leader in the infrastructure and asset-based credit market.”

In a separate transaction, Nexamp raised additional development capital from Nomura to advance earlier-stage project development and sustain its robust national pipeline of utility-scale opportunities.

Cool factor: Macquarie’s financing will facilitate the construction of more than 1 GWac of solar and storage projects across the high-demand MISO, ERCOT and NYISO markets, while Nomura’s capital will advance development activities in MISO, NYISO and PJM, three of the nation’s fastest-growing regions for utility-scale renewables. Nexamp’s long-term expertise in greenfield development of commercial distributed generation assets will complement its successful development of new utility-scale projects.

“These financings, secured from two world-class partners, ensure that Nexamp can both deliver on the near-term buildout of utility-scale solar and storage and invest in the development pipeline that will power the next phase of growth,” said Zaid Ashai, chairman and CEO of Nexamp. “This is about building a durable platform that meets the country’s rising demand for easy-to-deploy, more affordable energy.”

Soluna secures $100 million to expand green data centers

Soluna Holdings Inc. has closed on a scalable credit facility in an amount of up to $100 million from Generate Capital. The initial $12.6 million draw will fund refinancing and construction of active data center projects, with additional capital support for Soluna’s 1 GW and expanding pipeline.

“We believe this deal with Generate primes Soluna for scale,” said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. “We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution. We’ve known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.”

Cool factor: This financing follows over $30 million in funding raised earlier in 2025 from Galaxy Digital, Spring Lane Capital, and a recent public offering. The new agreement adds further momentum to Soluna’s execution roadmap, as the recent addition of 150 MW Projects Gladys and 100 MW Fei pushes the company past 1 gigawatt of renewable computing capacity.

This milestone builds on the recent 48 MW expansion underway at Project Dorothy 2 and the start of construction of Project Kati 1. Soluna also intends to expand its computing offerings beyond Bitcoin mining to include AI workloads, reflecting the growing demand for green computing across various industries.

Daikin selects ENGIE to advance unified solar strategy across Texas

Air conditioning manufacturer Daikin has signed a five-year agreement with ENGIE North America to power all of the company’s Texas facilities with 100% renewable electricity, including the Daikin Texas Technology Park (DTTP), home to its largest manufacturing site and North American headquarters.

“This initiative represents a major step forward in aligning our operations with Daikin’s long-term sustainability goals,” said Mike Knights, senior VP of procurement at Daikin. “By working with ENGIE, a global leader in the energy transition, we’re securing clean electricity for our Texas operations while reinforcing our environmental responsibility goals. The initiative facilitates a transparent, traceable connection between operational energy use and a certified renewable energy source.”

Cool factor: Under the agreement, Daikin will source renewable electricity from the Impact Solar project in North Texas, which is owned and operated by a third party and has been in commercial operation since 2021. This relationship brings Daikin closer to its goal of making the DTTP a Net Zero Factory by 2030 and supports the company’s global Environmental Vision 2050.

This milestone builds on Daikin’s recent installation of a solar array at DTTP, which powers the facility’s central chiller plant and supports grid integration. Together, these efforts reflect a broader strategy shaped by a two-year collaboration with ForeFront Power to evaluate energy usage, sustainability goals, and procurement planning. The result is a forward-looking approach that advances Daikin’s environmental goals while reinforcing its leadership in sustainable manufacturing and corporate responsibility within the HVAC industry.

The center-mounted 140-kWh battery pack provides lower center of gravity, improving handling dynamics while the 800-volt electrical architecture enables rapid DC fast charging compatibility. These aren't simply automotive electric technologies grafted onto an RV – they represent purpose-built solutions for the unique demands of motorhomes.

What truly differentiates this product is its holistic approach to electrification. Beyond just propulsion, the Embark addresses the broader energy ecosystem of RV life with bidirectional power capability that allows it to function as a home backup power source – transforming the RV from a recreational asset into a practical emergency resource. The integration of range extender technology solves the critical infrastructure challenge of limited charging networks in remote recreation areas.

The phased commercialization approach is particularly noteworthy. By first introducing the Embark through THL's rental fleet in 2026, THOR creates a controlled feedback loop for product refinement before full-scale production, significantly reducing market risk.

California will not replace the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit, with Gov. Gavin Newsom citing budget constraints and prioritizing infrastructure over direct subsidies.

Automakers lose hoped-for state relief, as companies like Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen had urged California to offer a $5,000 incentive to offset the federal rollback.

Newsom escalates tensions with automakers, accusing GM and CEO Mary Barra of leading efforts against California’s 2035 gas car ban, while leaving open the possibility of a future state credit funded through carbon-trading revenue.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday the state will not replace the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit set to expire Sept. 30, reversing an earlier pledge to restart California’s own subsidies. The decision removes what automakers had hoped would be the nation’s largest state-level incentive in the country’s top EV market.

Newsom, speaking in San Francisco, said the state cannot offset the loss of federal support, calling the phaseout “federal vandalism.” Instead, he told California that it will direct resources toward expanding charging infrastructure rather than direct purchase subsidies.

The announcement delivers a blow to EV makers such as Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, which had urged state leaders to create a $5,000 incentive to soften the impact of the federal rollback. California accounted for about 27% of all EV sales in the United States last year, positioning it as the most critical market for continued consumer adoption.

Newsom’s reversal follows a pledge made in 2024 to backfill the federal program if it were eliminated. However, California’s growing budget deficit derailed those plans. The state ended its previous EV tax credit program in 2023 and now falls outside the group of 17 states still offering some form of incentive, according to the Tax Foundation.

The governor also aimed at Detroit automakers, singling out General Motors and CEO Mary Barra. Newsom accused GM of “selling out” California by leading efforts in Congress to block the state’s 2035 ban on new gasoline-powered vehicle sales. California regulators had estimated the ban would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 35%.

Despite the setback, the governor’s office said California could revive its EV subsidy program next year.

And New York assemblymember Emily Gallagher previewed a state bill she will introduce next week aimed at helping renters access solar panels.","Hundreds of environmentalists gathered in New York City’s Stuyvesant Square Park and a nearby Quaker meeting house on Sunday to rally in support of solar power and other forms of renewable energy. The event was part of a national “day of action” billed Sun Day, founded by veteran environmental activist Bill McKibben and first Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes.

“It’s so sad to watch the sun going to waste,” McKibben said at a press conference, standing beside environmentalists and their children. “Every single day, energy from heaven going to waste while we drill down to hell for another dose of the stuff that is wrecking this planet.”

McKibben was joined at the press conference by other activists, as well as officials from New York and his home state of Vermont.

“We have the ability here to protect our children, to protect our future,” said New York’s lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.

The event in the park followed an all-afternoon celebration of clean power, with displays of solar panels, child-friendly lessons on renewable technology, and panel discussions. One popular panel featured McKibben and New York City’s comptroller, Brad Lander.

In other parts of the country, activists held more than 500 other actions meant to highlight the creative ways Americans are ditching fossil-based energy. In Virginia, volunteers climbed rooftops to install solar panels on affordable homes built by Habitat for Humanity. In North Carolina, families gathered at a farm powered by solar panels. And in Michigan, organizers held a car show to show off electric vehicles; families also held a beach clean up nearby.

Renewable energy sources have seen unprecedented growth in recent years. Last year, they accounted for over 90% of total energy expansion globally, one analysis found. And the US generated less than half of its energy from fossil fuels for the first time this past March.

Yet the day of action came amid unprecedented attacks on climate protections and the renewable energy transition by the Trump administration. Since January, his administration has rolled back grants for solar, kicked off an all-of-government approach to shut down wind, halted and delayed wind projects, and launched more than 150 other anti-environmental and anti-renewable energy actions. The plans are threatening not only the climate but also Americans’ pocketbooks, said Vermont senator Peter Welch.

“Clean energy is really good for affordability. It lowers the utility bills people are struggling to pay and creates really good jobs,” Welch said in an interview. “What Trump is doing is wrecking that economic potential. Customers are going to get hammered.”

Despite these attacks, the event had an overall air of optimism. McKibben said though the US is backsliding on climate progress, much of the rest of the world is continuing to build out renewable power.

“The pattern around the world is unmistakable,” he said in an interview. “The reason that it’s happening is partly because of the climate crisis but also largely because this is the cheapest form of energy, and it’s getting cheaper every year.”

The Sun Day action came ahead of Climate Week in New York City, an annual event that convenes government officials, corporate actors and activists for a vast array of climate-focused events. It also came one day after the “Make Billionaires Pay” march, for which 25,000 people took to the streets in New York City.

“Billionaires caused the climate chaos, spearheaded the rise of authoritarianism and they continue to profit from our suffering. But they forgot one thing: there are more of us than there are of them,” said Renata Pumarol, an organizer with the environmental justice non-profit Climate Defenders, in a statement about the Saturday protest.

Sun Day participants did not shy away from naming the fossil fuel companies who have been the primary cause of global warming. But it focused largely on solutions aimed at taking on the climate crisis instead of the actors behind it.

McKibben, for instance, praised Utah’s move three months ago to legalize the installation of solar panels on balconies – something that is illegal in all other US states. And New York assemblymember Emily Gallagher previewed a state bill she will introduce next week aimed at helping renters access solar panels.

At the press conference, McKibben noted that though the forecast for Sunday showed cloudy skies, the day was bright and warm.

“The collective power of all of us is enough to bring out the sun,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d71054d057f5e482367ccf359dae619d853207/604_2_4225_3380/master/4225.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0dc6f8d6e142adbaf64c470df97db4a1",N,,2025-09-22 08:59:45.433155

By Marcel Suri, CEO and Co-founder of Solargis

Extreme weather poses a serious threat to the solar energy industry. Higher occurrence of events such as heavy rainfall, fast changing sunny and cloudy weather, snow storms, hurricanes, high atmospheric pollution and hailstorms can significantly disrupt energy generation and cause material damage to PV systems.

In all cases, there are serious financial consequences for PV power plant operators and investors.

The growing pressure is on the US solar industry, too. Throughout the United States, more frequently climate patterns take the form of unusually warm weather, flash floods, wildfires, strong winds, and severe thunderstorms.

To ensure systems are designed and prepared to withstand harsher, less predictable conditions, PV developers must gain a deeper understanding of power supply fluctuations and model them accurately in real time to minimize potential losses.

What the numbers show

At Solargis, we conduct an annual analysis of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) difference, comparing each year’s data against the long-term averages (LTA) – data that directly impacts the performance of solar power plants.

Our 2024 findings reveal significant increases and decreases in solar irradiation across various US regions. For example, an extreme heatwave affected states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. We also observed unusually intense solar irradiation in moderate regions like the Midwest and Northeast, including the Great Lakes area.

These were not isolated events.

Other regions experienced climate-related disruptions too, including wildfires, which burned over one million acres of land in California alone, and late-season snowstorms in the northern Rocky Mountains. In October last year, a tornado significantly damaged a 45MW Lake Placid Solar Power Plant in Florida, shortly before Hurricane Milton hit the area.

Harnessing the power of data

The key to understanding how climate-related events affect PV system performance lies in the granularity and accuracy of the data used to model and simulate solar conditions.

Most solar simulation software today still relies on hourly Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. These datasets consolidate weather conditions from multiple past years into a single ‘typical’ year, capturing average solar and temperature patterns.

However, TMY fails to reflect real-world variability – whether short-term (intra-hourly) or interannual (year-to-year natural variability cycles). The limited temporal resolution and historical depth of TMY data mean that simulations based on it often overlook these ‘non-typical’ events and fail to account for critical operational risks.

This disconnect between simulation and reality can only be addressed through PV modeling based on higher-resolution datasets. Time Series data, which offers 15-minute granularity over multiple decades, enables significantly more accurate assessments of PV system behavior. But improved datasets alone are not enough – solar developers also need sophisticated software solutions capable of processing and interpreting this data effectively.

Protecting and empowering solar developers and investors

In a future shaped by more challenging weather events, the solar industry cannot afford to rely on legacy approaches. Forward-looking companies must embrace a new standard of modeling – one grounded in real-world physics and supported by data that reflects the full range of environmental conditions a PV power plant encounters.

High-resolution datasets, when paired with advanced simulation software, equip developers and investors with the insights needed to:

Predict weather-related impacts more accurately,

Create more robust designs, plan preventive operation and mitigate downtime,

Improve system resilience and operational efficiency, and

Strengthen confidence among insurers and financial stakeholders.

As the US solar sector faces the mounting challenges of climate volatility, access to granular, long-term data will become indispensable.

Understanding irradiance variability – and being able to model it accurately – is essential for protecting assets, securing investment, and maintaining consistent energy production.

Bob Mumgaard, Co-founder and CEO of CFS, said: “The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid.
As energy demand grows, Eni supports the development of fusion power as a new energy paradigm capable of producing clean, safe, and virtually inexhaustible energy.
This international partnership confirms our commitment to making fusion energy a reality, promoting its industrialization for a more sustainable energy future.”","Italian energy company Eni announced today that it has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) worth more than $1 billion with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), to offtake energy from CFS’ first commercial fusion plant, which is anticipated to come online in Chesterfield County, Virginia in the early 2030s.

Fusion, the process of combining two atoms to form a single atom to release energy, has been long referred to as the “Holy Grail” of clean and abundant energy production, given its potential to produce power from hydrogen – the most common element in the universe – without producing carbon emissions associated with fossil-fuel based power, and without the highly radioactive output of nuclear fission processes. Large scale fusion energy generation has been elusive, however, given the need to create extremely high temperatures and pressure.

Spun out of MIT in 2018, Massachusetts-based CFS is working to develop the world’s first net-energy positive – i.e., producing more energy than it consumes – fusion device, to prove and scale the production of fusion energy. The company is currently collaborating with MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center to build SPARC, the precursor to CFS’s first commercial plant, ARC, which the company expects to be the first grid-scale fusion power plant in the world.

CFS recently raised more than $860 million in a Series B2 fundraising round to advance the commercialization of its fusion technology. The new PPA with Eni follows an offtake agreement recently signed with Google.

Bob Mumgaard, Co-founder and CEO of CFS, said:

“The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid. It is a big vote of confidence to have Eni, who has contributed to our execution since the beginning, buy the power we intend to make in Virginia. Our fusion power attracts diverse customers across the world — from hyperscalers to traditional energy leaders — because of the promise of clean, almost limitless energy.”

Eni was an early investor in CFS in 2018, and the company increased its investment in CFS’ recent financing round. In 2023 Eni and CFS signed a Collaboration Framework Agreement to accelerate fusion energy development, with the collaboration spanning areas including operational and technological support project execution through the sharing of methodologies learned from the energy industry, and relationships with stakeholders.

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said:

“Eni has been strengthening its collaboration with CFS through its technological know-how since it first invested in the company in 2018.

California Stands to Lose the Most Among all U.S. states, California faces the steepest drop if the federal EV tax credit ends.
The scale of California’s reliance on the tax credit is a direct reflection of its aggressive push toward clean energy and transportation alternatives.
Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana are cited as regions where the EV credit had minimal impact in the first place.
The disappearance of the federal tax credit could force these companies to rethink pricing strategies or cut back production plans to match reduced demand.","Over the past few years, the federal EV tax credit has played a crucial role in boosting electric vehicle ownership. Buyers of new electric cars have received an average benefit of $6,700, while those opting for used models claimed around $3,400. In total, Americans claimed $3.3 billion in new EV credits and $95.6 million for used EVs in 2023 alone. This direct financial relief helped make EVs more appealing in a country where gasoline-powered vehicles still dominate.

At the same time, the national market for electric vehicles remains relatively modest. According to Supercar Blondie, EVs accounted for just 1.7 percent of all light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 2023, even with the tax credit in place. While that figure marked a slight increase from the previous year’s 1.2 percent, the overall momentum remains fragile, with new EV sales actually falling by 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

California Stands to Lose the Most

Among all U.S. states, California faces the steepest drop if the federal EV tax credit ends. The state, which has long led the country in EV adoption, could miss out on approximately $1.1 billion in incentives. Texas follows with nearly $273 million at stake, and Florida comes next, potentially losing around $201 million in benefits.

The scale of California’s reliance on the tax credit is a direct reflection of its aggressive push toward clean energy and transportation alternatives. But as reported by Supercar Blondie, without this financial support, the affordability of EVs could plummet for thousands of consumers, forcing many to delay or abandon electric vehicle purchases altogether.

In contrast, some states may barely register the change. Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana are cited as regions where the EV credit had minimal impact in the first place. With fewer residents investing in electric vehicles, the loss of the credit in these areas is unlikely to disrupt local markets in any significant way.

Drop in Sales Hints at Waning Momentum

Even before the scheduled end of the credit, EV sales have started to show signs of strain. Nationwide sales of new electric vehicles fell by 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same timeframe in the previous year. This downturn suggests a growing hesitation among buyers, potentially tied to the looming expiration of financial incentives.

The trend is especially concerning considering the relatively low base from which EV adoption is growing. At just 1.7 percent of light-duty vehicles, EVs still occupy a small slice of the U.S. automotive market. Without the continued nudge from federal credits, that slice may shrink even further—particularly in areas with limited infrastructure or weak local incentives.

This softening in consumer demand also places pressure on automakers, many of which have expanded their EV lineups in response to environmental goals and evolving regulations. The disappearance of the federal tax credit could force these companies to rethink pricing strategies or cut back production plans to match reduced demand.

Uneven State Infrastructure Could Widen the Gap

The disparity in how different states will be affected by the credit’s end points to deeper structural differences across the country. States like California, Texas, and Florida have made significant investments not only in EV adoption but also in charging infrastructure, public awareness, and state-level incentives. These efforts have created more favorable environments for electric vehicles.

On the other hand, states with limited charging networks or weak policy support may struggle even more to attract EV buyers once the federal incentive is gone. As noted in the same source, this could leave automakers with a “patchwork market,” where progress is clustered in specific regions while others remain stagnant.

The lack of a consistent national strategy means the EV market could fracture along state lines. LendingTree’s analysis, as cited in the article, warns that in the absence of federal support, areas without strong local programs will see demand slow even further, exacerbating the already uneven rollout of electric transportation.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EV-charging-.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:48.262034

With about a week and a half left before the next fiscal year begins, don’t hold your breath on anything happening soon to avoid a government shutdown.

President Donald Trump’s latest comments about negotiating with Democrats are a reminder of the difference between a get-together and getting together. “I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” Trump told reporters over the weekend. “They want all this stuff, they haven’t changed, they haven’t learned from the biggest beating they’ve ever taken, just about.”

Visa Fee Faces Likely Challenges

Trump signed a proclamation Friday that would move to extensively overhaul the H-1B visa program, requiring a $100,000 fee for applications in a bid to curb overuse. The fee, however, flouts clear requirements of federal immigration law and will invite immediate lawsuits, attorneys say.

The fee, which took effect Sunday, could also have devastating effects on businesses that expected to add workers through the specialty occupation visa program this fall. It would be imposed as a condition of US entry for foreign workers hired through the H-1B program popular with the tech sector, although it’s unclear what it would mean for visa holders already in the country.

Redistricting Begins Today in Two States

Two more states are starting the process of revising congressional district lines, Greg Giroux reports.

Ohio’s constitution requires a new map because the one put in place after the 2020 Census wasn’t bipartisan and therefore had to be temporary. A likely scenario there is for the Republican-dominated legislature to miss a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a map supported by a majority of both parties. That would trigger action by the GOP-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission, with an Oct. 31 deadline to approve new lines in a bipartisan vote. If it doesn’t, the legislature could do its own, at the risk of lawsuits under anti-gerrymandering constitutional provisions. Don’t expect anything to get settled quickly there.

Utah is going to move faster. The state’s Legislative Redistricting Committee will hold two public meetings this week and publish a proposed map on Thursday. It’s revising the state’s four-district map after a judge ruled that the legislature unconstitutionally repealed and replaced a voter-approved anti-gerrymandering initiative. Read More

Kirk Aftermath

In the days before yesterday’s memorial service for slain activist Charlie Kirk, the head of the FCC changed the national conversation around that killing by saying there could be repercussions against ABC for comments made about Kirk’s supporters by late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called that “mafioso” behavior, and another GOP senator now has added to the criticism. Kentucky’s Rand Paul (R) said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the media regulator “has got no business weighing in on this.”

“Any attempt by the government to get involved with speech, I will fight,” Paul said.

Trump and other Republicans have supported the push on broadcasters. “The FCC has a responsibility to call balls and strikes,” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said on Fox News Sunday. Read More

Eye on Tariffs

US companies are being pitted against each other over how tariffs should apply to their products. Businesses are able to suggest that their competitors’ products be subject to tariffs through a process that so far has produced lopsided results, Isabel Gottlieb reports.

Earlier this year, the Commerce Department granted virtually all requests to tariff certain products not already falling under another tariff measure or investigation. No rebuttals arguing against them were granted.

The filings in the tariff cases show the complexity of the arguments for protecting US factory production this way. LG Electronics wrote that raising the price of imported household appliances would lead to lower demand, “directly undermining the very type of domestic manufacturing capacity these tariffs are meant to protect.” Read More

Did You Ace the Quiz?

Give yourself a star if you selected Option B — No pricing data required. Though typically required on proposals worth $2 million or more, for Golden Dome the contracting officer is tasked with determining if a vendor “is not likely to offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.”

The other quiz choices are there to entertain procurement professionals. It’s common for companies that lose out on a contract to have future opportunities (Option A) and for proposals to include subcontracting plans (Option C).

As for cybersecurity standards (Option D), BGOV analysts Maika Ito and Paul Murphy flag that that even though the Pentagon’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification doesn’t take effect department-wide until Nov. 10, those meeting Golden Dome’s Oct. 10 bidding deadline also will have to comply.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Governors of more than a quarter of U.S. states are pushing for greater influence over the country's biggest power grid -- PJM Interconnection -- where electricity prices are surging as demand driven by AI data centers outpaces the connection of new supplies.

Rising power bills in PJM, which operates the grid covering 13 states and the District of Columbia, or one in five Americans, have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid.

The group of state leaders plans to announce the ""PJM Governors' Collaborative"" on Monday during a summit in Philadelphia to advocate for their interests in PJM, a member-run organization in which states do not have a vote, according to a person familiar with the plans.

""Among the first ideas the PJM Governors’ Collaborative will discuss at the summit will be historic reforms to PJM governance to give the states a larger role in decision-making moving forward,"" the source said.

Ballooning prices in PJM have been caused by a confluence of factors, including the cost to produce and transport electricity and a surge in demand brought by Big Tech data centers. PJM's territory holds the largest concentration of energy-intensive data centers in the world.

Capacity payments, which are made to power plant operators to guarantee they run during periods of spiking demand to avoid blackouts, are a piece of power bills in the region.

Those payments, determined by annual energy auctions, have risen by about 1,000% over the last two auctions on the projected rise of data center demand coupled with largely stagnating power supply.

PJM is governed by a board of managers, and its voting members include transmission line owners and independent power plant operators.

While states are not given a vote, they have wielded their power over PJM in other ways. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro led a successful push to put a price ceiling and floor on PJM's most recent capacity auction.

Governors are seeking a more formal role in shaping PJM that might be modeled after similar groups in Midwest and New England grids, a source familiar said.

Shapiro, who runs the biggest electricity-producing state in the PJM region, plans to discuss issues including the PJM stakeholder process, market reforms, connecting new power supplies faster and increasing transparency in PJM, according to a release by the governor's office.

The deployments come as renewables, which are tied to many battery projects, are under pressure in the U.S.
Made-in-America challenges While grid batteries emerged from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act with a preserved tax credit, the law is still creating headwinds for the industry.
A wild card for grid batteries is how much domestic manufacturing may step up to get around the FEOC restrictions.
“You don’t need that big of a change in EV demand to really create plenty of opportunities” for grid battery production, she said.","A clean energy technology often linked with renewables is notching record growth in President Donald Trump’s America, encroaching on fossil fuels even in the Texas oil patch.

Batteries that can store and release big amounts of electricity are increasingly connecting to the electricity grid and major industrial projects like data centers, even without the federal grants and loans offered in the Biden administration.

Those batteries are providing critical backup to the wind and solar industries that Republicans routinely chastise as unreliable — and this year stripped of grants and long-term tax cuts.

“This year is looking extremely strong now with some projects moving ahead quicker than anticipated,” said Allison Weis, global head of storage at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Batteries are expected to account for roughly a quarter of all installations to the grid this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, with storage costs projected to decline substantially in the coming years. In the second quarter of this year, battery installations were 63 percent higher than the same period last year, according to the American Clean Power Association.

All together, the battery market is threatening plans for new natural gas, diesel and coal plants. The reason is simple: Batteries allow companies to store and use power when they need it. That means a data center developer can store solar-generator electricity and use it at night, instead of relying on a fossil fuel plant, like a gas peaker, to step up.

“Batteries and solar are like peanut butter and jelly,” said Mark Dyson, managing director for carbon-free electricity with the environmental group RMI. “There’s a natural diurnal cycle to the sun, obviously, and also therefore to how batteries are going to be operating most economically.”

In deep-red Texas, the battery buzz is growing louder.

“We’re really trying to change the game,” Jon Parrella, the Houston area-based chief executive officer for battery firm Terraflow Energy, said in an interview. “We can get data centers online faster without having to have the grid infrastructure change as massively as everybody thinks [it needs].”

Several factors are driving private investment. Many companies are looking to batteries to meet clean energy pledges — and power demand growth forecasts not witnessed in the U.S. for decades, driven in large part by a scramble to stand up artificial intelligence data centers. Developers are also seizing on batteries to bypass sluggish permitting for new large projects like power plants.

Meanwhile, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the marquee Republican legislation this year that cut wind and solar subsidies, delivered a win for batteries, preserving a key tax credit through 2033.

And signs of trouble in fossil fuel markets are also spurring battery growth. Natural gas prices are projected to rise in the coming years, while low crude oil prices are forecast to stymie U.S. production.

Cutting carbon emissions

Parella’s company is developing a project in Bellville, west of Houston, using vanadium flow batteries. That’s a type of battery technology often considered long-duration energy storage (LDES) because they can discharge electricity for up to 10 hours or more. Other long-duration technologies include iron-air batteries and even pumped hydropower storage.

A separate Terraflow project on the Gulf Coast in the Port of Victoria is also advancing. Project partner Optimus Technology Group is planning to use Terraflow batteries at data center projects in Texas, Arizona, Ohio and other states, according to Keith Borie, vice president at Optimus.

The long-duration systems differ from lithium-ion batteries, which are more prevalent today but discharge for shorter periods of time and pose some risks for leakage and fires.

Parella says batteries are competing with “thermal” power generation, a reference to fossil fuels.

“From a carbon footprint, the biggest thing and impact we have is we significantly reduce the need for thermal generation of data centers,” he said. “They do not have to fire up anywhere near as much, and it gives us the ability to significantly reduce that footprint.”

Terraflow is just one company in a broad battery market in the U.S. that’s racing to catch up with global competitors.

“We are way behind other countries in terms of electrification and moving away from fossil-based economies,” said Anna Siefken, a former DOE official under Biden who now is North America policy and markets lead at the industry association LDES Council. “We have to make the market.”

Lithium-ion batteries, similar to technology in smartphones and electric vehicles, currently dominate the market.

They have changed how the grid operates over the past several years, increasingly providing power when demand surges, such as during evening hours in California when the sun is no longer shining. That differs from initial uses of batteries a decade ago to provide power mainly during small disruptions.

Among the biggest players are Tesla, whichunveiled a new grid battery product last week called Megablock, which combines four existing batteries around a transformer. The company is promising deliveries next year and claims it can reduce construction costs by preengineering the system in the factory, so it can plug easily into the grid.

“Lithium ion has gotten so cheap … it’s almost easier to just add more lithium batteries than to try and switch to a different technology,” said Weis.

As one example, a new battery complex on Oahu, Hawaii, began operating last year with Tesla Megapacks to replace power lost from the state’s last retired coal plant.

Skepticism at DOE

While Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said he supports long-duration storage, he also is critical of renewables.

“We need more affordable energy storage,” Wright said recently at the Council on Foreign Relations, arguing that batteries increase the costs of renewables “five- to fifteen-fold.”

“We don’t have a practical way to firm wind and solar today,” he said, referring to power that can be supplied 24 hours a day.

Battery proponents point to skyrocketing power costs from gas and coal plants during periods of highest demand. Meanwhile, they say batteries and renewables alone are not likely to fully power grids anytime soon, arguing that some gas peaker plants will continue to be important contributions to the grid.

Dyson said it would be “ridiculously expensive” to power grids with only renewables and batteries “because you’d need to oversize all three of those resources to a level that is untenable.”

“Nobody is asking for or suggesting that wind or solar should be 24-7 resources,” he said. “No resource is 24-7 — even so-called baseload power plants have frequent outages that are incredibly disruptive when they occur.”

But experts say Wright’s downbeat comments on batteries don’t match their increasing market penetration.

“Almost all of the planned capacity in Texas is solar and storage, so it must be penciling out for those developers,” said Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Otherwise, you’d be building gas plants.”

“You could have a stampede that’s going over a cliff. I don’t think that’s true in the electricity markets,” he said.

DOE’s loan office is continuing to finance an Eos Energy Enterprises battery project in Pennsylvania, after the Biden administration closed a loan guarantee for the company in December. Other battery producers have applied to the loan office, according to a DOE spokesperson, who did not provide details on the applications.

The deployments come as renewables, which are tied to many battery projects, are under pressure in the U.S.

The Trump administration is frustrating permitting for wind and solar on public lands. In the first half of this year, solar energy provided more than half of new generation to the U.S. electricity grid, according to analysis earlier this month from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. While that data demonstrates strength in the sector, new solar installations dropped in comparison to 2024. The analysis suggests a fifth less solar will be deployed in the U.S. in 2030, compared with previous forecasts.

Made-in-America challenges

While grid batteries emerged from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act with a preserved tax credit, the law is still creating headwinds for the industry.

The megalaw included “foreign entities of concern” provisions set to kick in in January aiming to prohibit imports of components from China, North Korea and other foreign adversaries.

While the measure allowed companies to obtain tax credits if they break ground through 2033, it included tighter timelines for the industry to comply with FEOC restrictions than many other industries. In 2026, storage projects will need to spend 55 percent of costs on non-FEOC components, a percentage that increases to 75 percent by decade’s end.

Considering that most battery components come from China, the restrictions add additional barriers for developers.

“There’s definitely a risk,” said Weis, noting that coming Treasury guidance will clarify how much the rules could exacerbate challenges for the sector. The guidance is required by the end of next year, but could be released earlier.

After the law’s passage in July, analysis firm BloombergNEF estimated grid battery installations could drop 15 percent over the next decade from where they would be otherwise, largely because of the FEOC restrictions.

Treasury’s guidance could be particularly important for battery cells, as the rest of a typical storage system is “relatively easy to source outside of China,” Weis said.

The growth this year is being driven partly by developers aiming to start projects before the restrictions hit in January, analysts say.

There’s a push to “really get things in the ground as fast as possible,” said Weis. The effects of FEOC may not be seen significantly in the industry until 2027, she said.

Tariffs and immigration raids

There also could be a contraction in growth next year because of the uncertainty from tariffs and policy shifts that occurred in the early months of Trump’s presidency — a period that takes time to show up in deployments.

“There was a pause in getting contracts signed,” she said.

After an expected drop in installations in 2026 and 2027, the industry should recover to 2025 levels within five years, but factors such as how much the Trump administration cracks down on permitting for solar projects tied to batteries could change things, according to Weis.

And despite the push for long-duration storage by Wright, that segment of the market may not be competitive until after 2030, said Isshu Kikuma, an analyst at BloombergNEF.

“It will be very difficult” to compete with the low costs of lithium-ion technology, although DOE could play a role in supporting startups, he said.

Among the startups that have pulled back on sodium-ion technology, a potential alternative to lithium-ion, is Bedrock Materials. The company halted operations earlier this year after facing cost challenges.

A wild card for grid batteries is how much domestic manufacturing may step up to get around the FEOC restrictions. Wood Mackenzie’s projections, for example, assume that growth in domestic supplies by the end of the decade will help counter any downturn.

LG Energy Solution, a Korean battery-maker, is among the companies well positioned to help drive domestic manufacturing because it has EV plants that are not being utilized and can be switched to produce grid batteries, Weis said.

“You don’t need that big of a change in EV demand to really create plenty of opportunities” for grid battery production, she said.

The company’s battery plant with Hyundai in Georgia wasrecently delayed after a raid by U.S. immigration authorities. White House immigration policies are threatening a brain drain at EV and battery plants.

Still, Parella said storage demand is likely to outstrip supply over the foreseeable future.

“The manufacturing capacity for long-duration storage is way short of where it needs to be,” he said. “The market’s so massive that there could be 20 more companies like us, and there’s still room for everybody to play.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/e6/15/e41ef7954f28a75308d865ffb12e/ew-0919-dabbs-marshall-batteries-2000-01.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:09.028658

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average score across the country was 15 out of 100.

The updated report comes out after a year of massive giveaways to the coal industry by Governor Braun and President Trump, while the federal government has ramped up attacks on affordable and easily deployable renewable energy resources, like wind and solar, which Indiana severely lacks.

Utility scores below

Duke Indiana earned a 0% (F) for the second year in a row. Since the previous report, Duke had its latest rate case approved by state regulators, locking in customers to higher monthly utility bills than if it were to stop burning coal at Edwardsport, based on the utility’s own financial data. Comparing Duke’s 2021 energy plan to its 2024 energy plan, the utility slashed 3,798 megawatts of clean energy investments and delayed a company-wide exit from coal from 2035 to 2038 by extending the life of its Gibson coal plant in southwest Indiana.

Duke's 2021 energy plan proposed shutting down unit 5 at the Gibson coal plant by 2025 and units 3 and 4 by 2029. Additionally, Duke’s 2021 energy plan proposed 4,697 megawatts of wind, solar, and storage by 2035. In Duke’s new plan, between now and 2035, the utility will only install 499 megawatts of solar and 400 megawatts of battery storage, for a combined total of 899 megawatts of new clean energy. Duke will go from a meager 100 megawatts of wind energy to none by the end of the decade when it lets a power purchase agreement expire, and the utility has no plan to bring new wind energy online between now and 2035.

CenterPoint Energy earned a 33% (D), 25% lower than its score last year. The utility is in the midst of writing its next long-term energy plan, which has a large impact on the evaluation of scores in the Dirty Truth report. CenterPoint was going to retire all coal by 2023 with a resource mix of primarily solar (54%) and wind (27%) according to its previous energy plan. In its current plan, CenterPoint cancelled 285 megawatts of clean energy contracts and is modeling keeping coal online past 2030. While CenterPoint is much smaller than Duke, it has still invested more in renewable energy and is closing coal plants.

The Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) saw its score decrease the most, earning a 57% (B), after earning an 80% (A) last year, its previous lowest score. The score lowered because of planned new gas plants due to growing demand driven by data centers, but the score remains higher than most utilities because it is closing coal plants.

Indiana Michigan Power saw the second largest dip in scores, earning 48% (C) this year after earning 66% (B) last year. I&M’s lower score comes on the heels of parent company AEP’s request to Indiana regulators to shift all costs for the uneconomic OVEC coal plants from being shared between its Michigan and Indiana customers to only Indiana customers. In 2025 alone, Ohio ended all subsidies to the OVEC coal plants and Michigan limited cost recovery, making the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s actions stand out.

AES Indiana saw its score remain unchanged from last year, earning it another 57% (B) in this year’s report. However, in May 2025, AES issued a request for proposal to build two new gas-burning power plants, up to 1,600 megawatts total, to power large load users like data centers, a move that would cause greenhouse gas emissions to skyrocket.

Statement from Megan Anderson, Senior Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Indiana:

“Governor Braun, monopoly utilities, and tech companies are driving up monthly utility bills for Hoosier families by straddling us with expensive coal and gas costs to feed power-hungry data centers. Braun’s executive orders and new laws aimed at bailing out uneconomic coal plants are forcing Hoosiers to subsidize electric infrastructure for data centers, hurting our economy and our health. I hope Gov. Braun is serious about decreasing rates, but it feels disingenuous based on his actions.

“Duke Indiana is not only failing compared to its monopoly utility peers in Indiana, it is also among the worst when compared to utilities across the nation. Duke’s failing strategy was approved by state regulators under Gov. Braun’s watch earlier this year, who granted the monopoly utility a massive rate hike that pumps hundreds of millions into its coal plants, including the economic clunker Edwardsport plant. There’s no better example of Duke’s renewable energy failure than the fact it will not have any wind energy resources after a power purchase agreement expires in a few years.”

Statement from Nicole Chandler, Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in southwest Indiana:

“CenterPoint’s backsliding on renewable energy commitments is a step in the wrong direction for southwest Indiana and Hoosiers. CenterPoint is drafting its next long range energy plan right now, giving its VP Shane Bradford the opportunity to do what is right by Hoosiers and retire its costly and polluting FB Culley coal-burning power plant and commit to investing in more affordable, renewable energy.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 10:01:05.645033

Duke Energy Florida’s inaugural score was 1% (F) in 2021 and peaked at 10% (F) in 2023. Duke’s score remains low because it currently has no plan to stop burning coal at its Crystal River power plant.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country – in an apples-to-apples comparison – of their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average utility score was 15% (F), the lowest average score since the report launched in 2021.

Dragging Duke Energy Florida’s score down is the uncertain future of its Crystal River coal-burning power plant. Duke is studying a closure plan for the power plant that will come out later this year. Sierra Club analysis of public data finds the coal plant was only needed 11% of the time during peak summer demand, and proposes that costly polluting power could be replaced by accelerating the utility’s investments in solar and battery storage, providing a hedge against volatile gas costs for customers. Duke can still act now to take advantage of sunsetting renewable energy incentives. Renewable energy is important to the largest tech companies to power their data centers, which Duke wants to attract to its service territory with a new rate structure it seeks approval of from state regulators.

Duke is a monopoly utility, meaning customers do not have a choice in where to buy electricity. High utility bills is one reason that St. Petersburg is evaluating whether it can establish a municipal utility to replace Duke as its electricity provider.

Statement from Walter Smith, Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Tampa Bay:

“The best thing Duke’s state director Melissa Seixas can do to ease utility bill impacts for customers is to retire the Crystal River coal-burning power plant and replace it with solar and storage. Duke’s peer utilities in Florida have demonstrated it’s possible and practical, and it’s not too late for Melissa Seixas to realize these benefits for customers.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 07:03:17.014626

Oklo Aurora powerhouse (Image: Oklo)

Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”

The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.

“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”

“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.

Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.

The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.

“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes, and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

PCACS Executive Director Bruce Lindner said the allocated money will allow the agency to assist 2,452 clients or families, which is up from the 2,066 assisted last year. The program will now run until that number has been reached.

Energy Assistance is an income-eligible program designed to help families pay their energy bills. When participants qualify for a determined amount, the payment is electronically paid to the appropriate energy company.

In order to apply for assistance, individuals will need a recent energy bill that is in the applicants’ name, but it does not have to be a disconnect notice. They will also need social security cards for everyone in the household and proof of income from all sources for household members over 18. If applicants are renting, they need to have a Landlord Affidavit completed. This form is available at the trustee offices in Portage, Chesterton and Hebron and at PCACS on its Web page, www.portercountyacs.org. Additional documents may be needed for some circumstances and the staff can identify these before the appointment.

“We are still requesting that those needing assistance call to clarify which documents they will need before attending their appointments,” Lindner said.

Families or individuals can only receive assistance once during the 2011-12 winter season.

For more information or to schedule an appointment, call PCACS at 464-9736.

The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges is an annual report that grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035.

Duke Energy Carolinas & Duke Energy Progress earned 12% (F), while Duke Energy earned 11% (F) for its operations throughout the country, which include Indiana and Florida. The national average for utilities throughout the country was 15 out of 100 possible points.

The failing score for Duke Energy Carolinas & Progress is the result of the company's lackluster investment in renewable energy, like wind and solar, which provide affordable fixed-cost resources to the grid, unlike the volatility of gas prices. Free fuel from the wind and sun, and avoiding the volatile costs of gas, is what would have saved North Carolina utility customers up to $23 billion over 20 years under the climate law that Duke successfully lobbied to weaken earlier this year. Additionally, the price of building new gas plants is going up, on top of concerns about gas-price volatility. The increase in demand from new customers, like data centers, is a convenient scapegoat for Duke’s failure to meaningfully invest in renewable energy.

Statement from Olive Burress, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in North Carolina:

“It’s wrong that monopoly utilities like Duke and multibillion-dollar tech companies are using their power to force North Carolina businesses and families to pay for power-hungry AI data centers. If more people join the growing number of individuals and organizations fighting back against this massive transfer of wealth from average people to the richest companies in the world, we can make them pay their fair share.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 07:03:44.871805

Mayors from Freetown, Paris, Montréal, Chicago, and Phoenix to showcase how cities are stepping up on climate, whilst others step back

On the agenda: green jobs, transforming ports into clean energy hubs, making cities more livable for all, and utilising city success to inspire stronger national climate commitments

World’s largest city climate week sets the stage for November’s Local Leaders Forum in Rio and COP30 talks in Bélem

C40’s delegation for New York Climate Week brings together mayors on the frontline of the climate crisis, all of whom have won election and then, in many cases, re-election, on their pledges to improve the lives of their residents through implementing positive climate policies. The experiences of these mayors are not unique: around the world, 80% of people want their leaders to take stronger action to tackle the climate emergency (according to the 2024 UN People’s Climate Vote), indicating that climate action is not just about protecting people and the planet; it is also politically popular.

Whilst some significant national governments slow or even reverse their climate commitments, C40 Co-Chair Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr of Freetown, Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris, Mayor Valérie Plante of Montréal, Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, and Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix will showcase how they are leading their cities through the climate emergency by cutting fossil fuel use, protecting communities from extreme weather, and investing in good green jobs and healthy cities.

C40 representatives will take part in a wide range of events across New York Climate Week, including the Climate Mayors Forum, where Mayor Gallego, as Climate Mayors Chair, will unite 40 US mayors to discuss how to continue to lead on climate action.

Mayor Aki-Sawyerr will also represent cities at the United Nations. At the invitation of the UN Secretary General, she will speak about how businesses, financial institutions, and city leaders can push countries to step up their commitments to reducing emissions (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs). The intention is for these discussions to provide a critical step towards COP30 by sharing best practices, reinforcing credible transition planning, and generating momentum to scale up ambitious net-zero action across sectors and regions. Nearly three-quarters of C40 cities are reducing emissions faster than their national governments.

The development of the green economy is another essential part of making a climate-positive future work for everyone. This will be highlighted in two new C40 reports published during New York Climate Week:

C40 Cities, the Climate Migration Council, and the Mayors Migration Council have collaborated on a new report setting out the investment and training needed for cities to capitalise on the jobs boom created by the green transition.

C40 and Arup have new research coming out that shows how transforming ports into clean energy hubs can bring significant benefits to city residents, by boosting economies, improving public health, and creating new, good green jobs.

The mayors’ work this week will also help set the agenda of city-led climate leadership, building momentum toward the World Mayors Summit in Rio and COP30 later this year. C40 mayors will be heading to Brazil to show how cities are delivering real, practical solutions to pressing global challenges, focusing on urgent delivery, not drawn-out negotiations.

C40 Co-chair and Mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, said: “As mayors on the frontlines of the climate crisis, we are not only leading the world on climate action but also demonstrating that real change begins in cities. Every initiative we champion—from cleaner energy to inclusive urban planning—is about securing a greener, more equitable future for generations to come.”

“New York Climate Week is a crucial opportunity to showcase how cities in the Global South are developing practical solutions, and to ensure that the voices of our rapidly growing urban youth are at the heart of the international climate conversation.

“Our work here in New York is a vital step on the road to COP30, where we must see national leaders match our ambition and commitment.”

Mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, said: “We are at a pivotal time in the climate movement – one with challenges, but also opportunities.

“Despite federal policy heading in reverse, mayors across the United States are resolved and delivering and taking action to create safer, healthier, and more affordable communities.

“As more and more Americans are impacted by climate change through extreme weather and rising costs, mayors are here to share a vision of climate action that drives economic prosperity, improved quality of life, and a safer future for our children. New York Climate Week is a chance for us to come together, share our successes, and chart a path forward with our national and global partners.

Deputy Mayor of London and C40 Board Member Mete Coban said: “I am incredibly proud to be attending New York Climate Week at a time when cities are demonstrating that real climate action delivers for everyone.

“In London, we are committed to an ambitious climate plan that is making a real difference to the lives of Londoners, including delivering cleaner air and waterways.

“Cities are playing a vital role in the green transition, and we must ensure it benefits everyone. Our work in New York is a crucial step in showing national leaders how city-led solutions can help to build a greener, fairer, and safer world for all.”

C40 Cities Executive Director, Mark Watts, said: “New York Climate Week is an essential moment for global climate action on the road to COP30.

“As we have seen in cities from Freetown to Chicago, urban leaders are not waiting for permission to act; they’re implementing tangible, science-based solutions that not only cut emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also create healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous communities.

“This momentum is what’s needed to spur national governments to step up their ambition and make meaningful commitments at COP30 in Brazil. The work C40 mayors are doing to create green jobs, transition to clean energy, and build livable cities is proof that climate action is not only possible but politically popular and economically smart.”",https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cropped-Favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-22 07:01:55.497107

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been mum on what that will mean starting Oct. 1, nine days from now. But Crain's obtained a copy of her administration's confidential draft contingency plan from 2019, the last time the state was on the brink of a partial shutdown. The impasse then, as now, was over road funding.

The documents, while not a final word by any means, offer a blueprint of what to expect if an agreement is not reached, including how many state workers could be laid off temporarily. Employees and vendors may begin receiving information this week.

And a state shutdown could be coupled with a federal government shutdown the same day as Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C., butt heads over health care funding and other issues.

Prisons would stay open. So would psychiatric hospitals, juvenile justice facilities, veterans homes and other 24/7 facilities.

Parole and probation work would be unaffected. Michigan State Police troopers and sergeants would still work. Specialized police operations and investigations would be scaled back. Child protective services and child welfare staff would remain on the job.

People receiving public assistance benefits — Medicaid, cash, food, child care and disability — would keep getting services and payments. Child support collection, adoption subsidies and Medicaid home health services would continue, as would unemployment benefits. Medicaid providers would not be paid until a budget is enacted, however. Child care providers would get their payments.

Emergency response and other health and safety functions could be pared back, including environmental and public health emergency capabilities, lab work and wildfire protection. Fish production would not be disrupted at state hatcheries.

The Mackinac Bridge, the Blue Water Bridge and the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge would remain open but possibly at lower capacities.

Debt service payments would be made.

State road construction and capital outlay projects. Halted road construction could cost the state at least $1 million a day in contractual penalties.

The lottery, which generated more than $3.2 million a day for public education in 2019, would cease, except maybe some daily drawings.

Most licensing, inspection, remediation and permitting programs would be paused, including food, dairy, environmental, occupational and other activities. The insurance, banking, marijuana, energy, payday lending and construction industries are among several that could be impacted.

Secretary of State branch offices would close and online transactions would stop. Law enforcement could not enforce expired vehicle registration and driver's licenses during the shutdown, similar to what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

State parks, campgrounds, harbors, historical sites, welcome centers and rest stops would close, too.

Employment and training programs would stop. Academies for state troopers and corrections officers would be suspended or postponed.

The Liquor Control Commission, the state’s liquor wholesaler, would no longer accept retail orders. Alcohol already purchased and in warehouses would be gone after five business days. A one-month shutdown in 2019 would have cost the state $41.5 million in liquor revenue.

Businesses with state contracts likely would be told it is up to them whether to keep providing services, though some would be informed their services are needed to protect residents' health and safety. They generally would not be paid for services rendered until the government reopens, though there might be some exceptions.

Most of Michigan's roughly 50,000 state employees would be instructed to not work. “Essential” workers would work and be paid.

Under the 2019 plan, an estimated 40% state employees would have kept working and 60% would not have. Departments in which a majority of employees would have continued working were corrections, military and veterans affairs, and state police. Many non-essential workers in the other departments would have stopped working.

In 2019, the Michigan Gaming Control Board, which regulates casinos, submitted a contingency plan that called for reduced staffing but enough to keep the three casinos in Detroit open. The state budget office, though, recommended fully shutting down the agency and, therefore, the casinos. It became a moot point because a shutdown was averted.

In 2007, then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm's administration planned for the casinos to close during what was an hours-long shutdown, prompting them to sue and be granted injunctive relief.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Michigan%20Capitol_CL.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:43.860268

On September 8, the 200 MW/400 MWh Lingshou standalone energy storage project in Hebei, China – jointly developed by EVE Energy and State Grid Power Technology – was successfully connected to the grid. It represents the world’s first large-scale application of 628Ah cells in a 100MWh-level facility, setting a new industry benchmark.

EVE Energy delivered and grid-connected 80 Mr.Giant energy storage systems and 40 integrated converter cabins within just one week. “From quality control and engineering coordination to system commissioning and operational support, EVE Energy has proven the maturity and feasibility of big-batteries technology,” the company said in a statement.

Mass production of these large-capacity cells began in December 2024, making EVE Energy the first manufacturer to mass-produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells with capacities exceeding 600 Ah for stationary storage applications.

The cells are part of EVE Energy’s Mr. Flagship series designed for battery energy storage system applications. The 628 Ah Mr. Big cell is integrated into the Mr. Giant system – a 20-foot containerised unit with up to 5 MWh energy storage capacity and suitable for 4+ hour long-duration storage.

However, EVE’s Mr. Big is not the largest cell announced to date. For instance, Chinese manufacturer Hithium showcased the industry’s first LFP battery cell breaking the 1000 Ah barrier last year. Their MIC 1130Ah cell is designed for long-duration storage of four to eight hours.

More recently, BYD relased a new battery energy storage system with the world’s largest single-unit capacity of 14.5 MWh. Named HaoHan, the system uses BYD’s self-developed 2,710 Ah Blade Battery cell, which the company claims is the largest energy storage cell in the world.

While 300 Ah+ products remain the industry standard, there are multiple reasons behind the move to even larger capacity cells. Using prismatic LFP cells with double the capacity effectively halves the number of cells, connection points and overall system components. According to many manufacturers, this leads to significant improvements in performance and maintenance efficiency and lower cost – primarily due to increased energy density per square meter.

On the downside, failures in larger cells have a greater impact on the system level, and thermal management becomes more challenging because larger cells emit more heat during charge and discharge cycles, making it harder to maintain uniform temperature.

EVE Energy has already begun shipping the Mr. Giant energy storage system equipped with 628Ah cells overseas. The company completed its first batch of shipments to Australia and Europe on September 10.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eve-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:10.466491

Our mission has always been to improve lives by delivering safe, reliable and cost-effective energy solutions to the people and businesses who depend on us every day. That hasn’t changed. But how we fulfill our mission must continue evolving to meet the demands of a growing region and a dynamic energy landscape.

In the past few months, there have been broader conversations about large-scale developments like data centers and the energy they consume. These proposed projects could support a larger economic development strategy that fosters growth and modernization of our electric infrastructure. Data centers are in no way associated with our current rate review request filed with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

In fact, we’ve developed a strategy that shows no negative impact to existing customer rates should AES Indiana power data centers in the future. This is possible because, even though more investments are required to serve those customers, we will be able to spread our costs over a larger amount of electricity sold.

This information was validated in our most recent Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) public stakeholder meeting. The IRP supports economic decision making and is a critical process for AES Indiana to gather input and analyze the future of our generation resources so we can continue our mission to serve Central Indiana.

The IRP models the cost of new generation resources, changes in fuel, power purchased in the market, and operating and maintenance costs for existing assets and analyzes how these factors could impact our overall costs. This process ensures AES Indiana identifies the best option that meets our customers’ needs in a way that is safe, reliable and cost-effective. AES Indiana is planning on completing its IRP at the end of October.

We understand customers have questions about data centers. If data center agreements progress, we have an obligation to serve existing customers while being transparent with our plans to serve new customers. This will also include following the regulatory framework that requires AES Indiana to go through a public review process to make the investments to serve the data centers and review the rates these data center customers will be charged.

Our job at AES Indiana is to deliver electricity to people and places that make our community prosper. We responsibly manage what is within our control, and we are committed to working with city and state leaders on a long-term vision for a stronger, more resilient energy future.

In addition to sharing costs, the parish and the Corps share responsibilities for the project.
In areas where work has been completed, Raiford said in the past he might have gotten calls about flooded ditches during a 2- or 3-inch rain.","A plan to dredge five Baton Rouge bayous, designed in the 1990s and implemented only after the deadly flooding of 2016, is now successfully protecting homes from floodwater — and it is only 15% complete.

The Five Tributaries Project involves clearing foliage from the banks and snagging obstacles along the bottoms of five bayous in the East Baton Rouge Parish, each of which empties into the Amite River.

With these bayous cleared, their waters can drain more quickly into the Amite instead of rising over their banks and threatening residents' homes.

""If you imagine the trapezoidal channel (of the bayou), we're pretty much clearing all vegetation off the side slopes coming down to about 2 inches above the ground, and then any obstructions or hindrances in the water itself, stumps, branches, anything sticking out, we'll remove those as well,"" said David Bradley, project director with the Army Corps of Engineers.

While the dredging plan was funded in 2018, it wasn't until February 2023 that the first portion of the first bayou had been successfully cleared and snagged.

Fred Raiford, transportation and drainage director for the parish, admitted delays slowed the start of the project, but says now that the lower portions of Bayou Fountain, Ward Creek and Jones Creek have been cleared, he is already seeing results.

""Those areas have always had problems with flooding and drainage, and once we've done that work I've had very, very, very, very few calls about water,"" Raiford said. ""The reason I know that is because I go look out. I mean, I watch when it rains at night. I get up because I know I'm gonna get phone calls, I'd like to at least know I've looked at it.""

Raiford said the completed work on those three bayous has been a ""tremendous plus for us with reducing the flood risk for people in our parish.""

The clearing and snagging of lower Jones Creek was finished in February 2023, Bayou Fountain's lower few miles were done in September 2023, and Ward Creek's part was completed in May 2024.

In total, 11.2 miles of waterway have been cleared, with roughly another 55 miles to go.

Those completed areas were all from the lowest and deepest portions of these bayous, where they bottom out into the Amite River and where the water is deep enough to support barges with excavators used for clearing.

The barges won't be an option for the remaining waterways, and Bradley expects the Corps instead will be using amphibious excavators, sometimes called ""marsh buggies.""

To get these machines to the water, and to store the collected debris, the parish floodwater authority will need to pay residents to use their land.

These right of way parcels could be as small as 25-foot strips along the bayous' banks or up to an acre plot on which to pile whatever is pulled from the water.

Raiford estimated the remaining work will require more than 300 temporary land acquisitions, none of which have been made.

Once all five bayous have been cleared and snagged, the Corps will also construct concrete riprap on the banks of portions of Jones Creek and look to make channel enlargements to parts of Beaver Bayou and Blackwater Bayou in Central.

So, how much longer?

Bradley, with the Corps, said he is waiting to get a better idea of the estimated time for completion for the project before giving a date.

Raiford has estimated the end of 2031.

Both pointed to the unknown variables of ongoing environmental surveys, construction timelines delivered to the directors from contractors, and the specter of hidden utilities needing to be relocated.

Raiford was the parish's public works director when the Five Tributaries plan was first considered in 1995 and 1996. He said despite approval from the Water Resources Development Act for the project to begin construction in 1999, the lack of federal money was a hurdle.

The Five Tributaries project has an estimated cost of $255 million, with the federal money being allocated in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

But that allocation also requires the Corps' ""non-federal partners"" to pay 25% of the costs of the total project, or roughly $64 million of that $255 million total.

So far, the parish has needed to pay only around $10 million, Raiford estimated, with roughly another $40 million being matched by a capital outlay from the state.

In addition to sharing costs, the parish and the Corps share responsibilities for the project.

The parish must acquire land and relocate utilities, while the Corps must develop environmental impact statements and award construction contracts.

As for what is immediately next: The Corps has completed environmental surveys for the upper portions of Jones Creek and has ongoing surveys for upper Bayou Fountain and upper Ward Creek.

In areas where work has been completed, Raiford said in the past he might have gotten calls about flooded ditches during a 2- or 3-inch rain. Now, the complaints have grown quiet.

Larry Galloway, former president of the Sagefield Homeowners Association, which lies on the other side of Burbank Drive from Bayou Fountain, said his neighbors experienced bad flooding during both 2016 and 2021.

On Friday, standing on the edge of a long ditch where Longwood Plantation Road turns to nothing but grass, Galloway gestured out at where a clogged culvert had to be pulled from the ground after flooding in August 2021.

""Some of them got it in their homes and these down here, they got it real bad. They couldn't get out,"" Galloway said from his neighbor's backyard. ""And boy, some houses that way, most of them it was up to the mailboxes.""

Galloway isn't sure if he has noticed less water backing up in the Bayou Fountain outlets that surround his subdivision, but he hopes Raiford is right that the snagging has helped. Mostly, he is concerned about new development in the area, especially in places that were underwater in 2021, and how those new homes might push water into Sagefield.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/8e/88e2b6b9-8747-46f5-9da0-8dc5e3ce7af6/68cdf86dbb4f6.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:33.293598

The reason: Electricity demand, also known as load growth, is surging, and NIPSCO’s clean energy plans are not keeping pace.
The failures are not happening in isolation: The federal government has eliminated $22 billion of funding for clean energy projects this year alone.
Unless utilities abandon fossil fuel expansion and accelerate clean energy, customers will be stuck with higher bills and dirtier air.
“Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”","In 2024, the planet crossed what many scientists consider a dangerous threshold: It warmed to about 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels, passing the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C threshold. That same year, American utility companies largely failed to do their part to ramp down fossil fuel usage. They earned a failing grade in the new The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges, the Sierra Club’s yearly analysis of utilities’ public commitments to sustainability versus their actual plans to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.

The report found that the nation’s largest power providers are clinging to coal, one of the dirtiest sources of energy, and racing to build new gas plants. The authors examined the long-term plans of 75 utility companies and found an industry aggregate score of just 15 out of 100—the lowest score in the report’s five-year history. It evaluated utilities based on whether they will phase out coal plants by 2030, stop building new gas plants, and invest in enough clean energy to replace fossil fuels by 2035.

On all fronts, most companies failed.

“So many utilities use load growth as an excuse to backtrack on their climate progress and goals, instead of using it as a bold opportunity to meet the moment and build the clean energy we need for a clean and renewable future,” said Emma Pabst, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign and one of the authors of the study. “The reality is that a lot of utilities are stuck in old, outdated, and dirty habits, and the data shows across the board that clean is more affordable.”

Many utilities are backsliding on their commitments to clean energy sources such as wind and sun, and greenwashing at the same time—even though 65 companies in the study have climate pledges, only three of them received an A rating. Collectively, utilities are planning less renewable capacity than is necessary to replace existing fossil plants, let alone to meet the clean energy targets that most scientists agree are necessary to prevent irreparable climate damage: 80 percent clean electricity by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035.

Despite the relative affordability of renewable energy, utilities are unable or unwilling to untether themselves from coal and gas. The 75 companies in the report plan to retire just 29 percent of coal generation by 2030, and 61 of them intend to build a combined 118 gigawatts of new gas capacity by 2035.

The Dirty Truth report comes at a time when electricity demand has skyrocketed, fueled in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers. This is the first edition of The Dirty Truth that has taken plans to build clean energy to meet growing electricity demand into account, because it is an increasingly pressing issue for utilities—and many of them meet that demand by investing in fossil fuels.

Few examples illustrate this better than the Northern Indiana Public Service Company. Although NIPSCO earned an A in every former report, its score fell 23 points from last year to this year, dropping to its lowest-ever score of 57 out of 100.

The reason: Electricity demand, also known as load growth, is surging, and NIPSCO’s clean energy plans are not keeping pace. The company predicts far greater load growth than in previous years, but its current renewable energy plans would cover only 31 percent of its existing fossil generation and projected growth. Even though NIPSCO plans to close its remaining coal plants by 2030, the utility is also planning 400 megawatts of new fossil fuel construction at the Schahfer site by 2035. Part of that new load growth is from data centers. For example, NIPSCO plans to power potential hyperscale data center development with over 3,500 megawatts of new gas infrastructure.

NIPSCO has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 90 percent by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. But its parent company said in the spring that its climate goals, “may evolve as we assess and respond to business opportunities such as data centers.”

""We have the technologies that we need today in order to solve this. Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”

In Kansas and Missouri, the utility company Evergy scored just 9 points out of 100—only four points above its score in the first edition of the report five years ago. Evergy serves 1.7 million people and is based in Kansas City, one of the most energy-burdened cities in the U.S., where many low-income, Black, and Latino households spend six percent or more of their income on electricity.

Evergy has refused to adopt local climate goals or commit to retiring the Hawthorn coal plant in Kansas City. The utility intends to retire only a third of its coal generation by 2030, while adding more than 5,500 MW of new gas capacity by 2035. If built, that gas capacity would emit as much annual pollution as 2.5 million cars.

Evergy has also walked back its emissions reductions goals. Five years ago, the utility touted its “Sustainability Transformation Plan,” which said Evergy could cut emissions 85 percent by 2030. Since then, Evergy has removed the pledge altogether. The company also proposed fewer plans for clean energy in 2025 than it did in 2024.

The failures are not happening in isolation: The federal government has eliminated $22 billion of funding for clean energy projects this year alone.

“We saw really great climate progress during the previous administration, with the IRA and the (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) and lots of federal rules that cracked down on pollution to make our communities cleaner and safer. We're seeing that get rolled back piece by piece,” said Noah Ver Beek, one of the report’s authors and a senior energy campaigns analyst with the Beyond Coal Campaign. “Even more, we're seeing crackdowns on the amount of clean energy that can get built on public lands, and the processes that a clean energy project needs to go through in order to receive federal permits.”

The consequences of fossil fuel reliance will land on ratepayers. According to a separate report, Assessing Impacts Of The 2025 Reconciliation Bill On U.S. Energy Costs, Jobs, Health, And Emissions, sticking with gas and coal will drive up electricity bills by $120 a year for the average household by 2030, rising to $230 by 2035.

Despite some companies improving their plans since the report’s first edition in 2021, the overall trajectory is moving backward. Unless utilities abandon fossil fuel expansion and accelerate clean energy, customers will be stuck with higher bills and dirtier air.

The Dirty Truth report calls on utilities to recommit themselves to sustainability, even as the Trump Administration does everything in its power to defund renewable energy projects and further entrench the United States in fossil fuel reliance.

“We don't need to wait for some new technology, or something great and special and new to come up. We have the technologies that we need today in order to solve this,” Ver Beek said. “Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:39.762533

Some lawmakers want New Hampshire to be a bigger part of that.,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-driving-data-center-boom-some-lawmakers-want-new-hampshire-be-bigger-part,"Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports.
Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.
Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries.
Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said.
But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.","As data center development takes off across the United States and the world, New Hampshire legislators and regulators are weighing what steps their state, and its aging electric grid, should take to prepare.

“For me, it’s worth considering. There may be an opportunity here, but I think there’s also concerns,” said Sen. David Watters, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Data centers — large, energy-hungry facilities housing computer networks — are rapidly becoming more common nationwide, data center developer Craig McGahey told New Hampshire lawmakers and energy professionals at the 2025 New Hampshire Energy Summit, organized by consulting and lobbying firm Dupont Group on Sept. 15.

The rise of artificial intelligence is the biggest factor contributing to increasing data center demand, McGahey said, citing competition among so-called “hyperscalers” — expansive cloud computing companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and others.

“As this race for AI dominance continues, we don’t see it stopping, and it’s going to continue on for many, many years,” he said.

Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports. And as of March 2025, the United States had more of the facilities than any other nation, according to a Statista tally.

In other states, some of which have hundreds of data centers, the facilities have strained electric grids and, in some cases, water supplies. Yet, for now, New Hampshire is not among those: 10 relatively small-scale facilities were listed statewide on the website Data Center Map as of September 2025, putting New Hampshire in the bottom fifth nationally.

Some see an ‘emerging market.’ Others, an environmental threat.

That may, however, be set to change. Low power availability and high electricity costs have so far been the principal factors preventing an influx of data centers in New Hampshire like that seen in some other states, McGahey said. But he added that he considered the Northeast as a whole an “emerging market” for the centers.

Developers like himself, he said, were assessing different states’ regulatory landscapes, land availability, and power supplies to determine where to site new centers, which can range in size from normal office buildings to projects spanning hundreds of acres.

Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.

Citing property tax revenue and employment benefits, some legislators said they wanted to see New Hampshire create a regulatory environment that would favor data centers.

“I think New Hampshire should court any business into the state,” said Rep. Doug Thomas, vice chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, in an interview. “In order for them to come here, there has to be a market. And so we have to … show them that we’re interested.”

He and House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Chair Michael Vose cited construction and jobs as a primary benefit of growing data centers in New Hampshire. In his presentation, McGahey said a data center of the scale likely to be established in New Hampshire could employ as many as 40 people full-time, and potentially hundreds more during construction.

Others questioned whether those estimates represented enough jobs to make a meaningful impact on employment. Rep. Thomas Cormen, a member of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, said in an interview the amount of people employed by data centers does not typically scale up proportionally as the centers increase in size. And, he added, for a relatively uncomplicated building like the typical warehouse-style data center, the construction phase might not last particularly long, meaning the bulk of jobs created would be temporary.

Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries. “Some of the biggest ones employ maybe 100 to 200 people at a $40,000 (annual) salary,” Watters said. “I mean, that’s McDonalds. … They might make close to $40,000, too.”

Cormen also raised environmental concerns. Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said. This could be harmful to the river itself or cause dangerous ice dams and flooding in winter, he said.

“I think a lot of people have environmental concerns, and power concerns,” Watters said.

Uncertainty about how data centers would be powered, Cormen said, is another hurdle; while drawing from the grid could raise electricity costs for other ratepayers, the type and effects of unregulated local generators are another unknown.

“Before you know it, we’re talking about diesel generation,” he said. “We just don’t know.”

Speculating to meet demand

Some states have weighed implementing special rate schedules to offset the impact of increased on-grid data center demand on ratepayers, but Vose said he did not expect the New Hampshire Legislature to consider such a system in the near future.

Instead, Vose and other legislators discussed ways to increase New Hampshire’s electricity generation down the road, including through speculative technology like small, modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.

The New Hampshire Department of Energy is assessing whether SMRs could someday be implemented in New Hampshire, Director of Energy Innovation Thomas Barrasso said at the summit. SMRs could power data centers within “microgrids,” small regionalized power grids that could operate either independently of or in tandem with the rest of the grid, he said.

“I think the microgrid piece of this, the grid modernization piece of this, the SMR piece of this kind of all start to fit together,” Barrasso said.

At the summit, Barrasso expressed optimism about small modular reactors, saying he felt the tide of public opinion toward nuclear energy was changing. A Gallup poll published in April supported this impression, showing 61% of Americans in favor of nuclear power — a six percentage point increase over the previous poll in 2023.

However, SMR critics point out that the technology is still in development, questioning Barrasso’s statement at the summit that they could eventually be “plug and play” solutions to bolster New Hampshire’s energy offerings. It may be anywhere from five to 15 years before the generators could hypothetically be deployed, according to Barrasso’s presentation.

SMRs are a “convenient” discussion for people resistant to renewable energy development, Watters said in an interview. “The interest is being driven by people who think SMRs are the answer to every problem in the world,” he said. But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.

Other technologies, including forms of renewable energy, are deployable now and could be implemented with less investment, said Dan Weeks, of solar developer ReVision Energy, at the summit. Weeks highlighted grid-scale batteries and renewable generation as other options that the state could direct attention to rather than the hypothetical future deployment of SMRs.

“Is the (Department of Energy) thinking about meeting these rising energy needs and cost concerns through … greater deployment of existing technologies that are at this point pretty far down the cost curve and probably a lot closer in the future than SMRs?” Weeks asked.

“My job was to sort of get ‘all of the above’ into the mindset of everyone,” Barrasso responded.

The Legislature has already taken some steps toward localized power generation that could be used to power facilities like data centers through SMRs. House Bill 672, sponsored by Vose and signed by Gov. Ayotte in August, paved the way for off-grid energy generators to sell power directly to buyers. Vose said he hoped that bill would “encourage” microgrids. (The bill also exempts off-grid electricity providers from renewable energy standards and the rate regulations on-grid generation is subject to.)

A resolution to declare the development of advanced nuclear technology “in the best interest of New Hampshire” also passed last session, but legislators failed to pass House Bill 710, which would have allowed utilities to own and operate SMRs. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Kevin Avard will come before the Legislature in 2026, according to a legislative service request listed on the General Court of New Hampshire website.

McGahey acknowledged the push to build data centers quickly had led developers to look toward more quickly deployable energy solutions than SMRs. In other states, developers have constructed new gas generators to meet data center demand, he said.

“Because this race is so intense, we’re looking for solutions in two to three years. We are looking at battery storage solutions. We’re looking at natural gas plants,” McGahey said.

Looking ahead

During his presentation, McGahey forecasted demand for a wave of smaller data centers within the next three to five years. The appetite of New Hampshire policymakers and utilities toward that development, McGahey said, could play a role in determining to what extent that development progresses locally.

The reality that New Hampshire’s grid is facing, including difficulties from power shortages and aging transmission lines, may make it unlikely that the state ever sees data center development on a large scale, Watters said.

“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’d be an interest in siting them here,” he said.

But the possibility, and related concerns, were worth discussing, he said, and others at the summit agreed.

“We need to get people to the table to start to talk about what the future is going to look like,” Barrasso said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-91/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenter-1024x6831758531830.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4OppMGlt,N,,2025-09-22 07:02:30.870395

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.","While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.

Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

Local climate activists held an event Friday to celebrate the ocean’s 3.8 billionth birthday and raise awareness about the impacts of climate change and carbon emissions on the ocean’s health.

Surrounded by artwork produced by local activists, including a painting of flood destruction in Sierra Leone and a banner reading “Fossil Fuel Burning = Ocean Death,” attendees participated in ocean trivia, shared an Ashley’s ice cream cake and listened to discussions of how carbon emissions from fossil fuel-based transportation endanger the ecosystem.

“Coastal displacement!” Jenna Zidan, an organizer for the New Haven Climate Movement, or NHCM, shouted to a crowd on Broadway island.

“Wake up!” the crowd chanted in response.

“Sea ice melting!” Zidan said.

“Wake up!”

The event marked the launch of NHCM’s inaugural GOtober Campaign, which calls for less car and more public transportation use from New Haven residents in October.

The campaign emphasizes that greenhouse gases emitted by transportation are one of the main drivers of ocean acidification, Chris Schweitzer, director of the NHCM, said. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 12 gallons of gasoline — a single tank for many cars — release 235 pounds of carbon dioxide.

Schweitzer hopes that GOtober encourages New Haveners to “defund the OilyGarchy” through concrete decisions they make about their transportation methods.

“Right now, the present administration, supported largely by millions of dollars of fossil fuel donations, is attacking everything to do with the environment,” Schweitzer said. “GOtober is partly a chance for people to say, ‘Yeah, I want to stop supporting the fossil fuel industry and spend the 500 dollars on gas elsewhere.’”

As extreme weather becomes more frequent and temperatures continue to rise, New Haveners at the event said they have noticed their environment shifting in real time.

Ethan Reynolds ’28, who attended the Sound School, a local public school on the New Haven Harbor, said that his proximity to frequent ocean storms made him “really mindful about how the changing water temperature and everything impacts the marine environment.”

Jam Lian ’28 said that while the coast helps moderate seasons, he worries that rising sea levels and temperatures make New Haven vulnerable to hurricanes due to its coastal position.

Organizers and participants alike expressed that while encouraging residents to take public transportation is necessary to stymie climate change, the current inaccessibility of the city’s transit system poses a barrier to many.

Natalie Clorio, a senior at Career High School and a former intern with NHCM, lives 40 minutes away in Derby. Every week, she pays up to $14 to take the bus to and from New Haven for school and work, she said. She said she has a part-time job to help pay for transportation.

“I don’t think high schoolers should be paying for buses,” Clorio said, adding that many of her peers are scared to take public transportation because of fears about danger on buses.

Meredith Polk, who took the bus to Friday’s event, said that her bus ran 15 minutes late, which was “pretty normal.”

“The city is really built for cars,” Polk said. “There’s a lot of parking options, so people aren’t really motivated to take the bus, and it’s not as safe to ride a bike.”

The lack of shelter, seating and signage about schedules at bus stops also makes riding the bus more inaccessible, Schweitzer said. Sandeep Aysola, New Haven’s director of transportation, traffic and parking, did not immediately respond to the News’ questions about shelter and signage. He wrote that the Connecticut Department of Transportation is responsible for buses and their scheduling.

“If you get more people on buses, the buses run more often, which is good for folks who depend on buses,” Schweitzer said.

In 2024, the NHCM proposed the “Transportation Transformation Resolution” to the city, which would require New Haven departments to detail concrete plans for improving public transportation and reducing greenhouse gases.

In March, the Board of Alders heard the NHCM’s proposal and decided to keep the resolution in committee, rather than taking a vote. The city’s alders have not yet voted on the resolution.

According to Connecticut’s latest climate report, transportation was the state’s top source of greenhouse gas emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels, at 42 percent of total emissions.",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oceanbday_kccc_CatherineCheung_ContributingPhotographer-scaled-1024x732.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:28.682615

However, these utilities are planning enough clean energy to replace ONLY 32% of existing coal and gas generation and load growth by 2035.

Each year since 2021, the amount of additional load utilities forecast by 2035 has increased, but utilities have failed to make clean energy plans to keep pace. If we assume all planned clean energy would replace existing coal and gas generation first, planned clean energy is barely sufficient to replace half, let alone supply forecast load growth.

Utilities plan to add 118 GW of new gas capacity by 2035- which would be a 20% increase in nationwide gas capacity. While they claim this is needed to meet rising demand, there are three problems with that argument.

First, load growth can be met with clean alternatives like efficiency, transmission upgrades, demand-side management, renewables, and storage. Second, over a third of utilities are planning more gas than needed for their projected growth. Third, new gas is poorly suited for near-term needs, which require faster, more flexible solutions.

To limit global warming to below 1.5°C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientific and policy consensus shows that economies like the U.S. must retire all coal-fired power by 2030. Yet utilities in this study are stubbornly clinging to coal.

Coal is one of the most polluting and often the most expensive way to produce electricity. In fact, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021. Retiring the rest of the coal fleet is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions and lower customer's bills.

Of the 75 companies examined in this study, 65 have some form of climate pledge. Utilities often highlight these commitments as proof of their dedication to clean energy and environmental responsibility. However, the data reveals a different story: most of these pledges are greenwashing, not indicative of genuine plans for a clean energy transition. Despite 65 utilities having climate goals, only 3 received an A.

Utilities that are serious about their climate commitments must do more than set distant goals. They should adopt strong, science-aligned targets with regular interim milestones and back those goals with detailed, actionable plans to achieve them.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-09/bw-istock-525755829-with-cutout-low-crop2-sh.png.webp?itok=BY2f_byt,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:32.749140

By embracing a holistic approach to supporting employees, including assessments along with other strategies, the nuclear industry will be poised to thrive well into the future.","With energy demand soaring due to greater electrification and the growth of data centers, all eyes are now on nuclear power to revive its role as a key component of the U.S. energy portfolio. Recent executive orders are facilitating the reopening of shuttered nuclear plants, such as the Palisades plant in Michigan, which is just one of the planned recommissions around the country.

This “nuclear renaissance” means that more employees are needed in the nuclear sector, and those already employed who have industry expertise need to be retained. The nuclear workforce is already older than other segments of the energy industry, with 60% of nuclear employees aged 30–45. Public and private employers must therefore invest in recruiting and training employees with the necessary technical skills, but they also must identify candidates with the right personality traits for this unique industry.

Working in a nuclear power plant can be stressful — in addition to technical competency, it requires a commitment to safety culture and teamwork. The legacy of accidents such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl means the stakes are high, and 80% of significant events at nuclear facilities have been attributed to human error.

HR teams need a robust toolset to find the right employees and support the physical and mental health of those they currently have. Assessments are a valuable part of that toolset, and they can equip HR professionals in the nuclear industry with data that helps them support the well-being of this critical energy workforce.

How assessments assist in recruiting

Assessments such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory®-3 (MMPI®-3) can bring value by providing information about attitudes and personality traits that can inform how a candidate may approach a given job role. While HR teams should not be expected to interpret the MMPI-3 as clinical practitioners would, the assessment can be a rich source of information for them. By going beyond resumes and interviews, such tools give hiring teams a deeper understanding of work styles, interpersonal dynamics, and potential fit within the organization, helping to make more confident, informed talent decisions.

“Assessments can play a powerful role in proactively spotting signs of emotional distress or maladaptive coping styles,” says Lynsey Psimas, Ph.D., Director of Business Development, Government & Public Safety at Pearson Clinical Assessments. “When applied consistently during recruitment, these tools can reveal skills and personality traits that will either complement — or potentially clash with — the demands of a high-stress role,” she says.

Maintaining employee wellness with assessments

Supporting employees’ holistic well-being requires many strategies, spanning health coverage, time off, and financial security. Assessments add an important layer to this strategy by offering insight into emotional or psychological distress that could impact an employee’s performance.

For example, the Beck Anxiety Inventory® (BAI®) and Beck Depression Inventory® (BDI®) from Pearson are quick 21-item screeners that can help identify symptoms of anxiety or depression. Pearson also offers the Quality of Life Inventory® (QOLI®), which assesses mental health aspects like happiness and satisfaction.

If an employee is struggling with family issues or financial problems, these stressors can affect their work life as well. Assessments help HR teams to proactively identify employees who may need support to handle such challenges and remain healthy and focused at work.

“Assessments can be an integral part of broader wellness and resiliency programs,” Psimas says. “They give employers a way to monitor progress over time, such as within an Employee Assistance Program, providing actionable insights to better support their workforce,” she adds.

Assessments can also help HR teams understand how their workforce approaches teamwork, and who may thrive — or face challenges — in collaborative or leadership roles. The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire® (MPQ®) looks at interpersonal skills, resilience, and social skills that are crucial for employees in an industry like nuclear power, where collaboration and executing on tasks are of the utmost importance. If employee conflicts are an issue or communication needs improvement, starting with an assessment like the MPQ® gives HR teams a data-driven baseline of personality traits, helping teams target development and strengthen workplace dynamics.

How to build the nuclear workforce of the future

As HR teams build up their workforce in the revived nuclear sector, they need a range of tools and tactics to find and retain the right employees who are technically skilled and able to handle this industry’s unique challenges. The need for more electricity will not diminish any time soon, and nuclear power’s emission-free nature means it will be an important part of our energy mix for years to come. As a result, employers must focus on recruiting and retaining the employees who can make this nuclear renaissance a success.

A resilient workforce is key to this process.

Policy Shifts: Carbon Pricing, Subsidies, and Regulatory Frameworks

The 2025 carbon policy landscape is marked by a dual focus on punitive measures for high-emission industries and incentives for sustainable alternatives. Carbon pricing mechanisms, such as expanded cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes, have created a fiscal disincentive for fossil fuel dependency. According to the Future of Jobs Report 2025, 47% of employers anticipate that climate-change mitigation will fundamentally reshape their operations within five years, directly influencing capital allocation toward low-carbon technologies In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ].

Simultaneously, governments are deploying subsidies and industrial policies to accelerate renewable energy adoption. For instance, the report notes that one-third of surveyed organizations are adjusting business models in response to subsidies for green infrastructure, which reduce upfront costs for solar, wind, and energy storage projects These are the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/][ 3 ]. These policies are not merely symbolic; they are recalibrating ROI calculations for investors. The World Economic Forum highlights that 41% of employers expect technological advancements in energy generation and storage to drive operational efficiency, further enhancing the long-term profitability of renewables In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ].

Renewable Energy Jobs: A Proxy for Investment Viability

The surge in demand for green jobs—such as renewable energy engineers and environmental engineers—serves as a barometer for the sector's financial health. The Future of Jobs Report 2025 identifies these roles as among the “15 fastest-growing jobs,” reflecting both policy-driven demand and market confidence in renewable technologies In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ]. This labor market shift underscores a critical point: as nations scale up renewable infrastructure, the associated workforce development and technological innovation create a self-reinforcing cycle of investment.

For example, the report projects that 170 million new jobs will emerge in renewable energy and related fields by 2030 These are the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/][ 3 ]. Such growth signals to investors that the sector is not only aligned with regulatory mandates but also poised for sustained economic returns. The integration of skills like AI and big data into energy systems further enhances operational efficiency, reducing costs and improving project scalability The Future of Jobs Report 2025 - The World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/in-full/3-skills-outlook/][ 4 ].

Geopolitical and Economic Catalysts

Beyond policy, geopolitical dynamics are amplifying the financial case for renewables. The report notes that rising trade tensions—exemplified by tariffs under U.S. President Donald Trump—have prompted countries to localize supply chains and prioritize sustainable alternatives In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ]. This “geoeconomic fragmentation” is driving investment into domestic renewable energy projects, as nations seek to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and secure energy independence.

Moreover, emerging technologies such as osmotic power systems and advanced nuclear reactors are diversifying the renewable energy portfolio, offering new avenues for high-ROI infrastructure. The Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 highlights innovations like structural battery composites, which could revolutionize energy storage for electric vehicles, further de-risking long-term investments .

Conclusion: A Tipping Point for Renewable Energy

The convergence of carbon policy reforms, technological innovation, and geopolitical realignments is creating a tipping point for renewable energy infrastructure. While specific ROI metrics remain sparse in the 2025 data, the broader trends—such as job growth, subsidy-driven cost reductions, and the de-risking of green technologies—paint a compelling picture of financial viability. Investors who align with these shifts are not only complying with regulatory frameworks but also capitalizing on a sector poised for exponential growth.

There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says.","The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he announced rollbacks.

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future.

The deployment will see the company secure Fuso eCanter trucks and Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans that will operate across metropolitan areas, beginning with Adelaide before expanding to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Peter Langley, FedEx Australasia Regional Vice-President, confirmed that the initial rollout will commence with 15 Fuso eCanter trucks in Adelaide, representing the first phase of a broader expansion plan.

“The introduction of these EVs to our pickup and delivery fleet in Australia marks a pivotal moment in our operations,” Langley said. The company plans to expand into additional regional and metropolitan areas as EV charging infrastructure is installed.

The EVs are expected to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 8.5 tonnes per vehicle annually, contributing to FedEx's global goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040.

This Australian deployment follows FedEx's successful introduction of EVs in New Zealand and aligns with the company's global strategy to electrify its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet by 2040.

The move comes amid increasing EV adoption in Australia's logistics sector. In recent weeks, ANC Delivers added 111 electric vehicles to its fleet through a project co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

Australia Post introduced 36 Mercedes-Benz electric vans in August, while Linfox announced plans to purchase 30 heavy-duty electric trucks in May.

Beyond vehicle electrification, FedEx is investing in aircraft modernisation, sustainable fuels, renewable energy, and efficient facilities to support its sustainability goals.

As EV charging infrastructure expands across Australia, FedEx plans to continue its electrification efforts in line with its global commitment of AU$2 billion (US$1.32 billion) initial investment in vehicle electrification, sustainable energy and carbon sequestration technologies.

FedEx’s announcement comes days after ARENA committed AU$12.3 million to develop Australia's first dedicated electric truck charging hub in Melbourne.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver scalable clean energy and commercializes nuclear fuel recycling to convert waste into usable reactor fuel. During the September 9 episode, Cramer said that he does not think that the company’s stock is “done going higher,” as he remarked:

“Then viewers urged me to focus on nuclear power. When I looked up over, when I looked over the group, I found one that seemed like a serious spec, Oklo, which is building small form nuclear reactors. Given the high demand for electricity thanks to the data center buildout, which we heard just again tonight with Oracle, and the fact that Oklo’s a company with significant customer interest, I decided to suspend my critical judgment. And I told you that it might take only one positive headline for this stock to rock, and sure enough, a $33 stock gapped up when it was selected for a DoD contract. I don’t think it’s done going higher.”

E3's ability to produce lithium with a low carbon footprint and minimal water usage could make it a preferred supplier in a market where ESG compliance is becoming a competitive differentiator.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Investment

E3 Lithium's strategic advancements—from DLE technology to regulatory progress—position it as a key enabler of North American EV manufacturing. Its phased production plan, coupled with partnerships and cost advantages, creates a compelling value proposition for investors. As the continent races to build a self-sufficient battery supply chain, E3's ability to deliver high-purity lithium carbonate at scale could not only disrupt the market but also redefine the economics of EV production.

I’ve been a regular visitor to Australia’s university campuses since my appointment to the science and innovation portfolios four months ago.

In fact, some weeks I spend more time on campus than I did in my final year as an undergraduate student at the University of Sydney.

I acknowledge the many hardworking public service agency leaders, directors of institutes, CEOs of important professional associations, deans and professors, researchers and postgraduate students here today.

Australian Public Policy Institute

There’s so much about this Institute that I have admired since its establishment under the leadership of my friend Dr Patricia Azarias.

In those early says of the James Martin Institute, the decision of the then-government of NSW to find a role for this institution really did set this organisation up to make that contribution.

There is enormous value in your online publications, research reports and podcasts.

But what impresses me most is the way this Institute is building a reliable pipeline of timely expertise that feeds directly into the policy process.

The Policy Challenge Grants are spectacular. They are mission-led, collaborative and directly geared to solving real-world problems that matter right now.

The findings from those projects are all the more impactful thanks to your partnerships with the university sector, the NSW Government and more recently the Australian Public Service Commission.

To the extent that I studied public policy, there was this dry language used to describe policy activism – I think the phrase ‘policy entrepreneurship’ sticks in my head as a particularly banal, individualistic conception of how policymaking works.

I really do like how Peter described tripartism. Tripartism – or this radical concept, pluralism – means the role of institutions working together in a credible way in the national interest.

That really does underline the way that the Albanese government thinks about public policymaking.

It’s a partnership with our institutions and business community. The university sector and the research sector more broadly. Our trade unions. Civil society. All working with government to solve national problems.

Think of how influential Australia’s leading economists were in the 1950s and 1960s as Australia mobilised its industrial and human resources after the second world war.

And in the 1980s, when economic expertise helped drive the modernisation of Australian industry and the internationalisation of the wider economy.

Social scientists across many disciplines have co-created a positive, distinctly Australian approach to anti-discrimination and equal opportunity for women, migrants and the First Australians.

Health economists helped design Australia’s public health insurance system.

Australia’s epidemiologists and visionary public servants, political advisers and ministers spearheaded Australian responses to the HIV-AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s – and that set us up well for Australia’s COVID pandemic response.

Active collaboration between researchers and policymakers has done so much good for the health and living standards of Australians over the years.

Australia’s climate journey

Of course, there is one policy area where Australia’s world-leading researchers have, at times, been disrespected and ignored for ideological and opportunistic reasons, and at great cost to Australia.

I’m speaking, of course, about climate and energy policy, and its implications for industry policy.

Fifty years ago, researchers began referring to ‘global warming’ in scientific journals to describe the effect of carbon emissions on earth’s atmosphere.

And for 40 years at least, policymakers have been deliberating in national and international fora in search of substantial, practical responses.

Australia has everything at stake here.

A failure to lead on the global response would exacerbate all of the agricultural, industrial, public health, strategic and other risks set out in the National Climate Risk Assessment, released last week.

The Treasury modelling, and common sense, ably demonstrate the consequence of policy paralysis or inadequate, stop-start approaches to energy and industrial policy.

And more than any other place on earth, we have most to gain from a low-carbon global economy thanks to our vast solar and wind resources, mineral wealth, proximity to growing markets and strategic partnerships.

As a highly carbon-intensive and trade-oriented economy, Australia was always going to find decarbonisation to be a big challenge.

Early on, Australian governments respected the scientists who were diagnosing the problem as well as the economists and social scientists who were proposing practicable, pragmatic solutions in Australia’s national interest.

The Keating Government put Australia’s signature to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – showing that Australia was serious about its role in reducing global carbon emissions.

The Howard Government – rarely progressive but usually pragmatic – legislated Australia’s first mandatory renewable energy target and developed plans for an emissions trading scheme.

The Rudd and Gillard Labor Governments moved heaven and earth to find a way through the political quagmire in which good climate and energy policy got stuck after 2009, when an unholy alliance of Coalition and Greens senators scuttled Labor’s emissions trading scheme.

None of those governments got everything right.

But nobody doubted their policy seriousness, their commitment to answering big problems with practical solutions, and their respect for the expert advice of scientists, researchers, the academy and the public service.

As a result, Australia has a range of tools at its disposal - renewable energy and emissions reduction targets, special investment vehicles for clean energy finance and industrial decarbonisation, and strong global partnerships – to draw on in the mission to avoid dangerous levels of warming.

The wasted decade

Of course, Australians know that the strategic leadership and evidence-based approach adopted by earlier governments was not sustained during the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years.

The Coalition spent nine years in government engaged in an internal contest over climate and energy policy.

The result of those years and that paralysis was 22 discarded climate and energy policies and enormous investment uncertainty.

It seems obvious, but policy stability really matters for attracting the investment to drive big missions like industrial decarbonisation, research and development in energy efficiency and boosting the contribution of renewable energy resources to the Australian grid.

And for the regional Australian communities whose jobs are concentrated in heavy industries, policy stability matters too.

Instead, what we saw was policy chaos leading to corporate underinvestment in new and emerging technologies, including energy generation and infrastructure and new production processes, and in fact disinvestment in nation-building energy projects.

At the same time, Australia became a leading global exporter of LNG and, regrettably, an importer of the world’s volatile and high gas prices.

Taken together, unaffordable energy and domestic underinvestment, along with overcapacity in other markets and disruptions in global trade, have left Australia’s industrial sector in a precarious position.

Industry policy that works

In the face of growing economic and strategic competition, Australia must strengthen its existing industrial infrastructure, not abandon it.

That’s why the Albanese Labor Government has undertaken major and transformational industry policy with the Future Made in Australia agenda, encouraging investment and creating opportunity for Australian firms, workers and regional communities, so that they can share in the benefits of the shift to a low carbon economy.

This is a modern industrial policy framework. It doesn’t start with the premise that traditionally informed industry policy, which was focused upon the economic and social benefit of investment in industrial capability. But it starts, as the Future Made in Australia Act does, with what the national objectives and imperatives are.

For the Future Made in Australia, the two national interest framework principles are, firstly, founded in economic resilience and a security and strategic rationale, and secondly, in establishing Australia’s future competitive and comparative advantages in our mineral resources and low cost future energy capability.

The economic and social outcomes, which will be felt mostly in our outer suburbs and our industrial regions – again, I think of the sterile language of the economists here – as spillover benefits.

That is modern industrial policy – focused on the national interest.

Turning challenge into opportunity for revitalised industries, greater economic complexity, national resilience and good jobs

That’s what modern industrial policy can deliver when it really works.

Let me set out just one industrial and resource opportunity: the iron and steel sector.

Australia should use its vast iron ore resources and renewable energy to manufacture iron here and export value-added iron and steel products to our partners around the world, decarbonising iron and steel industrial processes for our steelmaking partners, and protecting our iron ore exporters from replacement as our customers invest in other mining regions.

The Albanese government is investing $1 billion through the Green Iron Investment Fund to support early movers to establish in Australia.

We’re backing battery manufacturing through the Battery Breakthrough Initiative.

And delivering a long-term capability in aluminium production using renewable energy through the Green Aluminium Production Credit.

In terms of the iron possibilities for Australia, the proposition that we might remove for our steelmaking partners the most emissions-intensive step in global steelmaking (which contributes about 8 per cent to global emissions) and onshore that capability here and protect the future of our iron ore sector – so reducing emissions, protecting the future of our iron ore sector, delivering good jobs, improving Australia’s economic complexity and having a big impact on productivity – that is a nation-building

objective worth fighting for.

That’s what this industrial policy framework is directed towards.

The Albanese Government routinely draws on Australia’s own scientific, economic and strategic expertise – at the CSIRO, at our university campuses, and in this sector, at the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre, and in the private sector – to make sure Australia can become a low-carbon powerhouse for the region and the world.

Change on this scale requires a clear vision for the future, courage, and a willingness take decisions in the present that make that future reachable.

This is not without its challenges. Australia’s old and unreliable coal-power stations and unaffordable gas is putting significant pressure on Australia’s industrial facilities.

For some sectors, abatement technology does not exist or is too expensive.

The Industry Sector Plan that I released with Minister Chris Bowen last week acknowledges these challenges in an honest and forthright way, and lays out a credible path for how industry can invest in new capital to reduce emissions and become more internationally competitive.

The Commonwealth and the states need to build the modern renewable energy grid faster and address the energy market pressures that could stand in the way of a Future Made in Australia.

The work of my colleagues, Minister Bowen and Minister Madeline King, on the Gas Market Review and the National Electricity Market wholesale market settings review, is particularly important.

As is the work of Minister Murray Watt in reforming environmental approvals that will expedite renewable generation and transmission projects, while protecting Australia’s environment.

The new $5 billion Net Zero Fund within the National Reconstruction Fund, announced last week, will be another tool to support Australian heavy industry to increase energy efficiency, become more productive and to decarbonise, as well as encouraging the scale-up of low emissions technology manufacturing.

I look forward to opening consultation on the Fund in a matter of days.

I’m determined to make it work for industry to meet the kind of objectives that I set out a few minutes ago, in heavy industry terms, in new technology terms, and making a real contribution to Australia’s future economic complexity.

Conclusion

In aggregate, these initiatives offer a purposeful agenda for lower emissions, more dynamic and productive industries and a more economically resilient Australia.

This is the core business of government – making choices in the present that enable a better, stronger, fairer and more resilient Australian society.

That’s hard work, and it depends on a huge range of skills and talents, wisdom and expertise, to make it happen.

I am absolutely optimistic – this is an optimistic government – that if Australia’s collective talents are mobilised – and that has to include the talents of our university sector, researchers and policy experts – then Australia will meet the industrial challenge successfully.

​“I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.” Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming.
Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country.
Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability.
Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.","Funding for Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency programs could be cut by more than $42 million next year in an effort to rein in residents’ soaring power bills. That rollback would deprive the state of more than $90 million in benefits and potentially eliminate hundreds of jobs while creating only modest up-front savings, a new analysis finds.

Rhode Island Energy, the utility that administers the state’s energy-efficiency offerings, has proposed to slash spending on that front by 18% compared to last year and more than 30% compared to the budget originally projected in the nonbinding three-year plan introduced in 2023. If approved, the cuts will save the average household $1.87 per month, according to Rhode Island Energy.

The result of these changes, according to climate action nonprofit Acadia Center, would be more expensive electricity and more exposure to volatile natural gas prices in the long run.

“Energy efficiency is a tool for suppressing supply costs, for suppressing infrastructure costs in the long-term,” said Emily Koo, Acadia Center’s program director for Rhode Island and one of the authors of the group’s analysis. ​“I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.”

Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming. Over the past 15 years, the state has repeatedly placed among the top 10 states in the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s annual energy-efficiency scorecard. Since 2009, the state has spent more than $2 billion on efficiency incentives and services, yielding more than $6 billion in environmental and social benefits.

Now, however, the dynamics of energy markets are creating new obstacles. Nationwide, electricity costs have gone up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year, and gas prices have increased by more than four times the inflation rate. Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Add in cold Northeastern winters, and the state is girding for an expensive season ahead.

As in neighboring states, regulators, elected officials, and utilities in Rhode Island are scrambling for ways to provide some relief for residents and businesses. These efforts have increasingly looked to the bill fees that fund renewable energy incentives and energy-efficiency programs as possible targets for quick, if small, bill reductions. In Maine, for example, leaders from both sides of the aisle have sought to lower incentives for customers and community solar developments that send power back to the grid, and in Massachusetts, utility regulators ordered energy-efficiency administrators to cut $500 million from a planned $5 billion three-year budget.

Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability. The company has the support of the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which points to the growth in accounts with overdue utility bills to bolster its argument that the changes will provide needed relief to consumers.

“There is simply a financial limit as to how much cost the ratepayers can bear,” the department wrote in its public comments on the proposal.

Advocates, however, say the approach is short-sighted.

“This is weaker. It’s a retreat,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance, which opposes the proposed cuts. ​“It just feeds into the narrative — that we don’t accept — that ratepayers aren’t seeing benefits from energy efficiency.”

Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency offerings include home energy assessments, weatherization services, rebates on energy-saving appliances and heating and cooling systems, and contractor training. Residents and businesses that take advantage of these programs generally save money by reducing their energy use.

The programs also create savings for the average consumer, whether or not they participate. Because the improvements slow energy consumption, they allow utilities to build less pricey infrastructure, the cost of which is passed on to customers. Efficiency measures can also lower peak demand, reducing the need to buy costlier, dirtier power from peaker plants. In Rhode Island, efficiency programs lowered electricity use 5% between 2005 and 2024; without these interventions, use would have increased 15%, according to an annual state report.

Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.

“You spend money on energy efficiency or you’re going to spend even more money on power supply,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

Acadia Center’s analysis also finds that more than 800 jobs in the energy-efficiency sector could be at risk if the cuts are adopted.

The draft plan has been through multiple iterations; the most recent version was released on Sept. 5. The state energy-efficiency council is expected to vote on the proposal at its Sept. 25 meeting. The plan will then go to utility regulators for final approval.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2212482104.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0a863a9da97f5262d36eadbc29f9d0e7,N,,2025-09-22 03:58:56.449398

Eleven of the 20 countries surveyed have increased their plans for fossil fuel production since they were last analysed in 2023.
“We are in the foothills of an energy transition that is going to reshape fossil fuel demand,” said Grant.","Governments around the world are ramping up coal, gas and oil extraction which will put climate goals beyond reach, new data has shown.

Far from reducing reliance on fossil fuels, nations are planning higher levels of fossil fuel production for the coming decades than they did in 2023, the last time comparable data was compiled.

This increase goes against the commitments that countries have made at UN climate summits to “transition away from fossil fuels” and phase down production, particularly of coal.

If all of the planned new extraction takes place, the world will produce more than double the quantity of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with holding global temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.

Emily Ghosh, a programme director at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) in the US, said: “Fossil fuel production should have peaked and started to fall. Every year of delay [to the peak and rapid fall required] significantly increases the pressure [on the climate].”

She said an urgent “course correction” from governments was needed, but the current and planned overproduction of fossil fuels meant the world was burning through its remaining “carbon budget” – the amount that can be emitted without permanently exceeding the 1.5C threshold – at a rapid rate.

The Production Gap 2025 report, from the SEI, the Climate Analytics thinktank and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, analysed 20 major producers of fossil fuels around the world, including the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, Canada, Brazil, Australia and the UK, together representing about 80% of global fossil fuel production.

Only the UK, Australia and Norway plan to reduce production of oil and gas by 2030, compared with 2023 levels. Eleven of the 20 countries surveyed have increased their plans for fossil fuel production since they were last analysed in 2023.

Several countries are planning at least to cut coal production, including China, the US, Germany and Indonesia. But India, Russia, Colombia and Australia will ramp up their mining.

Demand for fossil fuels is also key – countries must pursue renewable energy and use energy more efficiently to obviate the need for new oil, gas and coal production. Neil Grant, of Climate Analytics, said: “So far, renewable energy growth has been an addition, alongside fossil fuel demand, and we haven’t seen peak demand. But given the pace of change in the energy system that could change quite significantly.”

As transport, heating and other functions become electrified, less primary energy is needed, as electrification is much more efficient. But less demand for fossil fuels could also make them cheaper, spurring a rebound effect.

“We are in the foothills of an energy transition that is going to reshape fossil fuel demand,” said Grant. “But many governments are thinking in terms of a world where the energy transition happens very incrementally. There’s a lot of danger, [including that] the voice of the fossil fuel lobby only gets louder and holds us back from this change to a cleaner, better, greener economy. That would lead to climate chaos or significant negative economic impacts.”

All countries agreed at the Cop26 UN climate meeting in 2021 to “phase down” coal. The original commitment was to “phase out”, though without a timeline, but a last-minute intervention by China and India resulted in the weaker language being accepted.

At the Cop28 summit in Dubai in 2023, countries agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels”, though without specifying what this would mean in practice.

Derik Broekhoff, the lead author of the report published on Monday, said: “In 2023, governments formally acknowledged the need to move away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change. But as our report makes clear, while many countries have committed to a clean energy transition, many others appear to be stuck using a fossil-fuel-dependent playbook, planning even more production than they were two years ago.”

The Production Gap 2025 report comes as world leaders prepare to meet the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, in New York this week on the sidelines of the UN general assembly.

Guterres will urge countries to come up with fresh commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the Cop30 summit in Brazil this November. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, governments must submit new national plans this year setting out their plans to 2035.

But the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, has already told the Guardian that the national plans would be inadequate to keep the world within the 1.5C limit. Instead, the UN is hoping that countries will agree ways to strengthen their commitments in future and to bring other forces, such as private sector investment, to bear.

On Monday, a separate report from the Industrial Transition Accelerator estimated that of more than 700 low-carbon industrial installations in planning and development around the world, only 15 a year were gaining the finance necessary to go into full production. This represented a $1.6tn (£1.2tn) opportunity for investors, the group said.

“To keep the 1.5C goal in reach, the world needs rapid reductions in coal, oil and gas investments, redirecting those resources towards an energy transition that prioritises equity and justice,” said Ghosh. “Governments must commit to expand renewables, phase out fossil fuels, manage energy demands and implement community-centred energy transitions.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0520a9a0c8854327786deba4c661621fa617df8/707_0_7108_5686/master/7108.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=912c0142c0789f188d5bcb66da890cfe",N,,2025-09-22 03:59:00.779398

🌱 What is a Power Purchase Agreement?

A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a long-term contract between a power producer and a buyer for the purchase of electricity. Often referred to as Green Power Purchase Agreements (Green PPAs), these agreements typically last between 5 to 20 years.

Under a PPA, developers sell electricity at a fixed rate, usually lower than utility retail prices, providing cost stability and clean energy benefits to buyers. The agreement ensures that developers earn revenue not only from electricity sales but also from tax credits and renewable incentives.

At the end of the PPA term, customers often have the option to extend the agreement or purchase the renewable system outright.

🔑 Key Findings of the Study

As a key raw material for lithium-ion batteries, lithium prices are closely tied to the dynamics of the EV industry. In 2022, battery-grade lithium carbonate prices in China hit a record high due to expectations of explosive demand, but subsequently experienced a sharp correction. Although prices recently saw a short-lived rebound driven by supply concerns from Chinese mines, the overall market remains oversupplied.

However, amid widespread pessimism toward the lithium sector, contrarian investing thinking reminds us that the most profound opportunities often emerge during the coldest winters. Investing in lithium stocks is not based on short-term price movements but on a deep understanding of several core logics.

First, the underlying trend of energy transition is irreversible. The carbon neutrality goals set by major global economies are not short-term policies but represent a fundamental transformation of the energy structure over the coming decades. Despite short-term challenges such as slowing growth in the EV industry and insufficient charging infrastructure, the long-term shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs remains unchanged. The current industry downturn will likely weed out weaker players, paving the way for healthier future development.

At the same time, supply-side consolidation is inevitable. Current low prices are putting significant pressure on high-cost producers and will continue to do so. When prices remain below cash costs for an extended period, mines will be forced to halt production, undergo maintenance, or shut down, while financing and construction of new projects will face delays. This process will effectively reduce supply, creating conditions for the next rebalancing of supply and demand. Investing in industry leaders with low costs and strong financials during this period is akin to being greedy when others are fearful.

Based on this analysis, the following lithium stocks and ETFs are worth watching:

1. Industry Leader: Albemarle (ALB)

As one of the world’s largest lithium producers, Albemarle strengthens its industry position with a global presence across six continents and a vertically integrated business model (covering mining, refining, and purification). Long-term contracts effectively hedge against lithium price volatility, while its bromine and catalyst businesses provide diversified revenue streams. Recently, the company has accelerated its strategic moves: two lithium processing capacity expansion projects are in their final stages, and it has announced a new lithium conversion facility in the southeastern U.S. with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons (expected to be operational by the end of 2029).

2. Automaker-Backed Strategy: Livent (LTHM)

Livent, with its core expertise in battery-grade lithium hydroxide, has secured a six-year supply agreement with General Motors (GM) starting in 2025 and plans to relocate all its downstream production lines to North America. A €285 million lithium supply agreement with the BMW Group further solidifies its demand outlook. To meet surging demand, the company is tripling its lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina and expanding lithium hydroxide production across multiple global locations. Capacity expansion and long-term contracts form a solid foundation for growth.

3. Technology Innovator: Standard Lithium (SLI)

The company leverages its 150,000-acre Smackover project in Arkansas and the Bristol Lake project in California, adopting revolutionary LiSTR Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology to significantly improve recovery rates and reduce environmental impact. Its partnership with Norwegian energy giant Equinor provides financial security, while recent collaboration with Telescope Innovations on carbon reduction technology promotes greener production processes.

4. Resource Giant: Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)

With its resources in the Atacama Salt Flat, SQM remains the world’s largest lithium producer. The company plans to increase its production capacity to 230,000 tons by 2025, including a $490 million investment to build the world’s largest lithium refinery. Recent lithium hydroxide supply agreements with Hyundai-Kia and a joint venture with Chile’s state-owned copper producer Codelco (extending through 2060) highlight its strategic positioning.

As the knowledge partner for the ICC Global Business Summit 2025, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) contributed to the Green Tech & Energy Forum, emphasizing the critical link between India’s clean energy goals and its workforce.

The forum’s opening address by Mr Anil Razdan, former Secretary at the Ministry of Power, underscored the urgent need to mitigate global warming. He highlighted that this is the era of chemical engineers and innovators who must solve complex challenges and stressed the need for global collaboration to train both current and future generations in emerging technologies.

Mr AK Saxena, Senior Director at TERI, reinforced this message by pointing to the “twin drivers” of demand-pull and knowledge-push in technology development. He stressed the importance of aligning India’s human capital with its clean energy ambitions.

In this context, TERI has released a knowledge paper, “Emerging Energy Technologies and Workforce Transformation in India.” The paper outlines key technology trends, market trajectories, and skill gaps, proposing a strategic roadmap to align the nation’s workforce with its clean energy future.

Context

India’s transition to a clean, resilient economy by 2047 depends not just on technology but on a skilled workforce. Rapid advancements in sectors like green hydrogen, semiconductors, and AI are facing a significant constraint: a talent shortage that could slow down progress.

Technology and Market Landscape

Green Hydrogen: India targets 5 MMT per annum by 2030, backed by ₹19,744 crore under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Electrolyser manufacturing is scaling, with tenders breaking the ₹50/kg green ammonia barrier. The challenge is cost competitiveness and creating skilled talent for stack engineering, hydrogen safety, and compression-logistics.

Waste-to-Energy: Installed capacity has nearly doubled since 2020, but at ~855 MW remains only 15 per cent of potential. Projects are challenged by poor waste segregation, public acceptance, and shortage of plant-ready operators. Policy reforms, PPPs, and better training can unlock urban waste’s 5,690 MW energy potential.

Semiconductors: The $10 billion India Semiconductor Mission has attracted multiple fab and ATMP proposals. Micron’s $2.75 billion facility is a milestone, but fewer than 200 professionals in India have fab experience, making workforce development urgent.

AI & Data Centres: Data centre capacity is projected to grow 6–7× by 2030, with $14 billion in committed investment. AI adoption can cut renewable forecasting errors by 20–30 per cent, but a shortage of grid-AI engineers, MLOps specialists, and critical-environment technicians is a significant risk.

Skill Gap and Workforce Imperatives

Current workforce readiness is inadequate: over 65 % of new clean-energy roles require re-skilling, yet formal vocational training reaches only 4 % of India’s labour force. Semiconductor fabs, hydrogen hubs, and AI-driven grid projects face project delays if talent gaps persist. Key roles identified include electrolyser stack engineers, CBG process operators, cleanroom technicians, and grid-AI engineers. Demand for many of these roles is projected to more than double by 2030, underscoring the need for immediate action on curricula, apprenticeships, and certification pathways.

Strategic Roadmap

The report recommends integrating human capital development into every mission and incentive programme. The roadmap proposes:

Integrated Planning: Workforce annexes specifying role counts and training targets for every major project.

Certification First: Nationally recognised, vendor-validated credentials to make skills portable and trusted.

Practice-Focused Training: Labs, simulators, and plant residencies to shorten time from training to deployment.

Demand Aggregation: Industry clusters to publish 3–5-year hiring forecasts to guide academic capacity planning.

Enablers and Outcomes

Four system-level enablers are critical:

Workforce mandates embedded in tenders

Outcome-linked funding tied to placement rates

A national skills dashboard for real-time visibility

Faculty and trainer development through industry sabbaticals

If implemented, this strategy could deliver higher placement rates, higher productivity across assets, and an exportable pool of skilled professionals, turning India’s demographic dividend into a competitive advantage in the global clean energy economy.

For several decades, Congress has been gridlocked on environmental health protections, while lobbying and lawsuits have halted most regulatory actions.
RFK Jr. talks a good game about “making America healthy again.” But governors and state legislators are actually getting it done.
She is the author of the forthcoming book A Healthy Union: How States Can Lead on Environmental Health.","Some of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plans to improve the nation’s health are based on solid evidence. His observation about children’s increased rates of chronic disease is correct, as are some of the likely contributors he points to, such as pesticides and microplastics.

However, the Health and Human Services secretary appears unable or unwilling to implement plans to address that issue. While he previously criticized the country’s “chemical-industrial agriculture” model, RFK Jr. has not proposed actions to reduce pesticides in food. In fact, he recently gave assurances to industry representatives that backpedaled on his past statements. And the Environmental Protection Agency, which has the primary authority to reduce pesticide use, has been approving new pesticides and aiming to bring back others that had been banned or restricted, like dicamba.

But policymakers at the state level aren’t waiting for federal action. Across a wide political spectrum, lawmakers — shored up by concerned parents — are making significant progress.

The National Caucus of Environmental Legislators reports, for example, that so far in 2025 lawmakers in 37 states — from Alabama to Iowa to New Jersey — have proposed legislation aimed at reducing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Added to items from cookware to firefighting foam and known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment, PFAS are linked with a range of serious health problems.

There are many more examples of state action across the country and across political perspectives. Arkansas, for instance, now requires warning labels on hair relaxer products that contain certain toxic chemicals.

This action at the state level is not new. For several decades, Congress has been gridlocked on environmental health protections, while lobbying and lawsuits have halted most regulatory actions. To fill these gaps, some statehouses have taken up the slack — and this pattern is growing.

State-led efforts have appeal across the political spectrum. For those who dislike federal intrusion into local matters, this movement prioritizes the preferences of states’ residents. For those troubled by the inadequacy of federal protections, state action offers an alternate route to protecting communities from pollution and toxic chemicals.

States that are starting to take steps in this direction can learn from successful policies elsewhere. When it comes to protecting children from pesticides, Texas was already in the lead, with a farsighted law that requires every school district to implement policies and practices to reduce pesticide use. It girds this mandate with extensive education, technical assistance and enforcement.

Massachusetts’ Toxics Use Reduction Act requires industrial facilities that manufacture, process or otherwise use certain toxic chemicals to report their use and develop strategies to reduce harm. As with Texas’ pesticide law, a partnership among state agencies, a university and industry ensures that the latest know-how is developed and applied.

State efforts to protect their residents’ health are by no means limited to regulating harmful chemicals. In Tennessee, representatives of 24 state agencies, departments and commissions that impact health — from environment, conservation and agriculture to education and human services — meet regularly to get to know each other’s work and identify opportunities for collaboration.

A leading example of what is known as “health in all policies,“ Tennessee’s effort breaks down silos that are often found in government. Cross-departmental collaboration aims to coordinate services for food, housing and transit. Transportation staff work with health officials, so opportunities for safe walking and bicycling are included in road planning.

Regional efforts are on the rise too. When a group of states that share climate and culture join forces, they can accomplish more than they can singly. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states has successfully reduced warming emissions through a structure in which participants share resources, achieving greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. And the Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability brings together environmental and military officials from six states to sustain both natural resources and national defense assets in the region. The program has leveraged private funding to protect and restore more than 1.3 million acres of land while preserving mission-critical infrastructure and capabilities.

Many of these best-practice policies have been evaluated, so information on outcomes and lessons learned is available. Common contributors to successful state initiatives include environmental health education and analyses that examine a broad range of costs and benefits of policies.

RFK Jr. talks a good game about “making America healthy again.” But governors and state legislators are actually getting it done.

BARCELONA (Reuters) -When Javier Hernandez went car shopping in Barcelona, he ended up choosing a plug-in hybrid by China’s BYD – swayed by a price nearly 10,000 euros cheaper than European rivals.

The 51-year-old Spanish excavator operator wanted something cheap and versatile for city drives and trips to the Catalan mountains, but had doubts about Chinese electrified cars as he didn’t know the brands well.

With government subsidies, the BYD Seal U DM-I Hernandez opted for starts at around 30,000 euros ($35,289) in Spain, compared to over 40,000 euros for VW’s Tiguan and Peugeot’s 3008 plug-in hybrid models.

“The value for money was better, I tried it out and they could give it to me right away,” he told Reuters.

CHEAPER CARS, MORE DEALERSHIPS

Cost-conscious buyers like Hernandez are fuelling rapid growth for Chinese EV carmakers like BYD in Spain and around Europe, stepping up competition with regional and U.S. rivals like Tesla, Stellantis and Volkswagen.

“Until the arrival of BYD, if you wanted to buy an electric vehicle, you had to spend a hell of a lot of money,” BYD country manager for Spain and Portugal Alberto De Aza told Reuters.

BYD’s Spanish dealership network has nearly quadrupled to almost 100 dealers from 25 last year, De Aza said, accompanied by aggressive marketing and discounts.

Meanwhile, most established car brands have closed dealerships. Data from Faconauto shows legacy brands had 1,648 dealerships in 2024, down from 2,164 a decade ago. Volkswagen and Audi dealerships fell 40% in that period.

“Chinese competitors are increasing the pressure, and not just on us,” Markus Haupt, interim CEO of Volkswagen-owned SEAT told Reuters last week.

CHINESE EV SURGE IN MARKET SHARE

BYD’s share of Spain’s EV market, including fully-electric models and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), climbed to more than 10% in Spain in July despite EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. That’s more than double its European average and three times Tesla’s 3.3%.

Its share of Spain’s total car market has risen to 1.8% through August from 0.3% last year, surpassing brands like Stellantis’ Jeep or Volvo, data by industry group ANFAC shows. The Seal U is Spain’s most popular plug-in hybrid so far this year.

Still, it trails behind top selling brands like Toyota, Renault and Volkswagen.

SPAIN: A GATEWAY FOR EXPANSION

Spain’s lack of a national automotive champion makes it fertile ground for Chinese expansion, analysts say.

“It doesn’t have a strong local carmaker,” said Felipe Munoz, analyst at JATO Dynamics, adding that SEAT had lost some of its Spanish identity having been bought by Germany’s VW and looked the most exposed.

SEAT’s sales are up 4% so far this year, underperforming the broader Spanish market which rose 15%, ANFAC data shows. SEAT’s sister brand, up-market Cupra slightly outperformed, with sales up 17%.

Sales of Chinese cars are growing faster. SAIC-owned MG was up 58%, while Chery’s Omoda more than doubled its sales in Spain year-on-year through August. BYD sales were up 675% through August to over 14,000 cars.

BYD EYES EUROPEAN PRODUCTION

With cutthroat competition in their domestic market, Chinese brands are increasingly targeting Europe.

BYD aims to produce all EVs for sale in Europe locally within three years and is building a plant in Hungary. Spain could be an ideal location for further expansion thanks to its industrial infrastructure and cheap electricity, said De Aza.

Still, challenges remain.

Combined battery-electric and plug-in hybrid sales in Spain made up 21% of total car sales in July versus 10% in August last year, but below the European average of 27%.

Insufficient charging infrastructure has caused slower-than-expected EV uptake in many European markets, especially in the south. Spain has some 50,000 charging points, a third of the number in the Netherlands despite a far larger population.

For now, Spanish motorists much prefer hybrids and PHEVs, which are central to BYD’s European expansion plans.

One of them is Juan Gonzalez, a 56-year-old head of an IT department who has solar panels that could charge any EV model, but bought a BYD plug-in hybrid because he worried about longer journeys.

“If you run out of battery and you have to tackle a mountain pass you’re really in trouble,” he said.

But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy

and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith

Those were powerful memories that will last my life. But I was also taken by the pictures that showed quieter moments—for instance, people huddled in basements so that they could see their neighbor’s heat pumps or solar inverters, demystifying the whole process of converting to clean power. This is from South Carolina—and it’s how we’re going to turn people into solar consumers across the country.

And here are Wisconsites setting out on a solar tour of the state’s capital

Some of the images were spectacularly beautiful. Christal Brown choreographed a dance among the solar panels on the campus of Middlebury College.

And some were literally sweet—here’s someone making s’mores in a solar oven in San Leandro California

Everywhere the beauty of the logo (thanks Brian Collins, Beth Johnson, Eron Lutterman) was on display. (Oh, and read the account of its design from Fast Company)

So many people and organizations helped make the day happen: Fossil Free Media, of course, with Jamie Henn and Deirdre Shelly leading an amazing crew; Solar United Neighbors, the Sierra Club, Mothers Out Front, Climate Revival, Green Faith, Dayenu, a hundred more. My colleagues at Third Act were absolutely crucial: here’s Deborah Moore and Anna Goldstein, who worked around the clock

But everywhere there were kids out enjoying the spectacle. Our great hope is that they’ll grow up in a world where it seems utterly obvious to power the planet with clean energy from the sun, instead of filling the air (and their lungs) with the smoke from humanity’s fires.

For a day it was possible to believe in all of that—and the human energy that belief unleashes allows us to make it happen. Even as the afternoon went on I was hearing of plans to introduce balcony solar laws in half a dozen states (and of plans to take this day global in the years ahead). In some sense the work has just begun

I’ll have many more images and reports in the days ahead—we’ve barely begun to sift through all that’s been pouring in these last hours. But time for a well-earned rest (and I have an early morning trip to Chicago—the beat goes on!). As the sun goes down (and the batteries that have been soaking up sunshine all afternoon kick in) I just want to say: Thank you all so very very much

+Wildfire smoke in America is now killing 40,000 people a year, more than car crashes. As the Washington Post reports:

“Those are huge numbers,” said Minghao Qiu, assistant professor at Stony Brook University and lead author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Nature. “This is one of the most costly and important climate impacts in the U.S.”

Between 2006 and 2019, the average cumulative smoke exposure across the country each year hovered around 100 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air, according to a preprint paper by the same author group that has yet to undergo peer review. But since 2020, Americans have increasingly been bombarded by toxic smoke. In 2023, when a sickly orange glow filled the skies of New York City and other East Coast metropolises, Americans experienced levels eight times higher. The years 2020 through 2024 have been the most extreme smoke years on record.

+New York’s utility regulator has endorsed a new gas pipeline across the Empire State—the residue of a deal by governor Kathy Hochul with Donald Trump

“This is not how you stand up for New York ratepayers, let alone our children and grandchildren who will be saddled with the true cost of this folly,” said state Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposes the project.

The pipeline would run under New York Harbor and connect to natural gas infrastructure that’s already in place off the coast of Queens.

A sardonic ad takes on the governor’s trademark weakness

+A big new campaign for public renewable power is underway across the country. Advocates argue that

Traditional for-profit models of renewable energy development are not moving fast enough.

By adding public renewable energy developers, states and cities can accelerate the transition, build projects that otherwise would not get built, cut costs for schools communities, and deploy resources at the scale needed to meet our climate goals.

An early project: a case study on how public power projects have made Connecticut the leader in school rooftop solar.

+Germany’s largest agrivoltaic project has come online. As Sandra Enkhardt reports:

For livestock farming, six mobile chicken coops, each housing up to 2,500 chickens, are planned. A conventional four-crop rotation is also foreseen for arable land. Vattenfall said the modules are mounted on a longitudinal axis and can tilt east-west from a horizontal position. Wider spacing between rows allows access for agricultural machinery.

+Tax credits for EVs are ending in America in ten days time, ten years ahead of schedule (thanks GOP Congress!). But automakers have a plan: much cheaper EV pickup trucks are coming soon, from a start up called Slate, and from Ford. As Kyle Stock explains,

A decade ago, someone in the market for a new car with less than $25,000 to spend, had 43 different models to choose from. Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. None is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Donald Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

+Amidst the joy of today’s celebrations, a really sad note. Global Witness just released its annual report on the environmental defenders killed in the past year. I got to lead the ceremony for these dead a few years ago; every year the numbers remind me not to feel sorry for myself, even in newly repressive America. It could be worse.

Last year, 146 people were murdered or disappeared for doing this work.

We acknowledge that the names of many defenders who were killed or disappeared last year may be missing and we may never know how many more gave their lives to protect our planet. We honour their work too.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute.
There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says.","The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he announced rollbacks.

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future.

Ben Hulac: The short answer, the technical answer is Republicans were looking for ways to pay for their broader tax breaks for corporations.
Remember, Congress is in charge of writing tax law and administrations carry out tax law.
But also, I should mention a commercial scale solar tax credit will be phased out next summer.
And that was also a Biden-era tax credit that was going to go for about a decade.","Homeowners in New Jersey and beyond are rushing to install solar panels on their rooftops in order to qualify for a federal tax credit that expires at the end of the year.

Congress zeroed out that tax credit, which covers 30% of a new residential solar project, as part of a broader Republican budget law.

The loss of that federal incentive is one several threats facing the domestic solar industry, as our correspondent in Washington, Ben Hulac, explains. This interview has been excerpted and lightly edited.

Briana Vannozzi, anchor: So, Ben, this tax credit was supposed to last until 2032. Why then did Congress decide to cut it nearly a decade short?

Ben Hulac: The short answer, the technical answer is Republicans were looking for ways to pay for their broader tax breaks for corporations. This was part, if we remember back to the summer, there was a lot of debate here on the Hill about how to pass and how to pay for this massive trillion dollar bill now law.

And this was an item that Republicans wanted. So they essentially went through lots of Biden-era tax breaks for renewables, for wind, for solar, and phased them out early in order to pay for their broader package.

BV: So I know you write, you report that demand has just gone through the roof. This really lit a fire under people. What does that looked like on the ground? I mean, how many people are actually calling and requesting quotes? And we should note this is, you know, really for residential homes.

BH: Right. So I talked with two people I mentioned Lyle Rawlings, who’s a business owner owns his own solar company. And he said salespeople are just swamped. And then I talked to a woman named Emily Walker, who works for a company called EnergySage. And EnergySage crunches data and numbers about solar demand. Their numbers show that just within New Jersey, from June to July, people requesting quotes for what it would cost to put solar on their homes, which skyrocketed 109%.

So that’s a huge jump. And that coincides with Congress debating this broader law. So the interest. And New Jersey is not an outlier in this. There is a race nationwide. If you are interested in putting solar on your home, you are pedal to the metal now.

BV: Yeah, 109% that’s significant. I mean, okay, if I’m a homeowner and I want to get this installed connected before the deadline, is that even possible? And what do I need to know then?

BH: Right. It is possible. You should probably do it now. And I actually talked with a solar advocate in Philadelphia, a woman named Elowyn Corby with a solar advocacy group called Vote Solar. And this is what she said.

Elowyn Corby: If you’re interested in going solar, you should start soon. The process of getting solar is much more than the, you know, two or three days it can take to put the actual solar on your roof. It includes permitting. It includes a number of logistical steps that I would recommend not rushing. You also want to make sure that you’re taking the time to make sure you’re working with a reputable installer, someone who you trust, someone who’s done a lot of work in the community. So start now because there can be more steps than, you know, starting five days before the deadline isn’t going to work out the way you hope it will.

BV: Yeah. And so, Ben, then what happens if someone is not connected in time for the deadline?

BH: If someone is not connected, then they are likely out this tax credit, which on average could defray about $9,000 worth of the cost. So it costs tens of thousands of dollars to install panels on your home. That’s a ballpark figure. Maybe about $30,000 is a good sort of rule of thumb. This $9,000 chunk of that money could be massive and could mean the difference between someone saying, yes, I’d like to take this plunge and go solar and try to maybe in theory, go off the grid and be my own little electrical island. Or going back and canceling those plans. So it’s a big deal.

BV: How does all of this play into the broader energy policy that we’re seeing from the White House and also some retroactive tariffs that could really impact the industry, as you note? How does this all play together?

BH: The tenor on science and on renewables out of this administration has been extremely aggressive and negative. The energy secretary actually recently assembled an anti-climate science report that purported to debunk well-established climate science that is of course, not true. Humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels oil, coal and gas. But this is this is sort of one tendril.

This solar, this anti-solar approach, this one tendril out of Congress, out of the Republican-led administration to slow efforts to clean up the power grid, to decarbonize the broader U.S. energy system. I would say it just it fits the pattern in a lot of ways and a lot of the money. Remember, Congress is in charge of writing tax law and administrations carry out tax law. But this cut that we’ve been talking about, Bri, is just one of many that this Congress has doled out so far.

BV: Yeah. And I wonder just about the long term impact here. What did some of the advocates say who you spoke with about how this affects the industry in the long term and maybe even some of these policies in the long term, you know, the appetite for it all?

BH: Right. It’s really put a damper on the appetite. There is a lot of frenetic energy in this moment to get people hooked up to the grid, to get people on solar before the year is out. But also, I should mention a commercial scale solar tax credit will be phased out next summer. And that was also a Biden-era tax credit that was going to go for about a decade.

Now, they’re nine years roughly short of that original target. And so people are scrambling on the commercial solar side as well. And then, of course, we haven’t really delved into this, but tariffs are another massive sort of ax hanging over this industry. The administration has floated retroactive tariffs, which would be extremely destabilizing for the industry and could go back two years and charge importers on what is already on U.S. shores.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office.

NJ utility bills spike, fueling voter backlash and concern

Author urges lawmakers to balance cost, reliability, environment

Natural gas remains critical to grid stability and demand, writer says

Calls for investment in modern energy infrastructure

Lawmakers are looking for answers in the face of recent increases to electric utility bills. With already high living costs, the public response to these increases has come in the form of a swift and justified backlash. And not surprisingly, this complex and multifaceted issue – which requires a balancing of cost, reliability and the environment – is center stage in the gubernatorial election.

The outcome of the most recent annual regional capacity market auction sent a clear message: demand is rising, supply is lagging, and the consequences are significant and impact everyone. And the time is now to reexamine the state’s energy policies to make certain they are consistent and keeping pace with the needs of the state and its residents.

Key to any honest energy discussion is the observation that demand for energy is going up. This requires more power from more sources and the avoidance of prematurely retiring energy sources – especially natural gas – without viable, scalable replacements.

It goes without debate that a robust, well-functioning and reliable power system is essential to the health, safety, and prosperity at both the state and federal levels. Accordingly, the state and region need the right combination of resources – power plants and energy efficiency as well as accompanying infrastructure – to ensure reliability, particularly when demand is most significant and pronounced during heat waves and cold snaps.

We must prioritize investment in transmission and delivery infrastructure. The best mix of energy sources is only as strong as the grid that carries it. That means removing unnecessary regulatory roadblocks, upgrading aging systems and building with the future in mind. Without a robust and flexible grid, even the most ambitious clean energy goals will fall short.

Right now, about 72% of New Jersey households rely on natural gas as their primary heating fuel and 17% use electricity for space heating. Additionally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost half of the power consumed is derived from natural gas.

This isn’t about turning our backs on alternative energy sources, rather, it’s about complementing them. Natural gas isn’t the enemy of renewable power, it’s an ally. It provides crucial backup to intermittent resources. Natural gas plants can ramp up quickly to meet sudden spikes in demand, something renewables, for all their promise, cannot yet do consistently or reliably on their own. That flexibility is essential for managing cold snaps, heatwaves and periods of rapid economic growth.

This isn’t about turning our backs on alternative energy sources, rather, it’s about complementing them.

Having an approach that takes advantage of all energy sources doesn’t just help stabilize electric prices and strengthen reliability, it also supports thousands of good-paying union jobs, keeps our manufacturing sector competitive, and helps ensure that major employers like hospitals and tech firms don’t start looking elsewhere for more dependable energy solutions.

The next governor should promote a diverse and reliable energy mix and have policies that support carbon reduction through innovation and infrastructure, not through mandates that ignore economic and logistical realities. Leadership doesn’t mean pretending we can leap to a zero-carbon future overnight, rather it means creating a clear, achievable roadmap that protects our environment while also protecting ratepayers and preserving our economic competitiveness.

Energy policy doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. We can support all types of energy sources including the vital role conventional fuels play in our current system. To do otherwise we risk failing on all three fronts: the environment, grid reliability, and price.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/09/Electric-Bill-illustration.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 00:58:41.278712

It’s only been a few months since the Trump administration and lawmakers like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley succeeded in derailing the Grain Belt Express, a high-voltage transmission line that would have brought clean energy to much of the upper Midwest. It’s not clear whether the project will go forward, but it’s already clear that people will pay more for electricity as a result—and nowhere is that more clear than in Missouri.

The Grain Belt Express would have carried 5,000 megawatts of wind power from Kansas across Missouri and Illinois into Indiana. The 1,280-kilometre project, slated to cost $11 billion and scheduled to begin construction next year, has drawn fire from critics—whose opposition includes its use of eminent domain to cross private property—and has been the target of Republican opponents like Hawley for well over a decade.

After years of lawsuits, regulatory review, and political battles in the Show-Me State, Invenergy, the nation’s largest privately-held clean energy supplier, received state approval from Kansas and Missouri in 2019. It began acquiring access to land as similar work proceeded elsewhere along the route. In March, Andrew Bailey, who was until recently Missouri’s attorney general, urged Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to cancel the loan. He called the Grain Belt Express a project by “far-left deep staters” dedicated to undermining farmers.

Bailey opened an investigation into the project in July, alleging that Invenergy had overstated its economic benefits, and called on the state Public Service Commission to reconsider its approval. President Trump, with Hawley’s encouragement, reportedly called Energy Secretary Chris Wright and told him to cancel a US$5 billion conditional loan the Department of Energy approved in November to underwrite construction. The agency did just that on July 23, a move Hawley called “a huge win” for Missouri.

However, it’s likely that Missourians will suffer if the line is not built: It was predicted to save state ratepayers almost $18 billion in utility bills in the coming years—though Bailey has called that figure an overstatement. Jesse Jenkins, of Princeton’s REPEAT Project, which analyzes how federal climate and energy policies impact emissions and energy systems, said it’s useful to think of Grain Belt Express as “roughly five nuclear reactors’ worth of low-cost energy.” Thirty-nine municipal utilities across Missouri—including several in the same rural communities Hawley claims would be harmed by the transmission line—have already signed up to tap that supply. If the line is not built, “all the customers in all these cities are going to see higher prices than they normally would have,” said Andy Knott of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign.

Hawley’s offices in Washington, D.C. and Columbia, Missouri did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment.

This, on top of the local impacts of the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill spending package—which one study suggested will cause Missouri electricity bills to skyrocket more than any other state—could create a dire situation for those already struggling to make ends meet. Kera Mashek, of the United Way of Greater Kansas City, said more than 14,000 people have called the Kansas City area 211 line seeking utility assistance so far this year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to increase Missourians’ electricity bills $240 a year by 2030 and $800 a year by 2035, according to a study from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy policy think tank. It also could hinder climate progress. Clean energy tax credits granted by the Biden administration and rescinded by the Trump administration likely would have incentivized power companies to bring cheaper energy sources online. Without the incentives, they’ll probably continue repairing aging coal-fired plant infrastructure indefinitely, said Megan Mahajan, a co-author of the study.

The idea that people’s bills are going to go up is “certainly concerning for us,” Mashek said. Given the looming cuts to Medicaid and federal assistance programs, particularly those that help low-income people pay energy bills, under Trump’s spending package, “We could be looking at a very dire situation for a lot of households that are suddenly just simply not going to be able to afford to keep their lights on,” Mashek said.

Invenergy accused Hawley of “trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability.” It plans to proceed with construction of what it calls “the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history” using private financing. It’s got plenty of backers, including Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm.

“A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company said in a statement. It might also connect a natural gas plant to what was initially a green energy line, the company announced in July.

Invenergy took Bailey’s office to court, demanding that the attorney general withdraw the investigation. But last week, Bailey announced he’d be leaving his post to join the FBI. Governor Mike Kehoe appointed former state House speaker and federal prosecutor Catherine Hanaway, who most recently worked as lead counsel for Grain Belt Express. Hanaway says the case will proceed, and that she has recused herself.

For Knott, of Beyond Coal, the decade-plus battle over Grain Belt Express is less about what would benefit Missourians and more about a culture war over what “energy dominance” means. “They have politicized clean energy,” he said, “which is honestly just a very weird and illogical thing to do, because clean energy is much, much cheaper than fossil fuels, and we need as much energy on the grid as possible right now.”

This, on top of the local impacts of the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill spending package—which one study suggested will cause Missouri electricity bills to skyrocket more than any other state—could create a dire situation for those already struggling to make ends meet. Kera Mashek, of the United Way of Greater Kansas City, said more than 14,000 people have called the Kansas City area 211 line seeking utility assistance so far this year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to increase Missourians’ electricity bills $240 a year by 2030 and $800 a year by 2035, according to a study from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy policy think tank. It also could hinder climate progress. Clean energy tax credits granted by the Biden administration and rescinded by the Trump administration likely would have incentivized power companies to bring cheaper energy sources online. Without the incentives, they’ll probably continue repairing aging coal-fired plant infrastructure indefinitely, said Megan Mahajan, a co-author of the study.

The idea that people’s bills are going to go up is “certainly concerning for us,” Mashek said. Given the looming cuts to Medicaid and federal assistance programs, particularly those that help low-income people pay energy bills, under Trump’s spending package, “We could be looking at a very dire situation for a lot of households that are suddenly just simply not going to be able to afford to keep their lights on,” Mashek said.

Invenergy accused Hawley of “trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability.” It plans to proceed with construction of what it calls “the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history” using private financing. It’s got plenty of backers, including Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm.

“A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company said in a statement. It might also connect a natural gas plant to what was initially a green energy line, the company announced in July.

Invenergy took Bailey’s office to court, demanding that the attorney general withdraw the investigation. But last week, Bailey announced he’d be leaving his post to join the FBI. Governor Mike Kehoe appointed former state House speaker and federal prosecutor Catherine Hanaway, who most recently worked as lead counsel for Grain Belt Express. Hanaway says the case will proceed, and that she has recused herself.

For Knott, of Beyond Coal, the decade-plus battle over Grain Belt Express is less about what would benefit Missourians and more about a culture war over what “energy dominance” means. “They have politicized clean energy,” he said, “which is honestly just a very weird and illogical thing to do, because clean energy is much, much cheaper than fossil fuels, and we need as much energy on the grid as possible right now.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/grain-belt-express-clean-energy-missouri-trump-hawley.webp,N,,2025-09-22 00:59:10.512115

The money-losing California-based company broke ground mid-September nearAtlanta despite U.S. president Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits, The Associated Press reported. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia Plant Is Key to a Mass Market and Profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges In the Electric Vehicle Market

Sales growth is slowing for EVs in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. EV sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 Billion in Incentives for 7,500 Jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some Neighbours Still Oppose the Plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbour to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

The court reversed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s decision and ordered Hoosier to stop raising prices and to immediately dismiss Duke’s rate increase application. The ruling has been welcomed by several public interest institutions aimed at representing the interests of the average American.

The Indiana Court of Appeals has given the people of the region a win against high prices

Every single American is slowly being subjected to increases in cost across several key sectors of everyday life. The rising cost of living in the United States has seen increases in the cost of everything from cars to eggs, and more in between. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented new rules for treating and disposing of toxic coal ash, and Duke has several coal-powered electricity generation plants in Indiana.

They began to spend essential money to try to comply with the new regulations. And have recently put in an application to try to recoup some of those operational costs by increasing prices for customers, which did not go down well, to say the least. Several organizations have reportedly planned to challenge the action. And the court agrees with them.

The Indiana Court of Appeals has reversed the action taken by Duke Energy over the past four years

The court has ruled that Duke’s plan to increase prices over the past four years was considered illegal retroactive ratemaking. Which speaks volumes about the company’s policies and views of their customer base, of which there are millions. Duke Energy operates several sites in the Indiana region, and the apparent price increases amount to a total of around $88 million in costs incurred from 2019 through 2023.

They even had plans to expand their recouperation efforts for the period between 2024 and 2030, claiming $238 million in projected operational costs in that time frame. Judge Paul Mathias delivered the ruling, which his colleagues on the bench agreed with.

“As our Supreme Court has made clear: ‘a statute operates prospectively when it is applied to the operative event of the statute, and that event occurs after the statute took effect,’ – Judge Paul Mathias of the Indiana Court of Appeals

The ruling also encouraged the Citizens Action Coalition to pursue legal action and sue Duke, which creates a split in the energy sector in the region. The Trump administration has led efforts to increase production in the energy sector across the board and will surely see the ruling as a mere speed bump on the way to energy independence for the United States.

“This is a big win. It’s quite simply, from our perspective, retroactive rate making, which is not allowed. The commission should have known better, and now we’re pretty happy with this (decision). Duke challenged our standing in the case and the court rejected those arguments soundly. We’ve seen more and more challenges on standing, so that (decision) was good.” – Kerwin Olson, Executive Director of Citizens Action Coalition

Will the federal government take steps to intervene in the court ruling

In the midst of all these court rulings and supposed interventions from the federal government, the ruling could be a positive one for the customer base, but ultimately, the industry will feel the effects on the levels of production in the downstream sector. The recent news of Nigeria’s struggles with its workforce has accelerated the Trump administration’s job creation efforts in the energy sector, no doubt aiming to avoid any more legal actions. Will the Trump government intervene? Time will tell.

In conclusion, Ghana’s financial and energy sectors present compelling investment opportunities, but careful planning, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies are essential.","By Africa Risk Control West Africa Desk: Ghana, located in West Africa along the Gulf of Guinea, has a population of approximately 34 million and a GDP of around $90 billion (2024 estimate). Known for its political stability and relatively strong governance, Ghana has consistently been one of Africa’s most attractive destinations for foreign investment.

The economy is diversified, with major contributions from agriculture (~20%), services (~50%), and industry (~30%). Key sectors driving growth include energy, financial services, ICT, and construction. The government has implemented economic reforms to improve ease of doing business, modernize the financial sector, and expand renewable energy, making Ghana a prime destination for investors seeking opportunities in West Africa. Understanding Ghana’s regulatory environment, sector-specific opportunities, and the major players is critical for successful market entry.

Regulatory Landscape

Foreign investors in Ghana should be aware of several key regulatory aspects:

Company Registration: The Registrar General’s Department oversees company incorporation. Investors can establish a limited liability company, branch, or joint venture. The process has been streamlined for faster registration.

Licensing and Permits: Specific sectors such as energy, banking, and telecommunications require sector-specific licenses from regulatory authorities including the Energy Commission and Bank of Ghana.

Tax Incentives: Ghana provides tax holidays, exemptions, and preferential tariffs for companies in strategic sectors like energy, manufacturing, and financial services.

Compliance Considerations: Investors must comply with labor laws, environmental standards, and foreign ownership regulations.

Key Investment Opportunities

Financial Sector

For most of the past half century, the H1-B visa program has been a conduit for global talent into the American economy. It has not been a minor contribution but a central driver of U.S. leadership in high technology. Scratch most successful firms of the last 50 years, and H1-B holders figure prominently in their intellectual capital and executive leadership.

Year after year, between 65 and 75 percent of H1-B recipients have come from India. The pattern is striking. Indian engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians have arrived in numbers that transformed entire industries. They filled programming roles in Silicon Valley, built quantitative models on Wall Street, managed semiconductor design in Texas, and supported every stage of the IT services industry.

China has been the second largest source country, contributing engineers in chip design, material sciences, and advanced manufacturing. Canada and South Korea have provided smaller but steady flows of specialists, particularly in artificial intelligence, aerospace, and telecommunications. The Philippines has supplied healthcare professionals and technical staff. Eastern Europe has contributed in mathematics-heavy fields like cryptography and software security. The United States drew selectively and broadly from this global pool, and for decades it reinforced an innovation ecosystem that relied on constant renewal from abroad.

These workers did not settle into one narrow niche. They worked in Microsoft’s Redmond offices writing operating system code. They staffed Google’s Mountain View teams designing algorithms that underpin global search and advertising. At Tesla in Palo Alto, they worked on battery management systems and autonomous driving stacks. They joined biotech labs in Boston, research centers in Austin, and clean energy startups in Colorado and Arizona. They were critical in engineering departments of utilities modernizing their grids. They were present in almost every major R&D center run by multinationals, from automotive OEMs in Michigan to chip designers in California. Universities relied on them as postdocs and assistant professors, who in turn trained the next generation of American students. Without them, many projects would not have been possible at the speed and scale the U.S. achieved.

The $100,000 fee attached to every new H1-B application with Trump’s most recent executive order changes that foundation. Startups, which live on slim budgets and early-stage venture funding, simply cannot absorb such a surcharge. A two-person energy storage startup hoping to bring in one specialist from India would need to raise an additional $100,000 before even paying salary and benefits. Most will abandon the idea and either hire remotely abroad or leave the role vacant. Larger firms have more flexibility, but even there the calculus changes. A multinational automaker might decide to relocate a promising engineer to a German or Canadian subsidiary rather than pay $100,000 to move them to Detroit. The pipeline of foreign graduate students finishing master’s and PhD programs in the United States will find fewer opportunities to stay. They will either return home or find openings in other countries that maintain more welcoming policies.

Layered on top of this immigration barrier, the One Big Beautiful Bill strips away much of the long-term certainty created by the Inflation Reduction Act. Manufacturing credits that were designed to give a decade or more of visibility now cut off in 2027. Critical mineral credits begin phasing out, and even coal is inserted as an eligible “critical” input. Foreign entity restrictions have been tightened and paired with recapture provisions that extend for a decade, raising financing costs and legal risks for investors. Loan guarantee capacity at the Department of Energy has been rescinded. Together, these shifts make clean technology projects in the United States riskier and less attractive. Developers and manufacturers do not make multi-billion-dollar decisions without predictable policy support, and that predictability has been undercut.

The countries that benefit most are those that were already feeding talent and supply chains into the U.S. India is first in line. With seven out of ten H1-B visas historically going to its citizens, India now retains that pool. Engineers and scientists who would have staffed U.S. offices will instead work from Bangalore or Hyderabad. Multinationals that relied on transferring staff into the U.S. will expand their Indian campuses instead. Venture capital that might have funded a Silicon Valley clean-tech startup will increasingly back Indian founders, confident the talent will remain in place. Over time, this compounds into a stronger domestic innovation ecosystem. More patents are filed in India, more startups are born there, and more global clean-tech firms build significant engineering footprints there.

China gains by virtue of its manufacturing scale. The U.S. stepping back from long-term subsidies for batteries, wind, and solar makes China’s factories more competitive. American gigafactories that were planned may stall, but Chinese exports will continue to flow. Solar supply chains that were slowly reorienting toward U.S. manufacturing under the IRA will instead remain anchored in China. The nascent battery manufacturing industry in the USA will find it very difficult to grow and for those factories that already started production, very difficult to stabilize quality. Every year of uncertainty in U.S. policy is another year of entrenchment for Chinese supply dominance.

Southeast Asia stands to pick up more of the middle links in the supply chain. Indonesia has been aggressive in attracting nickel processing and battery production, and higher U.S. visa costs and weaker incentives make that proposition more compelling for investors. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, already integrated into electronics manufacturing, will see more orders for modules, components, and subassemblies. As U.S. firms look to reduce risk and cost, they will push more of this work into these countries. Canada and Mexico, with geographic proximity and trade agreements, will also benefit as nearshore alternatives. A U.S. company that cannot afford to bring in foreign engineers may instead set up an R&D center in Toronto or Monterrey, where the visa rules are easier and the costs lower.

Artificial intelligence startups are among the most exposed to these shifts. For years they have drawn from graduate programs where the majority of students are from India, China, and other countries. Those graduates often transitioned to H1-B visas and staffed early teams in San Francisco, Boston, and New York. With a $100,000 surcharge attached to each petition, that pipeline is effectively cut off. Startups running on seed or Series A budgets cannot justify spending that much on a single hire, no matter how talented. Larger firms may still bring in a handful of foreign specialists, but the flow into the early-stage ecosystem will dry up. The result is that intellectual property that might have been created in the United States will instead be created in Bangalore, Toronto, or Berlin, where immigration pathways are open and financing confidence is higher.

The consequences ripple outward quickly. Investors back companies that can access the best people, and they will redirect capital if U.S. startups are constrained. Some American AI firms will register overseas subsidiaries to tap talent abroad, but that complicates intellectual property ownership and weakens the case for scaling in the United States. At the same time, Canada, Europe, and India will benefit from denser AI clusters, richer networks, and faster company formation. Once those ecosystems mature, they will reinforce themselves. For the U.S., the effect is a gradual erosion of relevance in a field that is central not only to economic growth but also to national security and strategic advantage.

The structural problem for the U.S. is that once these shifts occur, they are hard to reverse. Talent pools build density where they are welcomed. If India’s engineers now remain in India, they will start more companies there, join more local firms, and strengthen the ecosystem further. Manufacturing supply chains are sticky. Once a battery plant is built in Indonesia or a module assembly line is set up in Vietnam, it is not likely to move to the United States later. Investors allocate capital based on trust in long-term rules, and trust is slow to rebuild once lost. The rollback of IRA provisions signals that U.S. policy can change rapidly, and the $100,000 H1-B fee signals that the U.S. no longer values incoming talent as it once did. Together, they push money and people elsewhere.

This positions the United States for declining relevance in the industries that will define the rest of this century. Electric vehicles, batteries, wind, solar, grid storage and AI are not side projects. They are the backbone of the global energy and information transition. Countries that build and dominate them will shape trade, employment, and industrial strength for decades. By shutting down its own talent inflows and reducing its investment signals, the U.S. gives away opportunities.

Others will take them. India will grow stronger in technology and clean energy innovation. China will deepen its control of manufacturing. Both countries will end up with stronger AI ecosystems. Southeast Asia will expand its role in critical minerals and midstream processing. Canada, Mexico, and Europe will secure more design and engineering centers. The U.S. will find itself importing more technology and exporting less, a reversal of the pattern that defined its economic strength for the last century.

Reversing this trend will not be simple. Even if a future administration removes the H1-B fee and restores clean energy incentives, the intervening years will have shifted ecosystems abroad. The companies that were not formed in the U.S. will have formed elsewhere. The factories that were not built in the U.S. will already be running overseas. The trust of investors and talent will have been eroded. America can recover in part, but it will be rebuilding against competitors that have gained ground while it stepped back. The risk is not just slower growth, but a lasting decline in relevance in the technologies that matter most for the future economy. It is a choice that reshapes global competition, and one that will be very hard to undo.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-21-2025-06_08_21-PM.png,N,,2025-09-22 01:57:27.248290

WARREN COUNTY, OH -- Thomas Jefferson described Hugh Williamson’s role at the Philadelphia Convention as, “He was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of a high degree of erudition.” (That means being learned and scholarly.)

Jefferson may have been too modest describing Hugh Williamson. What Williamson accomplished at the Constitutional Convention was the following: He remained at the convention for the entire time and signed the Constitution for the state of North Carolina. He served on five committees, offered 23 motions, and delivered over 70 speeches. Williamson’s main role at the convention was in proposing and supporting certain compromises that ultimately made ratification a reality.

He proposed an impeachment procedure for the chief executive, endorsed a six-year term for U.S. senators, recommended that a free and slave population census be taken in support of the Three-Fifths Compromise, and favored the extension of slavery until a future date to give all states conditions that they could accept in the Constitution.

Williamson did not approve of slavery and never owned slaves, but he believed it better to have all the states within the Union, rather than excluding some by adopting provisions that everyone knew would not be accepted. His experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation.

Williamson was a scholar of international renown. He was an educator, mathematician, physician, legislator, merchant, scientist, and scholar. Williamson was born and grew up in Pennsylvania and entered the College of Philadelphia (later to become the University of Pennsylvania) at 18. He received a degree in mathematics. Immediately afterwards, he studied theology and received a license to preach in the Presbyterian Church. After that he began studying medicine and then left for Europe to study in Scotland, London, and Utrecht, the Netherlands, where he received an M.D. degree.

He traveled around Europe and upon his return, was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was drawn into scholarly and scientific circles and traveled in America and Europe conducting experiments. It was in Europe that it is thought he collaborated with Benjamin Franklin. While in Boston before sailing to Europe, Williamson observed the Boston Tea Party and was the first to bring the news to England.

During the Revolutionary War, Williamson was unique in that he contributed his talents in shipbuilding, working in a tannery, being a physician and natural scientist to the American war effort primarily in North Carolina, where he now lived. His important medical and scientific accomplishments included vaccinating North Carolina troops against small pox; at the Battle of Camden, he went behind enemy lines under a truce flag to care for American prisoners and provided medical consultation for a British officer.

In the Great Dismal Swamp, Williamson conducted experiments implementing dietary controls, instituting the use of proper clothing in keeping with local environmental conditions, and establishing specific sanitary procedures. Out of a force of between 500 and 1,200 men during the winter of 1780, only two men died from disease and no one was granted sick leave. Williamson advanced his own funds to the state to purchase medical supplies that would be needed in the event of a protracted campaign.

Hugh Williamson was a hugely influential person in North Carolina during and after the War. At the Second Constitutional Convention at Fayetteville, NC in 1789, Williamson made the initial motion on the floor to adopt the document that he had signed for the state. He served with distinction in state and national government and politics but always kept close ties with North Carolina. He was a true Renaissance Man.

The outlet quoted Ahmad as saying: ""As I have always said, it is not a matter of 'if,' but 'when.' I am responsible for fulfilling this directive, and the question now is the method, timing, and approach.""

Several of Malaysia's neighbors have already enacted their own vape bans. They've been banned in Singapore since 2018, and the government recently advanced even tougher enforcement measures. Thailand and Vietnam have also outlawed vaping, with heavy fines and jail time awaiting any violators.

For some, the proposed measures are a cause for concern. Malaysia has around 1.4 million users and a vape industry worth over $1.1 billion annually. According to The Straits Times, some retailers are perplexed by the move to curtail vaping, pointing to equally harmful products that remain perfectly legal, like cigarettes and alcohol.

Still, there's no doubt that vaping involves serious health and environmental consequences.

Disposable vapes are one of the most significant contributors to the growing problem of toxic e-waste that is clogging landfills. In 2023, Americans discarded the equivalent of 5.7 vapes every second.

Research conducted by the UN indicates that around 60-90% of all e-waste is illegally dumped. Fortunately, a better way to deal with most unwanted electronics exists: cashing in on old devices.

As national delegations, activists and other attendees struggle to find affordable places to stay by November, with some deciding not to go at all, Tilvawala, who lives in London, has spent hours working from afar to find lodging in Belem, negotiate prices and contracts and put down deposits. She did all that to create a housing portal specifically for young people who want to be part of the international conference. If not enough people sign up for the housing she’s secured, she might lose some of what she’s put down.

“There’s always a huge number of fossil fuel company representatives there. And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

Exmouth trial shows potential for V2G to power homes, reduce power bills

Technology has the potential to manage two-way charging to stabilise electricity grid

Horizon Power has successfully completed a 12-month trial testing technology to facilitate two-way charging of electric vehicles (EVs).

The Exmouth trial demonstrated that Horizon Power's vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has the potential to manage the two-way flow of energy from EVs charging and discharging into the power network, while ensuring stability and reliability.

The technology enables EVs to act as mobile energy storage systems.

Horizon Power conducted a range of tests exploring the future possibility of using V2G energy flow to power homes, reduce power bills, and stabilise the electricity grid.

It will use the findings of the trial to inform the development of products that will allow customers to get more from their EVs than just getting them from A to B. This could include helping them to power their homes or even earn money by feeding energy back to the grid.

The trial was the first of its kind in Western Australia and was conducted using the regional energy provider's Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS).

DERMS used data from Horizon Power's power systems, connected solar, the EVs and weather forecasts (predicting the availability of solar energy), to successfully balance power system stability with customer needs.

DERMS is already used to ease electricity grid capacity constraints, enabling more regional households to connect rooftop solar.

As part of the Cook Government's Electric Vehicle Action Plan, the trial has enhanced Horizon Power's understanding of how energy flow from EVs can be incorporated into its microgrids, especially in regional and remote towns.

As Horizon Power develops DERMS, EVs have the potential to draw power from the grid to charge but also feed power back into the network when needed - for example, when demands for energy are at their peak or when the flow of energy in the system needs to be stabilised.

Horizon Power partnered with the Gascoyne Development Commission, Shire of Exmouth, Exmouth Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and WA Country Health Service, providing them each with a V2G-compatible Nissan Leaf EV and V2G smart-charging equipment for the trial.

Further information about Horizon Power's V2G trial can be found at www.horizonpower.com.au/evorchestration

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""The success of this regional trial in Exmouth is an important milestone in our clean energy transition and in testing the technology that could make two-way charging a possibility in Western Australia.

""The findings confirmed for Horizon Power that its technology can manage EV charging and discharging intelligently, helping it to keep the grid stable while paving the way for flexible, customer-led energy products.

""Electric vehicle batteries are powerful. As well as helping to stabilise the grid they have the capacity to power homes and reduce energy bills.

This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and WABE, Atlanta's NPR station.

While any election brings ads, events, door-knocking and other efforts to remind people to get to the polls, this year campaign workers concerned with Georgia's Public Service Commission races have another hurdle: education.

Climate and environment organizers gathered in Atlanta recently to strategize about how to mobilize voters ahead of November's election for two seats on the Georgia commission. Dubbed ""Watts at Stake,"" the event brought together organizers, community leaders and influencers to hear about the importance of the somewhat obscure state agency — a message the speakers view as critical this election cycle.

""If you ask most people, they don't know what the PSC is,"" Russell Armstrong with Black Futures Lab, a group focused on leveraging Black electoral power, told Grist.

But, Armstrong and others said, voters care about what the commission does, once they understand it.

The commission regulates utilities in Georgia, including overseeing Georgia Power's plans and rates — and power bills are climbing. That motivates voters, according to strategists across the political spectrum.

""That's a galvanizing, dare I say energizing, message that will get Georgia voters out,"" said Carmen Bergman, an adviser to the campaign of incumbent Republican commissioner Fitz Johnson.

Experts and advocates elsewhere are also invested in the commission because while power bills are going up nationwide, Georgia is one of only 10 states that directly elects the utility commissioners who have final say over electricity rates.

""There actually is more power for the consumer in a state like Georgia than in any other state because they vote for their regulators,"" Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy and education group PowerLines, told reporters ahead this month's organizing event. ""The challenge is how do we get that education and awareness in front of as many folks as possible?""

One of the biggest jobs for the Georgia PSC is regulating Georgia Power. That includes how power is made — which has an impact on climate change because power plants are a major source of emissions — and how much energy costs, which affects the millions of Georgians who get their electricity from the company.

There are five statewide elected commissioners who serve staggered terms. Currently they are all Republicans. This year, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are up for election. Johnson is running against Democrat Peter Hubbard, and Echols is facing Democrat Alicia Johnson.

Helping voters make the connection between their power bills and the two seats on the ballot this year is proving to be an all-out, statewide effort. Groups like Georgia Conservation Voters, one of the organizers of the organizing event, said they are holding both virtual and in-person town halls to educate voters. Black Futures Lab has volunteers knocking on doors and is holding a series of events in South Georgia.

""The main thing is showing people that, hey, we hold the power, we hold the keys to this election and every other election from here to come,"" said Omega Calhoun, who spearheads their efforts in Valdosta.

Bergman said the Johnson campaign is taking an ""all of the above"" approach to getting the word out, including events, canvassing and ads.

""There's going to be no stone left unturned to make sure voters know that there is a difference on the ballot,"" she said.

This kind of effort is pretty novel for a down-ballot race in Georgia, according to Georgia State University public policy professor Tammy Greer. Voters would benefit from more education and engagement in other races, too, she said, including lieutenant governor and the commissioners of insurance, labor and agriculture.

""These spaces have so much policy implications over people in the state that we really don't pay attention to,"" Greer said. ""If we paid closer attention to their platforms then perhaps we can start electing individuals that are looking out for all of our best interests.""

This is also an unusual year for a typically low-profile election because the commission seats are the only statewide races on the ballot, but there are local elections in some of the major cities, including Atlanta. So while Georgia's Republican-leaning rural areas often carry state elections, without a governor's race or even mayoral race to get many rural voters to the polls, Greer said, Democratic voters in cities could decide the races.

""And I think that the folks on the commission understand that,"" Greer said. ""They understand the tide is changing.""

She pointed to the commission's unanimous vote earlier this year to temporarily freeze power rates as a sign the five current commissioners know that high power bills are driving voters and that what Greer called ""a bit of dissent"" could soon join the currently all-Republican commission.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/23/103789765_20250611-AMX-US-NEWS-BIG-ELECTION-WITH-TINY-TURNOUT-1-AT_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-21 18:59:24.622454

The goal behind the bill is to streamline the permitting process for cross-border energy projects.

The bill passed the House with bipartisan support in a vote of 224-203. Seven Democrats joined all voting republicans to pass the bill, with five members not voting.

The bill’s primary focus is to standardize and streamline the permitting process for the import and export of oil, natural gas, and electricity transmission. This would be a boon for oil-rich states near the US border.

The new law would require congressional approval to remove permitting for cross-border pipelines. That portion of the law is in response to President Joe Biden’s executive order removing permitting for the Keystone XL pipeline, an infrastructure project that stalled for more than 12 years before being canceled after then-President Biden’s executive order.

Under the proposed bill, the president would lose the ability to remove permits with an executive order and would need congressional approval.

In a speech on the House floor, arguing for the bill, Congresswoman Fedorchak said, “The Keystone XL pipeline should have never been cancelled. Yet on his first day in office, President Biden used the stroke of a pen to shut it down,” Fedorchak continued, “by passing my legislation, the House has taken a critical step to end years of regulatory uncertainty and partisan games that have delayed energy infrastructure projects, crushed good-paying jobs, and undermined America’s energy security.”

The bill now awaits a hearing from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It will face a slightly tougher audience in the Senate with Republicans’ razor-thin margin.

Journalism student enrollments soared by 93% between 1970 and 1975, per the New York Times, which can largely be accredited to the journalistic work of Woodward and Bernstein.

The release of “All the President's Men” in 1976 coincided with a 72% public trust in media that year across the United States according to a survey conducted by Gallup — the highest since the company began asking this question in 1972. This surge in trust underscores the substantial impact that Woodward and Bernstein’s investigation — and Redford’s production of the story and acting in the film — had on elevating the power of journalism.

Championing environmentalism

Since the beginning of the modern environmentalist movement, which began in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, Redford used his public persona to push for environmental causes.

Over the last five decades of his life, Redford worked closely with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) as a trustee.

He also consistently advocated for environmental justice. In the late ‘70s, Redford advocated for the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which expanded the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — a more than 19 million-acre protected home to an abundance of wildlife.

Most recently, Redford publicly supported clean energy legislation, which turned into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 — the largest climate and clean energy bill in United States history.

“The environmental movement has lost a giant,” NRDC president and CEO Manish Bapna said in a press release. “Nobody has done more to shine a light on the most important environmental issues from the dawn of the environmental movement in the ‘70s through the biodiversity and climate crises of today. We must continue to honor his vision in the difficult environmental landscape we face today.”

Empowering independent filmmakers

Despite receiving numerous Academy Award nominations and epitomizing the classic Hollywood movie star, perhaps Redford’s most defining traits were his significant contributions to independent filmmakers and the indie film industry.

In 1969, Redford purchased land to open the Sundance Mountain Resort in Utah, which he later fostered into a space for the Sundance Institute — a nonprofit organization dedicated to celebrating and cultivating independent filmmakers. Despite his success in acting and directing, Redford recognized that smaller creative minds lacked the opportunities and attention they deserved.

The institute hosts the annual Sundance Film Festival, which has helped launch some of the biggest director names in Hollywood, including Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson.

Brittany Friesner, managing director for the Indiana University Cinema, worked with Sundance in theater operations from 2008-2015 and remembers the feelings surrounding Redford within the organization.

“It was electric to have him in the building and there to remind everyone of the heart and soul and original intent of the festival,” Friesner said. “To highlight independent filmmakers, to celebrate their work, to gather together in a communal space, to connect and reflect on the stories we all have inside of us.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/d5ff2322-a3f2-48ec-a298-2b95511b960c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-21 17:59:52.106177

But the domestic nuclear sector is in severe decline, and the nuclear fleet is rapidly aging, with many of the nation’s reactors scheduled to be retired in the coming years. Reviving the sector could be a huge boon to national energy security and global climate goals, but building new plants is prohibitively expensive.

In the past few decades, the United States has only built one new nuclear power plant, Waynesboro, Georgia’s Plant Vogtle. Vogtle has the distinction of being the most expensive infrastructure project of any kind in U.S. history, clocking in at a whopping $35 billion after years of delays. First approved in 2009, the last reactor finally came online in April of last year.

The project is considered by most to be a bloated disaster, with the potential to derail momentum toward a nuclear renaissance in the United States. “But there are two ways to interpret the cautionary tale presented by Vogtle,” Oilprice reported as the project was wrapping up last year. “ Either you think that the lesson is not to build new reactors, or that the lesson is to build nuclear reactors better.”

A number of labs and startups across the United States have opted for the latter. Scientists and engineers are hard at work trying to figure out how to build nuclear reactors better and more cheaply than ever before.

One of the biggest focuses of nuclear innovation is the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) which will make nuclear power more scalable and streamlined, lowering up-front development costs. These smaller reactors can be mass-produced offsite in a factory setting and then assembled onsite, avoiding the extremely costly design and permitting process of traditional nuclear plants. Already, two SMR models have been approved for rollout in the United States, and many more are in the pipeline.

Meanwhile, Oak Ridge National Laboratory is working on integrating cutting-edge technologies into nuclear plant design for more efficient and effective designs and processes, including 3-D printing and artificial intelligence. The Tennessee-based National Laboratory says it has “successfully developed and validated large-scale, 3D-printed polymer composite forms for casting complex, high-precision concrete structures that would be technically challenging and costly to produce using conventional methods.”

The use of these 3-D printed composite forms can considerably cut down on production times. Typically, the casting of “complex structural components with unique geometries” can take weeks, but with these molds, nuclear projects can cast the parts on-site in a matter of days and with greater precision. The design of the 3-D molds has been tested and validated as part of the construction process for the Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor at Kairos Power’s Oak Ridge campus.

“At ORNL, we’re showing that the future of nuclear construction doesn’t have to look like the past,” says Ryan Dehoff, director of the lab’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. “We’re combining national lab capabilities with MDF’s legacy of taking big, ambitious swings — moonshots that turn bold ideas into practical solutions — to accelerate new commercial nuclear energy.”

The timing is right – nuclear is a rare bipartisan priority in the United States and the current policy climate is bullish on a homegrown nuclear revival. At COP28, during the Biden administration, the United States was one of more than 20 countries that cooperated to launch the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy. And so far, anomalously, the Trump administration has shown no signs of walking back that pledge. Just this week, Donald Trump signed a flurry of nuclear deals with the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, amounting to multiple billions of dollars to expand nuclear energy power production capacity across both nations.

The expansion, managed by the Kenya Electricity Transmission Co., will ease pressure on strained power lines, replace costly gas turbines, and help ensure reliable electricity for homes and businesses from an unlimited underground energy source.

Geothermal energy taps heat from beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, it produces virtually no harmful carbon pollution, making it a game changer for public health and the planet.

By diversifying its energy grid with this abundant and clean energy resource, Kenya is cutting pollution, curbing climate threats, and saving money on fuel imports. Kenyans will benefit from lower energy costs, as these plants produce steady, low-cost electricity that will stabilize the national grid, fostering community and economic growth.

The project is a $120 million investment to expand Kenya's transmission network, with additional lines planned nationwide. Officials recently approved the Olkaria VII power station, adding another 80 megawatts of clean capacity.

The move has drawn praise as a model for sustainable growth and reflects the government's focus on green energy development.

Kenya Electricity Generating Co. CEO Eng. Peter Njenga said in a press release: ""We are conscious about our carbon footprint and that is why we are deliberate about our focus on green energy projects, which are not only climate-sensitive but are also sustainable.""

While geothermal is taking center stage in Kenya, households everywhere can contribute to clean energy. Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack, bringing costs down to nearly zero. EnergySage offers a service that allows for easy comparison of quotes from vetted local installers to save as much as $10,000 on solar installations.

Going solar also makes other efficient appliances cheaper, such as heat pumps, which use a similar operating principle to geothermal energy. Mitsubishi offers affordable pumps with high-quality options to help you choose one.

Since 2017, the state has retired 2,500 megawatts of reliable power plants, including coal and nuclear.
Meanwhile, reliable power plants continue to be retired faster than they can be replaced.
Some states, like Kentucky, are ensuring utilities maintain “steel in the ground” — the dispatchable power plants capable of meeting customer needs at any hour.
A reliable grid is the foundation of our national security, economic strength, and technological leadership.","Americans often take for granted that when we flip a switch, the lights turn on.

But behind that simple act is one of the most complex machines ever built — the electric grid. In the eastern United States, PJM Interconnection is the grid operator that coordinates electricity for 65 million people across 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM’s mission is clear: keep the power flowing reliably and affordably. But today, that mission is being jeopardized by political interference.

Several governors within the PJM footprint are attempting to alter its governance, blaming PJM for higher electricity costs instead of acknowledging the consequences of their own state energy policies. Maryland and New Jersey, for example, are pushing for changes to PJM’s Board of Managers, while governors in Pennsylvania and Virginia are trying to force political nominees onto PJM’s governing body. But PJM is not a government agency. Allowing politicians to dictate who serves on the PJM board would fundamentally change how the grid operates and inject politics into decisions that must remain firmly apolitical.

For decades, the electric grid has been governed by organizations like PJM that prioritize reliability, engineering, and market economics, not political agendas. When politics takes priority, reliability becomes the first casualty.

This has been evident in many of the same states that have criticized PJM. These states have adopted policies that undercut electric reliability, including the premature shutdown of reliable power sources like coal and nuclear plants, the establishment of unrealistic renewable mandates, and the failure to require new industrial loads like data centers to secure sufficient generation resources. The result is a tighter market, rising costs, and growing threats to reliability. These state-level mistakes were compounded by federal policies under the Biden administration that accelerated baseload plant closures and weakened the resilience of the grid.

Take New Jersey, for example. Since 2017, the state has retired 2,500 megawatts of reliable power plants, including coal and nuclear. Offshore wind projects meant to replace that capacity have collapsed, forcing New Jersey to import roughly 35 percent of its electricity while residents’ bills soar by 20 percent. Maryland has followed a similar path, closing 16 coal plants in just over a decade. The state now imports 40 percent of its electricity and is blocking a critical transmission project that would improve reliability throughout the region.

Instead of accepting responsibility for their reckless policy decisions, these governors are blaming PJM and even threatening lawsuits. Lawsuits, however, won’t keep the lights on. Nor will state policies that attempt to micromanage PJM’s wholesale markets or impose artificial price caps. These short-sighted measures only discourage investment in new, reliable generation.

PJM’s most recent capacity auction, designed to ensure there are enough power plants to meet future demand, fell short of its reserve reliability target for the first time. Demand is expected to continue rising, which could lead to shortfalls as early as 2026 and 2027, driven largely by data center growth. Meanwhile, reliable power plants continue to be retired faster than they can be replaced. This is a dangerous recipe for rolling blackouts.

PJM is sounding the alarm on the need to keep existing resources, like coal, online longer, and is also prioritizing reliable, always-available projects like natural gas and nuclear. But states must do their part. They control siting, permitting, and the integration of new loads. Some states, like Kentucky, are ensuring utilities maintain “steel in the ground” — the dispatchable power plants capable of meeting customer needs at any hour.

Others, however, are simply leaning on PJM’s wholesale market while refusing to expedite the permitting and build-out of the resources needed to keep the system operating.

PJM’s customers cannot afford for it to become a political football. If governors are allowed to bend PJM’s governance to their whims, the consequences will ripple across the 13-state region. Politicizing PJM will not build a single new power plant, nor will it lower prices. It will only erode investor confidence and jeopardize the market principles that have delivered reliability for decades.

Coal and other dispatchable resources should not be viewed as obstacles to the energy transition. They are the bridge that ensures reliability until other resources can provide the 24/7 power needed to sustain our economy. Europe’s recent blackout in Portugal and Spain is a stark warning: When policymakers ignore reliability, grids fail. The United States cannot afford to follow that path.

A reliable grid is the foundation of our national security, economic strength, and technological leadership. To protect it, PJM’s governance must remain independent and free from political manipulation so that it can correctly value always-on, dispatchable resources. And states must step up to secure sufficient generation within their borders.

A great starting point for your Rivian Automotive research is our analysis highlighting that could impact your investment decision.","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has just broken ground on its new Georgia manufacturing plant, a move that is turning heads well beyond the electric vehicle crowd. With backing from both the federal government and state officials, along with support from Volkswagen and a multibillion dollar federal loan, Rivian is making a bold bet on scaling up. The facility is not just about new concrete and steel; it is about preparing for the launch of next-generation models like the midsize R2 SUV and R3 crossover, and expanding Rivian’s reach across the U.S. and international markets.

This announcement comes at a time when Rivian’s momentum has seen some bumps. Sales of existing models have cooled since their 2023 peak, and the company is facing challenges like rising competition, shrinking EV tax credits, and ongoing losses. Still, the stock is up over 5% after the groundbreaking news, building on steady gains of nearly 23% over the past year after a rocky prior stretch. The market seems keen on the idea that production scale and new vehicles could reignite growth, though real certainty is still a ways off.

So here is the real question: with the Georgia plant promising fresh capacity and new models on the horizon, is Rivian stock trading below its true value, or is the market already pricing in all the future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 2.4% Overvalued

The current consensus among analysts views Rivian as slightly overvalued, with the share price just above the estimated fair value according to their latest projections.

Rivian is positioned to benefit from the anticipated long-term acceleration of EV adoption, supported by expanding addressable market and increasing consumer demand for sustainable products.

Solar power has been apart of the American energy sector for nearly thirty years and still serves as a crucial energy provider.
The sector has plans to increase the percentage of power generation that solar provides in the United States.
The solar sector could set a new record if all units come online this year, as the renewable sector finds a more substantial foothold in the energy sector worldwide.
– Ralph Nader (Implicitly supports solar power) “Energy is essential for development, and sustainable energy is essential for sustainable development”.","The EIA or US Energy Information Administration has revealed the substantial importance that solar will provide the American energy sector as it forecasts increased energy demands for the years to come. The United States has seen a rise in solar power generation, thanks in no small part to the rise in solar power production in Texas. The US is on track to increase energy demands, thanks to an increase in population density and new and innovative tech sectors becoming more dominant in the United States.

The EIA states that solar is key to America’s plans for energy independence

As the energy demands worldwide are on an upward trajectory, several countries have made significant investments in the renewable energy sector. And the most dominant force in the renewable energy sector is, without a doubt, solar. Solar power has been apart of the American energy sector for nearly thirty years and still serves as a crucial energy provider.

US Energy Information Administration has announced that during the first half of 2025, developers added 12 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar electric generating capacity in the United States. The sector has plans to increase the percentage of power generation that solar provides in the United States. If those plans become a reality, they could add another 21 GW in the second half of the year.

New records could be set for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online in 2025

The previous record for U.S. generating capacity additions was set in 2002, when developers added an astonishing 58 GW to the grid. The vast majority of that addition came from natural gas, which is where this new record differs. The solar sector could set a new record if all units come online this year, as the renewable sector finds a more substantial foothold in the energy sector worldwide.

Texas has played a crucial role in the rise in solar usage in the energy sector in the United States. Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity only last year, and projections are that Texas’s fondness and proclivity for solar is only going to grow as energy demands rise in the United States. Kansas has seen recent discoveries of cast troves of hydrogen that could accelerate the US energy independence efforts.

“Clearly, we need more incentives to quickly increase the use of wind and solar power; they will cut costs, increase our energy independence and our national security and reduce the consequences of global warming”. – Ralph Nader

Jennifer Morgan Jennifer Morgan has been a central figure in international climate policy for over two decades, contributing to the climate crisis response through activism, diplomacy, and leadership in global climate negotiations.
She’s incredibly experienced in the sector and has held previous roles at some of the industry’s biggest hitters, including working at the Climate Action Network in the Nineties, leading the WWF’s Global Climate Change Program and then taking on the role of global climate change director for the think tank E3G.
The previous year, he swam 100 miles across the Red Sea to underline the impact of climate change on fragile coral reefs.
In June, Garcetti was named ambassador for global climate diplomacy for the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.","The grip of the climate crisis is tightening, with records continuing to tumble as the world heats up and the natural world suffers increasing harm.

Temperatures reached a worldwide high in 2024, research revealed, following on from the record set in 2023. The UK this year had its hottest spring and summer since records began in 1884, with multiple heatwaves causing droughts and wildfires .

In his inaugural state of climate and nature speech, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, cited research that the UK had become one of the most “nature-depleted countries in the world”. He said: “These are uncomfortable, sobering facts, and we should make no mistake: we must act on the climate and nature crisis … because no sector or part of our society is immune from those risks.”

Outside of the UK, attitudes are different. Donald Trump’s scepticism has seen green initiatives rolled back, while reliance on fossil fuels has increased. Yet Florida just had the worst drought in 24 years, with almost the entire state affected, and the LA fires in January displaced thousands of people as their homes were destroyed and hundreds also lost their lives.

Even the Nordic countries have experienced extensive heatwaves this summer and scientists believe the rapid loss of Antarctic sea ice is accelerating the problem to tipping point, with potentially irreversible global consequences.

It may sound like a dismal state of affairs, but there’s always hope, as Sir David Attenborough revealed in his Ocean documentary that the ocean can regenerate itself. Aside from the broadcaster, there’s a whole host of people dedicating their lives to improving the environment before it’s too late, and making others see that we need to change our ways.

You’ll find many of them in the second edition of The Independent’s Climate 100 List, following on from the success of our first edition last year.

The list isn’t in order of importance, nor does it compare or rank one change maker against another. Instead, it’s a recognition of the people and companies dedicated to finding positive climate solutions. Some have made a splash recently with a notable contribution to the fight, while others are celebrated for their long-term commitment and contribution. We also asked you, our readers, to nominate five unsung climate heroes.

The publication coincides with Climate Week NYC – one of the climate world’s biggest events – where The Independent will be hosting its own Climate 100 event, including a keynote speech from Greg Jackson, the founder and CEO of Octopus Energy.

So, meet the inspirational people solving the planet’s greatest challenges.

Arts & Fashion

1. Abi Daré

Winning the first Climate Fiction prize in May of this year, British-Nigerian writerAbi Daré’s novel And So I Roar documents how the climate crisis also triggers social crisis. She unravels the effects of this on rural Nigerian communities, especially women and girls, deepening the inequality that already exists.

On winning, she told The Independent ,""it shows that stories from all over the world, from Africa, from Nigeria, matter. And that people have heard the voices of the girls because they were roaring in the book, as the title says. That means a lot to me.""

It also gives a voice to Africa’s climate narrative and that of the Global South too. As the continent contributes an estimated 4 per cent of global emissions, yet it bears a disproportionate brunt of the impacts of the crisis.

And So I Roar is the sequel to The Girl with the Louding Voice. In 2023, she launched The Louding Voice Foundation, which supports educational scholarships and empowerment programmes for women and girls in underserved Nigerian communities.

2. Edward Burtynsky

Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky has used most of his photography career to powerfully track humanity’s disastrous environmental footprint. His work provides the urgent environmental commentary many can’t convey with words alone.

He focuses on sites such as oil fields, mines, quarries, and those that have suffered from droughts or deforestation and uses his lens to stir much-needed conversations of human impact. His images are often stark and positioned from a bird’s eye view, encapsulating the sheer size, made more damning by often including tiny human figures for scale.

Sometimes, his pieces might look like a study of colour or pattern, until it becomes clear it’s actually something much more shocking, like the remnants of an extracted copper mine and huge craters in the land and varying rusty colours.

His recent exhibition at New York’s International Center of Photography (ICP), The Great Acceleration, portrays the effects on glacier retreats, coastal erosion and industrial landscapes.

3. Arizona Muse

British-American model Arizona Muse is the founder of the charity Dirt, a non-profit organisation aiming to change the fashion industry by tackling its many problems from the ground up, literally.

Her focus is on soil health and regenerative farming and growing methods, after witnessing the fashion industry’s impacts from within. Muse now speaks out about the hidden costs of fashion on the environment and communities, including ethical and sustainability-related problems associated with exploitation. When she first started her campaigning, she says she lost a lot of followers, but set about engaging her audience in her message. She has spent the past decade highlighting the importance of regenerative organic agriculture, especially for growing the raw materials needed to make our clothes.

Muse is working to convince the larger fashion houses and brands to change how they work, and to not only prioritise revenue. Her vision is to bring the industry more in line with the food and wine sector, which has certifications and standards for produce made following environmentally conscious practices. As there’s nothing like it, Muse is working on her own set of standards.

4. Aziza Chaouni

Architect, activist and professor Aziza Chaouni – the first Moroccan national to study architecture at Harvard University – addresses climate resilience, ecological sustainability, and social empowerment through design.

Chauni’s most prominent project has been creating earthquake-resistant buildings in Morocco, following a devastating earthquake in 2023 that claimed the lives of around 3,000 people.

Remote areas in the Atlas mountains, where buildings were made from unreinforced brick and masonry, were the worst affected by the 6.8-magnitude disaster. Chaouni’s designs are not only affordable, but are built with compressed bricks made of 95 per cent earth that are interlocked with mortar and vaulted brick roofs reinforced with steel rods, while wastewater is filtered to be reused.

The project exemplifies the need for climate-sensitive, socially responsible architecture, and for her work Chauni was awarded the 2024 IMA “Impact” Design Award in October.

5. Livia Giuggioli Firth

Livia Giuggioli Firth’s environmental contribution was almost entirely rooted in fashion, until she spent the lockdown on her twin brother’s organic farm in Umbria. Now she has moved to working on the sustainable and regenerative farm project known as Quintosapore (meaning fifth taste).

For decades, Firth committed to raising awareness on sustainability in the fashion industry. In 2010, she founded the Green Carpet Challenge, bringing sustainability to the forefront by encouraging celebrities and designers to choose eco-friendly materials and follow ethical practices on the red carpet, spotlighting the environmental costs of fast fashion.

Her 2015 documentary, The True Cost, highlighted the hidden environmental and ethical toll of fast fashion, largely on women in the Global South. Through her activism, she has influenced major fashion brands to adopt more sustainable practices and sparked a movement towards greater transparency and accountability in the industry. Last year, she closed her longstanding consultancy business, Eco-Age, after 17 years.

6. Natsai Audrey Chieza

Fashion has a pollution problem, but Zimbabwe-born Natsai Audrey Chieza found an unlikely solution in biology. Most of the textile industry’s ecological damage happens near the end of the process at the dyeing stage, as it requires a huge amount of water and many chemicals used are petroleum-based. Chieza came across a solution in the pigment found in mould, which she harnessed to create a toxin-free dye, creating a groundbreaking alternative technique.

It’s just one achievement out of her design, research and development studio Faber Futures. Set up in 2018, it designs at the intersection of nature, tech, science and sustainability, using biology to address problems caused by the climate crisis. Her work within the biodesign sector not only reduces the environmental impact of textile production but also promotes a broader dialogue about the role of biology in sustainable design.

Her success led her to co-found Normal Phenomena of Life (NPOL), a pioneering biodesign brand aiming to change the fashion industry’s over-reliance on petrochemicals. Instead it offers grown-to-order products such as bacterially dyed garments, algae-ink prints, and microbial bioconcrete. It’s part of working towards her future vision that all materials, whether for our clothes or construction, will be made from living organisms.

7. Stella McCartney

Even before sustainability became a buzzword, Stella McCartney’s name had long been associated with sustainable fashion as she used her status and following to speak out on environmental issues. Inspired by her mother Linda, an animal rights activist, McCartney has become one of the most influential figures in fashion, refusing to use any kind of animal products, and encouraging the reuse and recycling of materials, as well as the reduction of waste.

She launched her eponymous fashion line in 2001 and has been committed to ethical and environmentally conscious practices since. She has recently gone on to champion regenerative farming practices in her supply chain and has expanded the use of bio-based materials.

Earlier this year, she launched her most sustainable collection yet, made from 100 per cent cruelty-free materials, using materials such as fungi-based vegan leather and yarns from seaweed. She’s also partnered with materials company, Balena, to create a completely biodegradable shoe sole in a bid to reduce waste.

Business & Finance

8. Greg Jackson

Paving the way for modern energy companies in the UK is the founder and CEO of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson. With a long-standing interest in the climate from a young age and a member of Greenpeace aged 16, he went on to create Octopus in 2016, which sources a large portion of its energy from renewables. Jackson has turned green tech into a formidable force and wants to make renewable energy smart, affordable, and undeniably consumer-friendly.

Octopus is currently the UK’s largest energy supplier, thanks to Jackson’s attitude of not being afraid to shake things up, mainly with its dynamic pricing. It is investing heavily in wind and solar, where most of its renewables also come from, and it uses a tech platform to incentivise customers to use energy when more renewables have been generated, or when it’s at its cheapest and cleanest. For his services to the energy industry, he was awarded an OBE last year.

9. Scott Strazik

Scott Strazik is the CEO and president of GE Vernova, one of the largest producers of electricity in the world. Since being named to run the power division of General Electric when it was spun off into a separate company in the spring of 2024, Strazik has presided over a more than fourfold gain in the company’s stock price.

GE is one of the biggest players in the renewable energy business, managing sizeable operations in wind, nuclear, hydropower, and electricity generation. It has become a favourite of investors who are looking to cash in on the booming business for AI and in particular powering data centres for technology giants.

Strazik is a career GE executive, having previously run both its gas power business and aviation commercial engine business. GE Vernova is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

10. Andrew Forrest

Andrew Forrest is one of Australia’s richest men, having founded the Fortescue Metals Group 20 years ago, and is now a philanthropist and green energy advocate using his billions to help mitigate climate change.

Forrest’s fortune is estimated by Forbes to be above $17bn (£12.8bn), much of which he has ploughed back into his privately held Squadron Energy venture, which he founded in 2022. The company paid around $2.6bn that year for Australia’s biggest wind energy company, CWP Renewables.

Among other philanthropic endeavours, he has pledged to help rebuild Ukraine into a clean energy giant once the war with Russia is over. Forrest is known for railing against oil executives and the markets-based system of measuring corporate performance by quarterly earnings or half-year earnings, which he said is too short a timespan to allow companies to invest in meaningful change.

11. Eva Zabey

Eva Zabey is the CEO of Business for Nature, a Geneva-based group of more than 100 organisations seeking to work with business and policymakers on behalf of the environment. The group refreshed its ambitious plans to achieve a nature-positive economy for all by 2030 earlier this year to focus, among other things, on national deep dives with local partners in places such as South America, Africa and Asia. Within this plan, she is calling for it to become mandatory for all companies to report on their impact on nature, part of the Target 15 initiative.

Before joining Business for Nature, Zabey was a senior member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development for 15 years. As an ecologist, she has long been associated with work to reverse the loss of important natural systems, as well as biodiversity initiatives.

12. Jonathan Maxwell

The British investment banking entrepreneur Jonathan Maxwell created Sustainable Development Capital LLP almost 17 years ago to seek opportunities in the booming market for energy efficiency. Since then, it has been at the forefront of creating value from wasted heat and gas.

Maxwell notes that up to a third of global emissions are caused by the construction sector, from cement and steel to inefficient lighting and air conditioning systems. Whether it’s steel mills in the US to olive presses in Spain, the company works with large commercial operations to find ways for them to save energy by reducing waste.

In the past year, Maxwell has hit the television news circuit in the UK and US to alert viewers to the dangers of cuts to climate funding in both places and to promote his book, The Edge: How Competition for Resources is Pushing the World, and its Climate, to the Brink – and What we Can Do About it. Sustainable Development also did a major deal with equity firm General Atlantic to sell a minority stake to one of the investment giant’s climate funds.

13. Carole Bamford

As the founder of Daylesford and her eponymous brand, Bamford, Carole Bamford champions not only British farming, but sustainable food production and the benefits of organics. She has undeniably been a key driving force in making ethical and sustainable everyday living attractive to the general public. At Daylesford pubs and cottages, all run from 100 per cent renewables, reducing waste is essential, whether it’s turning spent coffee grounds into body scrubs, fermenting glugs of produce, or turning beeswax into beauty products.

Last November, she was a prominent voice in criticising the government’s controversial family farm tax, which she says will threaten farm sustainability.

This year, she has just hosted Daylesford’s inaugural event, Down To Earth: The Daylesford Nature Summit, which saw 150 leaders across food, farming, fashion and sustainability come together to discuss important topics such as land stewardship and organic innovation.

14. Scott Tew

Scott Tew knows better than anybody the opportunities – and risks – inherent in fighting climate change. Tew is managing director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Sustainability at Trane Technologies, one of the world’s largest industrial cooling and heating companies.

In a world in which record temperatures are being set every month, there is arguably no better position to be in than working at an air conditioning company. Tew is one of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) world’s most prominent corporate innovators, drawing large audiences when he discusses how companies need to develop sustainability cultures.

Trane is based in North Carolina but domiciled in Ireland, and its stock is among the best performers on Wall Street of any clean tech stocks of the last few years. It has continued its run so far in 2025, up more than 17 per cent through June. With 15 per cent of emissions coming from inefficient heating and cooling systems, and another 10 per cent from food transportation, Tew and Trane are in a strong position to influence how the world reacts to global warming, and how companies can prepare.

15. Stefania Di Bartolomeo

Stefania Di Bartolomeo is the founder of Physis Investment, a Boston-based asset manager with an all-woman executive team dedicated to making investing in the fight against climate change profitable and transparent.

A Harvard graduate who grew up in Italy, she became focused on sustainable finance in her early twenties after taking a call from an investor asking how her money, specifically, was making a difference.

Di Bartolomeo conceived a software portfolio package that would show investors not just how much money they were making or losing on a stock, but also how that company uses money on things like water security, energy efficiency, corporate philanthropy, or to increase the number of women in its senior management ranks.

Physis, a fintech company whose name is Greek for nature or law of nature, is dedicated to advocating the position that there are important metrics to investing in companies beyond just profit and loss. Over the last year, it became one of the first sustainable investing companies to incorporate AI into its algorithm for picking stocks in a transparent manner that would benefit the environment and be good investments.

16. Nick Mabey

As the founder of global think tank Leading E3G, (which stands for Third Generation Environmentalism), Nick Mabey has been the CEO since 2006 and has steered the company in climate policy and diplomacy to work towards transitioning to a greener future. He was also an early adopter of the idea that the climate crisis poses serious risks to national and global security, back in the 1990s.

As part of this, he launched the annual London Climate Action Week event in 2019, in partnership with the Mayor of London, which is now held every June. Since then, it’s gone on to become one of the world’s largest independent climate-focused events.

He has also authored and co-authored several books and reports, including Argument in the Greenhouse: The International Economics of Controlling Global Warming back in 1996. He was awarded an OBE in 2022, for his climate leadership and role in supporting the UK Cop26 in Glasgow, where he served as a “Friend of Cop26”, advising the UK COP presidency.

17. Yvon Chouinard

Yvon Chouinard is one of the most influential businessmen in the climate world. A rock climber, environmentalist and philanthropist, he became a billionaire after founding Patagonia, the California-based maker of outdoor recreation clothing, in 1973.

In 2022, Chouinard stunned both the environmental and corporate worlds by donating all of Patagonia’s investing stock (while keeping control of its voting stock) to a trust to ensure that future profits are used to address the climate crisis. Since then, the trust has directed more than $71m (£56m) to environmental causes, including a campaign in the last year to encourage its outdoor enthusiast customers to vote for climate candidates in local and national elections.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Chouinard was a well-known mountain and ice climber in Europe and the US, and started out making steel pitons (spikes) for climbing. In the 1970s, when he learned that the steel pitons were cracking the rock faces in Yosemite National Park, he changed the material to aluminium and, in the process, invented what is now called “clean climbing”.

18. Michael Bloomberg

Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, has a two-pronged approach to fighting the climate crisis – policy advocacy and financial innovation.

During his 11 years as mayor, he reduced the city’s carbon footprint by 13 per cent. Since leaving politics, he has continued to call for the phasing-out of coal power and through Bloomberg Philanthropies, created a $500m (£372m) fund dedicated to closing coal plants and transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

In January, Bloomberg said his philanthropies arm would step in to cover US funding for the United Nations’ climate budget after President Trump said he would end the country’s international climate funding and withdraw from the terms of the Paris Agreement.

19. Kathryn Murdoch

Kathryn Murdoch isn’t just funding climate action, she’s also playing a part in reshaping it and is able to push for systemic environmental change. As co-founder of the Quadrivium Foundation, along with her husband James Murdoch – son of media mogul Rupert – she backs science-backed initiatives that drive climate action, strengthen democracy, and promote ocean health. A former strategist at the Clinton Climate Initiative, Murdoch has spent over a decade pushing for better climate solutions.

She sits on the boards of the Environmental Defense Fund, Climate Central, and the Climate Leadership Council, informing high-level climate strategy. In 2023, she co-launched Futurific Studios to tell hopeful, solutions-focused stories about the planet’s future, including the PBS docuseries A Brief History of the Future, showing what a better world could actually look like.

NGOs, Non-Profits & Philanthropists

20. Jennifer Morgan

Jennifer Morgan has been a central figure in international climate policy for over two decades, contributing to the climate crisis response through activism, diplomacy, and leadership in global climate negotiations.

She became Germany’s special envoy for international climate action in 2022, the first person to hold the role, and now steers Germany’s climate policy on the world stage, where she’s working towards a faster shift to renewable energy sources.

She’s incredibly experienced in the sector and has held previous roles at some of the industry’s biggest hitters, including working at the Climate Action Network in the Nineties, leading the WWF’s Global Climate Change Program and then taking on the role of global climate change director for the think tank E3G.

She is also the former CEO of Greenpeace International. Recently, after protests at Cop29 in Baku, she spoke out about how she thinks the events are essential, as every country in the world has a seat at the table.

21. Bill Gates

Though best known for founding Microsoft and his philanthropy through the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates is pouring a significant amount of his time and wealth into tackling the climate crisis. He founded the investment firm Breakthrough Energy in 2015, which backs tech companies focused on climate solutions.

His approach to net zero is grounded in his tech world background. In an interview with Fortune he said “planting trees will not solve the climate problem” and added that “doing climate policy by brute force will not work either”.

He believes the answer is to “invest in new technologies for carbon removal, clean energy, and electric vehicles and to implement policies like carbon taxes that could fund future green technologies”. Over the past few months, Gates has tailored his climate efforts less toward investing, given the headwinds against climate action from the Trump administration, and more towards encouraging climate entrepreneurship to lay the seeds for future innovation.

In his 2021 book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, he outlined a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero emissions, emphasising the importance of global cooperation and innovation.

22. Rita Maria El Zaghloul

With just 17 per cent of the world’s land and a mere 8 per cent of its oceans under formal protection, the planet remains acutely vulnerable to biodiversity loss and ecological collapse. Rita Maria El Zaghloul is working towards changing that.

As the 2024 Earthshot prize winner in the Revive Our Oceans category, El Zaghloul is at the forefront of a global push to protect at least 30 per cent of the world’s land and oceans by 2030. She leads the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, an alliance focused on preserving carbon sinks, boosting ecosystem resilience, and halting destructive practices like illegal overfishing and the extraction of resources.

Under her, it has already secured support from over 120 countries, and now she’s pushing for accountability, ensuring commitments are turned into tangible action. Progress is visible though, as nearly 50 member states have begun strengthening conservation laws, like Chile’s expansion of marine protected areas to around 1.5 million square kilometres.

El Zaghloul’s work is essential for creating a coordinated defence of the planet’s remaining wild spaces, before they’re gone.

23. Alice Ruhweza

Alice Ruhweza is one of Africa’s most respected voices in sustainable development, with nearly three decades of experience working at the intersection of climate, agriculture, and economic policy. In March, she took on one of the most influential roles in African agriculture as president of AGRA (the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa), an organisation that drives climate-resilient and inclusive farming systems.

Her appointment comes at a critical time, as Africa faces the converging crises of climate shocks, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss. She previously led WWF Africa’s regional work on regenerative agrifood systems and spearheaded data-driven environmental policy as co-director of the Vital Signs Program at Conservation International.

At UNDP, she mobilised an estimated $1bn (£743m) for green projects in more than 40 African countries. Now at AGRA, Ruhweza’s focus is to champion homegrown solutions, empower smallholder farmers, and ensure Africa’s agricultural transformation is both just and ecologically sound.

24. Mithika Mwenda

Mithika Mwenda is the co-founder and executive director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a collection of more than 70 non-governmental organisations that have come together to address problems around the climate crisis.

Mwenda has worked in the climate sector for a decade and has a strong influence over climate policy. He advocates for sustainable solutions that are specifically tailored to the needs of African countries rather than those of the Western world, while also ensuring Africa’s development.

At Cop29 last year in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mwenda delivered a powerful appeal, rejecting the burden of loans on African nations and advocating instead for grant-based, equitable climate finance. He stressed the importance of justice for accessible, affordable funding for the communities who are most vulnerable to climate risk.

In 2023, the PACJA criticised the decision to appoint oil executive Sultan al-Jaber to lead Cop28, a move it called the “lowest moment” for the UN. In May last year, the PACJA hosted the UN Civil Society Conference in Kenya – the first time the event has been held there – as a precursor to the Summit of the Future at the UN in New York this month.

25. Ann Lee

Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which reached a magnitude of 7 and tragically killed more than 220,000, Ann Lee co-founded a crisis relief organisation, Community Organized Relief Effort (Core), along with actor Sean Penn.

Lee has been the CEO since 2015, and has led the relief efforts across the world including, the Ukraine invasion, the Sudan War, Covid-19 Pandemic, Pakistan floods and Hurricane Helene.

She works on preparedness efforts with communities around the world to help them bolster against climate-driven disasters, such as watershed management, agroforestry, biodiversity protection, and soil conservation, where Lee and Penn often highlight the role human impact plays a part in the increasing disasters.

They work in disaster-prone regions like North Carolina which suffers from hurricanes and Northern California that's prone to wildfires, working alongside local communities to strengthen infrastructure and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather exacerbated by climate change. Earlier this year, Core focused its emergency response efforts on the Los Angeles wildfire.

26. Boyan Slat

Boyan Slat is a Dutch inventor and entrepreneur who founded The Ocean Cleanup in 2013 when he was just 18 years old, after he went scuba diving off the coast of Greece and noticed more plastic in the ocean than fish.

The project centers around a giant plastic tube with a thick nylon screen that can trap plastic as small as a millimeter in size but won't ensnare any sea creatures.

Slat, now aged 31, recently announced a project that plans to stop some of the plastics entering the ocean in the first place. He will deploy the technology to the rivers of around 30 cities to catch plastic as it makes its way out toward the oceans.

The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit based in the Netherlands, announced this past spring that it has captured more than 11.5 million tonnes of plastic this year, more than all the previous years combined.

27. Mafalda Duarte

Mafalda Duarte is executive director of the Green Climate Fund, which claims to be the largest multilateral climate fund in the world, with a portfolio of $18bn (£13.3) in approved funding for projects.

Born in Portugal, Duarte has spent her career working in more than 30 developing countries on climate projects. She also managed the Climate Investment Funds, a pool of more than $8bn being put to work in more than 70 developing countries. Before that, she worked at the African Development Bank and World Bank.

She recently spoke about the potential for Brazil to play a major role in developing climate finance and is expected to be a key player at the United Nations climate summit, Cop30, in Belem, Brazil in November.

28. Inger Andersen

Inger Andersen is a Danish economist who leads the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep). Her recent achievements include leading global negotiations on plastic pollution, which have been moving ever closer towards an international, legally binding deal to tackle a burgeoning global problem, both for the environment and public health. However, negotiations have failed in the past few months to finalise a treaty. Europe wants to reduce the creation of plastic, while oil states such as Russia want to increase recycling programmes instead.

“To stop plastic pollution, we need to start at the start and end at the end,” she said at an event last year. “This means crafting an instrument that ensures we use fewer virgin materials and less problematic plastic. That we design for circularity. That we use, reuse and recycle resources more efficiently. This is the instrument we need to protect human and ecosystem health – while ensuring a just transition and space for the private sector to thrive in a new sustainable economy.”

Though there have been deadlocks, there's hope to regroup to review the treaty.

29. Juan Carlos Jintiach

Ecuadorian-born Juan Carlos Jintiach has dedicated his life to ensuring indigenous communities’ voices are heard on the frontlines of the climate movement. He is a member of the Shuar People of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and is calling for world leaders to listen to them, emphasising that the crisis stems from a broken relationship with nature and says indigenous people's knowledge is integral to the solutions.

As executive secretary of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities (GATC), he represents 35 million people managing vast swathes of forests across 24 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. He believes Indigenous communities are the best stewards of their territories, having lived in harmony with nature for generations.

The GATC have established Shandia, which is a platform that is dedicated to supporting and directing Indigenous funds, and ensuring accurate tracking of them. He is also a technical adviser for the Coordinator of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), a major Amazonian Indigenous federation. For his work, in 2023 he was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize.

30. Dame Lisbet Rausing

As heiress to Sweden’s Tetra-Pak business, a science historian, co-founder of philanthropic foundations Arcadia and the Lund Trust, and a landowner in Scotland, Dame Lisbet Rausing has many strings to her bow. Collectively, they all play a part in her environmental work.

Dame Lisbet owns the 57,000-acre Corrour Estate in the Scottish Highlands, and since 2015 has worked on environmental projects including deer management, planting native woodlands, restoring peat bogs and reintroducing red squirrels.

The Arcadia Fund, which Dame Lisbet co-founded, has donated more than $1.3bm (£996m) to environmental causes and this year received a damehood for her philanthropic work.

Last year, Corrour Estate joined Loch Abar Mòr, a nature preservation partnership that already included the National Trust for Scotland, Glenaladale Estate, The Woodland Trust, Glen Nevis Estate and the Nevis Landscape Partnership. Together, they will restore a large part of the Lochaber area in the Highlands to make it more ecologically diverse and so more resilient to the effects of the climate crisis over the next 50 years.

31. MacKenzie Scott

An author and philanthropist, MacKenzie Scott is still perhaps best-known for who she used to be married to – Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But since 2019, she has emerged as a major force in environmental giving.

She has given $19.2bn (£14bn) via more than 400 grants in the past five years, including almost 200 grants worth $2bn last December alone.

Scott has donated $15m to Global Fishing Watch, an independent nonprofit that creates and shares data on the ocean to increase the transparency of fisheries and help improve marine resilience. She has also donated $20m to Blue Ventures, which supports coastal communities and small-scale fishing operations.

Scott’s approach to funding is unique: her grants are “unrestricted”, which gives organisations more autonomy and helps empower grassroots groups living and working on the frontline of environmental issues.

32. Rena Lee

As Singapore’s Ambassador for Oceans and Law, Rena Lee advocates for the vital but often overlooked relationship between ocean health and climate. Her work shows ocean governance is essential to climate resilience to protect the planet’s largest, yet most neglected, climate regulator, the ocean.

Lee played a pivotal role in the landmark United Nations High Seas Treaty in 2023, the first-ever international agreement to protect biodiversity in international waters, covering nearly two-thirds of the world’s oceans. This treaty represents a major breakthrough, enabling the creation of protected marine areas beyond national jurisdictions and offering a lifeline to the ocean’s ability to regulate the climate. For her work on this, she was recognised as one of Time's 100 most influential people.

In late 2024, she spoke at the International Court of Justice, urging world leaders to take their legal duties on climate change seriously.

33. Helen Clarkson

After tackling humanitarian crises while working for Médecins Sans Frontières in countries including Sudan and Pakistan, Helen Clarkson moved her career focus to the planet’s wellbeing.

Now she's the CEO of the Climate Group, a non-profit driving businesses towards net-zero emissions, which also runs the annual Climate Week event, held every September in New York. Clarkson is responsible for taking Climate Week from its humble beginnings in 2009 as a panel discussion to the globally important, myriad of events it is now. She advocates for systemic change, pushing for ambitious climate policies and fostering collaboration between businesses and governments.

Clarkson emphasised that energy affordability and climate action must be addressed together. In 2022, she was awarded an OBE for services to environmentalism and supporting the UK’s presidency of Cop26.

Food & Agriculture

34. Doug McMaster

Claiming to be the world’s first zero waste restaurant is a lofty claim, but it’s one that owner and chef Doug McMaster can attain to as there aren’t bins in his restaurant.

Silo first opened in Brighton in 2014, and later moved to east London’s Hackney Wick. Everything in the restaurant is reused or recycled. Beyond the food, the furniture is upcycled or recycled and tables are made from recycled plastics too.

His most recent project is using koji, a traditional Japanese mould, to ferment hard-to-reuse food scraps giving them new life to produce misos and fermented sauces like shoyus and garums, which can be used as flavour enhancers for dishes in the restaurant.

McMaster’s work is not just about food, it’s about creating a scalable solution to hospitality’s food waste and he’s a pioneer in how waste can be drastically limited and reused within the industry.

35. Chantelle Nicholson

One of just 36 UK chefs awarded a Green Michelin Star, Chantelle Nicholson is a leader in regenerative practices in the food world. At her Mayfair restaurant Apricity, her regenerative ethos runs through everything, as Nicholson believes in going beyond simply “sustaining” to actively regenerating.

She’s a powerhouse for championing seasonal and local produce, innovatively minimising food waste and excess packaging, and avoiding unnecessary energy use, down to details like using rechargeable candles instead of single use and switching off unused fridges, preventing energy waste, which is rife in busy working kitchens.

This year Nicholson is expanding her vision and branching out from London with a new project, Fjora a restaurant in the 1 Hotel in Copenhagen. It follows her regenerative ethos with a Nordic-inspired menu that’s deeply rooted in her connection to nature.

36. Caroline Bennett

After struggling to source sustainable and ethically caught fish for her sushi restaurant, Moshi Moshi in London’s Liverpool Street station, Caroline Bennett took a leap of faith, and did it herself.

Setting up Sole of Discretion in 2016, an ethical online fishmonger, she connected the dots between fishers in Plymouth harbour with not only her London restaurant, but also people at home who could buy quality British fish, knowing exactly where it came from. Supporting small-scale, low-impact fisheries, she works with small day boats that don’t have the same damaging impact on the ocean as industrial boats do. Each fish is traceable, labelled with information on where it was caught, the method, the name of the skipper and the boat, as for too long, all of this information was lost at port.

This year, she’s working with Scottish charity, Open Seas, on its #DivedNotDredged Campaign, which is amplifying the intense desolation dredgers cause to the ocean bed, which can take up to 10 years to recover after just one dredge. Instead it champions the far less impactful hand-dived scallops. It also reflects the important message of Sir David Attenborough’s seismic documentary Ocean, which focuses on this very issue.

37. Andy Cato

Andy Cato, former electronic musician and half of Groove Armada, made an unexpected shift from music to farming almost two decades ago. After selling his music rights, he bought a farm in France and became deeply invested in soil health, biodiversity, and access to better food systems. This led him to become a voice for regenerative agriculture, where he advocates for the importance of farming regeneratively, looking after soil and water health, and food security.

Cato brought this message to a mainstream audience through a guest appearance on Clarkson’s Farm, where he successfully encouraged Jeremy Clarkson to trial regenerative practices, which he’s continued.

In 2018, Cato co-founded Wildfarmed with former broadcaster George Lamb and finance expert Edd Lees. The company now works with over 150 farms across the UK and France, all adhering to a set of agreed regenerative methods Wildfarmed laid out, including maintaining crop cover, integrating livestock, and avoiding synthetic pesticides.

Wildfarmed produces flour and bread for both wholesale and consumers, aiming to make regenerative food systems affordable and accessible to all, and so is available in supermarkets. Their work blends innovation, ecological responsibility, and social equity in the quest for a healthier food future.

38. Dr Mariangela Hungria

Dr Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian agronomist and microbiologist, was named the 2025 World Food Prize Laureate, an honour often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Agriculture. The award recognises her four decades of pioneering research into biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) as a sustainable alternative to synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.

Working with Brazil’s Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), Dr Hungria has developed innovative microbial inoculants that enable crops, particularly soybeans, beans, and other legumes, to naturally absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere. Her work has transformed tropical agriculture, improving soil health, reducing input costs, and minimising environmental damage.

Today, her BNF methods are applied to more than 40 million hectares of Brazilian farmland, saving farmers up to $40bn (£30bn) annually and avoiding more than 180 million metric tons of CO2 emissions each year. Her research also supports global climate goals by reducing dependence on fossil fuel-derived fertilisers and increasing long-term agricultural resilience.

39. Vandana Shiva

A former physicist, Dr Vandana Shiva became an activist in the 1970s and has gone on to focus her work on protecting seeds and food sovereignty, which she’s regarded as the leading voice on. She famously campaigned against laws that would prevent farmers saving, sharing, or replanting seeds, which would give big corporations ownership of seeds and destroy traditional farming. To protect them, she set up more than 150 seed banks in India.

In her work, she also advocates for ecology, environmentalism and eco-feminism – a branch of the movement that combines feminism with political ecology. A key part of that is the “invisible” work women do that goes unnoticed, but is key to protecting the environment, such as water collection.

She believes an intersectional approach is key to climate adaptation and justice, which she sees as a biodiverse women and community-led approach to agriculture, especially in more climate-vulnerable regions. To promote this, she set up her own NGO, Navdanya.

40. Nidhi Pant

Combating food waste, rural poverty and gender inequality – three of the Indian farming community’s biggest issues – is S4S Technologies, which was co-founded in 2013 by Nidhi Pant and six university friends.

It creates pioneering solar-powered dehydrators, which are used to prevent food waste. By drying food out without using electricity, it enables rural smallholder farmers to financially benefit from being able to sell their entire crop. Previously around 30 per cent could be lost due to bad weather, being misshapen or market price fluctuations. It’s a life-changing move for rural farmers living in poverty.

Since it began, S4S Technologies has helped provide sustainable incomes for around 300,000 rural farming women across 400 villages, vastly improving gender inequality in the process. Pant was awarded the Earthshot Prize in 2023 by Prince William. The team has prevented 60,000 tonnes of food waste and averted 300,000 tonnes of C02 emissions.

41. Sean Sherman

Chef Sean Sherman, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe, wanted to preserve his own heritage, so he founded The Sioux Chef, which promotes food sovereignty and educates others on Indigenous cultures and the importance of their environmental stewardship.

His ethos is to source local, wild and heirloom ingredients and follow the sustainable practices that Indigenous communities have used for generations.

This November, he’ll be publishing his latest cookbook, Turtle Island, which is the Indigenous name for North America. He’s also working on a new hub for indigenous food culture, Wóyute Thipi (meaning ‘food building’ in the Dakota language), which is set to open in Minneapolis later this year.

In 2021 Sherman and restaurateur Dana Thompson founded the restaurant Owamni (which translates to the place of falling, swirling water) in Minneapolis. The following year, it won the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. It’s mostly staffed by Indigenous people and serves Indigenous dishes without ingredients introduced by Europeans, such as butter and sugar. Since 2023, it has been run as a non-profit. For his work, Sherman won the prestigious Julia Child Award in 2023.

Activists

42. Pua Lay Peng

Nicknamed the Erin Brockovich of Malaysia, former chemist Pua Lay Peng became an activist after realising her community in Jenjarom, in the state of Selangor, was suffering from the devastating effects of the increased amount of plastic being illegally dumped there.

The crisis escalated after China banned plastic waste imports in 2018. Illegal plastic recycling factories opened, emitted toxic fumes with an acrid smell in the air, polluted waterways, and left residents suffering from respiratory issues and fatigue.

To combat it, she co-founded the Kuala Langat Environmental group (Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala). Peng has rallied everyone in the community to push for action from local authorities, and has even faced death threats for it.

She’s been successful in shutting down more than 300 illegal recycling factories by visiting sites, filming it and posting it to YouTube, but more are beginning to reappear again. They’ve improved both the air and water quality and empowered communities to succeed in regional action, not only in her community but across the country too.

43. Ayisha Siddiqa

At just 26 years old, Ayisha Siddiqa has achieved a lot as a climate justice and human rights advocate. She campaigns for Indigenous people’s rights and the rights of women, who she recognises are disproportionately affected by floods and other devastation caused by the climate crisis.

Born in Pakistan, she moved to Brooklyn as a child, and believes solutions to the crisis are too often developed from a global North perspective, which doesn’t work for many of the countries worst affected.

At just 14, she saw the effects of climate change not only on the environment, but also on humans, after family members in Pakistan became ill from polluted river water. This led her to get involved in climate activism, and she went on to found her university’s branch of Extinction Rebellion in 2019 and lead a strike involving 300,000 people. In 2020 she co-founded Polluters Out, a global youth movement, and helped create an activist training course, the Fossil Free University.

She is also a climate advisor to the UN secretary general and UN youth envoy. This year she’s studying law at UCLA in Los Angeles, where she’s gearing up to tackle the climate crisis not just in the streets, but in the courtroom, to push for systemic change.

44. Bill McKibben

Author, environmentalist and activist Bill McKibben has been a key climate protest organiser for decades and has made many contributions to the fight, including being awarded the Gandhi Peace Award in 2013. In 1989, he wrote The End of Nature, which is widely recognised as the first book for a general audience about climate change and is still in print in 24 languages.

This year, his key driving message is that solar energy is the path to a greener future, and is pushing for the clean energy source to be more widely adopted. He has organised the inaugural Sun Day, a national day calling for action, on 21 September, chosen as it’s one of two solar equinox days. It’s also the subject of his new book, Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization, published this month.

He co-founded the global grassroots organisation 350.org in 2008, which aims to end our reliance on fossil fuels. The name is an ode to climate scientist James Hansen, who warned that any atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide above 350 parts per million (ppm) was unsafe. Currently, the planet’s concentration is over 420ppm. In 2021, he founded Third Act, an activist group for older environmentalists, with the support of big names including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda.

45. Greta Thunberg

Aged just 22, Greta Thunberg has dedicated her life to the climate crisis and already achieved what other activists have struggled to do by bringing the severity and urgency of the climate crisis into homes across the world. So impactful has she been, it’s been dubbed the “Greta effect”.

To reduce her carbon footprint, she became vegan and refused to travel by aeroplane, aged just eight. In 2018, Thunberg inspired a global movement after holding her first school climate strike outside the Swedish parliament, which called for the end of reliance on fossil fuels. She was just 15 and inspired thousands of students around the world to join her Fridays for Future strikes.

Since then, she’s consistently called out world leaders in her sharp speeches for their inaction on climate change, including last November when she protested Cop29 being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, saying the authoritarian petrostate was given a chance to greenwash its human rights abuses.

Thunberg was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023. In 2019, she became the youngest person to be named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. In 2022, she published The Climate Book, a “book of the year” for many top publications. She has also inspired others with Asperger’s (which she calls her superpower) to feel included and take a stand.

Since finishing her schooling in 2023, Thunberg ramped up her activism, including in the past year in support of Gaza. Last year, she was acquitted of charges of blocking an oil conference. After the verdict, she said: “We must remember who the real enemy is.”

46. Nemonte Nenquimo

She is the first woman president of the Waorani people of Pastaza and co-founder of the Indigenous-led, non-profit organisation, Ceibo Alliance, which is the first of its kind between four ancestral nations within Ecuador, Peru and Colombia.

She won a case against the Ecuadorian government in 2019, protecting half a million acres of Waorani ancestral land in the Amazon rainforest from oil drilling. It set a landmark legal precedent to protect a further seven million acres from planned oil auctions. But now, it’s under threat once again.

She told The Independent last year: “I’ve often thought that it must be easy to destroy what you don’t understand,"" which is why she co-wrote her debut book last year, We Will Not Be Saved, with her husband Mitch Anderson. The memoir is one of hope and resistance and was well reviewed by critics.

She was the first Indigenous woman to be included on the Time 100 list, and she was one of six environmental leaders to be awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize. In 2020, the United Nations Environment Programme awarded her its Champions of the Earth award in the category Inspiration and Action.

47. Neeshad Shafi

Qatar regularly experiences some of the world’s highest temperatures, which regularly hit 44C, but can reach as high as an unbearable 50C.

As co-founder of the Arab Youth Climate Movement Qatar (AYCM), Neeshad Shafi has created a first-of-its-kind study on public perceptions of climate change in his home country, as he says “global warming” is over and the period of “global boiling” has begun.

Through his work, Shafi attempts to change the minds of the proportion of people in Qatar who don’t believe in the climate crisis, by showing them how the effects will impact them. One of the biggest battles Shafi has faced is some people’s belief that they can’t do anything to help change the situation, and countering that view is a major focus for him. In June this year, he was involved in the Doha Climate Talks, which focused on demanding action to address the crisis.

48. Julia Olson

Julia Olson is the founder and executive director of Our Children’s Trust, a not-for-profit law firm which empowers young people to hold governments accountable for their climate inaction.

It has won several landmark cases against state and local governments over the right to a healthy environment, including high-profile cases suing the US government for prioritising fossil fuels over ensuring a safe climate for future generations. Cases have been won across Montana, Colombia, Germany, and South Korea.

Last year, the US Supreme Court rejected a petition to review a constitutional climate lawsuit against the US government after a lower court rejected it. Attorneys in the case of Juliana vs United States vowed to fight on in other legal avenues.

Olson, an attorney, founded the trust in 2010 while pregnant with her second child and after watching Al Gore’s climate documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, where it dawned on her that future generations could be left with a near-devastated world without drastic action.

49. Wawa Gatheru

Kenyan-American climate activist Wawa Gatheru is the founder of Black Girl Environmentalist, which supports women of colour and gender expansive people. Its aim is to create a representative and inclusive climate movement, and to champion Black women as the leaders they already are. It is now one of the biggest Black youth-led climate organisations in the US, making her a powerful voice for underrepresented communities.

Last year, she spoke at The Independent’s inaugural Climate 100 event and told the audience, “There’s no such thing as a perfect environmentalist,” hitting back at the idea that people who care about the climate crisis must be perfectionists.

She was aware of the climate crisis while growing up, but came to the realisation that those most affected by it – people of colour – were generally not the same people making the decisions. She saw that the narrative for people of colour was more likely to be “victim” than “problem solver”, and also recognised that women had even less of a voice. Instead, she works to ensure Black voices are also at the centre of the climate movement too.

50. Desmond Alugnoa

Climate activist and co-founder of the Green Africa Youth Organization (GAYO), a Ghana-based NGO, is Desmond Alugnoa, who is tackling waste, air pollution, and environmental injustice. In 2024, GAYO won the Earthshot Prize in the “clean our air” category for its Zero Waste Model, an innovative community-based system that reduces landfill use, stops open waste burning, and creates dignified green jobs for waste workers.

The organisation’s work not only improves public health and air quality but also helps build local, circular economies and climate-resilient communities.

The Earthshot recognition came with £1m in funding to scale the project, and Alugnoa is aiming to reduce air pollution by up to 70 per cent and divert thousands of tonnes of waste by 2030.

51. Raoni Metuktire

Spending his lifetime protecting the Amazon, the chief of Brazil’s Kayapo tribe, Raoni Metuktire is now 93 years old, and hasn’t slowed down yet. One of Brazil’s most influential people, he’s often referred to as the most effective protector of the Amazon, yet growing up following a nomadic lifestyle in the Amazon, he didn’t encounter the outside world until age 22.

Even a decade ago, as reported by The Independent, Metuktire said the developed world was intent on “destroying everything” and urged its citizens to fundamentally change the way they think. At last year's New York Climate Week, he called on global leaders to reflect on their responsibilities to help end extractive and illegal mining and logging, which are making way for increasing droughts and wildfires.

He became famous after campaigning with pop star Sting (also in this list) and his wife Trudie Styler in the late 1980s, to prevent hydroelectric dams being built on the Xingu River, a major tributary of the Amazon.

His memoir, Memórias do Cacique (The Chief’s Memoirs) was published in July, where he claimed Brazil's previous right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, wanted to exterminate the country’s Indigenous people. This year, he met with Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and warned him of the devastating effects of oil drilling. Here, Metuktire was also awarded the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit, Brazil’s highest civilian honour, recognising his lifetime of defending the environment and Indigenous rights.

Entertainment, Royalty & Sport

52. Billie Eilish

Multi-award-winning singer-songwriter Billie Eilish is the epitome of a Gen Z’er using their platform (she has a whopping 125 million followers on Instagram alone) to spread their message.

As a vegan since the age of 12, she ensures that only vegan food is sold at her gigs, though this has been controversial lately for some fans. She also asks the venues to encourage fans to come with reusable water bottles and makes sure there are refill stations to avoid plastic waste.

She ran her own climate event, OVERHEATED, in both London and Berlin this year, and will be debuting in the US soon. It’s based on the 2022 documentary she released of the same name, and brings together activists, musicians and designers discussing the biggest issues surrounding the climate crisis and calling on people to take action.

At her concerts, she also has “Eco Villages”, which is described as a hub to raise awareness of the climate crisis, and inspires fans to connect with environmental groups, learn more about a plant-based diet and to understand the detrimental effects of fast fashion.

53. Don Cheadle

Actor and Goodwill United Nations Ambassador Don Cheadle has previously asked, “What is more important than food and clean air?” Such a simple sentence, which gets to the crux of what we’re fighting for, serves as a simple reminder of the key issues at stake.

He was one of the founders of the humanitarian Not On Our Watch Project in 2008, which has since merged with The Sentry organisation, involving other celebrities including George Clooney and Matt Damon. The organisation urges leaders to protect vulnerable, marginalised and displaced communities, such as those in Darfur in Sudan. For this work, he and Clooney were awarded the Summit Peace Award.

Cheadle also worked with actor Harrison Ford to create Years of Living Dangerously, a documentary TV series tackling climate issues.

He’s a member of the board of directors for the Solutions Project (co-founded by actor Mark Ruffalo, also in this list), which has supported more than 300 community organisations fighting for climate justice in 45 states, and highlights racial and gender inequities.

Last September, as part of the Our Kids’ Climate initiative, Cheadle combined his parental role with his climate action work, urging the importance of protecting the planet for future generations. He signed an open letter along with more than 150 other parents including actors Emma Thompson and Julianne Moore.

54. Jessie Diggins

As a board member of POW, (Protect Our Winters), one of the world’s largest climate advocacy groups, American cross-country skier Jessie Diggins vocalises how increasingly warming winters are changing not only winter sports, but also the lives of the communities who live on and around the snow and have a reliance on it.

As a two-time cross-country World Cup champion who has been competing for 15 years, she says she’s seen winters change dramatically and speaks about the severity of winter environments disappearing before our eyes. In an interview last November, she said: “I will not shut up and ski,” highlighting the importance of the voices of people who see climate issues first hand too.

Ahead of the Nordic World Championships in Trondheim in February, Diggins and her teammates debuted race suits featuring images of melting glaciers, an impactful visual no one could ignore. She also endorsed the ban on PFAS chemicals in ski wax on the World Cup circuit, marking a major step toward reducing the environmental footprint of snow sports.

55. Jane Fonda

Activism has long been an important part of life for Jane Fonda. Many years since her days of anti-Vietnam war campaigning in the 1960s, the 87-year-old Oscar-winning actor now channels her energy into climate activism.

Earlier this year, Fonda became involved in the conservation of the Amazon rainforest, aligning with Amazon Frontlines and the Ceibo Alliance, an Indigenous-led coalition representing multiple tribes (also featured in this list under Nemonte Nenquimo’s entry), to protect their ancestral lands. The aim is to convince Ecuador’s Constitutional Court to enshrine the rights of Indigenous people, which allows them to decide what happens in their home, and means they must be informed before any action is taken. It follows Ecuador’s president Daniel Noboa’s plans to auction off more than 8 million acres of Amazonian Indigenous lands to oil companies.

Fonda has been arrested five times for civil disobedience while marching and protesting in recent years. In 2019 alongside Greenpeace, she launched Fire Drill Fridays, a series of weekly protests in Washington DC to urge political leaders to take stronger action on climate change. These protests, inspired by Greta Thunberg, galvanised public support and then became educational virtual events that educated people about climate justice, sustainability, and environmental policy, until it ended last year.

She also founded the Jane Fonda Climate Political Action Committee in 2022, which raises money to defeat the fossil fuel industry’s influence on US politics and elect climate champions across government.

56. Lewis Pugh

British-South African former maritime lawyer Lewis Pugh is an endurance swimmer and prominent speaker on the effects of the climate crisis on our rivers and oceans. He completes long-distance swims in some of the planet’s most vulnerable and challenging waters – including the Arctic and Antarctic – to highlight the importance of marine conservation.

In May, he took on a 62-mile swim in 8C waters around Martha’s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Cape Cod. It’s known as the filming location for Jaws, which turned 50 this year, and was tied into his event’s aim to raise awareness for the critical need for shark conservation, and to change the public’s perception of them as vicious, cold-blooded killers. He was the first person ever to achieve this.

In 2023, he swam all 315 miles of the Hudson River and wrote an opinion piece about it for The Independent to highlight the importance of clean rivers. He also became the first person to swim the full length of the River Thames in 2006. The previous year, he swam 100 miles across the Red Sea to underline the impact of climate change on fragile coral reefs. He is a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, and part of the 30x30 campaign, which aims to protect 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030. His work, and epic swims, are inspiring global efforts to safeguard marine ecosystems.

57. Mark Ruffalo

The anti-fracking movement’s most famous face, actor Mark Ruffalo has been an environmentalist for years, and uses the term “fractivists” to describe this particular branch of activism.

In 2016 he, Colin Firth and the late Vivienne Westwood wrote an open letter to then prime minister David Cameron to oppose fracking. In 2013, he co-founded The Solutions Project, an organisation committed to promoting 100 per cent renewable energy. In February 2024, Ruffalo worked with politicians to ban a new type of fracking, which swaps the use of water for pressurised carbon dioxide to get at methane trapped in shale. Fracking companies say this is a carbon-neutral fuel operation, but “fractivists” disagree.

Last October, he urged people to sign a petition to prevent the Irish Green Party from passing a “bill to fast track building liquid natural gas terminals that would import fracked gas from the United States”, he said in a video he posted to his Instagram. He’s also joining fellow members of SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) in calling for their pension fund to divest more than an estimated $100m (£74m) from fossil fuel stocks, and instead reinvest in green funds.

58. Sting

A British singer and an Amazonian tribal chief may seem unlikely friends, but environmentalism brought Sting and Chief Raoni Metuktire (also included in this list) of the Brazilian Kayapo tribe together.

After Metuktire asked for Sting’s help in protecting their Indigenous land and people, he and Sting, along with his wife Trudie Styler, founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund, a charity dedicated to raising awareness of deforestation and the rights of Indigenous people. For nearly four decades, the fund has donated to projects that have saved 28 million acres in 20 different rainforest countries.

More recently, in January, Sting performed at FireAid in LA, the concert held to raise money for those affected, following the devastating wildfires that burned through the area, destroying more than 22,000 homes and 40,000 acres. The set included a rendition of the repurposed song, Message in a Bottle – a powerful call for action on climate change. The newer version was aimed at world leaders attending Cop26 that year in Glasgow, urging them to “do something now” for the planet.

59. King Charles III and Prince William

Since he was a young man, King Charles III has been a green champion, long before sustainability became the buzzword it is today. It’s a trait that appears to have been passed down to his son and heir, Prince William, who has picked up the baton and launched his own initiative to tackle the climate crisis.

The king was head of the Duchy Estate for seven decades (a role now passed to Prince William), and he has been a tireless champion of organic food and agriculture.

For his unwavering focus on green issues, Tony Juniper, chair of Natural England and former director of Friends of the Earth, praised the king as “possibly the most significant environmentalist in history”. It is something that he has continued since ascending to the throne, installing the first solar panels on Windsor Castle and using biofuel in royal cars as he strives to reach net zero within the palace walls.

Prince William, who has followed in the footsteps of his environmentalist father and philanthropist mother, used his speech at the celebrations for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in 2022 to talk about the crisis. Although we have “increased our awareness of the impact humans have on our world, our planet has become more fragile”, he said, adding “the pressing need to protect and restore our planet has never been more urgent”.

This year, he supported Dartmoor peatland restoration and the planting of hundreds of saplings in Wistman’s Wood there too. He also launched a documentary series, Guardians, spotlighting wildlife rangers working in perilous conditions across habitats like the Amazon, Himalayas, and Africa.

His flagship initiative is the Earthshot Prize, launched five years ago. It supports young innovators from around the world in their ambitious attempts to solve our biggest environmental problems, from ocean pollution to poor air quality, by awarding five winners with £1m each.

60. Arnold Schwarzenegger

The former bodybuilding champion, movie star and politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has long been a proponent of fighting the climate crisis, which he said is an ineffective term that should instead be called just pollution.

He formed the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative in 2017 to “terminate pollution” and has been actively campaigning for smart solutions to mitigate climate change and for less political rhetoric.

Speaking in June at the Austrian World Summit, which he helps organise each year and is a key event in the climate calendar, Schwarzenegger challenged world leaders and climate advocates to “stop whining” and to focus on doing something in terms of workable solutions to help battle global warming.

During his time as governor of California two decades ago, Schwarzenegger was one of the first politicians to advocate transitioning to clean energy and finding ways to cut harmful carbon in places such as San Diego.

Politics & Government

61. Mark Carney

As prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney faces a climate challenge far bigger than in any of his previous roles, which included governor of the Bank of England and before that, governor of the Bank of Canada.

A long-time advocate for using the financial industry to help fight global warming by leading a transition to renewable energy, Carney was a mainstay on the global environmental conference circuit.

Since he was elected prime minister, Carney now runs one of the largest oil producing nations. He must balance his enthusiasm for a green energy transition in Canada and around the world with the energy politics in his country.

Carney scrapped an unpopular consumer carbon tax soon after being elected. He is considering imposing a carbon border tax to impose on importing countries with weaker environmental rules but so far that is still being studied.

62. Ed Miliband

As the former leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband's commitment to finding solutions to the climate crisis has run deep through his career. As the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, the role is similar to the one he held 15 years ago when Labour was last in government, where he played a pivotal role in shaping the UK’s Climate Change Act in 2008.

Shortly after he was re-appointed to the role following Labour's win last year, Miliband lifted the offshore wind ban and increased the renewable energy budget to a record figure of more than £1.5bn.

More recently, he's brought in the Great British Energy Act, which became law in May and aims to speed up the UK’s shift to renewable energy. He also delivered the first of what he plans to be an annual speech on Climate Crisis and Nature Decline, where he stated the two crises are inseparable. In the speech, he warned: “We must act on the climate and nature crisis to protect our British way of life, because no sector or part of our society is immune from those risks.”

63. Claudia Sheinbaum

Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a climate scientist with a strong background in renewable energy projects. She has contributed to the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and as mayor of Mexico City she worked to put solar panels in public places and electrify the city's transportation system.

Her presidential campaign included a commitment to invest more than $13bn (£10.4bn) in clean energy by 2030, but now that she is president she faces challenges in weighing her climate-fighting desires against the importance of Mexico's oil-producing legacy. In particular, she must tread lightly in her handling of Pemex, the state-owned energy company, which is a national leader in fossil fuel production.

Sheinbaum has also been a force behind designing a 30-year water plan for the country, to help manage water supply for its vital agricultural industry.

64. Sir Sadiq Khan

London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan, who is now in his third term, was the first mayor to be knighted in the New Year's List 2025. Throughout his tenure, he’s put the climate crisis at the forefront and has made significant strides in reducing the city’s carbon footprint. He's focused on tackling air pollution with Ulez (Ultra Low Emission Zone) and 20mph areas, and has just announced that one of the city's busiest shopping areas, Oxford Street, will become pedestrianised.

This year, he's opposed London Heathrow's proposed third runway, citing pollution concerns and the impact it could have on Britain's climate targets. He's also launched a £12m Green Roots Fund to support community-led projects that enhance parks, wetlands and rivers, improving urban biodiversity.

In an opinion piece for The Independent’s Climate 100 series last year, he called London’s air pollution the “gravest environmental threat to human health… with our poorest citizens and minority ethnic communities suffering the worst effects”.

Under new Ulez rules, roadside nitrogen dioxide levels have been halved since 2016, pollution has been cut by over 20 per cent in outer London, and the capital’s “air quality is improving at a faster rate than the rest of England’s average,” he says.

65. Mary Robinson

After serving as Ireland’s first female president, Mary Robinson, a lifelong champion of human rights, has established her own climate group, Project Dandelion, which pushes for women to be prioritised within the climate crisis response. The group launched a short film, We Are Dandelions, which premiered at the virtual Unite for Climate Solutions: A Women-Led Summit event, ahead of Cop28.

As well as advocating for women, she also emphasises the need for inclusive solutions that properly serve the needs of marginalised communities. For her work, she has become one of the most highly respected people in the climate conversation.

In her humanitarian work, she has been vocal in speaking out against Israel's aid block and has been to the Rafah Crossing as a member of The Elders, (which was founded by the late Nelson Mandela in 2007). The group is made up of a group of global leaders working together for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet, which she is the chair of.

In an interview with The Independent in 2023, she explained that she thinks the US, which is responsible for the largest share of historic greenhouse gas emissions, could do more in the fight against the climate crisis.

66. Lord Deben (John Gummer)

The Tory peer John Gummer, has been a steadfast advocate for environmentalism for decades. He served as Conservative Party chairman under Margaret Thatcher and as environment secretary in John Major’s government. More recently he was chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) between 2012 and 2023. In this role he played a crucial part in shaping the nation’s climate policies and guiding the UK towards its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Despite the CCC being the government’s own watchdog on climate, Lord Deben has spoken out about worries the previous government would not meet its climate targets. In June 2023, he said it had been “too slow to act”.

This year, though he supports increasing the UK’s onshore renewable efforts, he has spoken out against Lionlink energy cables going through the countryside. Instead, he says, cables should be taken under the sea, which he argues has the least impact on biodiversity, and brought onshore to brownfield sites.

For The Independent’s Climate 100 series last year, he wrote that, despite the crisis surging on, it is still within our collective power to mitigate its effects.

67. Marina Silva

Earlier this year, the Brazilian environment minister Marina Silva, warned that we’re already at the limit of liveable climate.

As a native Amazonian from a rubber-tapping family, Silva is serving as environment minister for the second time, having also held the role from 2003 to 2008. Back then, she implemented policies that significantly reduced deforestation rates, and she is continuing that work now, as well as being a staunch defender of Indigenous rights and biodiversity.

Silva is regarded as one of the most influential ministers in Brazil thanks to her work to rebuild the country’s capacity to halt rampant illegal deforestation in the Amazon. She believes protecting the Amazon rainforest, almost two thirds of which is in Brazil, is key to staving off the worst effects of the climate crisis.

In July, however, this came under threat following what has become known as the “devastation bill”, signed by President Lula, which stripped powers from Silva’s ministry. It allows companies to self-license for big construction projects such as building new roads, which will have devastating effects on the environment.

Silva has described the passing of this bill as a “death blow”, saying it threatens the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030.

68. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva

As president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, is arguably on the hottest climate change seat in the world this year.

Brazil plays host in November to the annual United National climate summit, this year dubbed Cop30, and Lula’s government has promised to host the tens of thousands of expected delegates in Belem, a small city on the Amazon Basin.

Lula and his team want to spotlight the damage being done to the Amazon – generally acknowledged to be the world’s largest natural carbon sink, for the ability of its trees and jungle to suck harmful carbon out of the atmosphere – by fossil fuel interests and cattle ranching.

The logistical challenge of bringing so many people to Belem and finding rooms is just one of the headaches Lula must deal with as he seeks to keep his country on track to fight global warming after four disastrous years of pollution and land clearing by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.

How Lula performs this year and in coming years will largely cement his legacy as either a climate advocate or a politician who was unable to control the vast oil and cattle interests that dominate his country.

69. Mia Mottley

Mia Mottley is a woman of many firsts, including, in 2018, becoming the first female prime minister of Barbados, and also the first prime minister to serve after Barbados became a republic in November 2021. The following year, she announced her landmark Bridgetown Initiative, which proposes to entirely reform how global debt works.

The plan calls for wealthier nations to contribute far more financially to the global climate fight, as poorer nations are bearing the physical and financial brunt of the crisis despite having contributed the least to it. It’s her central call, and one she spoke about at Cop29 in Baku last year, emphasising the need for global financial architecture reforms as the planet was “hurtling towards catastrophe” with increasing extreme weather events.

After floods, hurricanes or droughts, poorer nations struggle to financially rebuild due to their high debt. This can be as much as 12-14 per cent in poorer nations, compared to 1-4 per cent for wealthier countries. Mottley argues that if these high repayment interest rates are not paused or even cancelled – as was done for some countries after the Second World War – then they could be a death sentence for countries like hers.

Last December, Barbados benefitted from its first “debt for climate resilience swap”, meaning it replaced expensive debt with more affordable financing, generating $125m (£93m) in savings, which has been turned into a water and sewage project to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

70. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

A rising Democrat star and congressional representative from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quickly established herself as a lightning rod for climate change criticism after she was first elected in 2018 at the age of 29.

Also known as AOC, she was a co-sponsor of a bill called the Green New Deal, which called for a series of initiatives to combat global warming and housing inequality to support a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The Green New Deal became an attacking point of President Trump in his first term and remains so to this day, even though it has largely been put aside by Democrats. AOC, now a seasoned insider on Capitol Hill, is still is a leading spokesperson for environmental efforts and has positioned herself as one of the greatest critics of Trump’s policies to attack renewable energy in his second term.

She also continues to search for ways to incorporate parts of the Green New Deal into other legislation or programs to help mitigate the worst effects of global warming, both in New York and around the country.

71. Kathy Hochul

Kathy Hochul is governor of the state of New York and from the beginning of her leadership she has fought climate change, making herself a prominent target of President Trump’s efforts to thwart climate control.

In December, Hochul signed a Climate Superfund Act that requires fossil fuel companies to help finance climate adaptation projects in New York, particularly around low-carbon infrastructure. She has led state investments of more than $1bn (£743) in renewable energy projects and campaigned for social justice tied to environmental practices.

Her most controversial act was to implement traffic congestion pricing in New York City in January to slash traffic into Manhattan and lower carbon emissions, following a lead from London and other cities. President Trump has ordered her to reverse the order and threatened to withhold federal funding from New York state if she does not.

By May, the city reported more than $200m in new revenue from the pricing plan, which is set to be used to update and replace its aging public transportation system.

72. Ursula von der Leyen

As President of the European Commission in Brussels, Ursula von der Leyen has made climate change a central focus of her efforts since she was first elected in 2019.

Working toward a European Green Deal with other like-minded members of the EU, she pushed through policies and legislation designed to reduce harmful carbon emissions on the continent by 90 per cent by 2040 and completely by 2050, which would make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent.

But since last year’s EU elections, when a wave of right-wing members were elected as part of a backlash against rising energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen has faced rising challenges implementing green policies.

In June, she was forced to cut out large parts of the European Green Deal in order to push it through, which will affect most of her ambitious timelines.

73. Pope Leo XIV

Since Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost became Pope Leo XIV in May, he has quickly adopted climate change and the environment as one of his major focuses, as did his predecessor, Pope Francis, who was known as the “climate pope”.

Leo has actively addressed the destruction of the environment and in particular its effects on the poor. He has celebrated “green masses” to emphasise the Church’s responsibility to the Earth, and is even attempting to build a solar farm in the Vatican.

Shortly after becoming Pope, he celebrated the 10th anniversary of Francis’s Laudato si’, a 184-page letter to bishops that tied climate change to the Church’s social mission and condemned the destruction of the environment for financial gain, asking for a “relationship of reciprocity” with the environment.

74. Eric Garcetti

As mayor of Los Angeles from 2013 to 2022, Eric Garcetti fought to make the city a global leader in mitigating climate change, committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and establishing preventative measures to fight California’s growing trend of destructive wildfires.

In June, Garcetti was named ambassador for global climate diplomacy for the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. His new role will help him represent other cities and mayors in global climate leadership talks, particularly those arranged by the United Nations.

The leadership of cities has become a battleground in the fight against global warming as federal policies in the US and regional policies in the EU have shifted against green transition plans after a pushback over rising energy prices.

Climate advocates are focusing their attention on how each individual city can fight to protect itself and limit its carbon output despite the broader attack on climate policies. Garcetti will be a key figure at Cop30 this November in Belem, Brazil.

75. António Guterres

Under the leadership of Secretary General António Guterres, the United Nations has intensified efforts to push for ambitious climate action, urging countries to meet and exceed the goals of 2015’s legally binding Paris Agreement, which was enforced the following year.

Guterres frames the climate crisis as the defining issue of our time, and has championed the need to transition to renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions and protect vulnerable communities.

He continues to push for global net zero by 2050, though he now thinks richer nations should aim for 2040, and calls for greater international cooperation to address biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. His advocacy often runs into conflict with governments – such as in the US this year – that are hostile toward investing in climate mitigation or providing money to nations hit hard by global pollution.

Guterres faces a defining moment this November when the UN hosts its 30th annual climate summit, Cop30, in Brazil, whose portion of the Amazon Basin is threatened by logging and agriculture interests. Climate scientists say loss of the Amazon, one of the world's largest carbon sinks, would be devastating throughout the region. Guterres will deliver his message to delegates from countries that have moved decidedly away from sustainability in recent years because of costs and a global energy crisis.

76. Al Gore

After leaving public office as US vice president in 2001, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore has become one of the best known leaders of the climate fight.

In 2006 he founded the Climate Reality Project, which has trained more than 3.5 million people worldwide, empowering them to devise climate solutions for their communities. The same year, Gore’s documentary An Inconvenient Truth brought the realities of climate change to the fore and sparked a global conversation.

This past spring, Gore was a headline speaker at San Francisco Climate Week, where he blasted the Trump administration for its attack on government subsidies for renewable energy and for its attempts to override Congress on its traditional taxing and spending powers.

He also kicked off an international tour in March in Paris for his nonprofit Climate Reality Project, to use training centres and youth programs in other countries to expand public support for renewable alternatives to oil and gas. Gore said the strategy is designed to help support climate activism in parts of the world where there is still motivation to mitigate extreme heat and weather, despite setbacks in the US.

77. Sarah Johnson

As the head of peatland nature recovery at Lancashire's Wildlife Trust (LWT), Sarah Johnson has spent decades championing the need to restore peatlands.

Thanks to her, she's responsible for saving and recovering thousands of acres of upland and lowland peatlands, which are huge carbon sinks. The dense areas have the ability to lock away carbon for long periods of time, which are thought to be twice as effective as forests.

She's working to help protect the peatlands, which are vastly unprotected and have been heavily drained since after the Second World War. It's only recently that the UK has realised their importance, resulting in around 80 per cent of them being damaged. To do this, she works closely with local farmers to ensure wetter lowlands areas can both help farming and wildlife.

Part of this collaboration includes encouraging farmers to plant bullrushes to create an environmental filler for puffer jackets and pioneering carbon farms establishing new coverings of sphagnum moss to trap carbon.

78. Robbie Macpherson

Robbie Macpherson is a vocal advocate for driving the national economy away from oil and gas and transitioning to a green future to reduce harmful emissions and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. .

A graduate of the University of Sheffield, he was until last year the senior political adviser to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on climate change in the UK Parliament. Macpherson has written for national newspapers and appeared on broadcast media to discuss and advocate ways the government can better speed the climate transition.

In October, 2024, Macpherson was given a Churchill Fellowship, named after Winston Churchill, to study what lessons the UK can learn from countries such as Denmark and Colombia in their efforts to transition away from oil and gas to sustainable energy economies.

79. Ben von Wong

Canadian visual artist Ben von Wong's most recent installation sat outside the Plastic Treaty negotiations at Geneva’s Palais des Nations, where talks were held.

The 20ft structure, known as 'The Thinker's Burden', highlighted the reliance of plastics and the problem of microplastics. The traditional looking stone sculpture, which symbolises mother earth, was almost drowning in plastic waste, which he'd been adding to for weeks, and was designed to encourage people to think about and recognise the health problems plastic causes, not just for us, but future generations.

His work covers social and environmental issues, such as e-waste (discarded electronics) where he created The Skull of Satoshi in collaboration with Greenpeace in 2023 to raise awareness of the environmental damage Bitcoin mining creates. While in 2018 his 'Strawpocalyps' piece won him a Guiness World Record as the largest installation created from drinking straws to raise awareness about the damage they cause in the ocean.

80. Frances Fox

Frances Fox is the founder and UK director of Climate Live, a five-year-old group dedicated to using music festivals and concerts to bring climate activism to a new generation.

A long time music fan and graduate of the University of East Anglia, Fox is passionate about using music to spread the message of environmentalism. Fox was responsible for creating the solar-powered pink bus stage and music stall at music festivals across the UK and at climate events in as many as 30 other countries to spread the word. She is an active public speaker and writer.

This past summer, she appeared on the Drowned in Sound podcast to discuss her evolution from music fan to climate activist, and why music festivals themselves are under threat from climate change.

81. Sarah Small

While cycling over 4,500km this year, Sarah Small also had her 4ft wood instrument in tow, strapped to the back of her bike. It wasn't an endurance event, instead, she was on tour – taking the slow road. By travelling on two wheels around the UK, she highlighted the environmental impact of the traditional way of touring for musicians, usually reliant on flying or cars or coaches.

Playing the Viola da Gamba (also known as a viol), which was popular during the Renaissance period, she gave 31 performances and also wanted to perform at music venues outside of the main cities.

She began in May and finished at the end of July, traversing a large loop of most of the UK sticking to the coastlines of England and Wales, and much of Scotland, including the western isles. In an Instagram video she said this is the only way that she's not felt guilty for the way she's travelled.

Scientists & Academics

82. Sir David Attenborough

No one has been a greater force in raising awareness of the climate and environmental crises than Sir David Attenborough. The British documentarian and naturalist is behind dozens of TV series, beaming unforgettable portraits of animals and plants in their natural habitats into the homes of millions around the world, while also painting a very vivid picture of the disastrous realities the planet faces at the hands of humans. His enthusiasm and respect for our uniquely diverse planet has inspired generations of scientists, academics, conservationists and activists.

Known as “the voice of nature”, Sir David is still working and broadcasting with his signature eloquence at the age of 99. He has reported from some of the world’s toughest environments, and at every opportunity, uses his platform to advocate for immediate action to combat environmental degradation through programmes including Natural World, Wildlife on One and the Planet Earth series. The Blue Planet is regarded as having drawn attention to the global problem of plastic pollution, and The Life of Mammals explored the threat humanity has posed to every other species on Earth.

This year, he has already launched two documentaries, Parenthood and Ocean with David Attenborough. The latter was released on his 99th birthday – one critic called it the “greatest message he’s told” – and it described the startling effect dredging has on the ocean floor, and how important the oceans, which he calls “our life support system and our greatest ally against climate catastrophe”, are to the future of our world

83. Gretchen Goldman

Gretchen Goldman is an American environmental scientist and president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit advocacy group that uses scientific research to push for solutions to environmental problems.

Before that, she was director of climate change research and technology at the US state department after holding a leadership role at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Biden.

In her current role, which she assumed in February, Goldman intends to be a leading voice among scientists increasingly concerned by President Trump’s anti-environmental policies and attacks on renewable energy.

As the Trump administration seeks to limit environmental data and in some cases remove research from government websites, more and more pressure will build on scientists to find new ways to promote fact-based environmental research.

84. Dr Ayana Elizabeth Johnson

Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is an American marine biologist and co-founder of the nonprofit Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for policy on coastal cities. She has long promoted ocean conservation and co-authored the Blue New Deal, a plan for including the oceans in climate policy. She has also been involved with environmental policy, written books and articles on the subject, and co-hosted the podcast How To Save A Planet.

Adding to her long history of climate work, last year she published her own book, What If We Get It Right? Visions of Climate Futures, which one critic called “a much-needed antidote to ‘climate grief’”. The book is a collection of essays, poems and musings on potential climate futures by people working in areas ranging from farming to architecture. It promotes the idea that there may be many different solutions to the climate emergency – not just one sole plan of action.

85. Fatih Birol

Fatih Birol is executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which helps countries to form energy policy. He is known for championing the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future, and has emphasised the need for urgent, coordinated global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C.

Renewables grew rapidly in the past few years and Birol has said the IEA expects renewable energy use to increase by 2.5 times by 2030, but that that would still fall short of the tripling that nations agreed at the Cop28 climate summit two years ago. He added that the goal is still reachable, though success hinges on increasing funds for clean energy in developing countries.

He also previously said the war in Gaza has proven that “oil and gas are no longer safe choices”, and that the Middle East crisis could accelerate the move to clean energy.

In January at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Birol singled out India as a developing country on the right track, noting its 40 per cent surge in renewable energy investment in 2024. Later this year, Birol will help preside over the critical Cop30 climate summit in Brazil, which will focus on ways to contain damage to the Amazon basin, among other things.

He must also navigate increasing pressure from the fossil fuel industry and from governments such as the US that want to drill more. He has said existing oil and gas fields do require investment but that must not detract the world from its mission to transition from oil and gas to clean energy.

86. Dr Jane Goodall

Jane Goodall’s name is synonymous with her groundbreaking work on the study of chimpanzees, which she began in 1960. She is a renowned conservationist and ethologist (the study of non-human animal behaviour) who at 91 continues to show an unwavering commitment to conservation.

Through the Jane Goodall Institute, her work focuses on education and community conservation projects. In 1991, she set up Roots & Shoots, supporting young people to work on environmental, conservation and humanitarian issues. In 2023, Goodall launched the Trees for Jane campaign, promoting tree planting and forest preservation worldwide.

Speaking in London at the South by Southwest festival in June, Goodall reflected on the horrors of Gaza and Ukraine and the damage the environment has suffered from them. However, she added that she is still hopeful that the younger generation, who make up a large section of her supporters, will change things while there is still time.

She also commented on the surge in AI usage and said it was a tool whose impact on the world will depend on how it is used by society.

87. Dr Kimberley Budil and team

For 70 years, scientists have attempted to replicate the energy process that powers the sun. Three years ago, a team in California finally managed to do it after 13 years of trying.

Physicist Kim Budil is the director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. She is the first woman to hold the position, and it was under her leadership that her team made its historic breakthrough in nuclear fusion.Since then, investors have poured money into fusion technologies and companies purporting to be on the cusp of a breakthrough to scale the process. The Trump administration recently said the US was committed to all forms of nuclear energy, including fusion.

Nuclear fusion offers the promise of providing nearly limitless clean energy, which could revolutionise efforts to meet the world’s energy needs sustainably, changing the trajectory of the climate crisis. Known as a “net energy gain” – producing more energy in a fusion reaction than was used to ignite it – the experiment delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of energy output.

88. Michael Mann

For Michael Mann, climate scientist, author and professor of climate science at the University of Pennsylvania, the problem of climate denial has been at the heart of a major libel case that has continued for 12 years.

In February 2024, Mann, who is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences, was awarded damages after winning a case against two writers who, in a blogpost for the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, compared Mann’s depictions of global warming to child molestation but against data, which Mann says damaged his reputation. After the verdict was announced, Mann said: “It’s a good day for us. It’s a good day for science.” The case has become a symbol of upholding of s","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/18/13/29/climate100100herosplitNEW.jpeg?trim=0,1,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-09-21 15:00:39.825707

We now have nearly 15 years of additional experience and data to support the Endangerment Finding more thoroughly and with greater confidence.","MADISON | Wisconsin’s Green Fire (WGF), a science-based conservation nonprofit, urges the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to keep the 2009 Endangerment Finding in place and to maintain the greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. WGF is submitting detailed comments opposing the EPA’s proposed rule (Federal Register Number 2025-14572). WGF’s comments were prepared by subject matter experts on climate change and are available on the WGF website here. The EPA’s public comment period on this topic closes on September 22nd, 2025.

In a 2007 US Supreme Court decision, the nation’s highest court ruled that greenhouse gases qualified as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The US EPA subsequently issued the 2009 Endangerment Finding. It stated that: 1) that greenhouse gases threaten public health and 2) that motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution. These findings are the basis for emissions standards that aim to reduce pollution and protect public health. There have been no new developments, particularly no peer-reviewed scientific studies, that cast doubt on the reliability of the 2009 Endangerment Finding or challenge its assumptions. Counter to the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment, the EPA is ignoring or misconstruing the science and the obvious facts: climate change is a grave existential threat to human health and welfare.

We now have nearly 15 years of additional experience and data to support the Endangerment Finding more thoroughly and with greater confidence. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the past 10 years have been the 10 warmest years on record since 1850. Additionally, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995. This is not a random coincidence.

These changes impact Wisconsin directly, too. According to the 2021 Assessment Report from the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI), “In the last decade, nearly every region of our state has experienced extreme rainfall events that led to flooding of roads, homes, businesses, and farm fields.” The August 2025 flooding in Milwaukee and other parts of southeastern Wisconsin is just one example of a 1000-year rainstorm. From 1980 to 2024, NOAA documented 44 severe storms in the Midwest, including Wisconsin. In a similar time frame from 1988 to 2023, there were nine droughts. Droughts are associated with health risks like heat stress. Furthermore, droughts can cause widespread crop losses to economically important crops like corn and soybeans. Life-threatening weather events are becoming almost annual in our region.

Beyond weather events, greenhouse gases endanger public health by lowering the air quality. Emissions from vehicles and other sources create smog. Warm temperatures accelerate those smog-creating conditions. Smog harms human health, resulting in acute respiratory symptoms that lead to reduced productivity (missed school and work days), hospitalizations, and premature death.

Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns also bring increased risks of vector-borne disease like Lyme disease, West Nile virus, dengue fever, and Zika virus. According to BioMed Research International, since 2009, cases of dengue have been documented in Florida for the first time in 75 years. The warmer and wetter conditions caused by global warming will make some areas of the US more conducive to the spread of mosquitoes and ticks that spread these dangerous diseases.

The climate factors occurring today, including temperature increases, changing precipitation patterns, changes in humidity and other factors are different in one dramatic and devastating regard—the rapid rate of change. Thousands of species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians, trees, coral reef species, and others are threatened with extinction. In 2020, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed that climate change was the biggest factor leading to extinction.

For New Pittsburgh Courier

In August 2025, the Black unemployment rate surged to 7.5 percent —about twice the rate for White workers (3.7 percent) and well above the national average of 4.3 percent. Washington, D.C., and Michigan had the highest Black unemployment rates in the second quarter of 2025, at 10.3 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

These numbers are not mere statistics—they signal families set back, dreams delayed, and communities left more vulnerable each time the economy falters. For Black Americans, downturns hit harder, and recovery is slower. In these moments, only true wealth infrastructure—assets, homeownership, savings, and entrepreneurship—can anchor families and offer a genuine path forward.

As federal layoffs accelerate and key industries shed workers, families without assets face a familiar crisis: unemployment that threatens not just monthly bills, but housing stability and children’s futures. Black workers bear the heaviest burden, losing jobs first and finding new ones last each time the economy turns.

The Promise of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program

One model stands out: the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, HUD’s proven approach for helping low-income families turn rental assistance into long-term wealth. As participants’ incomes rise, so do their savings—thanks to an innovative escrow account that captures what otherwise would have gone toward higher rent. By graduation, many families have enough for a down payment, tuition, or even a small business venture. With $141 million in federal appropriations for 2025, FSS is a rare example of scalable, bipartisan anti-poverty policy—yet it faces perennial funding threats that put its gains at risk.

Asset-building programs like FSS, which Congress has protected even as recent budgets have targeted them for cuts, are essential to help families weather unemployment, avoid eviction, and create security that income alone cannot guarantee. In the wake of these disruptions, Black wealth infrastructure isn’t just important; it is essential for community and generational resilience. The effects are visible in lives transformed.

Take Marisabel, who entered the FSS Homeownership Track in Massachusetts as a renter struggling to get ahead. Through steady work, saving, and coaching, she bought her first home —turning uncertainty into lasting security for her family. Likewise, Tanisha Durrett, a single mother, became the proud owner of a bookkeeping business after completing FSS, crediting the program’s financial coaching for her leap into entrepreneurship.

Closing the Racial Wealth Gap

However, even diligent saving can’t close the racial wealth gap alone. The pathways to prosperity increasingly run through new engines of economic growth —like clean energy, a $23 trillion market by 2030, expected to generate over a million jobs in the coming years. Yet Black Americans currently hold only 8 percent of jobs in the sector and own less than 1 percent of its companies. Even as industry leaders clamor to hire—“We need to hire 500,000 people in the next decade,” says Jason Grumet of the American Clean Power Association—systemic barriers persist.

Chief among these obstacles is unpaid training. As CEO Carla Walker-Miller notes, “If you want [Black people] to be trained, pay us… We need to be paid while we’re trained.” Without paid opportunities, participation remains limited—no matter how dire the labor shortage. For those who do break in, union positions offer real security: 8–19 percent higher wages and strong benefits. Most new roles require no college degree, making these jobs especially valuable for displaced workers.

Business ownership—vital for family and community wealth —remains out of reach for many. Fewer than a quarter of Black-owned clean energy companies get bank financing, compared to nearly half of White-owned firms. This persistent financing gap prevents Black entrepreneurs from scaling up and sharing new opportunities.

Programs like FSS, the Dearfield Fund for Black Wealth, and D.C.’s Black Homeownership Fund reveal what’s possible. These efforts turn passive hope into asset-building action, helping families achieve homeownership, launch businesses, and stabilize entire neighborhoods.

To create lasting resilience, we must do three things:

Expand asset-building programs like FSS and down payment supports nationwide so every hardworking family can own a home and build security.

Open pathways to emerging industries with paid training, union jobs, and fair business opportunities.

Reform lending and homeownership systems with targeted community investments and strict anti-discrimination rules.

If policymakers act with purpose—grounded in evidence —Black families will not only weather economic storms, but thrive: launching businesses, sending children to college, and building communities with enduring strength. True wealth infrastructure is more than a safety net—it’s the foundation for real and lasting mobility. There is no Black mobility without Black sustainability.

In a 2022 report, the industry itself admitted only 6% of its methane emissions were leaks, the rest were intentional releases.

They’re making a false argument that increasing methane production and exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) worldwide will somehow help meet Global Methane Pledge goals.
Methane still offers a tremendous opportunity to make climate progress, provided we make tremendous progress on actually cutting methane emissions.","U.S. energy policy stinks because it accelerates rising methane emissions, which accelerate climate change. The Trump administration is attacking renewable energy, most recently taking a whole-of-government approach to savaging wind power, while aggressively pushing dirty natural gas production and LNG exports, and even threatening countries that try to decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

This is a recipe for disaster. Fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure inevitably release methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years. Methane has likely caused 40-50% of all warming in the past 20 years. Cutting it is our best chance to slow warming, but we’re blowing it. Methane emissions continue to climb with “no foreseeable slowdown,” a new study in the journal Nature finds.

We can’t change this trajectory unless we stop drilling for oil and gas. “Overall emissions will remain high as long as the industry is drilling new wells…That’s just the nature of the beast,” a petroleum expert told ProPublica this month, as it reported on how permits for Texas wells to vent and flare their natural gas (i.e., methane) are rubber stamped, with 99.6% approved. In fact, in Texas and some other states, oil well methane emissions are so normalized that some permits are issued automatically, without applications.

The industry literally can’t exist without pollution, because oil and gas operations must release methane and other pollutants to regulate equipment pressures, which is why they routinely get air pollution permits. The problem is much bigger than accidental leaks. In a 2022 report, the industry itself admitted only 6% of its methane emissions were leaks, the rest were intentional releases.

The Permian Basin in Texas alone emits more than 256,000 kilograms of methane per hour (about 2.2 million metric tons a year) the climate equivalent of 161 natural gas-fired power plants. And even in purportedly low-emitting oilfields, we know emissions are grossly underestimated.

So as leaders gather at Climate Week NYC to discuss solutions, they should start there: methane emissions are required for oil and gas production, “clean” natural gas is a scam, so to stop methane emissions we must stop drilling new wells.

We already agree on the need to stop methane. I was at the 2021 COP26 climate summit in Glasgow when the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 was launched. So far 159 countries including the United States have signed it. But as I said then, “A pledge is not a plan.” Today, roughly halfway to the 2030 deadline, global methane emissions are up, not down, by some 40 million tons, largely from growing energy sector emissions — the equivalent of building 296 new coal-fired powerplants.

Meanwhile, oil and gas executives advertise flashy new emissions controls and misleading performance metrics to justify more production, even as methane emissions rise. They’re making a false argument that increasing methane production and exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) worldwide will somehow help meet Global Methane Pledge goals.

Their playbook is to ignore lifecycle emissions, cherry pick certain examples, and peddle the notion that natural gas can be “clean,” even though natural gas is methane and venting and flaring it is endemic.

But LNG is not “clean;” studies show it is 33% worse for the climate than coal. Leading environmental scientist Bob Howarth calls LNG “the worst of any fossil fuel.” Besides the methane emissions required in all natural gas production and transmission, LNG involves liquifying the gas, transporting it on boats, then more processing to make it usable in the destination countries, all of which causes massive additional emissions.

But we can still reverse the trend and bring methane levels down. Since it has a short lifespan in the atmosphere, the International Energy Agency points out that “sharp cuts in methane can deliver a net cooling effect within a relatively short period,” giving us time to “pursue lasting reductions in carbon dioxide.”

Although the Global Methane Pledge hasn’t delivered actual methane reductions yet, the IEA’s fundamental logic is correct. Methane still offers a tremendous opportunity to make climate progress, provided we make tremendous progress on actually cutting methane emissions. But accomplishing this will take more than non-binding pledges and fossil fuel industry spin. It will take putting a stop to oil and gas expansion.

No amount of emissions gadgets or performance certifications can fix an industry that must pollute to exist. Once we admit that, we can finally move from pledges to actual plans, and from methane-intensive energy to renewables.",https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1392949973.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:43.981298

“… It’s important to note that Duane Arnold Energy Center operated safely for decades, providing reliable, emissions-free energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.
Linn County’s outdoor sirens, originally installed by Duane Arnold, were donated to Linn County and its communities when the plant closed.","PALO — At Whiskey River Grill, a bar and restaurant that sits a couple miles from the decommissioned Duane Arnold Energy Center, co-owner Lacey Christiansen remembers when the lunch crowd was steady, fueled by technicians and operators coming off shifts at Iowa’s only nuclear plant.

“When we first opened six years ago, they were still up and running, and there was just a lot more lunch business,” Christiansen said. “We definitely saw a decline after it all closed down.”

Now, with plant owner NextEra Energy weighing a plan to restart operations at Duane Arnold by the end of the decade, Christiansen sees reason for optimism.

“I haven’t heard anything negative about it,” she said. “We hear, you know, 1,000 people can be coming to work. … And that's exciting for us, right? You know, because these people are going to be coming right through here to go to work every day and going home every day. So that's a big deal for a small business like us.”

Her reaction is echoed across rural Linn County, where residents and business leaders are bracing for an economic revival spurred by the prospect hundreds of high-wage jobs, a multiyear construction surge, and new housing demand.

Palo and Center Point businesses, union leaders and city officials say the economic ripple would be significant.

Impact of decommissioning

Duane Arnold, a single-unit boiling water reactor, entered service in 1975. It was decommissioned in 2020, after more than four decades of producing around 600 megawatts of power and supplying about 8 percent of Iowa’s electricity.

The decision was driven by a combination of economic factors — with Alliant Energy, the plant’s primary electricity customer choosing to exit its power purchase agreement years early — and was hastened by the August 2020 derecho, which caused “extensive” damage to the facility’s cooling towers.

Officials for both Alliant and NextEra at the time said the declining market value of energy from sources like wind, which had dropped below the cost of nuclear generation, prompted the decision to close Duane Arnold.

Alliant Energy customers were projected to save nearly $300 million in energy costs over 21 years — or about $42 a year for residential customers, starting in 2021 — due to the plant’s closure, The Gazette reported at the time.

Since then, NextEra says recommissioning is needed to meet surging electricity demand driven by data centers and other energy-intensive growth.

For nearby communities like Palo and Center Point, the loss was felt both in jobs and in identity.

“I think the biggest impact was more of, ‘Oh no, the nuclear plant shut down. That sucks,” said Palo Mayor Eric Van Kerckhove. “That's kind of been part of Palo’s identity” for a long time.“

Though Palo has grown with new homes and businesses, the mayor said reduced foot traffic and spending were noticeable.

In Center Point, Mayor Traer Morgan saw the closure more directly. His neighbor lost his job at the plant.

“There are people who had to find work elsewhere since the decommissioning,” Morgan said.

City Administrator Joe Taylor described the loss as a “gradual impact” typical of large employer closures.

“You have a negative impact that’s gradually felt, as opposed to just an immediate shock,” he said.

Businesses wait for return

Restaurants and small businesses reported declines in daytime customers once the plant went offline.

“The lunch rush just hasn’t been the same,” Christiansen said of Whiskey River.

Anticipation for new activity has been building since NextEra confirmed it is exploring recommissioning. The project could bring a thousand or more of temporary construction workers and eventually several hundred permanent employees back to the site.

In Center Point, Taylor said the prospect has already sparked some interest from developers.

“We're examining the aspect now of conducting a hotel study,” he said. “They had attempted to do one about 10 years ago, and the numbers just really didn't jive — didn't validate any forward movement past the initial phase,” but the potential bringing a thousand or more temporary construction workers to the area over three to four years changes the tone and urgency.

“They are going to need places to stay, places to eat, places to do (things),” Taylor said. “And so, you know, where our population and our development is already headed that way, something like this obviously spurs some interest from (developers) who are like, ‘Oh, well, you know, there's a possibility to capitalize on something and go from there,’ and with our position on (Interstate) 380 it makes sense, right?”

Economic stakes

A 2014 economic study by the Nuclear Energy Institute estimated Duane Arnold’s operation pumped $246 million annually into Benton and Linn counties, supported 978 jobs locally, and contributed $25.6 million in tax revenue across federal, state and local levels.

At its peak, the plant directly employed nearly 600 workers, with average wages in Linn County topping $82,000 — far above the county average of $45,690 at the time.

Ron Corbett, vice president of economic development for the Cedar Rapids Metro Economic Alliance, said restarting could restore that kind of economic engine.

He said NextEra is working on an updated economic impact study.

“We know the impact will be substantial,” Corbett said. “ … We are thrilled there is a chance to bring these jobs back with the reopening of the nuclear power plant.”

He said the average wage at Duane Arnold before closing was over $100,000.

Housing demand

New demand for housing is a near certainty, according to local officials. Palo has seen a wave of new single-family homes, and developers are preparing for more.

“My hope is that we'll see a lot of homes sell pretty quickly and be in the situation where we need to build more faster,” Van Kerckhove said.

The Palo mayor also expressed excitement about the broader opportunities for new industry in and around Palo. While he said he could not share any specific companies that Palo hopes to attract with the potential restart of the Duane Arnold nuclear plant, Van Kerckhove said a recommissioned plant could attract companies that require significant clean energy, such as data centers and manufacturers.

Center Point has annexed land across Interstate 380 in anticipation of growth.

“Even in my short tenure here — I got here in September of 2021 — land that was in essence considered pretty much off limits … is now for sale,” Taylor said, noting developers are already positioning for new demand.

He said the “sweet spot” for growth remains homes priced at $350,000 or below, which he now considers the affordable range for new construction. If the plant returns, he expects a wave of new neighborhoods to follow.

“At that price point, you could have a pretty good boom on your hands,” Taylor said.

A recently built 42-unit apartment complex is already full, with some tenants working on new data centers or on early Duane Arnold-related projects.

“That’s a direct impact,” Taylor said.

Union’s perspective

For labor unions, Duane Arnold’s potential restart represents more than jobs — it’s about stability and growth.

“It was a huge deal for us,” said Jon Van Zante, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204. At its height, the plant employed more than 350 of his members.

Even if staffing levels today are smaller — perhaps 150 to 200 permanent union jobs — Van Zante said the ripple effects across trades would be significant.

“These are highly skilled jobs that pay extremely well,” Van Zante said, estimating wages could exceed $120,000 annually. “That’s long-term employment, not just a project.”

Beyond the permanent workforce, the project would draw hundreds of contractors and tradespeople during construction and scheduled maintenance. Electricians, plumbers, carpenters and other skilled laborers would see steady demand, echoing the plant’s past role as a major source of work for union members across Iowa, he said.

The facility previously paid nearly $3 million annually in property taxes, supporting schools and county infrastructure. Van Zante said reopening would restore that revenue stream, strengthening local services and community projects.

Local businesses would also benefit from increased foot traffic and disposable income. Restaurants, health clubs and service providers once thrived on plant workers and could again, Van Zante and city officials said. Housing demand is expected to rise as workers and families move closer to the site, fueling new construction and boosting property values.

Former employees have expressed interest in returning, Van Zante added. Some transferred to Alliant Energy’s Prairie Creek Generating Station in Cedar Rapids or other nuclear plants nationwide, he said.

“Some of them (who have left and went to work at other nuclear facilities elsewhere in the United States), even still have houses here,” Van Zante said. “And so they would love the option to be able to come back. So I think it creates a lot of good potential.”

And with the state’s growing energy needs driven by data centers and other industries, he said Duane Arnold’s return would ripple well beyond Linn County, supporting suppliers and utilities across the region.

The union also sees a chance to train the next generation.

“I tell my 18-year-old son, there’s never been a better time to go into the trades,” Van Zante said. “I’ve never seen growth like this in 28 years.”

Ripple effects

Beyond jobs and wages, local leaders expect a cascading economic effect.

Restaurants, gas stations, auto shops and retailers all stand to benefit from increased daily traffic, Van Kerckhove said

“You’ll see more people coming in for lunch, getting their oil changed, buying groceries,” he said.

For Center Point, the benefit could extend to schools.

“Good-paying jobs mean stronger school districts,” Taylor said. “... It’s the rising tide that lifts all boats.”

The 2014 study quantified that ripple: for every $1 of output from Duane Arnold, the local economy generated $1.23, while the state economy produced $1.27.

NextEra’s plans

While no final decision has been made, Duane Arnold Energy Center spokesperson Bill Orlove said the company is conducting engineering studies, recruiting licensed nuclear operators and working with potential customers.

If the project moves forward, Duane Arnold would add 600 megawatts of power generation, contributing to the Trump administration’s target of 5,000 megawatts of new nuclear energy by 2030. NextEra said a restart would bring “hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs” back to Linn County and generate millions in tax revenue for schools and local governments.

The company stressed safety remains the top priority, noting Duane Arnold had operated safely for decades before its 2020 closure.

“Restarting a nuclear power plant is a serious undertaking,” Orlove said in a statement. “… It’s important to note that Duane Arnold Energy Center operated safely for decades, providing reliable, emissions-free energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses. The health and safety of the public is always our top priority. Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.

“As we continue to go through this process, we are committed to remaining engaged with local and state stakeholders.”

From Palo’s vantage, Van Kerckhove said, “It feels more like when, not if.” He expects construction could take about three years once approved, bringing a surge of temporary workers.

NextEra has historically invested in community amenities, from donating a splash pad in Palo to supporting local fire departments. Leaders expect that outreach to continue if the restart proceeds.

Safety and community response

Unlike contentious solar projects that sparked opposition in Linn County, leaders say the nuclear restart has drawn little pushback.

“We haven’t heard any complaints,” Taylor said. “It’s been excitement.”

Van Kerckhove agreed: “I’ve heard nothing but positive remarks. People see it as putting Palo back on the map.”

Emergency planning, once tied closely to the plant, also will return. Palo’s fire department still uses equipment donated when the plant closed. Linn County’s outdoor sirens, originally installed by Duane Arnold, were donated to Linn County and its communities when the plant closed. Officials expect those partnerships to be reactivated.

“The community is very familiar with it,” Morgan said. “It’s not new. It’s been here for 40 years.”

A sense of identity

Palo City Council member Jen Welton said the town has long identified with the plant.

“I think a lot of people would consider Palo as the home of the Duane Arnold power plant, and they take great pride in that,” Welton said. “… There was a sense of loss when it was decommissioned. People really felt strongly about the power plant and felt that it brought a lot of great things to the community over the years for us.”

Welton said residents view the possibility of bringing back hundreds of high-paying jobs as “absolutely great for economic development,” benefiting not only Palo but surrounding communities such as Cedar Rapids, Hiawatha and Marion. The plant’s return, she added, could also spark interest from industries looking for clean power and encourage further housing and business development.

“I haven’t met one person that hasn’t really found this to be a positive,” she said. “It was really hard when the plant closed. When it becomes part of who you are as a community, to lose something of that size and magnitude is tough.”

At Whiskey River, Christiansen sees that identity translating into customers again.

“It’s exciting,” she said. “These are good jobs, good people, and they’re going to be coming right through here every day.”

For union members, it’s a chance to reestablish a pillar of the local labor economy.

“I don’t see anything but positives,” Van Zante said. “It makes our union stronger, and it makes the community stronger.”

And for Center Point’s administrator, the restart could mark a turning point.

What’s everyone think about the EV tax credit going away? Do you see manufacturers rolling out bigger rebates to keep sales moving, or will prices just crash harder? Will this kill EV demand, or could it actually push used EV values down even more?

I own a dealership that exclusively sells used EV’s.. (in a very red state).. my experience says those that are interested in EV’s will buy them either way as long as they are affordable. Most my customers are buying around the $15-$20k mark as an affordable way to test an EV for their lifestyle. That’s the biggest barrier to entry for most in the new car sector. Until the last year we’ve really lacked “affordable” new EV’s with logical use range… Even with the tax rebate. With the new Leaf coming out, Chevy’s Equinox doing well, and whatever Ford has planned.. we are seeing that change.

On the flip side.. manufacturers like Cadillac who have rolled out a phenomenal line of EV’s… Most their customers aren’t going to qualify for the rebate and they seem to only be picking up momentum with some ridiculously big number like 80% of their EV buyers being new to the brand. They are showing that if you build attractive EV’s that feel and look worth the money.. there’s a market.

From the used side.. we actually stopped utilizing the rebate this last week out of fear we might not get paid as it wraps up this week (which talking to other EV dealers.. that seems to be the case)… We still had our best week in 2 months.

I do expect to see a bigger spread in pricing on used EV’s. We won’t see vehicles with 50k miles priced so close to vehicles with 100k miles since they won’t be trying to stuff every price under the $25k threshold of the used EV credit.",,N,,2025-09-21 15:00:10.732368

The move is part of a broader strategy to stimulate local demand for green technologies and respond to external trade pressures.

Policy Shift Aims to Boost Domestic Consumption

The tax cut applies to a range of equipment used in the renewable energy sector, including solar panels, , and related components. By lowering the tax burden, the government seeks to make these technologies more affordable for domestic consumers and businesses. This is expected to encourage investment in clean energy projects and accelerate India’s transition toward renewable sources.

The reduction comes as part of a series of fiscal adjustments aimed at supporting the country’s energy infrastructure goals. By reducing the cost of imported and locally manufactured equipment, the policy is intended to enhance the competitiveness of India’s renewable energy market.

Strategic Response to External Trade Developments

While the government has not explicitly referenced trade dynamics, the timing of the tax cut is seen as a strategic move to offset the impact of potential external tariffs. The policy change is expected to cushion the Indian manufacturing and energy sectors against the financial implications of higher import costs that could stem from foreign trade barriers.

The adjustment also reflects the government’s commitment to promoting self-reliance in the energy sector. By making renewable energy equipment more accessible, the policy is expected to support domestic manufacturing and encourage the adoption of green technologies across industries.

Implementation Set for Mid-September

, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust to the new fiscal environment. Industry stakeholders have welcomed the move as a positive signal for the sector, with expectations that the reduced tax rate will translate into faster project approvals and increased investment.

The government has emphasized that the change will be applied uniformly across the relevant product categories. Importers and local manufacturers will both benefit from the lower tax rate, which is expected to improve margins and reduce the overall cost of renewable energy infrastructure.

Sector Readiness and Future Outlook

With the tax cut now in place, the focus will shift to how quickly the market adapts to the new framework. The government’s policy has the potential to reduce the cost of setting up solar and wind projects, making it more attractive for private sector participation. .

The move underscores the government’s continued support for the renewable energy sector as a key pillar of India’s energy strategy. By reducing financial barriers, the policy aims to create a more favorable environment for long-term investments in clean energy infrastructure. {}",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2643784bc002.png,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:26.778114

CID Gulf LLC, an Omani-Moroccan engineering consultancy firm, has announced that it has secured a prestigious contract to provide design consultancy services for the establishment of Oman’s first wind turbine manufacturing project at Duqm SEZ. The client is Mawarid Turbines — a subsidiary of Oman’s integrated energy powerhouse, OQ Group.

Muscat-based CID Gulf is a joint venture established by Khonji Engineering Consultancy, a member of Mohamed & Ahmed Alkhonji LLC (MAK), a leading Omani tech-based products and services holding company and Conseil, Ingénierie et Développement (CID), a Moroccan consultancy engineering firm operating across the African continent and the Middle East.

“This project represents a cornerstone in the Sultanate of Oman’s move towards clean energy, local industrialisation and long-term sustainability. We are honoured to contribute to this national initiative alongside key government and private sector stakeholders”, CID Gulf noted in a post on Friday.

The award underscores a fast-track approach to the implementation of Mawarid Turbines — a landmark bid to localise wind turbine manufacturing to cater to the large domestic market as well as regional demand. Oman’s requirement for wind turbines to support the country’s energy transition — spanning grid-connected clean energy generation and the ambitious green hydrogen sector — is estimated in the thousands over the next couple of decades.

Phase 1 of the facility, to be developed on a sprawling 550,000 m² site in the SEZ, entails an investment of around RO 70 million. The wind turbine manufacturing capacity of this phase is projected at around 1,100 MW per year, focusing on the production of two turbine models — the 6.25 MW and the 9.6 MW. Technology for the project will be licensed from Shanghai Electric Group, a major player in China’s clean energy equipment manufacturing sector.

Among the first recipients of the turbines — covering not only nacelle hubs housing the generators but potentially other components as well — are grid —connected, wind-based Independent Power Projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah. While these projects will be developed by international developers (supported by their local consortium partners) selected through a competitive tender managed by Nama Power & Water Procurement (Nama PWP), OQ Alternative Energy (OQAE) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of OQ Group — has been assured a stake in them. This stake commitment, consistent with OQAE’s mandate as the national champion for renewable energy, covers an equity share of up to 25 per cent in all future renewable energy projects procured by Nama PWP, starting with the Ibri III Solar PV project — a 500 MW scheme slated for implementation in Al Dhahirah Governorate. In the case of the wind projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah, OQAE’s investment — in the form of locally manufactured wind turbines and potentially other contributions — will correspond to an equivalent stake in the respective project companies, it is learnt.

Phase 1 of Mawarid Turbines is expected to come on stream by late 2026 or early 2027.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/09/21/thumbs/600x600/3135108.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 13:00:34.929370

The Trump administration has signed into law several executive orders aimed at reducing the standing of renewable energies in the United States. The Trump administration has implemented a new approach to the energy sector that sees the traditional gas and coal sectors being favored instead of the wind and solar power sectors that have become more popular in recent years.

U.S. Wind alleges federal officials were under pressure from the Trump administration

A recent court filing has revealed that the Trump administration filed a request to a federal court to vacate a permit approved for US Wind’s proposed Maryland Offshore Wind project. The project could have a significant impact on the energy sector in the United States and has the capacity to provide enough electricity to power 718,000 homes. So why the filing from the Trump administration, you ask?

That filing states that US Wind’s project could create issues with search and rescue operations and commercial fisheries. If that sounds like a stretch to you, you are not alone. Several key players in the energy sector have come out to state their disapproval with the court filing by the Trump administration, claiming the only reason the current administration made the filing was because the project gained approval from the Biden administration.

The action was filed in the US District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore, and the Trump administration has been hard at work trying to find a feasible reason for asking the court to cease the approval process. The filing stated that the previous administration misinterpreted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which enabled the government to manage several key projects in federal waters across the country.

US Wind fights back against the recent action taken by the Trump administration

US Wind is not going to sit by and watch one of its most promising projects being taken away by the Trump administration, and has filed motions to dismiss parts of the suit and requested extensions for responses to the amended complaint.

“Political pressure was applied to the Federal Defendants’ decisionmakers, and the pressure caused those decisionmakers to rely on improper factors,” U.S. Wind alleged in the filing.

The company has claimed that the suit is a part of the Trump administration’s coordinated efforts to repeal any and all projects set up during the previous administration. U.S. Wind received approval to begin construction for the Maryland project in December 2024 and took pride in the fact that the project was the 10th commercial-scale wind project approved in the U.S. The evidence suggests that Trump has a personal vendetta against large wind farms.

The suit has local politicians split as to whether this is the right move for the energy sector in the United States. In August of this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced it was pulling $679 million from offshore wind projects nationwide. Maryland House Republicans praised the administration’s decision to revoke the permit and stated the project was “a bad idea that was never going to come to fruition.”

It’s precisely the kind of forward-thinking approach labor needs to take on industrial policy.
Public projects can be financed over a longer term and better withstand the volatility of national energy policy than strictly private alternatives.
Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table.","A consensus is emerging across the political spectrum around the need for industrial policy. Whether in the form of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act under Joe Biden in 2022 or the haphazard tariff policy of Donald Trump implemented earlier this year, political leaders on both sides of the aisle are clearly searching for answers regarding how to revive the United States’s flagging manufacturing base.

While the Trump administration places a lot of rhetorical emphasis on bringing back industrial jobs, its policies so far have displayed a profound lack of seriousness or coherence. Trump’s tariffs have not been focused on strategic industries or paired with the investment and planning required to make jobs actually materialize. Attacks on agencies like the Department of Energy will make it difficult to build out even those energy sources that Trump claims to favor, like nuclear.

At the same time, the “abundance” debate, kicked off by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book of the same name, has drawn additional attention to the need for increased state capacity to make things and deliver improvements for ordinary people. This, the book’s authors argue, is the way to revive both the American economy and the Democratic Party. The discussion, fraught and flawed as it is, has captured the attention and imagination of liberals who don’t usually make a habit of thinking about industrial policy.

But there’s one constituency whose voice is missing and sorely needed in that debate: industrial workers and their unions. A new report from the United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 6 titled “Organize, Industrialize, Decarbonize: A Pro-Worker, Green Industrial Policy for California” takes up the challenge, providing a compelling example of how labor can weigh in on the reindustrialization conversation.

The report presents a vision for how the state can deploy a range of industrial policy tools to expand clean energy industries like offshore wind, electric vehicle batteries, and heat pumps. The same strategies would ensure that jobs created in this build-out become high-quality union careers. It’s precisely the kind of forward-thinking approach labor needs to take on industrial policy.

Trump’s return to office has effectively killed the momentum behind pro-labor clean energy investment that built up under Biden. Even while the current administration has expressed support for nuclear and geothermal development, its lack of appetite for competent state capacity throws serious doubt on its ability to follow through on a build-out.

In this bleak federal context, states can partner with trade unions to lead on industrial policies that show how a clean energy transition can create good jobs. The more progress is made on forming these coalitions now, the better positioned they’ll be when a more favorable national political climate emerges.

The Industrial Policy Tool Kit

The UAW Region 6 report begins by outlining the dilemmas that presently make carrying out a clean energy transition so challenging, especially if left up to private industry and markets. While working-class families are already reeling from inflation, private utilities are paying for climate investments by raising rates for consumers. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry remains a rare source of good blue-collar union jobs, and workers are rightfully concerned about their disappearance.

But the UAW believes that California’s rich research ecosystem and advanced manufacturing experience puts it in a strong position to be able to build out clean energy technologies. The report helpfully breaks down a range of industrial policy tools, from public procurement to enabling institutions, that the state can employ to favor union labor.

California already uses many of these tools successfully in different contexts. For example, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority has a public procurement provision that gives preference to bidders who create jobs within the county. The PowerForward ZEV Battery Manufacturing grant program incentivizes grant recipients to enter a card check neutrality agreement, have a collective bargaining agreement, and offer comprehensive benefits to their workers.

Enabling institutions, a designation that refers to government entities that carry out research and coordination between public and private institutions, are on the more ambitious side of the policy menu. These represent the building of actual state capacity instead of mere regulation. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is an example of such an enabling institution and played a crucial role in crafting Japan’s postwar economic boom.

UAW Region 6 is focusing its legislative campaigning on Senate Bill 787, which would create a state-level enabling institution in California to facilitate the growth of zero-emission vehicles and batteries (ZEVs), offshore wind, and heat pump manufacturing. It would require state agencies to coordinate funding in line with the goals of supply chain development and energy affordability.

A Pro-Worker Abundance

California contains the natural wealth to make this vision possible. The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has estimated that up to eighteen million metric tons of lithium exist in the state’s Salton Sea Region in the Imperial Valley. This is enough to build 375 million EV batteries. The report advocates expanding EV battery recycling capacity in order to create a fully self-sufficient supply chain.

Two hundred gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind potential exists off California’s coast, and the state already has the highest density of non-aircraft turbine manufacturing in the country. Just last year, voters approved a bond measure that earmarked $475 million for offshore wind port infrastructure. The UAW believes these conditions make the industry ripe for expansion in the state with the right level of planning. The report recommends that California seek to round out the supply chain by also producing component parts like generators, cells, and power converters.

With the Trump administration launching an all-out attack on offshore wind, it’s even more important for states like California to develop their own capacities to build out the industry and integrate the supply chain. Public projects can be financed over a longer term and better withstand the volatility of national energy policy than strictly private alternatives. For example, Golden State Wind is a joint venture between Ocean Winds and Reventus Power, which is owned by the national public pension plan in Canada. They plan to deploy 2 GW of wind capacity in the state.

Heat pumps are HVAC systems that use electricity instead of gas to heat and cool buildings. They get less attention as a clean energy technology, but they will play a vital role in reducing building emissions. Demand for heat pumps is projected to grow, and California has set a goal of six million installations over the next five years. UAW Region 6 argues that this is a perfect opportunity to use public procurement to create local, unionized employment.

Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table. While other important clean energy sources like nuclear power and geothermal are left out, the policy proposals play to California’s natural strengths and build on already existing successful initiatives.

Many on the Left have wholly dismissed the abundance concept as repackaged neoliberalism. But others have begun to thoughtfully argue that a chief concern of the Left should be increased state capacity to create good jobs and deliver improved lives. If we don’t offer a compelling vision for how to do this, others will.

The authors of the UAW report conclude by stating that they “wholeheartedly agree with authors Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein” on the need for “increased state capacity, empowered public authorities, and investments in innovation.” The UAW’s fight for SB 707 could be an important first step towards a pro-union abundance agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20114054/uaw-green.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:03:56.716048

The European Union has taken another major step towards cleaner skies with the announcement of €945 million in funding for a new wave of research and demonstration projects under its Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking.

Approved on 9 September, the investment will support 12 projects that promise to push the boundaries of propulsion, systems, and aircraft design.

This third call for proposals represents the largest single package to date under the Clean Aviation programme, which falls within Horizon Europe. It is designed to accelerate the development of next-generation regional and short-medium range aircraft capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% compared with 2020 technology.

Work on the projects is due to start at the beginning of 2026, with first flight tests expected in the 2028–2029 timeframe. By laying the groundwork for new aircraft entering service around 2035, the initiative is a central pillar of Europe’s aviation decarbonisation roadmap.

The €945 million pot combines EU grants with industry contributions and in-kind support. It has been divided between large demonstration programmes for regional and short-medium range aircraft, a set of “Fast Track” enabler projects, and transversal studies into aircraft concept integration and environmental impact.

“The results of Call 3 show the variety of innovative technological concepts to boost the entry-into-service of highly efficient aircraft by 2035,” says Axel Krein, Executive Director of the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking. “These projects have high potential to make major advancements towards climate neutrality and sustainability.”

Collectively, the 12 winners represent a blend of established OEMs, engine makers, electrical specialists, and smaller innovators, all aligned behind the EU’s climate ambitions.

The EU Clean Aviation chosen dozen

TAKE OFF

Led by Safran Aircraft Engines, TAKE OFF – Technology And Knowledge for European Open Fan Flight – will push forward open fan architecture engines. This disruptive engine design promises significant improvements in propulsive efficiency and is one of the most visible bets on how the next generation of single-aisle aircraft might take shape.

LEIA

Airbus Operations GmbH is coordinating LEIA, the Large scalE Integration demonstrator of hybrid electrical Architecture. The programme will explore how large-scale hybrid-electric power architectures can be integrated into commercial aircraft, bringing together multiple propulsion and energy systems in a single demonstrator.

UNIFIED

Rolls-Royce plc is taking forward UNIFIED, or Ultra Novel and Innovative Fully Integrated Engine Demonstrations. The project will develop and integrate advanced propulsion technologies into a next-generation powerplant concept, paving the way for more efficient and lower-emission short-medium range aircraft.

PHARES

PHARES – Powerplant Hybrid Application for Regional Segment – is coordinated by Pratt & Whitney Canada. It combines a turboprop engine derived from the PW127XT with a powerful electric motor and optimised gearbox. The ambition is to cut regional aircraft fuel burn by around 20%, with a consortium that also includes ATR and Collins Aerospace.

DEMETRA

ATR leads DEMETRA, the Demonstrator of an Electrified Modern Efficient Transport Regional Aircraft. The project will create a flight demonstrator as part of ATR’s broader Evo programme, advancing its ambition to deliver hybrid-electric aircraft to the market in the next decade.

OSYRYS

Safran Electrical & Power is behind OSYRYS – On-board SYstems Relevant for hYbridization of Regional aircraftS. The project will focus on developing and testing the electrical systems required to make hybridisation feasible on regional aircraft, from power distribution to thermal management.

CRYOSTAR

CRYOSTAR, led by the Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, will concentrate on the certification roadmap for cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks. By investigating crashworthiness and safety methodologies, it aims to clear a critical regulatory hurdle for hydrogen-powered aviation.

MODABAT

Germany’s Fraunhofer Gesellschaft will run MODABAT – Modular, scalable and technology-Open Design for future Aviation BATteries. This fast-track project will look at ways of designing modular and scalable battery systems that can be adapted for different aviation applications.

POWER4AIR

Spanish SME Skylife Engineering leads POWER4AIR, which targets the challenges of arc fault detection, electromagnetic interference and reliability in high-voltage power electronics. These are essential elements for making electric and hybrid-electric propulsion safe and certifiable.

LIME

French start-up Ascendance Flight Technologies will coordinate LIME – Lithium based Innovation for Modular Energy. The project is expected to explore lithium-based modular energy systems that can be scaled and integrated into aircraft designs.

HERACLES

HERACLES – Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft Concept for Low EmissionS – is another ATR-led project. Unlike DEMETRA, which is demonstrator-focused, HERACLES will concentrate on conceptual design and environmental assessment of hybrid-electric regional aircraft, providing the analytical foundation for future models.

ACI&I

Finally, Airbus is also responsible for ACI&I, or Short Medium Range – Aircraft Configuration Integration and Impact. This project will examine how various new propulsion and airframe technologies integrate in short- to medium-range aircraft, evaluating the performance and environmental impact of different configurations.

What happens next

Although the projects have been selected, their official launch depends on finalising grant agreements, expected by the end of 2025. Work will formally begin in early 2026, with development efforts running into the latter part of the decade.

The most ambitious undertakings, including PHARES, DEMETRA and TAKE OFF, are aiming for flight testing between 2028 and 2029.

The road ahead is steep. Hybrid-electric propulsion introduces complex systems integration and certification questions, hydrogen storage requires entirely new safety standards, and advanced batteries must meet aviation’s uncompromising performance and reliability demands. By pooling public funding, industrial expertise and fresh thinking from smaller players, Clean Aviation hopes to overcome these hurdles.

If the programme delivers on its ambitions, Europe could see the first genuinely climate-friendly regional and short-medium range aircraft entering service by 2035. That would not only bring the sector closer to its net-zero targets but also help secure Europe’s place at the forefront of global aerospace innovation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/plane-flight-sky-travel-aircraft-sunset-1575625-pxhere.com_.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:04:00.778600

As national delegations, activists and other attendees struggle to find affordable places to stay by November, with some deciding not to go at all, Tilvawala, who lives in London, has spent hours working from afar to find lodging in Belem, negotiate prices and contracts and put down deposits. She did all that to create a housing portal specifically for young people who want to be part of the international conference. If not enough people sign up for the housing she’s secured, she might lose some of what she’s put down.

“There’s always a huge number of fossil fuel company representatives there. And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

raises a critical question: Is the company's stock undervalued relative to its growth potential?

Financial Resilience Amid Transition

NRG's Q2 2025 financial results underscore its operational resilience. Despite a GAAP net loss of $104 million, the company reported Adjusted Net Income of $339 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $909 million, reaffirming its 2025 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA ($3.875–$4.025 billion) and Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments (FCFbG) of $2.1–$2.25 billion NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results and Reaffirms 2025 Financial Guidance[ 1 ]. This performance reflects NRG's ability to balance near-term challenges—such as market volatility and operational costs—with long-term strategic gains.

The company's capital allocation strategy further strengthens its financial profile. Through $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $345 million in dividends in 2025,

As of July 31, 2025, it had already repurchased $768 million in shares and distributed $173 million in dividends NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results and Reaffirms 2025 Financial Guidance[ 1 ]. This dual focus on returns and reinvestment positions NRG to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the energy transition.

Strategic Moves in Renewables and Grid Services

NRG's most transformative initiative is the $12 billion acquisition of LS Power's generation portfolio, which nearly doubled its capacity to 50 GW and diversified its energy mix with wind, solar, and storage assets NRG Energy: Strategic Capacity Doubling & Emerging Market Focus[ 2 ].

Additionally, its $150 million annual investment in smart home solutions—such as thermostats and demand response programs—is expected to contribute 3–5% of total retail revenue by 2028 NRG Energy: Strategic Capacity Doubling & Emerging Market Focus[ 2 ]. These initiatives not only diversify revenue streams but also position NRG as a critical infrastructure provider for a decarbonizing economy.

Valuation Metrics: Undervalued or Overpriced?

NRG's valuation metrics present a nuanced picture. The stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 74.86 and a forward P/E of 20.95, significantly higher than the U.S. renewable energy industry's average P/E of 41.4x U.S. Renewable Energy Industry Analysis - Simply Wall St[ 4 ]. Meanwhile, its EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.92 exceeds the sector's 11.1x average Key Valuation Multiples in Renewable Energy Deals[ 5 ]. At first glance, these multiples suggest the stock is overvalued. However, analysts argue that NRG's growth trajectory justifies the premium.

A consensus of 20 analyst estimates, as of September 2025, assigns a 12-month price target of $173.06—7.03% above the current price of $164.36—with a “Strong Buy” rating NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) Stock Valuation, Peer Comparison[ 6 ]. The wide range of targets ($92–$203) reflects diverging views on macroeconomic risks, such as interest rate volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Yet, NRG's 5-year EPS growth forecast of 21.02% and its recent guidance raises (e.g., $100 million midpoint increase in Adjusted Net Income) suggest strong earnings momentum NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) Stock Valuation, Peer Comparison[ 6 ].

Industry Context and Risks

The broader renewable energy sector has seen valuation normalization since 2020, with EV/EBITDA multiples declining from 18.2x to 11.1x Key Valuation Multiples in Renewable Energy Deals[ 5 ]. This trend reflects higher capital costs and policy shifts, such as the Trump administration's reversal of Biden-era clean energy incentives. However, NRG's diversified portfolio—spanning generation, storage, and grid services—offers resilience against sector-specific headwinds.

Key risks include its debt-to-equity ratio of 4.86, which could constrain flexibility during economic downturns NRG Energy (NRG) Statistics & Valuation - Stock Analysis[ 7 ]. Additionally, the success of its data center contracts and VPP initiatives hinges on execution risks, such as permitting delays or technological bottlenecks.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Bet

NRG Energy's strategic pivot to renewables and energy services positions it to capitalize on the U.S. energy transition's structural tailwinds.

There is a vast farmland here in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), with each farmer specializing in crops they’ve been growing and harvesting for generations. Whether its leafy greens, exotic fruits, sweet corn, green beans, sugarcane or rice, there is one thing all farmers in the EAA share in common — our commitment to being mindful stewards of the land and water.

Last month, the South Florida Water Management District announced EAA farmers this year achieved a 62% annual phosphorus reduction, which is more than double the 25% reduction required under Florida’s 1996 Everglades Forever Act.

EAA farmers are among the most regulated in the country. With the EAA being one of the most fertile farmlands in the United States, farmers make sure to treat the land and water with great care so it stays this way. We want to protect our way of life and preserve family legacies for generations to come.

Since the program began three decades ago, EAA farmers’ clean water efforts have averaged a 57% annual reduction. We accomplish this by implementing best management practices (BMPs) and cutting-edge innovation to promote healthier water and soil.

On our farm in Belle Glade, we have worked to feed our family, local community and customers around the country for over 40 years. We grow a variety of wholesome foods including sweet corn, rice, lettuce and other leafy greens, including parsley and cilantro.

We practice sustainability every day at our farm. We’ve integrated a number of practices, including employing a balanced crop rotation program, which is a foundational piece of the BMP program, along with soil preservation techniques such as sediment control to promote regenerative soil, and regular soil testing to ensure nutritional inputs are appropriate for our crops. To preserve water quality and minimize water use, we use strategies such as ditch bank stabilization, land leveling, and water retention systems to capture and reuse rainfall effectively.

I believe that when food is grown with real dedication, care and a commitment to the land, you can taste the difference.

EAA farmers are proud to celebrate this milestone, demonstrating a 30-year commitment to sustainability, which has resulted in the removal of thousands of metric tons of phosphorus in the water since the program began.

We look forward to extending this commitment to our soil, our water and our land, for many decades to come.

As tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google race to build energy-hungry data centers, utilities are saying that the billions needed for new power plants and grid upgrades could drive up bills for residents and small businesses.

What's happening?

Driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, the number of massive data centers across the country is soaring. These facilities now consume more than 4% of the nation's electricity, with analysts warning that figure could triple to 12% in just three years.

To keep pace, utilities are being asked to spend billions on new power plants and grid upgrades. Those costs are traditionally passed on to everyone, meaning residents and small businesses could see higher bills even if they aren't using more energy, according to a report from The New York Times. In Ohio, households are already paying about $15 more per month because of data centers.

Why are data centers concerning?

Nationally, electricity rates for residents have already jumped more than 30% since 2020, and experts say data center demand could supercharge those increases. A joint study from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State projects that average household power bills could rise by another 8% by 2030 — and even more than 25% in states like Virginia, where data centers are proliferating.

Regulators warn that utilities are being pushed into ""extremely new territory,"" with projects being greenlit faster and on a larger scale than ever before. Consumer advocates are worried that homes and small businesses will be stuck paying for Big Tech's massive expansion. ""Our wallets cannot be strained anymore,"" wrote one resident to state regulators, per the Times. ""Make them pay their own bills like we do!""

What's being done to protect everyday consumers?

Some regulators are pushing back. Ohio recently ruled unanimously against a proposal from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that would have shifted more costs onto regular folks, instead requiring data centers to cover a larger share of their own expenses. Similar debates are underway in Virginia and other states where data centers have multiplied.

At the same time, companies like Amazon argue they are investing in renewable power and efficiency, including electric delivery vans and wind and solar farms. Still, those efforts may be overshadowed by the immense energy demand.

For consumers, watchdog groups recommend staying engaged with local authorities and supporting policies that ensure large corporate users pay their fair share. On a personal level, adopting energy-efficiency upgrades at home could help offset rising costs. Even so, the larger battle will depend on whether regulators hold Big Tech accountable for the true cost of its growth.

Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters.
HERCULEAN TASK Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable.
Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan's vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres.
But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".","GOTO, Japan: Close to a small fishing port in southwestern Japan, the slim white turbines of the country's first commercial-scale floating wind farm glimmer offshore, months before a key project in Tokyo's green-energy strategy begins.

Still heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels, Japan has declared offshore wind energy a ""trump card"" in its drive to make renewables its top power source by 2040, and reach carbon neutrality a decade later.

That's despite rising project costs and fears over inadequate infrastructure to produce turbines en masse.

Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters.

""Floating structures are relatively stable even in the case of earthquakes or typhoons,"" said Kei Ushigami, head of marine renewable energy for construction company Toda, a key player in the project.

The eight turbines, sitting 5km off the coast of the Goto Islands in waters up to 140m deep, will officially start turning in January.

It's hoped they'll aid the archipelago in reaching ambitious new targets laid out this year that should see wind's contribution to the energy mix soar to between four and eight per cent by 2040, up from around one per cent today.

But it's a long, hard road ahead for resource-scarce Japan - the world's fifth-largest carbon dioxide emitter - to wean itself off fossil fuels.

In 2024, 65 percent of its electricity needs were met by coal and hydrocarbon-powered thermal plants, while just over a quarter came from renewables, according to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies.

HERCULEAN TASK

Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable.

Other project operators have asked for better support from the government.

""It is important for the government to address shortcomings in the current bidding system, which failed to anticipate rapid global inflation after bids were awarded,"" said Yoko Mulholland from the think tank E3G.

The streamlining of regulatory processes and easing construction restrictions would ""shorten lead times and also lower capital expenditure"", she told AFP.

Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan's vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres.

The task, however, appears Herculean: to meet the 2040 wind target, around 200 15-megawatt turbines a year need to go up.

But ""the infrastructure is not yet in place"", warned Yonekura. ""Japan lacks turbine manufacturers and large production sites.""

FISHERS' LIVELIHOODS

Construction companies also face technical challenges with these still-novel systems: defects discovered in the floating structure of a wind turbine at Goto meant Toda had to make replacements, delaying the project by two years.

Coexistence with local industries, especially fishing, is also crucial.

Toda said it had conducted an environmental assessment and found a pilot project had ""no negative impact on fish"".

Fishermen also receive part of the revenue from electricity sales and some of the property taxes generated by the project, while some have been hired to monitor the construction site with their vessels.

But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".

Nevertheless, ""fishermen understand the importance of such a project for Japan"", he said.

The National Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Associations protested to the government after Mitsubishi withdrew, reminding them that fishermen had worked with these projects, hoping for positive economic impacts.

As fishing becomes less viable owing to warming sea temperatures, ""some hope their children or grandchildren will find jobs in wind turbine maintenance"", said Eashiro.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--0i4eQ_EP--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/09/21/000_68xh3x3.jpg?itok=N8haSEgM",N,,2025-09-21 10:59:11.574696

Key Takeaway Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger.","A Nuclear Surge Ignites Investor Frenzy

On Friday, shares of Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) and NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) blasted over 20% higher, electrified by the U.S.-U.K. Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, signed ahead of President Trump’s recent London visit.

This game-changing deal aligns the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the U.K.’s regulator, reducing SMR licensing timelines from about three to four years to roughly two years. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright — a former fossil fuels executive — called it a “nuclear renaissance” and plans similar pacts with Poland, Romania, and others to power AI data centers and end Russian nuclear material reliance by 2028.

The agreement unlocks billions of dollars for SMR projects, like U.K. data centers in Nottinghamshire. With Oklo skyrocketing 537% year-to-date and NuScale up 160% in 2025, investors are wondering if these nuclear stocks are still a buy, or has the uranium train left the station?

Oklo (OKLO)

Oklo is a Santa Clara startup founded in 2013 by MIT alumni Jacob and Caroline DeWitte that is redefining nuclear power with its Aurora microreactors. These 15 to 50 megawatt electrical (MWe) fast-fission units — that are scalable to 100 MWe — run on recycled nuclear waste, offering meltdown-proof safety, passive cooling, and a 10-year fuel cycle.

Targeting off-grid clients such as data centers, military bases, and remote communities, Oklo sells power via long-term contracts, not reactors, and produces radioisotopes as a bonus. Backed by Sam Altman, Oklo has secured strategic partnerships with companies like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) for data center power and is prepping a 2027 debut in Idaho.

The U.S.-U.K. deal easing licensing requirements sparked Friday’s 28.8% surge to $135.23 per share by promising faster Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval — Oklo was denied a combined license for its Aurora microreactor in 2022 — and European pilots. Oklo’s 537% YTD gain reflects AI energy demand, its February Atomic Alchemy acquisition for isotope tech, and Trump’s May executive orders to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Yet, because Oklo is pre-revenue with a $30.7 million cash burn against guidance for $65 million to $80 million in annual cash use, Oklo’s $20 billion market valuation is a bet on execution. Because it is trading on its potential rather than operational performance, it is best-suited for risk-tolerant investors. Dips below $100 per share could yield 50% to 100% upside if global SMR deals materialize, but expect a volatile ride getting there.

NuScale Power (SMR)

NuScale Power leads the SMR race with its VOYGR plants that are 77 MWe modules scalable up to 924 MWe per plant. As the only NRC-certified SMR design since 2022, NuScale’s factory-built approach cuts costs for utilities, industrials, and hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google.

NuScale’s compact reactors are just 65 feet tall and use simplified pressurized water systems, reducing construction timelines and risks compared to traditional plants. Its 2025 wins include Romania’s Doicesti plant, where it will help deliver 462 MW of installed capacity, a 6 gigawatt (GW) Tennessee Valley Authority deal, partnering with ENTRA1 to commercialize its SMR technology inside ENTRA1’s power plants, and talks for a Polish project by 2029.

The U.S.-U.K. pact drove Friday’s 22% jump to $46.77 per share, bringing it within 12% of its all-time high of $53.50 per share hit in July. Its 160% YTD surge ties to revenue in Q2 that surged to $8.1 million from $1 million a year ago, DOE’s $400 million SMR funding, and AI hype.

Because NuScale is the only NRC-certified SMR operator and has a global pipeline, it provides the nuclear stock with a wide competitive moat, making SMR a strong buy. At almost $47 per share, it’s undervalued with 30% to 50% upside on international deployments, meaning you haven’t missed out on the opportunity to have your portfolio radiate stellar gains.

Key Takeaway

Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger. Supply chain risks and fuel costs linger, but Secretary Wright’s global push signals a trillion-dollar SMR market. These stocks still have room to glow for bold investors.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OKLO-Reactor.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:32.293276

The Japanese manufacturer will produce two new electric vehicle models in the country. This move aims to reduce costs and avoid the effects of tariffs.

This move takes place in a context of trade tensions. Donald Trump's policies imposed a 25% tax on cars manufactured abroad. Now Toyota is speeding up the production transition within the United States.

Two new electric vehicles will be manufactured in the United States

The stars of this announcement will be the electric versions of the RAV4 and Land Cruiser. Both models are brand benchmarks and will have three rows of seats, reinforcing their profile as family vehicles. The strategy aims to keep the essence of the best-selling SUVs, but with a sustainable focus.

The production of these models will be concentrated at the Georgetown, Kentucky plant. In addition, Toyota is strategically reorganizing its capacity at the Kentucky and Indiana plants. This opens the door to more future announcements about new vehicles manufactured in the United States.

The decision also secures jobs in Kentucky. The factory had lost workload after the next-generation Lexus ES returned to Japan in 2021. With these new models, Toyota strengthens its commitment to local employment and to an increasingly competitive market.

A direct response to tariffs

The strategy is part of a broader move among manufacturers. The Trump administration imposed tariffs with the intention of forcing brands to produce on U.S. soil. General Motors, Honda, and BMW had already announced similar plans to strengthen their domestic manufacturing.

Those who didn't adapt passed the costs on to consumers. In fact, Ford raised prices by two thousand euros on vehicles produced in Mexico. Meanwhile, Volkswagen and Subaru also applied considerable percentage increases to several of their models.

The effect on the market has multiplied. Used car prices remain high after the semiconductor crisis between 2020 and 2023. The shortage of new models reduced the supply of second-hand vehicles and raised repair costs, with an 8.5% (8.5%) increase in September.

Consumers bear the bill

Analysts warn that tariffs will keep pushing prices up. Michael DeLong, from the U.S. Consumers Federation, pointed out that the taxes don't benefit the buyer. According to him, costs are rising in all segments, including cars imported by individuals.

There is no shortage of examples. An Arizona resident had to pay six thousand euros just to re-enter the country with his own car. In addition, insurers project a nationwide increase of at least 8% in premiums for 2025, reaching up to 13% in some states.

In this context, Toyota's strategy is not only industrial but also competitive. The brand avoids price increases on its electric SUVs and strengthens its presence in the United States. The move aims to secure customers who increasingly value cost stability in a volatile market.",https://estoesatleti.es/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/toyota-coche-estados-unidos_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-09-21 10:59:50.279020

The collaboration establishes ElectricFish as a charge point operator on Emobi’s platform, positioning Emobi as the digital backbone for public chargers and fleet depots. ElectricFish’s technology delivers fast charging without requiring expensive grid upgrades, it said.

Emobi and ElectricFish Partnership Combines Speed, Compatibility

The partnership merges Emobi’s patented JustPlug technology with ElectricFish’s microgrid-scale energy storage and fast charging systems. Together, they address two of the biggest barriers to EV adoption — charging speed and grid infrastructure limitations.

Emobi’s JustPlug technology enables 80% of existing EVs and chargers—lacking native Plug & Charge features—to access seamless automatic charging. It also strengthens security with encryption and certificate authentication.

ElectricFish’s 350Squared system delivers 133% faster charging than traditional hardware while reducing grid upgrade costs by up to 90% through advanced power electronics and battery integration.

Traditional EV charger installations often face delays of up to two years and costs exceeding $100,000 due to required grid upgrades. The Emobi and ElectricFish partnership removes these barriers by enabling grid-independent fast charging. Operators gain interoperability, enhanced security, and the ability to offer Plug & Charge capabilities without costly hardware replacement, the companies said.

Leaders Emphasize the Future of EV Charging

“This partnership exemplifies our commitment to future-proofing EV infrastructure as we expand beyond public charging into fleet charging depots,” said Lin Sun Fa, CEO of Emobi. “ElectricFish’s approach to solving grid constraints complements our JustPlug technology’s ability to eliminate compatibility barriers across both public and fleet use cases.

So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

""There is still time, but the clock is ticking,"" said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

WHAT ARE THESE TAX INCENTIVES?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

WHEN ARE THE CREDITS EXPIRING?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that ""as soon as you hear this message.""

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. ""You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,"" she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

WHAT SHOULD I PRIORITIZE FOR MY HOME?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

""That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,"" she said. ""Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.""

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

""We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn't mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,"" Pierce said.

""Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that's quick,"" said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. ""You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it's even possible.""

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

WHAT IF TAX CREDITS EXCEED WHAT I OWE?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects -- think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage -- could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

But those focused on permitting reform bear similarities to AI bills introduced by Republicans.
Vitali adds there's also little to no activity in the House grappling with any climate or environmental harms directly generated by AI data center development.
The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.","When Pennsylvania state Sen. Katie Muth toured a small data center in her suburban Philadelphia district this May, she was mostly impressed by what she found. It was quiet and impeccably clean–a largely unintrusive presence even in a wealthy enclave where some of the closest neighbors live in million-dollar homes. But in one corner of the facility, Muth found the source of growing concern in the state.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

""The engineer that worked there showed us this cabinet farm that was kind of lightly shaking. It was very warm,"" Muth said. ""And he said it was an AI cabinet farm and that at certain times of the day, this sucker is just revving up.""

The copious amounts of power such AI servers require are already driving up energy bills for consumers in the state. Since her visit, Muth has announced plans to introduce the ""Pennsylvania Ratepayer Protection Act,"" just one of at least a dozen proposed or planned bills in Pennsylvania's legislature addressing the hottest industrial issue in the commonwealth.

Some of the bills aim to further ramp up data center development by modifying permitting and zoning procedures. Other legislation, including a package of bills under the banner of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's ""Lightning Plan,"" seeks to combine permitting reform with policies focused on clean energy and consumer costs.

Whether any of them will find their way through the morass of Pennsylvania's divided government remains to be seen.

Proponents of AI development view the technology's arrival as the dawn of a new industrial era in this resource-rich state, following booms of iron, coal, natural gas and, more recently, e-commerce warehouses. Speaking at a Pennsylvania Senate hearing in August, Merle Madrid, senior manager of public policy for Amazon Web Services, said his company's $20 billion investment in the state would create at least 1,250 new ""high-skilled"" jobs, support thousands of others and provide other benefits to host communities.

""Our investment in the commonwealth isn't just financial, it's also in the people and future of Pennsylvania,"" Madrid said.

Others–such as John Quigley, a former secretary of the state's Department of Environmental Protection and now senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania–view likening AI to major industries of the past as a cautionary tale. The state has a long legacy of unresolved industrial pollution, and some of the economic promises have fallen short.

""Pennsylvania's history is, we roll out the red carpet for every industry, regardless of whether its impacts are known or unknown,"" Quigley said. ""Then we find out later we made a mistake. … I don't see too much indication we're not on the same track.""

Muth is most interested in addressing the state's swiftly rising energy costs, a dynamic playing out across a 13-state territory overseen by electric grid operator PJM Interconnection. Stretching from Chicago to Jersey to eastern North Carolina, it's the nation's largest grid and includes all of Virginia and Pennsylvania, which consulting firm Wood Mackenzie ranks second and third among all states for announced data center development.

On June 1, many Pennsylvanians saw their electricity rates increase between 5 and 12 percent–and some as much as 40 percent–according to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. And more is on the way. Each year, PJM holds ""capacity auctions"" for energy generation, which influence consumer costs by effectively balancing electricity supply against projected demand. Quigley notes that this summer's auction was a record-setting $16 billion, more than seven times the total from just two years ago.

PJM predicts the latest auction will cause energy bills to rise by another 1.5 to 5 percent next year. While the organization says costs are increasing for several reasons, including electrification and regular economic growth, its independent market monitor cites data centers as the primary and ""unprecedented"" cause, accounting for about $9.3 billion of this year's prices.

Muth's upcoming legislation is focused on yet another factor in costs: transmission. New industrial facilities that use copious amounts of electricity, like data centers, often require new power lines and other energy infrastructure to operate. In Pennsylvania, that's the domain of transmission companies like PECO and PPL, which pass along the costs of building new distribution lines to customers.

Muth said her bill is modeled on existing policies in Oregon that require ""high-load"" customers to fully cover the costs of infrastructure created for their benefit.

""I think the general public, all party affiliations, don't want to pay these increased utility bills. They can't afford them,"" Muth said. ""I can remember my own grandmother saying, 'I don't want to turn on the air conditioner because I don't want my electricity bill to go up.' And I hate to think that people have to make those decisions and sit there and suffer.""

But garnering the support of her colleagues will likely prove difficult. The state's politics are increasingly acrimonious: The Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-occupied House and governor's office have butted heads, most recently over a state budget that is now more than two months overdue. Some in the state capital of Harrisburg, such as Elizabeth Marx, executive director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, doubt there's much room for compromise.

""I do not see the Pennsylvania General Assembly breaking gridlock on any energy issues anytime soon,"" Marx said. ""While there are some common threads of agreement that we need to protect consumers from increased rates as a result of data centers, there is not agreement on the 'how.'""

Still, others say AI-related legislation is important to track, as it shapes the policy landscape in which a future deal may be forged. And some kind of action may become unavoidable as consumer costs–and anger–rises, said Katie Blume, political and legislative director of the nonprofit advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.

""We need to socialize these ideas with the legislature, with the public, and we need to make sure that people are brought into conversations who are going to be impacted by these things,"" Blume said. ""And I think the Senate Republicans who always say, 'We don't want to do anything on energy right now,' are going to be in between a rock and a hard place before too long.""

Power Plays

On the surface, there does appear to be at least some common ground among Pennsylvania lawmakers on AI data center development: getting more of it.

In Pittsburgh in early July, U.S. Senator Dave McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, convened an Energy and Innovation Summit that drew both President Donald Trump and Shapiro. All three expressed excitement over what McCormick says is more than $90 billion in investments announced by tech companies in the state.

The legislature has previously found its way to a deal in the space. In 2021, a tax bill that included a measure to strengthen an existing tax credit for purchasing servers and other equipment for large data centers in the state passed with wide bipartisan support. The incentive currently costs the state about $43 million in tax revenue a year, and Shapiro's office projects it will eclipse $50 million annually by the end of the decade. But politicians, including Shapiro himself, have cited it as key to growing the industry in the state, with a spokesperson for the governor telling Spotlight PA that it will ""generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenue for state and local governments.""

Shapiro's Lightning Plan is a package of six bills that, altogether, seek to create a new ""streamlined"" permitting process for key energy projects, create new tax incentives for diverse energy sources, create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, bolster renewable energy and attempt to address energy costs in rural and low-income communities. Although the package does not directly address the buildout of AI data centers, it focuses on spurring new energy generation needed by the power-hungry sector and is similar to some other bills specifically addressing AI.

Many of the Lightning Plan measures, such as the carbon program, are supported by Democratic rank-and-file members seeking effective climate policy. But those focused on permitting reform bear similarities to AI bills introduced by Republicans. Senate Bill 939, introduced by Republican state Sen. Greg Rothman with at least one Democratic co-sponsor, proposes creating a ""Commonwealth Opportunity Zone"" that would create a fast-track permitting process for data centers, as well as a ""regulatory sandbox"" encouraging deregulation.

""This innovative, collaborative framework will enable industry leaders to work directly with state agencies to identify and remove unnecessary and outdated regulations, thereby streamlining the development process and accelerating innovation,"" Rothman's office, which did not respond to inquiries from Inside Climate News, stated in a press release announcing the proposal.

A Republican colleague in the House, Rep. Jason Ortitay, introduced a bill to create a ""Keystone Artificial Intelligence Authority"" to similarly ""streamline and coordinate"" permitting through a new, centralized process. Other Republicans say they are preparing to introduce measures also designed to accelerate data-center permitting and create new tax incentives, with some bipartisan support.

Asked to comment for this story, Shapiro's office touted a focus on permit reform, noting the governor already established an Office of Transformation and Opportunity ""as a one-stop-shop for businesses looking to grow in the Commonwealth."" In 2024, his administration also launched the PA Permit Fast Track Program, which it calls an innovative permitting system to ""expedite major economic development and infrastructure projects,"" including a data center campus in Northeast Pennsylvania.

""Governor Shapiro is laser-focused on getting stuff done and taking real action to lower Pennsylvanians' energy costs through his commonsense, all-of-the-above energy plan to build more power in the Commonwealth, create a more reliable, affordable energy grid, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come,"" his office said in a prepared statement.

Among the points of conflict: Several Harrisburg insiders say Shapiro and Republican Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman are at loggerheads on energy policy over the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program spanning 10 neighboring states. Shapiro's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, joined the program in 2022, but Pennsylvania's participation is tied up in the commonwealth's courts.

Shapiro's administration has defended the initiative in court but has floated PACER–the bill in the Lightning Plan that would create a state-run ""cap-and-invest"" program–as a preferred alternative.

Pittman's office did not respond to requests for comment. But the senator previously told Spotlight PA the pending RGGI case leaves his caucus ""very limited"" in considering energy-related legislation, a dynamic that others say remains the status quo.

A Call From Inside the House

Some of Shapiro's policies also face opposition from members of his own party, particularly RESET, another Lightning Plan bill. The legislation's primary sponsor, state Rep. Mandy Steele, says it would create a ""central cohesive authority"" to approve siting applications for large energy-generating facilities.

Muth said that opposition to the bill from some southeast Pennsylvania Democrats crystallized in June when the House Energy Committee held a hearing on the legislation. A bevy of environmental groups came out against it for fear the new state board could support new fossil fuel infrastructure while local officials objected to losing authority over siting.

The bill has the support of several Democratic committee members, labor organizations and environmental groups. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Nature Conservancy think the board will boost clean energy buildouts.

Muth says she's seen some potential Republican support percolating for the bill, which leads her to believe that deals could be coming, perhaps in next year's budget negotiations, if not in the one still ongoing.

""My fear is we're going to have this dumped into something,"" Muth said. ""It could happen tomorrow.""

Quigley, the energy expert and former DEP secretary, believes that if something does emerge from the legislature, it will likely focus primarily on deregulation and industry incentives, rather than consumer costs or environmental protection. Both the state's powerful natural gas lobby and trade unions support AI development, he notes.

""There's this rush to deregulate, to accommodate this industry that no one is prepared for,"" Quigley said.

State Rep. Greg Vitali, another Southeast Pennsylvania Democrat and chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, is also concerned environmental considerations could be overlooked in the push for more AI and energy to feed it.

He notes that both the cap-and-trade bill PACER, as well as a PRESS bill that would require more renewables to be added to the state's energy mix, have stalled even in the Democratically controlled chamber. The latter bill, he believes, has been held up after fossil fuel lobbyists convinced some House Democrats that a measure diminishing waste coal's status in the energy mix would be harmful.

Vitali adds there's also little to no activity in the House grappling with any climate or environmental harms directly generated by AI data center development. Natural gas may end up powering much of the nation's data-center growth, and many of the tech promises to the contrary are short on details.

""When the governor announces his $20 billion deal with Amazon, you don't hear any discussion of climate impacts. … It just seems to be one of the things people forget about,"" Vitali said. ""I think legislators are discouraged from talking about any issue in terms of climate because it's almost become like a poison pill in anything you want to get through the Senate.""

Quigley says history has shown that ""legislators always play catch-up"" to new industries, and believes that will be the case with AI as well.

""These data centers can potentially use millions of gallons of water a day … and nobody's raised the issue, nobody's planned for it,"" Quigley said, adding that millions of Pennsylvanians rely on groundwater wells for drinking water.

In an email, Amazon Web Services says its company is focused on efficiency and sustainability, with ongoing plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and be ""water positive"" by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses.

""Amazon is continually improving water efficiency, using advanced cloud services, such as internet of things technologies, to analyze real time water use, identify and fix leaks, and gain other efficiencies,"" the company said in its statement. ""Amazon is further improving operational efficiency to reduce cooling water use in many facilities for most of the year, instead by relying on outside air.""

Mind Your Ps and Queues

In the absence of legislative action, policies set by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and PJM could have an outsize effect.

The PUC is a quasi-independent state agency whose directors are appointed to terms by the governor. In April, the commission held a hearing about a potential ""model tariff"" on AI data center development, which Marx said could help ensure ""large load"" customers like data centers pay for any transmission costs they generate. The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.

The release of a model tariff is expected soon: PUC spokesperson Dave Hixson told Inside Climate News that the commission is drafting a proposal with a goal to issue it ""in the near future.""

Quigley adds that PJM is also taking steps to consider new policies, including measures that would require data centers to ""bring their own power"" to the grid instead of eating into existing capacity.

""So there's two positive things,"" Quigley said.

Jackson Morris, director of state power sector policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, notes that, like the Pennsylvania legislature, PJM has also been subject to criticism over gridlock. Its new power generation queue remains backed up and renewable energy projects buried. He thinks something will have to give way to the pressures of the new AI paradigm.

""You've literally got governors running for office talking about PJM capacity, market reforms. Two, three years ago, you never heard a governor say the letters PJM,"" Morris said. ""We're not living in that world anymore.""",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/AI_data_centers_PA.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:48.044597

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land.
Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple.
Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike.
""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields.","In 2023, world leaders pledged to triple global renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai. Meeting this goal will require an unprecedented buildout of renewable energy projects, both in speed and in scale. And all of those projects are going to require a whole lot of land, presenting serious challenges for land use strategies.

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land. “Utility-scale solar and wind farms require at least ten times as much space per unit of power as coal- or natural gas–fired power plants, including the land used to produce and transport the fossil fuels,” says a 2022 report from global consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Company. “Wind turbines are often placed half a mile apart, while large solar farms span thousands of acres.”

And, while the vast land tracts that these projects are targeting are undeveloped, it doesn’t mean that they are unused or unpopulated. “These developments often intersect with agricultural zones, conservation areas and Indigenous territories,” explains Renewable Energy Magazine in an article released earlier this year. Plus, the rural areas that have the most undeveloped land are often the most resistant to large-scale renewable energy projects, leading to tense political flare-ups and litigious gridlock that can keep projects tied up in court for years.

Finding land-use agreements that allow for mixed-use plots will be essential to achieving the renewable energy buildout we need without compromising agricultural production, rural livelihoods, and food security. Some farmers have rented out their land to solar developers, but this practice can be risky, with grave consequences for the topsoil. Solar farms, if they clear the land of all vegetation, can create prime conditions for erosion, making that land unsuitable for agriculture more or less permanently. “The reality is that it takes thousands of years to create an inch of fertile topsoil,” warns National Geographic, “but it can be destroyed in minutes.”

But marrying solar power and agriculture on the same land at the same time could provide a win-win for both sectors. The practice, called agrivoltaics, is not a new concept, but it hasn’t reached a commercial scale since its conception in the 1980s. Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple. “A pressing question is how AV technology can maximize crop productivity and energy generation while minimizing plant water loss and irrigation needs,” Phys.org wrote in a 2023 report. “That's a lot to ask for on a piece of land.”

But a new pilot project in Denmark seems to have cracked the code. Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike. ""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields. At the same time, the panels produce electricity in a daily pattern that better matches energy demand. It's a win-win,"" Marta Victoria, lead author of the study and Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Aarhus University, told Tech Xplore.

Critically, the solar panels only took up about 10% of the land, allowing for successful metrics from both the agricultural and the photovoltaic sides of the agrivoltaic model. The study, recently published in the scientific journal Energy Nexus, yielded excellent results in full sun as well as with conditions of some shade. ""Even with some shade, the yield per square meter is almost the same. The crops don't seem to mind the presence of solar panels and they like the wind protection that they provide,"" explains Professor Uffe Jørgensen from the Department of Agroecology.

Evans isn’t the only Coloradan participating in Problem Solvers; GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd and Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen are members of the caucus.","The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus is hoping to have lightning strike twice.

The group, which released a framework for infrastructure that eventually became law under the Biden Administration, has released a new policy plan — this time an approach to permitting reform that they think has a chance of getting through Congress.

“One of the things that we've been trying to get rolling in our group is the generation of two-party solutions on some key areas that we think are going to determine the success or failure of our country over the next decade,” said co-chair Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania. “Energy and permitting reform is at the top of that list.”

Colorado GOP Rep. Gabe Evans co-led the working group that developed the framework with California Rep. Scott Peters.

Evans said they had one goal in mind: to streamline the process to get new energy projects — from fossil fuels to renewables — up and running faster.

“We have to make sure that we can navigate our own regulatory environment to be able to build these things here in the United States with some of the best and most environmentally and socially responsible guidelines, really anywhere on the planet,” said Evans.

The framework includes five key goals, starting with cutting red tape and depoliticizing the permitting process. It also seeks to meet the nation’s fast-growing energy demand, reform NEPA requirements, set clear and enforceable permitting deadlines and strengthen domestic supply chains.

Peters noted that other legislators have been introducing bills aimed at many of these goals, including one from the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee called the SPEED Act, which reforms NEPA. “I think ultimately this probably all comes together as a big package, because everyone wants to make sure they’re covered.”

Evans added that having a framework, as opposed to lawmakers introducing specific bills, allows for “greater flexibility to be able to work with all the different stakeholder groups to make sure that we’re getting that input early, that we’re getting that buy-in earlier on.”

This approach, he added, also helps ensure there is a large coalition to support getting the permitting reform package through Congress, where it will need backing from members in both parties to garner the minimum 60 votes to pass the Senate.

The Problem Solvers Caucus pointed out that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law started out just like this.

“Started as a framework, then became a bill. Got endorsed by the group, and it was ultimately a bipartisan coalition that got it over the finish line,” said Fitzpatrick. “And our country is better for that bill. We hope this can be following in those footsteps.”

The group has an aggressive timeline. The SPEED Act could hit the House floor by the end of the year and the group is hopeful they can get a package together by then. One bill they mentioned for inclusion in the package, and that meets the guidelines of the framework, is a Senate permitting reform bill introduced in the last Congress by Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.

Among other things, that bill, the Energy Permitting Reform Act, proposed shortening timelines on litigation for projects, provided two pathways for transmission development and accelerated leasing and permitting decisions for all types of energy projects.

Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.
Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms.
So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.
The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.","Dust storms have always swirled through parts of North America, but they are becoming more unexpected and destructive and landing in places unfamiliar with the danger, scientists warn.

In May 2023, a dust storm stalled over parts of central Illinois, disorienting more than 80 motorists on Interstate 55 who crashed into each other, leaving eight people dead and 37 hospitalized. In March this year, Kansas found itself swallowed in a dusty rush of wind that covered Interstate 70, killing eight people in a 71-car pileup. A few months later, Chicago was engulfed by its first torrent of throat-choking dust since 1985. No one was injured in that May storm but visibility was near zero for hours.

In all these cases, the dustups followed a similar script. Thunderstorm winds churned up soil from plowed-open fields and carried it for a short distance. Dust billowed violently, giving people little warning. Scientists from the region are now reviewing and pursuing research to consider whether the ruptures are the start of a new normal for parts of the Midwest.

Agriculture practices have been slow to adapt or anticipate the risks of climate change and particularly droughts, some studies have shown. Dry-tilled fields, notably before spring plantings, are vulnerable to more intense seasonal winds. Kansas knows from history the wreckage of harsh and relentless gusts. A hundred years ago, parts of the Plains states lived through the disastrous Dust Bowl before agricultural irrigation and adaptations were in place.

Will this generation, across the Midwest, have to reckon with a new dust risk rooted in climate change?

Drivers of Dust

Both 2023 and 2025 storms in Illinois happened early in the growing season. In 2023, the winds swept up dust from open fields, just south of Springfield. As it moved eastward, the wind speed rose to roughly 60 mph. Nearby Interstate 55 was in its path.

Eliot Clay, director of the Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts, lives near Interstate 55. He was worried shortly before the disaster. “I remember a couple days prior noticing how much dust was in the air, like you could see it,” Clay said. “I remember thinking if this wind shifts and it goes from west to east, there is a major interstate right there. And sure enough, all of that happened a couple days later.”

Complex factors caused the Interstate 55 storm, said Jonathan Coppess, director of the Gardner Agriculture Policy Program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and former administrator of the Farm Service Agency at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A cold spring season coincided with drought, creating a lot of dust in the fields. The planting season started late and high winds descended. Then there was a bit of bad luck.

Coppess and a team of researchers from the University of Illinois, Texas A&M University and Cornell University studied the 2023 incident and described how the dust storm crossed I-55 and collided with a tree line—a defense often planted close to highways to prevent dust storms and blizzards.

But there was only one tree line along this part of the highway and it, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of the road for this storm.

“If the wind had come from the other direction, there would have been no accident simply because that windbreak would have worked,” Coppess said. “The most interesting to me is how that clump of trees, which is designed basically as a windbreak, ended up concentrating dust right in the accident spot.”

Thomas E. Gill and a team of colleagues in Texas have calculated that the economic risk of such storms is rising and that the U.S. could be losing around $154.4 billion annually due to wind erosion and dust, according to a review of data from 2017.

That number, which includes losses in agriculture and renewable energy, health costs, car accidents and other factors, was based on the limited data they could gather. Gill, an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the real toll is likely higher.

Gill is one of the leaders at the Dust Alliance for North America, an inter-university partnership that aims to promote more dust-related research and its practical application across the United States and other countries. The accident in Illinois isn’t the only recent dust storm that caused blinding loss of visibility and car crashes, Gill said.

Accidents increasingly have been recorded across the Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest.

Growing dust storms aren’t necessarily warning of a repeat of the Depression-era tragedy, he said. “Rather than seeing a large wholesale dust bowl over a lot of the plains like happened in the 1930s, you might see a bunch of mini dust bowls here and there in various different states and regions,” said Gill, who has published several studies on atmospheric dust.

The United States has better soil and water protection efforts than a century ago. But, he said, “there’s no question that climate change is one of the major drivers of dust.”

Drought and Gusts

So how does a dust storm erupt?

Air is constantly filled with soil and sand particles that move around, playing a key role in spreading minerals. Plants in North and South America are partly dependent on the dust carried all the way from the Sahara Desert by Atlantic winds. But droughts and strong winds can complicate dust movements, leading to serious harm.

A dust storm is an occurrence that reduces visibility to less than one kilometer, according to the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency that promotes international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics. Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.

Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms. With this initiative, U.N. officials are trying to raise awareness of dust threats and urge more international cooperation.

Dust formation is a mechanical process. It usually happens in two ways, said Barry Baker, a physical research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Air Resources Laboratory.

Wind can make a large dust particle roll on the ground, forming the particles into larger masses. That formation is called a creep.

The other process is called impaction, where the wind is high enough to raise particles off the ground until they fall to earth with calamity. “Whenever it crashes, it throws a bunch of other particles up in the air,” Baker said, “and that then basically cascades more and more and more.”

The increased unpredictable heavy rains and extreme droughts create potential for more dust events, Baker said. These events happen in spring and fall, when the soil is often barren, but now they have started to “even out” throughout the year, he added. So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away.”

— Eliot Clay, Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts

U.S. farmers have protected their soil with cover crops over the years, notably after the 1930s and in recent decades. But strong spring winds have arrived before planting in the past couple of years, not just confusing drivers on Illinois’ interstate but confounding farmers. The quality of soil is at risk.

“The soil is so good [in Illinois] because it had thousands of years of perennial tall grass prairie on it,” said Clay, who represents the 97 soil and water conservation districts in Illinois. “And that system that existed naturally meant we had root systems that were going deep into the ground.”

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away,” Clay said.

Altering the Landscape

Anna Gannet Hallar, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, was part of a research team that in 2020 examined space satellite data of expanded farmland within the Midwest/Great Plains region. They explored how climate change and land use has been “altering the landscape, producing increases in windblown dust.”

Hallar said most observed dust increases were significant, linked to land being tilled more often. The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.

“We saw doubling [of dust in the air] over 20 years, and we were able to show that that doubling was associated with changes in land use,” Hallar said.

Evan Thaler, a soil health researcher at Oregon State University, said 30 percent of the top-level soil in the Midwest has been lost. “What’s driving the majority of erosion across the landscape is just the mechanical movement of soil by people plowing over and over and over,” Thaler said. “If we’re tilling a lot, it makes the soil susceptible to any type of erosion.”

As the climate crisis accelerates across the planet, it creates conditions for multiyear droughts in many regions, including the United States. Such droughts endanger both plants and soil—which simply doesn’t have enough time to regenerate. Some multiyear droughts turn into megadroughts—among the most severe in centuries.

The U.S. Southwest is currently going through its most intense megadrought in 1,200 years.

Zack Leasor, director of the Missouri Climate Center at the University of Missouri and the state climatologist, said multiyear droughts can lead to much more devastating effects than a one-time event. It takes time for water reservoirs, plants and industry to recover. With a year-after-year drought, they get no break, he explained.

After the Dust Bowl, the Great Plains agriculture industry recovered and relies now on irrigation from underground water sources, Leasor said. That irrigation system helps confront droughts, but the increasing number of megadroughts as climate change worsens will test that adaptation, Leasor warned.

“While groundwater can be kind of a Band-Aid to get you through a drought, it can also turn into a long-term water supply problem,” Leasor said. Groundwater is used up much faster than it can be replenished, he said, and repetitive drought lets less and less moisture from rain reach down into natural underground reservoirs.

While existing irrigation technologies can help, they aren’t going to solve the growing drought problems, Leasor said.

Gill and his research colleagues, meanwhile, found that human casualties from dust storms are roughly on the same level as casualties from hurricanes, thunderstorms or wildfires. Frequently that’s happened in deserts and farm country—places that don’t receive a lot of press coverage.

Wind farms are becoming more common in Indiana. The state already boasts the fourth largest ""farm"" in the U.S. and produces more than 3,500 megawatts of wind energy.

The towering windmills reaching up to the sky produced 10% of all the electricity used in the state in 2023. That's enough to power more than 1 million homes, according to the American Clean Power Association.

With more projects in the works, wind power is likely to continue to grow across the state. And with the increasing presence of the conspicuous energy generators comes some curiosity.

So, for this edition of Scrub Hub, we chose a question from Teresa, who asked: Why are the wind turbines not turning right now?

It’s possible for the blades on wind turbines to reach up to speeds of 200 mph, so it may seem odd when some are spinning very quickly while the blades on others nearby are not moving.

We dug around in some state, federal and industry reports and reached out to academic experts in energy technology to determine why some turbines in a wind farm spin while others remain still.

Short Answer: The turbine is down for maintenance

Wind turbines, like all machines, need both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. In some instances that explains why some are operating but not others.

The basic components of a wind turbine are the visible tower and rotor blades, as well as the gearbox and generator located at the top of the tower.

Scheduled maintenance helps prevent wear and tear from breaking parts and unscheduled maintenance occurs when the turbine experiences any of a number of failures.

Regular preventative maintenance can include periodic equipment inspection, oil and filter changes, calibration and adjustment of various parts, as well as replacing brake pads and seals. General housekeeping and blade cleaning can also temporarily keep a turbine from spinning.

In larger wind farms, several turbines on a circuit can be inoperable and not spinning because they are all down for maintenance, said John Roudebush, program chair of Ivy Tech College’s Energy Technology program.

Long answer: Curtailment, congestion and wind speed

Energy transmission in Indiana is run through the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, commonly known as MISO. The group manages the flow of electricity by balancing demand versus what’s being generated, which means there are times where excess electricity is being produced.

“(Sometimes) we don’t need the power as demand is down or another power plant is selling power to the customers instead,” Roudebush wrote in an email. “Power plants compete on the grid. A coal plant, a natural gas plant, or a wind farm will all bid to sell power during some part of the day and MISO will pick the cheapest bid for the day. Generally, wind is the cheapest but not always.”

John Hall, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo’s Engineering and Applied Sciences, focuses his research on the technical aspects of wind energy. While some wind turbines will operate normally, he said others may be stopped to match production with grid demand.

“Basically, you have the utility company distributing power and buying and selling in real time,” Hall said. “Based on how much they need, wind farms would turn turbines off accordingly.”

The industry calls a wind turbine that is not spinning “parked,” Hall said, and this is done with a braking system that holds the rotor in place. Once energy demand rises, the brake is released and almost immediately the turbine starts delivering electricity to the grid again.

Another obvious answer to why the turbines may not be spinning is that the wind speed is not high enough.

Generally, turbines can generate power with wind speeds as low as 5 mph. If speeds fall below that, there just isn’t enough to turn the sometimes massive blades.

On the other hand, wind that is too fast can cause damage to the turbines, so operators of wind farms will park the rotors until the wind calms down. Turbines generally shut down when wind speeds hit about 55 mph.

“The system is not designed for that, so they shut it down,” Hall said. “That’s OK because we rarely get winds over that speed, and it would not be worthwhile to design for that for the few instances.”

To help improve the efficiency of wind farms, Hall said banking excess power is a huge research area right now.

“There are studies on new battery technology and super capacitors and different ways to get around that issue,” Hall said.

Another solution for storing excess electricity is by making hydrogen, Hall said. Wind farm operators would be able to create hydrogen and store it for use later when the grid demand increases.

While fossil fuel plants may be more responsive to the constantly moving supply and demand for electricity, Hall said the future depends on renewables.

""If folks are concerned about climate and want a better future for the next generation and everything, renewable energy like wind and hydro-electric and tidal power are all really not just sources of energy but vital to perhaps our existence,"" Hall said.

What Tesla got changed Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan.","Tesla successfully fended off proposed environmental regulations in Nevada late last year that would have applied more stringent rules on its battery production operations, according to records obtained by The Nevada Independent.

As the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) sought to create a new regulatory framework governing an array of hazardous materials, the company pushed back — and quickly got its way.

Tesla, which builds battery packs and energy-storage products at its massive Gigafactory east of Reno, argued that regulations proposed by NDEP staff would threaten Nevada’s leading position in a nascent industry that is crucial to diversifying the state’s economy beyond gaming and tourism. The proposed rules would put Nevada “at a disadvantage when competing with other states to grow the lithium-ion battery recycling industry,” a Tesla executive wrote to NDEP in a late October letter.

The proposals would have required companies including Tesla to obtain more onerous permits (which require ongoing compliance reports and could lead to federally mandated spill cleanups but are generally not required for recycling facilities) for certain operations. It also would have required companies to continue following more stringent federal waste regulations related to the handling of hazardous materials, which include scrap metals or sludges that can be ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic.

Two days after Tesla wrote NDEP, the company’s lobbyist sent the same letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, which four days later participated in a meeting with officials from NDEP, Tesla and Redwood Materials, a Northern Nevada battery recycling company started by a co-founder of Tesla. One day after the meeting, held in the governor’s chief of staff’s office and on Microsoft Teams, an updated version of the regulation was sent by NDEP to participants with everything Tesla had asked for in the letter.

“Thank you very much for actioning the industry feedback so swiftly,” a Tesla official emailed the day after receiving the updated regulation.

A panel of state lawmakers later adopted the new rules without controversy.

The previously unreported series of events, revealed in documents obtained from the governor’s office through a public records request, brings into question the role battery companies should have in developing environmental regulations that are designed to keep workers, the public and the environment safe.

Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Its Nevada lobbyist told The Indy in an email that the company does not comment on media inquiries “as a general rule.”

The governor’s office said in a statement that it “has focused on streamlining regulations and implementing regulations that simultaneously support industry safety standards and pro-business policies,” and that it “regularly works” with industry associations and state agencies to shape regulations.

In an interview with The Indy, NDEP officials said that the governor’s office has no defined role in the regulatory process, but it sometimes is involved.

“Because of the growth of this economic sector, they’re interested in what’s going on,” NDEP Administrator Jennifer Carr said. “The governor’s office did not get involved in our process. … We never feel pressure to do anything from the governor's office.”

State agencies typically oversee the regulatory process, but on rare occasions, the process can involve the governor’s office, according to a former high-ranking state official granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal state regulatory dynamics. However, the source noted it is uncommon for a company to immediately get what it wanted from state officials, and that more back-and-forth could have occurred outside of what the public records revealed.

The governor’s office declined to make Lombardo’s chief of staff or its liaison to NDEP available for an interview, but it did respond to The Indy’s written request for comment.

NDEP received almost 70 comments regarding the proposed regulations, which the agency replied to as part of the normal regulation process. Agency officials told The Indy that it did not intend to make its rules more stringent than federal ones, but realized it had done so after meeting with industry officials.

Similar to many other businesses, Tesla has contracted with a lobbying firm in Nevada (Rowe Law Group) and has also engaged in lobbying efforts in other states, such as when CEO Elon Musk hired a dozen lobbyists in Texas this year to pass legislation advantageous to Tesla and another one of his companies, SpaceX.

Nevada officials across the political spectrum have embraced Tesla and the broader battery industry as a surefire way to expand the state’s tourism-dependent economy. State legislators approved a $1.25 billion tax incentive package for Tesla in 2014 — an unprecedented deal in the Silver State — and in 2023, state officials approved $330 million in additional tax breaks for a corporation valued at more than $1 trillion.

These investments are part of the state’s efforts to create a “lithium loop,” with the goal of encompassing all aspects of the process, from lithium extraction to its processing and eventual recycling.

“Our state has the components to be world leaders in battery development,” Lombardo said last year.

What the regulation means

The newly crafted regulation will likely lead to a system where fewer types of hazardous materials in Nevada are designated as waste, meaning there will be fewer requirements for certain companies that deal with hazardous materials.

The regulation was part of a broader effort to create a new framework in Nevada governing “hazardous secondary materials,” which are manufacturing byproducts that are not subject to certain federal waste regulations if they are legitimately recycled and meet other federal criteria. The state must validate that a company is meeting this criteria. .

Corrado DeGasperis, CEO at Comstock Inc., a Northern Nevada-based company that was involved in the battery recycling industry but has since pivoted to solar panel recycling, said under the new framework, companies will be incentivized to recycle their products. Disposing them as waste triggers more government oversight.

“Nevada’s way, way, way better off with these materials being recycled,” DeGasperis said.

In an interview, NDEP Deputy Administrator Jeffrey Kinder said the agency did not intend for the state’s hazardous secondary materials rules to be more stringent than the federal ones. It was only after input from industry officials that the agency recognized its proposed regulation would have been overly restrictive.

“We do sometimes ask for more stringent regulations through our own state process if we think there's a gap in what the federal program does,” he said. “But … that didn't exist. [It] is a fairly robust federal program that's been operating for a number of years in a number of states.”

Six facilities, including Redwood and Tesla, have notified the state they have applied to handle these secondary materials, according to NDEP.

Discarded lithium batteries are typically designated as hazardous waste because of their ignitability and reactivity, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But because the industry is still in its infancy, the recycling chain for lithium ion batteries is still being developed, according to Nevada lithium experts.

Top NDEP officials said, during their tenure, they have never been tasked with drafting regulations for a sector as large and rapidly evolving as the lithium recycling industry.

What Tesla got changed

Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan. These permits require ongoing compliance reports, and the EPA is able to issue orders or file lawsuits to these permitted facilities to require cleanups of spills.

These requirements, according to Tesla’s letter last year to state environmental regulators, could lead some lithium recyclers to “be forced to choose between losing ground to competitors in other states” or “ceasing business altogether.” Battery facilities have long eyed Nevada for its business-friendly environment, particularly the lack of state income tax.

Additionally, under the initial regulation, some materials would have still been classified as hazardous waste — and subject to stricter oversight — because the state did not intend to adopt certain federal rules. However, Tesla said in its letter to regulators that the decision to not adopt these rules “effectively advantages select recyclers, while disadvantaging others.”

Under the revised regulations, NDEP will now be solely responsible for validating whether battery facilities are meeting the requirements for legitimate recycling.

The agency has seven employees overseeing all hazardous waste compliance and enforcement for the entire state — not just for the battery factories.
