Reportedly, India’s solar waste was estimated at a manageable 110,000 US tons (100,000 tonnes) in 2023, but that figure is a trick of the light.
Recycling waste Solar panels contain high-value silver and copper, as well as trace amounts of lead and cadmium.

India’s energy future looks bright.","India is currently basking in a golden age of solar power. A decade-long solar surge has carried India from the bottom of the ranks to the global top three.

Miles of shimmering blue panels now blanket the Thar Desert, while millions of urban rooftops hum with subsidized energy.

With this rise, there is also a waste problem. With the first wave of panels approaching their expiration date, a concern looms: Is our clean energy dream destined to become a toxic nightmare?

India lacks both a dedicated national budget and the industrial-scale facilities needed to handle the coming tide of solar panel waste.

Dark side of the bright side

Fueled by government subsidies, nearly 2.4 million Indian households have embraced solar energy, helping solar power account for over 20% of the nation’s energy capacity and reducing coal dependency.

However, this success hides a looming environmental threat.

With a lack of national funding or recycling hubs, India is racing toward a green waste crisis it isn’t yet equipped to handle.

Reportedly, India’s solar waste was estimated at a manageable 110,000 US tons (100,000 tonnes) in 2023, but that figure is a trick of the light. It could rise to 661,386 US tons (600,000 tonnes) by 2030.

According to India’s think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), the volume is set to explode to over 12 million US tons (11 million tonnes) by 2047.

Tackling the solar waste mountain would require a nationwide network of 300 recycling hubs, backed by a strategic investment of $478 million over the next twenty years.

“The real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,” Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray, told BBC.

Most of India’s mega-solar parks were commissioned in the mid-2010s. These modules have a 25-year shelf life, and the countdown has already begun.

Recycling waste

Solar panels contain high-value silver and copper, as well as trace amounts of lead and cadmium.

When panels are smashed in unauthorized scrap yards or tossed into landfills, these toxins seep into groundwater and eventually enter the food chain.

Currently, India’s recycling scene is the wild west of basic recovery.

Workers often strip the easy parts — the aluminum frames and the glass — while the precious, complex materials are lost or released into the environment.

Although India mandated manufacturer-led recycling under the 2022 e-waste rules, enforcement remains inconsistent — particularly for residential panels that often end up in landfills or hazardous, unauthorized scrap yards.

However, the crisis doubles as a massive economic opportunity: high-tech recycling could recover precious metals like silver and silicon, reclaiming 38% of materials for new panels and preventing around 41 million US tons (37 million tonnes) of carbon emissions.

To succeed, experts argue India must spend the next decade professionalizing its recycling sector and holding profitable solar companies accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products.

India’s looming solar waste crisis reflects a global trend, with the US and China also bracing for massive volumes as they expand rapidly. However, regulatory responses vary widely across borders.

India’s energy future looks bright. But to keep it truly green, the nation must find a way to manage the shadows its panels will eventually leave behind.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IE-12-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 02:57:15.885876

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year.
Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.
Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.
“It’s negligible compared to the emissions of a coal plant,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told IEEE Spectrum.","While we’ve made major strides in generating renewable energy, storing that green power to use when the Sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing remains a major engineering challenge.

Researchers have developed many creative concepts — storing it in cranes that hoist humongous concrete blocks up and down, inside hot giant rocks, or spinning turbines by pumping water out of deep, decommissioned mines — none have yet proved practical enough for wide deployment.

Now, as IEEE Spectrum reports, a Milan-based company called Energy Dome has come up with an intriguing approach that stores energy in enormous domes that are filled with compressed carbon dioxide gas.

The idea behind the “CO2 battery” is simple. By compressing the gas using excess green power, it can later be depressurized to spin large turbines. A fully charged facility can store a formidable 200 megawatt-hours of electricity — enough to power around 6,000 homes for a full day.

To charge, the battery uses a thermal-energy storage system to cool the CO2 down to ambient pressure, and a condenser turns it into a liquid over a span of ten hours. To discharge it, the CO2 is evaporated and heated to power the turbine.

The goal is to bridge the gap between when renewable energy is available and when it’s actually needed through a “long-term duration energy storage” (LDES) solution. For instance, solar energy generation may hit its peak during the day, but peak household demand lags hours behind when people are home in the evening.

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year. Now, IEEE Spectrum reports that the tech giant “plans to rapidly deploy the facilities in all of its key data-center locations in Europe, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.”

Energy Dome is currently working on a pilot CO2 battery built on five hectares of flat land in Sardinia, Italy. If successful, it wants to expand rapidly, popping up similar facilities across the world, starting with a separate plant in Karnataka, India. Authorities are also working on laying the groundwork for another in Wisconsin.

Google’s senior lead for energy strategy, Ainhoa Anda, told IEEE Spectrum that one big benefit of the approach is that it’s one-size-fits-all.

“We’ve been scanning the globe seeking different solutions,” he said, adding that “standardization is really important, and this is one of the aspects that we really like” about Energy Dome.

“They can really plug and play this,” Anda added.

The tech giant is looking to start in places where the electricity grid is already reliable and has a surplus of renewable energy that needs to be stored. Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.

Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.

And it’s not just Google looking to harness the benefits of LDES. China is also working on constructing CO2 batteries, according to IEEE.

Nonetheless, questions surrounding the concept’s long-term economic viability remain. For one thing, a CO2 battery’s footprint is considerably larger than a lithium-ion battery storage facility. There’s also the shortcoming that plagues all bubbles: the threat of a puncture, which could release thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

But proponents argue it’s worth the risks.

What's geothermal? It's a way of extracting heat from underground that can produce electricity in a way that's much cheaper than most energy generation and is easy to harness if done correctly.

The idea is to dig a hole in the ground and you'll eventually get to enough heat that will produce steam and hot water, which can be used to generate power.

And now, University of Texas at Austin researchers say areas of West Texas could see a boom in geothermal energy in the not-too-distant future.

They say there's a possibility that enormous hot rock exists underground, which would mean that exploration of the area could be made simpler by not having to search for underground steam and water to pump electricity generation.

All energy explorers would have to do is find underground areas where the rock is hot, then inject water into it, the way water is very forcefully injected into the ground to stir up oil and force it out of the ground in the fracing industry.

We already know Texas is number one in America for producing oil and gas and is number one in electricity production sourced from wind towers and solar panels, but UT scientists say if research can be done quick enough, the state could become a leader in geothermal energy pretty quickly if ideas are implemented soon.

Geothermal is among the safest forms of energy:

Environmentalists like it because it's clean, with almost no pollution.

Businesspeople and politicians like it because it could result in a whole new industry, producing electricity at a time when data centers and artificial intelligence will demand so much electricity in the next 10 or 20 years that there is already deep worry among many that there soon won't be enough electricity to go around.

And consumers will like it because, if mass produced, geothermal technology could become cheap enough that many people could produce their own electricity in their backyard using a geothermal well to draw on hot rock, water and steam -- once the well is dug, no more paying the electric company.

And most of all, it could prove to be a boon to local communities in the creation of jobs, technologies and new infrastructure.

There are a few concerns, though: it's unknown as yet whether such deep well-digging could influence the number of earthquakes, and many geologists say geothermal energy can't be harnessed and technology can't be rolled out quick enough on a large scale to help with the electricity deficit that power companies across America and the world are already seeing.

Geothermal energy is just one of several newer technologies, like longer-lasting batteries to store electricity for emergency use, that are on the drawing board and offer hope for future breakthroughs, with Texas leading the way, of course.","https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/65dcd42b7252e43218304a33?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)",N,,2025-12-28 01:57:35.776160

Nuclear fusion differs.
The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.
We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.","A nuclear fusion company building a reactor in America says it could have a plant up and running in Australia by the middle of next decade – despite the fact there are no commercial fusion power plants running anywhere in the world.

Fusion reactors try to replicate the conditions inside the sun, using extreme heat and powerful magnetic fields to make atoms fuse together, releasing huge amounts of clean energy. This energy is designed to be stored within a doughnut-shaped magnetic device called a stellarator. In theory, they represent the ultimate source of cheap, clean energy. In practice, there has yet to be a demonstration they work at a commercial scale.

Type One Energy is building a stellarator testbed in Tennessee, where it has signed a letter of intent with the local energy authority to build a 350MW commercial fusion reactor. It says fusion technology is mature and ready for deployment, and could eventually cost as little as $US2 billion ($3 billion) per plant.

Australian fusion experts disagree. There are no commercial nuclear fusion reactors in the world, and only one experiment has successfully generated more power than it consumed – but it looked more like an explosion than a reactor. Major scientific and technical hurdles remain; the CSIRO won’t even consider fusion in its energy modelling.

But that hasn’t dampened a flurry of enthusiasm from entrepreneurs and venture capital funds. Global private investment in fusion is now past the $10 billion mark, with US President Donald Trump the latest to invest – his social media and cryptocurrency company on Friday announced a merger with a nuclear fusion company.

“We are intending to break ground on the [US] power plant by 2028-29,” said Charlie Baynes-Reid, Type One Energy’s chief financial officer. “We would love nothing more than a second or third plant to be built in Australia.

“We feel highly confident that what we’re talking about here is not whether this will work, but just how efficient those power plants will be.”

A star in a bottle

Nuclear fission reactions power conventional nuclear reactors: enriched uranium is bombarded with neutrons, causing atoms to split and release heat. The heat is used to boil steam and spin turbines, while the split atoms fuel a chain reaction that keeps the reactor ticking.

Nuclear fusion differs. Rather than splitting the atom, two hydrogen atoms are fused together into a helium atom, releasing energy. Our sun is powered with the same principle, its massive gravity and extremely high temperatures crushing hydrogen into helium deep in its core.

Fusion reactions release much more energy than fission. There are no greenhouse gases. To quote the International Atomic Energy Agency: “It could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy to meet the world’s demand.”

Achieving nuclear fusion itself is a solved problem. In 2018, 12-year-old Jackson Oswalt did it on a homemade reactor in his bedroom.

The real challenge can be boiled down to a simple statement, from emeritus professor John Howard, who oversaw the Australian National University’s experimental fusion reactor for many years: “You are keeping a star inside a magnetic bottle.”

This is as difficult as it sounds. The fusion reaction must be sustained, steady and reliable to provide baseload power.

Loading

Fusion scientists start with plasma – a super-hot swirling gas of atoms that have been stripped of their electrons. The plasma is sensitive to magnetic fields, so huge magnets are used to contain it and send it swirling through the reactor chamber.

Type One is proposing to build stellarators, which look like twisted hollow donuts wrapped in coils of superconducting magnets. The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.

The technical challenges are enormous. Stellarators need to survive temperatures exceeding a hundred million degrees kelvin, while keeping the superconducting magnets that surround the chamber below zero.

It can work. The German W7-X stellarator set a record this year for the longest controlled fusion reaction. All that is needed now, says Baynes-Reid, is to scale up the German model to grid-size. One Energy proposes repurposing old shuttered coal plants, which already have grid connections.

Loading

“The fundamental science and technology has been proven. We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.

Other scientists are less optimistic. The W7-X set a record by running for a grand total of 47 seconds.

“I hate being a naysayer. Huge progress has been made. But there’s a few fairly deft tech challenges yet to be solved,” said Howard.

Two stand out. First, for fusion to work, engineers need to prove up tritium breeding.

Fusion reactors run by fusing two special types of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. Deuterium can be easily extracted from water, but tritium is rare – and radioactive.

A commercial fusion reactor needs to make its own tritium as a byproduct of the reaction, which can then be reused as fuel. This technology is theoretically possible, but scientists are yet to prove it works.

Second, neutrons created as part of the reaction can degrade the components of the reaction chamber. Can you quickly and economically swap them out, while still providing a reliable power supply?

“Their prospectus is fairly optimistic. I’d love to say it was grounded in demonstrated achievements, but that’s not quite the case yet,” said Howard. “Would I put my money into it, if I had any? Probably not.”

Then there’s the timescale problem. Type One believes it could have a working plant up in Tennessee by 2034, replacing the coal plants scheduled to reach the end of their working life over the next decade.

Australia has committed to cutting emissions by between 62 and 70 per cent of 2005 levels by 2035 – a dramatic increase in the pace of emissions reduction, likely requiring 95 per cent of all electricity generation to be renewable within a decade.

ITER, the world’s largest and most powerful experimental fusion reactor, conceived in 1985, has been under construction since 2013 and is projected to cost $US66 billion.

It is designed to reach breakeven, and will test out tritium breeding. But it won’t achieve first plasma until 2034 at the earliest, and won’t be connected to the grid.

“I am a believer. But there is the problem at hand. We’re cooking ourselves alive, and setting up the conditions for crazy rainfall and flooding and sea-level rises. First things first, deal with that with the tech that is available and proven,” said Dr Nathan Garland, a fusion researcher at Griffith University.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7874%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/420256724b6d90603c0eefff98b1c3e88e2061bd,N,,2025-12-27 20:57:06.390497

Discover more about China’s historic breakthrough in the desert below.

Goodbye to hydrogen after China’s historic discovery

China has shown that achieving long-term carbon neutrality is not an impossible feat, especially with the assistance of short-term climate targets. According to the World Resources Institute, China has set the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, and has updated its 2035 climate targets to include the following:

Have EVs become mainstream in sales

Boost forest stock volume

Boost wind and solar capacity to more than 6 times the 2020 capacity

Decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% compared to peak levels

>30% non-fossil fuel share in energy consumption

By late 2025, China managed to boost its green hydrogen capacity to surpass 220,000 tonnes annually. Now, thanks to an ultimate green facility and a future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of a hydrogen carrier in the desert, China can easily achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, if not earlier. Find out more below.

1,500,000 tonnes of this green energy in the desert

A Chinese company called Envision Energy has developed the ultimate green facility in the Net-Zero Industrial Park located in Inner Mongolia’s Chifeng City, near the Gobi Desert. This facility will be the biggest green ammonia and hydrogen production facility in China. Envision Energy’s facility will be a milestone in the country’s large-scale decarbonization.

The Chifeng facility is unique compared to others of its kind, as all production is powered solely by renewable energy sources, solar and wind energy, which is stored in batteries. Exports of green ammonia were planned for the final quarter of 2025, with the entire facility set to expand over three phases to achieve 1,52 million tonnes of green ammonia annually.

Expanding in three phases

Phase 0

Launching 20,000-ton pilot phase in March 2024

Phase 1

Produce 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually by September 2025

Phase 2

Start construction by August 2025

Increase annual production by 320,000 tonnes, starting in November 2026

Phase 3

Increase annual production by 900,000 tonnes

Reach full-scale production of 1,52 million tonnes annually by 2029

China will greatly benefit from this green energy

Beyond the Chifeng facility operating with zero emissions thanks to renewable energy sources, it is also the world’s ‘smartest’ facility. AI plays a vital role in operations management, balancing energy supply and demand in real time. The facility will also be beneficial for China’s export market, as Envision Energy has already secured an offtake deal with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation.

In this deal, green ammonia is exported for sectors such as:

Chemicals

Fertilizers

Shipping

According to the China Hydrogen Bulletin, other export purposes include transporting green ammonia by railway to Envision’s 80,000 cubic meter liquid ammonia storage and processing facility in Jinzhou port. This facility’s construction started in June 2024 and is still under development. Inner Mongolia is also planning to construct a 4,400 km green hydrogen pipeline network along with a 299 km ammonia transportation pipeline between Chifeng and Jinzhou.

The economic and environmental benefits for China are thus endless. Most importantly, this pioneering facility will significantly boost China’s energy security and play a major role in global decarbonization, bringing the world one step closer to achieving the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050.

Also lagging behind in terms of EV adoption and incentives is West Virginia, another state that offers no incentives for EV buyers.
A likely reason for this could be that Mississippi also doesn't offer much in terms of EV incentives, as there isn't any state-wide EV rebate or tax credit.
Arkansas, like the states before it on this list, offers no tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles.
Regardless, seeing as how the state is a coal-producing one, EV incentives are a pretty unlikely development anyway.","Electric vehicles are said to be great for the environment and a good way to cut down on gas and maintenance costs. All around the world, countries have introduced policies to help phase out gas-powered vehicles for electric ones. In the United States, there have also been deliberate efforts to encourage everyone to invest in electric vehicles through tax credits and rebates, both at the federal and state levels. A recent federal incentive that offered $7,500 tax credit on new EVs and $4,000 on used ones has effectively come to an end, but many states still have similar benefits in place for residents.

The politics surrounding electrification are one factor that has some states continuing to preserve their gasoline-focused car market, offering zero tax credits or rebates. EVs also struggle to gain sufficient demand in certain areas due to environmental factors or state-specific driving habits. With that said, here are the U.S. states with the worst EV incentives.

To start things off, North Dakota has been recognized as one of the least friendly states for electric vehicles. Vehicle owners don't get tax incentives or rebates for buying the best new EVs or even installing home charging stations. Instead, the state actually imposes an additional registration fee of $120 a year, which further discourages EV use in the state. That's probably why it has the second-lowest amount of EV chargers available to use among all other U.S. states.

When it comes to EV market shares, North Dakota ranks 50th in the country, and adoption of this technology in the state has been noticeably slow. Given that it's a rural state, the aversion to electric vehicles in North Dakota is not unexpected. It also has a cold climate, which means residents often have to travel long distances under weather conditions that EVs generally don't have the capability to perform well in.

Also lagging behind in terms of EV adoption and incentives is West Virginia, another state that offers no incentives for EV buyers. As you might expect, the state has one of the lowest EV adoption rates in the country, with just 143 EVs per 100,000 people. In 2020, West Virginia placed 44th among US states in terms of EV sales.

Apart from its lack of incentives, you'll also need to pay $200 as an EV user each time you want to renew your registration in West Virginia. This approach is partly due to the state's rural geography, as well as its political stance on electric vehicles; the governor of the state once described EV mandates as harmful to the state's energy production.

The good news is that there have been recent efforts to improve EV infrastructure in West Virginia. These projects were initiated and funded by the federal government. From 2021 to 2023, the number of DC fast-charging ports in the state went up by 81%, and from 2022 to 2023, its EV sales grew by 46%, indicating that the embrace of EVs may improve.

Mississippi is stereotyped for its underdevelopment, ranking low in many national comparisons on socioeconomic issues. Turns out, it doesn't fare well with EV technology, either. It has a very poor EV adoption rate compared to other states. A likely reason for this could be that Mississippi also doesn't offer much in terms of EV incentives, as there isn't any state-wide EV rebate or tax credit.

However, in addition to that, Mississippi has restricted EV manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to customers in person. While this move has been justified for the protection it affords businesses, it counts as a setback for the growth of the EV market. Unsurprisingly, Mississippi has the lowest proportion of EVs in the country, with 110 vehicles per 100,000 people.

On the bright side, residents seeking incentives may be able to access municipal-level rebates from utility companies. In particular, Mississippi Power, which operates in some cities within the state, offers rebates on EV chargers.

Arkansas, like the states before it on this list, offers no tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles. The state was also noted as one of the worst for electric vehicle infrastructure. Recently, a bill was also introduced in Arkansas to repeal its EV infrastructure program, which could potentially worsen the EV-friendliness of the state.

In addition, purchasers have to pay expensive registration fees when purchasing both EVs and hybrid vehicles, with a cost of $200 for the former and $100 for plug-in hybrids. However, even though the state doesn't provide any of its own, residents do have incentive options. Groups like Entergy, Ozarks Electric Cooperative, and Southwestern Electric Power Company all provide EV charger rebates for their customers and communities.

Despite the aforementioned roadblocks and Arkansas continuing to have one of the lowest adoption rates in the country, EV registrations in the state have still increased in recent times, going from 6,895 in 2024 to 8,807 as of April 2025.

Wyoming has very low EV adoption, which is unsurprising, seeing as how the state has failed to create an enabling environment for this technology. There are no state-level tax credits or rebates for EV purchases, and to worsen matters, the political climate serves as an obstacle to EV development. In 2024, a Wyoming senator introduced a bill seeking to eliminate the federal tax credit, citing that unwilling families should not have to shoulder the costs of a ""climate agenda,"" as mentioned by Buckrail. Other politicians have also raised concerns regarding the threat that EVs pose to the oil, gas, coal industries in the state.

But apart from the political pushback, Wyoming's environment is just not the best fit for EVs. The harsh winters and rural landscapes mean that EV investments won't provide much benefit here. Regardless, seeing as how the state is a coal-producing one, EV incentives are a pretty unlikely development anyway. However, there are still utility companies in the state that offer EV charger rebates to their customers.

Next on the list is Kentucky. Although this southeastern state has been a force in America's vehicle market, it is easily among the toughest places for EV owners to live in throughout the U.S. To start with, it has one of the worst infrastructures for electric cars. Charging stations are sparse, laws are unfavorable, and adoption is low. There are only about 820 chargers in the entire state, which amounts to 5,520 residents per charger.

As you might have guessed, there are no state-sponsored tax credits or rebates offered to EV purchasers in Kentucky. Although some utility companies offer rebates of $25 when owners enroll and an additional $5 a month, this amount is unlikely to seriously influence purchase decisions. With all these barriers in place, it appears Kentucky residents are largely reluctant to buy EVs. But for those who choose to, they will have to pay an annual registration fee of up to $25 along with a $120 annual supplemental license fee.

In Alabama, any incentives or rebates available to residents are either those sponsored by the federal government or by utility companies such as Alabama Power. There's also a local utility provider known as Central Alabama Electric Cooperative, which allows its members to qualify for a $100 rebate on their EVs.

On the other hand, the state government imposes a fee of $203 annually for EV buyers and $103 for plug-in hybrid purchasers. This amount is separate from the registration fees, and it also increases by $3 every year. The absence of incentives, coupled with the high fees and lack of adequate infrastructure, means owning an EV in this state can pose heavy financial burdens.

Alabama has also taken some political steps against EVs. In August 2025, it joined 26 other states to challenge California's EV mandate. The states collectively opposed a waiver that allowed California to limit the sale of gas-powered vehicles. With that in mind, it seems unlikely that Alabama would seek to support an electric-powered future for the automotive industry.

As previously mentioned, cold temperatures are known to have some impact on EV range, so it's not unusual for regions with harsh climates to be less friendly towards EVs. For Alaska, this is very much the case. It is a remote and sparsely populated state, and that makes the use and development of EV infrastructure quite difficult — especially considering its large land area.

There are no EV rebates or tax credits sponsored by the Alaska state government. However, unlike some other states, Alaska doesn't impose penalties for purchasers in the form of registration fees or annual ownership fees. Essentially, the state is pretty passive when it comes to EV regulation. Residents may, however, benefit from the Alaska Power and Telephone utility company, which grants a $500 rebate simply for purchasing an EV. And from the look of things, EV popularity may be growing in the state, as ownership numbers have doubled from 2018 to 2020.

Idaho also refuses to embrace EVs, which should be a given when considering its status as a rural state. For many residents, gas is a cheaper and more accessible option, and it doesn't help that there are no incentives for those making the switch to electric. In fact, if you own an EV, you have to pay an annual fee of $140. A few years ago, there was an attempt to raise this fee even higher to $300 through a bill that was never passed.

Ironically, Idaho is one of the states that could benefit the most from a fuller embrace of EVs. It, along with Wyoming, has one of the highest rates of private vehicle ownership in the country, and this contributes negatively to the rate of traffic congestion and greenhouse emissions. EVs would lower the negative environmental impacts while simultaneously saving some money for residents that would normally be buying gasoline.

Currently, the only incentives available to Idaho residents are the rebates offered by Kootenai Electric Cooperative, which go to the purchase of a level 2 home charger. Idaho Power also offers savings for its customers when they charge their vehicles during specific hours.

Although the interest in EVs has significantly increased in South Dakota, the state has still been lagging behind in embracing them. With increasing gas prices coupled with increases in electrical vehicle range, there's more reason for people to invest in these cars. However, South Dakota offers no state-wide incentives for individual EV purchasers while also imposing a $50-per-year for owners.

Generally, the state still has much to do in terms of EV infrastructure. Chargers, for instance, are just over 100 in number, despite the state being home to nearly a million residents. But that's not to say the state government has done nothing to improve it. A while ago, the South Dakota Department of Transportation introduced an EV Fast Charging Plan to create more available chargers for EV owners.

The state has also provided rebates through the Volkswagen EV Charging station rebate program, which emerged from a lawsuit against Volkswagen in 2016. However, this project is limited to state bodies, organizations, and businesses, not individual consumers.

Unlike many states that have made it to this list, Hawaii appears generally receptive to the use of EVs. The tropical island state actually has one of the highest rates of EV adoption in the country. However, the state itself still doesn't offer any incentives for EV users or purchasers. In fact, aside from registration fees, owners of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are expected to pay $50 annually.

The reason EV adoption has been so high in the state is actually due to several other reasons. Firstly, gasoline prices, which cost $4.72 on average, are high for most residents. Also, the state doesn't have the challenge of long road trips that are common in most rural areas. To add to this, the warm weather in Hawaii is quite favorable for EV adoption.

In terms of the actual infrastructure and incentives, Hawaii still lags behind, leaving a gap between the demand for EVs and the structure to accommodate it. On the bright side, the state has a mission to fully embrace renewable energy by 2045 and has already taken steps toward achieving this goal.

Montana is sparsely populated, but it is a large state in terms of land area, and this makes EV adoption quite a challenge. The state government does not help much either, offering zero incentives or tax credits for going electric. If you choose to invest in an EV, you're required to pay $260 if your car weighs less than 6,000 pounds. If it's heavier, that fee goes as high as $380. The state also imposes annual fees for EV owners, which are also dependent on the vehicle's weight and can reach up to $1,100.

Unlike many other states, Montana residents don't have access to rebates provided by utility companies either. The only form of incentive residents could have been entitled to were those provided by the federal government. Montana's challenge with EVs can also be partly attributed to its poor energy sector.
