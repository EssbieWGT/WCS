General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting U.S. fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

The Trump administration has taken aim at vehicle environmental rules on a number of fronts. In June, Trump signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Now, according to emails obtained by the Free Press, the local EV startup is struggling to pay its workforce.
In June, David Michery of Mullen Automotive took over as the CEO of Bollinger and renamed the company Bollinger Innovations.
A communications representative who previously worked for Bollinger told the Free Press he was no longer affiliated with the company.","Bollinger Motors, an Oak Park-based electric vehicle start-up, has not paid its employees for two pay periods, citing a shortage of available funds.

The company has been sued by its founder, as well as suppliers, over unpaid debts.

There are 59 pending claims of unpaid wages against Bollinger with the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

Bollinger Motors, an Oak-Park-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has not paid its staff for at least the last two pay periods as it struggles to keep business going.

Bollinger was founded in 2015 and pitched itself as the builder of ""the most bad-ass electric commercial trucks on the planet."" The company builds vehicles in Livonia, is headquartered in Oak Park and has previously inked a manufacturing contract with Roush Industries, a Livonia-based manufacturer of high-performance vehicles, indicating that Roush would handle the production of Bollinger vehicles.

As of Nov. 18, the company's website lists a chassis cab truck, the B4, as available for order, as well as two boxy SUV prototypes, the B1 and B2. A larger chassis cab truck, the B5, appears to be slated for release in 2026.

But the company's finances suggest a rough road ahead.

In March, the company's founder and namesake, Robert Bollinger — who had left the company — sued to recoup on a $10 million loan he gave the company the previous October. Robert Bollinger alleged the company was broke and sought a receivership to handle repayment of his loan. The company put up the money with the help of its parent company, Mullen Automotive, and paid him. The company exited the receivership in June.

The former founder is not the only party to sue Bollinger Motors over money owed. At least six suppliers have taken legal action this year, seeking to settle more than $5 million in overdue bills, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

Now, according to emails obtained by the Free Press, the local EV startup is struggling to pay its workforce.

""Unfortunately, we could not process this week’s payroll on schedule due to a delay in receiving the expected funds,"" reads an Oct. 31 email from Walter Collins, the chief operating officer of Bollinger Motors. ""As of today, we do not yet have a confirmed update on funding to meet payroll ending October 31, 2025. As soon as funds are received, we will process payroll in full. I will provide updates as new information becomes available.""

A follow-up email was sent a week later, on Nov. 6, with Collins telling employees that funding still had yet to be secured to pay employees.

Keely Lovern, spokesperson for the state labor department, wrote in an email to the Free Press that the department currently has ""59 open claims against Bollinger Innovations for unpaid wages or benefits. Those claims are still open and under investigation.""

In June, David Michery of Mullen Automotive took over as the CEO of Bollinger and renamed the company Bollinger Innovations. Mullen Automotive, an EV startup based in California, purchased a majority stake in Bollinger in 2022. Under Michery, the company has undergone a significant contraction in staff, property and assets.

At the company's Oak Park location, a Detroit Free Press reporter could see several of its commercial trucks in the parking lot behind the building.

In September, the company publicly notified Nasdaq that it had taken significant cost-cutting measures and reduced its quarterly cash burn from $21.2 million to $8.9 million.

A communications representative who previously worked for Bollinger told the Free Press he was no longer affiliated with the company. Further efforts to reach company leadership were unsuccessful.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/presto/2020/08/18/PDTF/6b324257-f326-4202-889a-648188e10ad5-030719_electric_motor_c2.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y111&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 09:58:08.927834

Regenerative agriculture improves soil health, removes carbon from the atmosphere and conserves water

Honda is supporting 1,800 metric tons of soil carbon removals as a step toward its decarbonization goals

Honda today announced that it has joined Carbon by Indigo, a leading program to help farmers across the U.S. adopt regenerative agriculture practices to improve soil health, capture carbon and increase their profitability. As part of its broader commitment to decarbonization, Honda is purchasing soil carbon removal credits through Carbon by Indigo, resulting in the removal of 1,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Learn how regenerative agriculture is making a difference for farmers at https://honda.us/farmers.

Carbon by Indigo produces high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits in the U.S., providing farmers with opportunities to increase profitability while building soil health and long-term resilience. Participating farmers learn, adopt and expand regenerative practices tailored to their crop systems and local conditions, such as planting cover crops, reducing tillage, diversifying crop rotations and optimizing nitrogen application. These practices boost soil health, reduce surface water runoff and enhance air quality. As farmers implement and maintain these methods, they generate soil carbon credits by capturing carbon in the soil.

While water dynamics are highly local and field-specific, the practices in this project on average conserved approximately 69,000 gallons of water for every metric ton of carbon removed. Honda's investment in the soil carbon project supports farmers across the U.S., including approximately 150 farmers near Honda operations in Alabama, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina, empowering them to adopt regenerative practices on a combined 214,000 acres of farmland. All credits in the Carbon by Indigo program have been independently verified by Aster Global Environmental Solutions and issued by the Climate Action Reserve, a trusted, high-quality carbon credit registry.

""For over 40 years, Honda has supported farmers near our Ohio operations through conservation programs that protect farmland and help expand access to markets for their crops,"" said Mahjabeen Qadir, sustainability strategy lead at Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC. ""Now, Honda is building on that history by supporting regenerative agriculture practices that help farmers manage climate challenges and maintain healthy farmland for future generations.""

""Indigo proudly works with companies like Honda to take action on achieving their climate goals while creating impact for the communities in which they operate,"" said Dean Banks, CEO of Indigo Ag. ""The Carbon by Indigo program builds prosperity from the ground up, with tangible benefits for local communities and their environment: cleaner air and water, more resilient soil and crop production, additional income for farmers and their families, and a legacy of stewardship across generations.""

Honda aims to decarbonize its products and operations and use high-quality offsets only for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions that could not be eliminated. To advance this decarbonization goal, Honda has implemented the following initiatives:

Zero and low emissions products: Driving the transition to 100% battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles, starting with hybrid-electric models in the U.S.

Nature-based solutions: Planting over 85,000 trees to capture carbon and further restore biodiversity at Honda's Ohio operations

Home energy solutions: Providing home and vehicle energy management technologies to help customers reduce their environmental footprint

Energy-efficient operations: Reducing energy use and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources across Honda manufacturing facilities

Industry: Alt-Energy

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2792288/3-alternative-energy-stocks-to-watch-amid-near-term-challenges

A strong outlook for wind energy installations is poised to support alternative energy stocks. However, escalating turbine costs, along with U.S. tariffs and recent policy shifts, may temper their momentum, especially as the One Big Beautiful Act remains a significant obstacle. Even so, accelerating transportation electrification is expected to fuel substantial near-term growth in the U.S. electric vehicle market, providing a meaningful boost to clean energy stocks. The forerunners in the U.S. alternative energy industry are Bloom Energy, OPAL Fuels and FuelCell Energy.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources.

The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels.

Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever.

Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market.

According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027.

To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s bottom-line estimate for the current fiscal year has moved down 15.4% to $2.04 since June 30.

And there, underlying the lush forests and riverbeds of East Texas, sits the Carrizo-Wilcox — a big, juicy pig, with no one standing guard.

“We cannot compromise one region for another,” State Representative Cecil Bell said to another packed room, this time at the Texas State Capitol in Austin.
High-quality monitoring could give the groundwater conservation districts the data they need to say no to big projects that are deemed unsustainable.","The farmers and ranchers who descended on city hall in Jacksonville, Texas, had been told to “leave their pitchforks at the door.” While everyone ultimately arrived unarmed, the attendees of the June 19 board meeting of the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District were ready for a fight.

In the hallway outside the boardroom, wives tried to cool their husbands with handheld paper fans that flapped uselessly amid a sea of silver hair — stoic men with sweat-slicked brows beneath weathered cowboy hats, veterans’ insignia, and red MAGA ball caps. Near the chamber door, a uniformed officer stood sweating through his shirt, trying to enforce the fire marshal’s 150-person limit while the crowd swelled behind him. The sign-in table, barely visible through the crush, had already collected nearly 100 names — almost all were there to speak out against the water permits requested by two shadowy LLCs tied to hedge fund manager Kyle Bass and his investment group, Conservation Equity Management Partners.

The permit applications submitted by Bass’ Redtown Ranch Holdings LLC and Pine Bliss LLC collectively request permission to withdraw approximately 15 billion gallons of water annually from the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer in East Texas, an amount residents fear will run their wells and farms dry. Without taking off their “Don’t Tread On Me” t-shirts, the citizens of six East Texas counties where Trump took around 80 percent of the vote last November are now turning to their state government to protect them from billionaires.

Jacksonville sits about two hours southeast of Dallas. With a population just shy of 15,000, it’s the largest city in Cherokee County, one of the three counties represented by the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District. The trees in the county are lush and tall, and the Neches and Trinity Rivers gently flood the landscape with a predictability that local farmers use to their advantage. The county’s tight-knit residents typically vote Republican, they’ve told me over the years, to protect their freedom from government overreach. But as they watch water conflicts breaking out all over Texas, they feel their communities are being overwhelmed by heavy industry and profiteering. Some locals have started making the case that it’s not government overreach for the state to step in when the fight’s not fair.

Melisa Meador, who identified herself as a wife, mother, Christian, and pecan farmer with 600 acres near Bass’s Redtown Ranch — one of the LLCs looking to pump groundwater — took a prophetic tone in her testimony to the conservation district board. “Those who endlessly accumulate sow the seeds of their own destruction,” Meador said at the podium with the cadence and poetry of a revivalist. “Today’s water barons join river to river, well to well, until all water flows through their meters. Their thirst for profit can never be quenched.”

For his part, Bass feels he’s being mischaracterized. “I’m not coming at this as a robber baron, and I’m not coming at this as someone who intends to do any harm whatsoever,” he told me in the hall after taking a break from being public enemy number one inside the Jacksonville boardroom. “If they come back to me and say, ‘You’re going to do harm, you need to reduce your permit,’ I’m a very reasonable person.”

He’s not shy about his intentions for the water, though he insists that he does not already have buyers lined up. The water, should he get it, could be transported out of East Texas to any number of bone-dry cities west of the Carrizo-Wilcox. Unless the government wants to hang a “closed for business sign on I-35,” he said, there has to be some solution to the statewide water shortage. Really, he said, the amount of water he’s talking about exporting is a drop in the bucket — less than 1 percent of what the state needs.

“I mean, we’re talking about a large amount of water in this area, but a very small amount of water as it relates to the state,” Bass said. “The state has a real problem.”

He’s right. Droughts have always been part of Texas weather, but with climate change, they’ve grown longer and hotter. Meanwhile, increasingly unpredictable torrents of rain are flooding canyons and tributaries, but doing little to refill the aquifers under parched, hard land.

West Texas is getting drier, heading toward all-out catastrophe for high desert cities and the state’s treasured spring-fed rivers. The Panhandle and Gulf Coast are scrambling for new water sources as agriculture and industry outpace local basins and aquifers. As drought conditions persist, the primary urban corridor, Interstate 35, has boomed with massive, thirsty tech companies that exhaust local water supplies in metropolis-adjacent exurbs. And the Edwards Aquifer — the massive limestone tank under southwest Texas — cannot support more growth, rendering San Antonio desperate for imported water. Like ravenous wolves, the thirsty cities are on the prowl for water. And there, underlying the lush forests and riverbeds of East Texas, sits the Carrizo-Wilcox — a big, juicy pig, with no one standing guard.

San Antonio struck first, running its 140-mile Vista Ridge pipeline and pulling 16 billion gallons per year from the Carrizo-Wilcox, causing wells in some rural counties to sputter. Fast-growing Austin suburbs also began sinking proverbial straws in their surrounding counties, laying pipe to keep up with exploding development. In Lee County, just east of Austin, the San Francisco-based water asset management firm Upwell Water announced plans to build a pipeline so big that the cities of Bryan and College Station, along with Texas A&M University, jointly filed suit to stop what they see as a groundwater grab.

There’s more to the pipeline-palooza than just competition for scarce resources. There are also fortunes to be made. Conservationists, well drillers, and even industry insiders have started comparing the rush on the Carrizo-Wilcox to the oil frenzy of the Texas Permian Basin or the California gold rush. But this time, the boomtowns won’t spring up next to the pumps. The real fortunes — and the real growth — are happening hundreds of miles away, in cities that may never lay eyes on the rural wells quenching their thirst.

Sitting on top of a gold mine doesn’t mean that every resident of East Texas could be about to strike it rich. The infrastructure to pump and export billions of gallons of water is more than most farmers and ranchers could afford — so they can’t drain their own land. Nor will water exporters need to pay them top dollar for their largest tracts. All an exporter needs is a couple of acres and some antiquated property rights.

In Texas, landowners enjoy the “rule of capture,” a doctrine based in Roman and Old English law giving them the right to harvest whatever groundwater flows under their property, even if it causes problems for their neighbors. This regularly did cause problems between neighbors — especially if one neighbor was an industrial farmer — so in 1940, Texas established groundwater conservation districts to serve mostly as monitors and arbiters. As regulatory bodies, they are ill equipped to impose strong enough penalties to stop an operation like Bass’. District boundaries often follow county lines, a demarcation which, many have pointed out, means nothing to the water flowing below. If the district tells you no in one county, you can just go next door.

Some in Texas, including some Republican lawmakers, would like to see that change. Following the June 19 meeting in Jacksonville, the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District ultimately opted to kick Bass’s permit request to the State Office of Administrative Hearings, a referee in complex regulatory fights that’s intended to give citizens, companies, and government entities a legal forum for high-stakes disputes — like who gets to pump 15 billion gallons of East Texas groundwater. The hearing has yet to be scheduled, in part because of lawsuits filed by many of the people and businesses who could be affected. But the outcry in Jacksonville sparked a growing awareness that every single Texas politician represents one of two kinds of places: districts that need water, or those that stand to lose it.

“We cannot compromise one region for another,” State Representative Cecil Bell said to another packed room, this time at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. The House Natural Resources Committee convened on July 15 specifically to talk about Bass’ permits, but found themselves wrestling with the statewide dilemma as well. The 11-hour hearing was like a marble and brass version of the Jacksonville meeting, complete with air conditioning problems in the Capitol annex. Many of those who showed up in cowboy hats to Jacksonville were now in suits and ties. In addition to the 13 members of the committee, six state representatives and two state senators stayed seated on the dais until nearly midnight — a startling show of interest in a topic usually delegated to staffers and lobbyists.

That night, several expert witnesses and more than one state representative suggested that it might be time to rethink the rule of capture and move toward a more modern means of regulation that can balance the needs of neighbors and water systems across the state. But property rights in Texas are sacrosanct, and folks in rural Texas don’t necessarily trust the government — even the one they voted for — to regulate in their favor.

Industry veteran Johnnie Parker, owner of a wastewater cleaning company near the area Bass wants to pump, attended the hearing in Austin — he was one of the few attendees who’d stuck with jeans and a ball cap instead of a suit — and expressed doubts about whether the Legislature or even the State Office of Administrative Hearings would ever side with rural East Texas. “To me it’s a circus when it comes to these hearings and what not … there’s a lot of things that happen behind closed doors that the general public doesn’t get to see,” Parker said, sitting on a bench in the vaulted, echoing hallway outside the hearing. He rubbed his fingers together to indicate the power of money. “Until the Legislature gets together and decides they want to change the laws on how these things are regulated, this is just a smoke screen.”

Most of the testimony indicated that regulation should fall to the groundwater conservation districts, which would need “more teeth” to protect their jurisdictions. That might be the most politically feasible way forward. The Legislature this year already raised the maximum fine allowed for overpumping, from $10,000 to $25,000. It also considered a bill to increase funding for groundwater research, which could help develop tools for better real-time monitoring of water levels in high-demand aquifers like the Carrizo-Wilcox. High-quality monitoring could give the groundwater conservation districts the data they need to say no to big projects that are deemed unsustainable. Additional legislation could help those denials hold up in court when property owners dispute them.

Representative Cody Harris represents most of the area where Bass wants to pump and also happens to chair the Texas House Natural Resources Committee. After the hearing, he filed two bills in the special legislative sessions Texas convened in July and August — one bill to prohibit water exports from East Texas and another to fund a study of the Carrizo-Wilcox to determine just how vulnerable it is to over-pumping. The clock ran out on both bills, but Harris feels confident they will fare well in the 2027 Legislature, which many expect to be dominated by water issues.

But the Austin hearing underscored an uneasy feeling growing in some rural communities. While the science and governance of millions and billions of gallons were extensively debated, barely a question was asked about the millions and billions of dollars to be made selling that water. Back in Jacksonville, speaker after speaker had scoffed at the idea that Bass would walk away from profit if it hurt his rural neighbors. But in Austin, it was only Parker, out in the hall, talking about the influence money would have on the future of water in Texas. For him and others raising concerns, the water wars are the latest example illuminating the power big money can wield over politics when regulation — usually anathema to free-market conservatism — isn’t strong enough to keep it in check.

This tension between political principle and existential threat was evident back in Jacksonville at the hearing on June 19, when Miria Dean — who lives two miles from Redtown Ranch — chatted with others who’d arrived too late or given up trying to get on the list of speakers inside. She told me she saw Bass’ plans as “greed, pure and simple.” What’s legal and what’s right aren’t always the same, she said. Then she paused, smiled, and added, “Happy Juneteenth, right?” We regarded each other, both taking in the significance of the holiday that happened to coincide with the hearing. Slavery was once legal in this country, but it had never been right.

When I asked who should intervene to stop Bass, Dean recoiled at the idea of big government. But her stance was more complex than that. “We still want the government’s hands off. We don’t want their nose in our business. We want them to step in, but only as far as we want them to step.”

Even capitalism, the guiding ethos of small government, is no longer a free pass. “Capitalism is a great thing,” one speaker said at the Jacksonville hearing. “Unfettered capitalism is bad.” The crowd applauded.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Texas-aquifers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-19 06:57:38.381057

The oil can coat feathers and fur of wildlife, poison marine life and destroy sensitive habitats like coral reefs and mangroves.

Different types of technology can be used to prevent and treat oil spills, helping to protect ecosystems and recover as much oil as possible.

Energy Digital has ranked 10 of the top oil spill response technologies.

10. Autonomous surface vessels

Leading company: Sea Machines Robotics

Founder & CEO: Michael G. Johnson

HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, US

In 2019, Sea Machines Robotics successfully deployed the industry’s first autonomous spill-response vessel.

The autonomous systems are placed on skimmer boats and can be controlled remotely to deploy on-board booms, skimmer belts and other equipment.

It can be operated in an unmanned autonomous mode, allowing operators to respond to spill events without exposing crewmembers to challenging weather or toxic fumes.

The vessel has the potential to increase the safety, productivity and predictability of response for marine oil spill operations.

9. Drones and aerial surveillance

Leading company: Chevron

CEO: Mike Wirth

HQ: Houston, Texas, US

A remotely monitored drone – called an AiRanger – can help inspect oil and gas pipelines.

Chevron, working together with American Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (AATI), became the first companies permitted to use these uncrewed aircrafts by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The AiRanger has a wingspan of 18 feet, making it larger than a traditional drone but smaller than a piloted plane.

It can fly for 12 hours which is more than twice as long as other types of aircraft, providing real-time reports of any threats and risks in Chevron’s pipelines which could lead to spills.

8. X-band radar-based detection

Leading company: Petrobras

CEO: Magda Chambriard

HQ: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Brazil’s environmental agency reached an agreement with Petrobras in 2018, encouraging the company to expand its oil spill detection operations in the Campos Basin near Rio de Janeiro.

Ocean monitoring company Miros Group provided Petrobras with oil spill surveillance technology.

The system provides continuous automatic oil spill detection using x-band radar, thermal imaging, vessel tracking and infrared cameras.

It can help to accurately detect oil spills early on, allowing Petrobras to respond to the spills and recover as much oil as possible.

7. Satellite monitoring technology

Leading company: Saudi Aramco

CEO: Amin H. Nasser

HQ: Dhahran, Saudi Arabia

Petroleum and natural gas company Saudi Aramco has introduced satellite technology to help detect marine oil spills.

This is to help protect coral reefs, due to the threat oil spills pose to the economy and the environment.

The satellite features Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors (SAR) that provide high-resolution images that allow oil slicks to be identified due to disrupted ocean backscatter.

Aramco’s technology can help make informed decisions to safeguard people, assets and the natural environment.

It provides advantages including rapid spill identification, real-time imagery for spill impact management and threat assessments.

6. Sorbents

Leading company: Sorbcontrol

General Manager: Juan Francisco Pozzi

HQ: Barcelona, Spain

Sorbents are materials that soak up oil while repelling water, removing the last traces of oil that mechanical methods usually miss.

Sorbcontrol specialises in designing and producing a variety of oil spill solutions, including sorbents. The company says it has worked with businesses including Repsol.

It provides sorbents that can treat both marine and industrial spills, with sorbents that can absorb only hydrocarbons or those that absorb all liquids, including chemicals and water.

Juan Francisco Pozzi, General Manager at Sorbcontrol, said on LinkedIn: “Seeing our solutions in action reinforces our commitment to helping teams tackle environmental challenges head-on and protect our oceans.”

5. Subsea containment and recovery systems

Leading company: Ambipar

CEO: Tercio Borlenghi Jr.

Offshore containment aims to capture and collect oil directly from the source of the leak, before sending it to surface vessels for removal.

If successfully deployed, offshore containment can prevent the majority of leaking oil from reaching the environment.

Companies like Ambipar offer equipment that can be rented out to tackle oil spills.

Its containment package includes a 10 foot container, offshore boom and hydraulic hoses, while its recovery package includes an offshore skimmer and a transfer pump.

4. Capping stacks

Leading company: Shell

CEO: Wael Sawan

HQ: London, UK

The Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) was founded by Shell and other global oil and gas leaders to better prepare the industry for deepwater well control incidents.

This initiative is designed for subsea well containment, featuring equipment including capping stacks.

A capping stack is placed over a well to shut it in and stop the flow of oil and gas, containing any spills and mitigating environmental damage.

The equipment is designed to be quickly transported to an incident site and lowered to the well, where its valves can be closed to contain oil.

3. Chemical dispersants

Leading company: bp

CEO: Murray Auchincloss

HQ: London, UK

bp extensively used dispersants during the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, which was one of the biggest oil spills in history.

Chemical dispersants are used to mitigate the impact of an oil spill from coating shorelines and harming coastal wildlife.

During the incident, bp applied chemical dispersants on the surface of the water using aircrafts and directly into the well at the source of the spill.

Dispersants work by breaking down oil into smaller drops that can more easily mix with the water, which helps remove it from the surface of the ocean.

To be fully effective, chemical dispersants must be added into the water quickly after an oil spill has taken place.

2. Oil skimmers

Leading company: Enbridge

CEO: Gregory Ebel

HQ: Calgary, Canada

Enbridge uses different types of oil skimmers for both industrial cleaning and emergency oil spill response.

One type of skimmer is an oleophilic (oil-attracting) skimmer, which is used to lift oil from the surface of the water.

These can be belt skimmers which use a continuous belt and wiper blessed to scrape oil into a container, or mop skimmers which use a series of mops to blot oil from the water.

Enbridge also employs tube skimmers, using a floating horizontal tube to collect oil which is then stripped off and drained into a collection vessel.

Despite having strict oil spill response measures, the company says it believes that all incidents can be prevented.

It aims to limit the environmental impact of spills by working to contain the oil, prevent further damage and protect nearby wildlife.

1. Containment booms

Leading company: ExxonMobil

CEO: Darren Woods

HQ: Houston, Texas, US

The Valdez oil spill took place in 1989 and was one of the biggest learning experiences in ExxonMobil’s history.

The company took immediate responsibility for the spill and worked to clean it up using technology like containment booms.

Containment booms are temporary floating barriers used to contain oil on the surface of water to prevent it from spreading.

In the oil spill, ExxonMobil first focused on protecting nearby salmon hatcheries by deploying booms between the oil and the salmon streams.

After oil was contained by the booms, it was removed by skimmers and other treatments.

Containment booms are very commonly used to treat oil spills thanks to their high effectiveness in various weather conditions including wind and storms.

Darren Woods, CEO and Chairman of ExxonMobil, says: “We have a philosophy to be the most responsible operator in our industry.

“For as long as there’s a demand for oil and gas, you want the most responsible companies producing that.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a61ec1f2fc0d1b35bcd7fdaff404487c:356a89f49bb7c6947238ba30f6420443/energy-top10-graphics-cms-oil-spill-response-technologies.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 06:00:23.573476

The city, which already has 24 gas stations — roughly one for every 2,000 residents — first enacted the moratorium in May. On Tuesday night, council members extended that pause another 180 days to allow time for changes to Littleton’s Unified Land Use Code.

“The City of Littleton put in place a development moratorium for Fuel Sales (Retail) uses that were not already under review on May 6, 2025,” said Jessica Bixenman, the city’s communications director. “The moratorium was established after a study session that discussed the existing number and proposed additional fuel sales locations within the city. An economic analysis of fuel sales uses was provided at the Sept. 16, 2025, City Council meeting. As a result of that meeting, City Council directed staff to extend the moratorium and draft a text amendment to the Unified Land Use Code (ULUC) focusing on where the use would be allowed and implementing additional development standards. Staff intends to hold a study session with the Planning Commission in January as a next step in completing the text amendment to the ULUC. Tonight's council action is the extension of the moratorium to complete the code amendments.”

For Puspa Poudel, who has owned Horizon Food and Gas for eight years, the pause offers some optimism amid high competition from large chains.

“When we started, it was really, really good at the beginning. But nowadays, you know, like how lots of new gas stations came — things change,” Poudel said. “When a big gas station opens right next to you, you really cannot compete much, and then it hurts your business.”

“They are purchasing inventory high, so they get the better deal. And you really cannot compete, because you already buy your purchasing price so high. I'm really, really hoping no more new builds,” she said.

City officials say the existing number of gas stations already meets the needs of Littleton’s 46,000 residents, while electric vehicle adoption continues to grow statewide.

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said EV sales in the state have jumped in recent years.

Littleton extends pause on new gas stations as city eyes a cleaner future

“If you look back over the last year, it's varied a little bit, but it's varied between about 25 and 33% of new vehicle sales being EVs,” Toor said. “When you think of the smog and ozone problem we have in Denver and in the northern Front Range, one of the biggest things we can do to tackle that air pollution is move to electric vehicles.”

""The Energy Office really has the mission of both improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas pollution while helping to reduce consumer energy costs,"" Toor added, saying state-level tax credits have helped customers overcome initial costs. ""We think that those consumer incentives have really helped people to get past the first cost of an EV so that they can then benefit from all of those long-term fuel and maintenance savings.""

While Toor said Colorado’s market momentum for EVs is likely to continue, he noted the federal government is “certainly going in a different direction.”

“The Trump administration has turned away from electric vehicles, whether... removing vehicle emission standards that supported cleaner vehicles, including electric vehicles, or removing the federal tax credit that was $7,500 for each passenger vehicle,” Toor said. “It's a little early for us to know what the impact is going to be, but it's certainly going to make it... harder for EVs in the United States.”

“This stuff is generating astronomical amounts of money for localities,” data center developer Tom Dakich said. “We do a bad job of bringing the transparency of those numbers, and the numbers are staggering.”

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroad data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”

Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.

Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.

“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.

Soliday, who chairs the Indiana House’s energy committee, said no clapping, booing or signage is allowed during his meetings — and critiqued chaotic local gatherings.

He wants every SAGE project to create jobs or revenue for the tribe.
In November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first.","This summer, Len Necefer finally planned the road trip he’s been thinking about for nearly a decade: Going coast-to-coast in an electric vehicle, stopping only to charge on tribal lands.

As a Navajo citizen and tribal energy expert who used to work in the federal government, he saw it as the ultimate test of how far energy infrastructure had come.

Stop by stop, his plans came together until North Dakota, where a dearth of chargers seemed to prevent a Midwest crossing. Then, he spotted it: a level-2 charger at Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Reservation.

50 States, 50 Fixes is a series about local solutions to environmental problems. A few more to come this year.

It was more than a lucky break. Over the past three years, Standing Rock has installed chargers across the reservation as part of the Electric Nation project, a regional effort to create an intertribal charging network.

By the time the project wraps at the end of November, Standing Rock Nation will operate 13 E.V. chargers, most of them in North Dakota. While there aren’t many E.V.s in town yet, each new charger makes driving one easier than before.

“I want to show folks that this technology is not out of our affordable reach, but that it is here for us to use,” said Joseph McNeil, the chief executive of SAGE, a clean energy organization owned by the tribe that is spearheading the project.

The Standing Rock Reservation, home to the Lakota and Dakota peoples, is rural and spread out, straddling the border between North and South Dakota. The cost of gas aggravates the reservation’s high poverty rates. With the closest commercial centers at least an hour away, access to reliable transportation is a measure of well being.

“Our economic situation shouldn’t dictate our access to sustainability,” Mr. McNeil said. He wants every SAGE project to create jobs or revenue for the tribe. Institutions that are hosting the E.V. chargers, like the college, will eventually take ownership of them and collect any revenue.

SAGE’s project director, Fawn Wasin Zi, said E.V.s were part of a longstanding push for clean energy on the reservation. In 2016, the tribe was in the midst of planning a wind farm when protests to block the Dakota Access Pipeline engulfed the reservation. Their fight against a plan to transport oil over their sacred lands was recognized with an award from the Wallace Global Fund, which came with a $250,000 prize and a $1 million investment earmarked for the ongoing wind farm project.

The tribe may be widely known for the anti-pipeline movement, Ms. Wasin Zi said, “but there’s so much more going on.” She was managing the wind project at the time and used the prize to start SAGE. “The traditional way is to live with Unci Maka, Grandmother Earth, not against her,” she said.

The pipeline also helped inspire the regional E.V. project.

“As I was protesting, I thought, ‘What if we connected all the tribes in an electric vehicle charging network?’” said Robert Blake, a solar energy developer in Minneapolis. “It would be another form of resistance against fossil fuel infrastructure.” A few years later, Mr. Blake formed Native Sun, a nonprofit group dedicated to renewable energy outreach in tribal nations.

In 2021, Native Sun and SAGE teamed up and jointly won a $6 million Department of Energy grant to create Electric Nation. More funders followed, and the project took off.

Today, eight chargers have been installed at key locations around Standing Rock including local schools, a tribal administration building, Sitting Bull College and two casinos. Four more, coming later this month, will mark the completion of the project.

There’s even more in Red Lake Nation, where Mr. Blake is from. He has heard from other tribes in different parts of the country who now want to recreate Electric Nation on their lands. The network is a crucial first step in helping residents see gas-free cars as a viable, climate-friendly option.

SAGE has also used grant funding to give six electric vehicles to various institutions across the reservation.

These vehicles are improving daily life in small but meaningful ways. Sitting Bull College’s facilities director, Scott Gates, now uses a Ford Lightning E.V. to haul equipment and rescue cars stuck in the snow. Leo Red Horse, a clerk at the tribe’s administrative offices, takes an electric shuttle, provided by Standing Rock Public Transit, to work most mornings. Four teachers share a ride to the local elementary school in a Chevy Blazer, which is often plugged in to the school’s solar-powered chargers.

In November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first. It will take riders as far as Bismarck, N.D., the nearest commercial hub, an hour away. The school district also has plans to purchase several more electric vehicles for teacher car pools, along with some electric school buses.

SAGE hopes to eventually place a community-shared E.V. and charger in each of the reservation’s eight districts. In a place with a 40 percent poverty rate, free access to an E.V. matters. Even though electric cars typically cost less than gas ones over the lifetime of the vehicle, the initial purchase does not.

There’s also broad concern about how the cars will fare in the region’s harsh winters. Cold weather, combined with energy needed to heat the car, can affect battery efficiency and cause an E.V.’s range to drop by up to 30 percent.

Climate-friendly choices often have to take a back seat in light of the struggles many people on the reservation face daily, like affording food for the next day, said Steve Sitting Bear, the tribe’s recently elected chairman.

But, “inherently, as tribal members, we don’t like to see the destruction of the environment, of our land, the poisoning of our water,” he said. “I want us to be a self-sufficient, sovereign nation leading the way, whether that’s with wind or solar.”

Today, SAGE’s small team is juggling several projects alongside building out the electric vehicle network, including the ongoing wind farm development and a community solar project.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18cli-50x50-nd-promo-jghb/18cli-50x50-nd-promo-jghb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 02:58:10.609303

The federal subsidies did not guarantee that nuclear energy could be produced at competitive rates compared to other generation sources.
These states also adopted additional state-level derisking policies to provide further impetus for developers to undertake nuclear projects.
Welton and Harrison suggest that additional public oversight of derisking initiatives is necessary to manage the hidden risks associated with energy projects that rely on derisking policies.
Climate derisking is a complex and uncertain method for pursuing clean energy, Welton and Harrison acknowledge.","Scholars argue that failed nuclear projects reveal flaws in strategies to promote renewable energy today.

With climate change, many scientists fear that if countries do not mitigate global warming through decarbonization, sea levels will continue to rise, natural disasters will become more common, and large swaths of the planet may become uninhabitable.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which the U.S. Congress adopted in 2022, aims to encourage private investment in renewable energy. It seeks to promote this investment through “derisking”—the use of government incentives to increase the attractiveness of private investments into clean energy by minimizing the risk of profit loss. Sometimes referred to as a “carrots without sticks” approach to decarbonization, the IRA leverages tax credits for clean energy industries and includes conditions that enhance the value of these tax credits to spur investment.

In a recent article, Shelley Welton of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Conor Harrison of the University of South Carolina critique the IRA’s derisking approach by examining a prior use of this strategy—a failed attempt to revive the U.S. nuclear energy industry in the early 2000s. Drawing on this failure, they argue that derisking clean energy projects may result in utility ratepayers bearing the financial burden of projects with little to no decarbonization benefits.

Derisking strategies have been present in the United States for a long time, note Welton and Harrison. They trace these strategies back to land grants and financial incentives for railroads in the 1880s. Over the past 50 years, the U.S. government has leveraged risk mitigation tools to promote renewable energy following the advent of electricity markets—often with great success, according to Welton and Harrison.

Yet they point to one former climate derisking effort—the attempted restoration of U.S. nuclear power in the early 21st century—that they observe offers several important cautionary lessons for regulators.

Starting in 2000, concerns about rising energy prices, air pollution, and the recent accident-free record of nuclear generation prompted utilities to consider new investments. A subsequent broad lobbying effort culminated in the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This law offered production tax credits, loan guarantees, and risk insurance to utilities willing to invest in new nuclear reactors. Welton and Harrison explain that the goal of these incentives was to lower the barrier to entry for utilities and help shield investors and lenders from risks associated with the new projects.

But according to Welton and Harrison, these incentives failed to entice a large majority of U.S. energy firms. The federal subsidies did not guarantee that nuclear energy could be produced at competitive rates compared to other generation sources. Welton and Harrison explain that only a handful of southern states—those that relied on traditional public utility regulation that ensured utilities could pass construction costs onto customers—chose to pursue these nuclear incentives. These states also adopted additional state-level derisking policies to provide further impetus for developers to undertake nuclear projects.

The results were grim, say Welton and Harrison. They observe that Georgia’s Plant Vogtle was the sole example of a completed nuclear reactor built using incentives provided by the Energy Policy Act. This project, however, was completed over a decade behind schedule and cost more than $35 billion, double its initial budget.

South Carolina fared no better, according to Welton and Harrison. They explain that the state never completed its nuclear venture, leaving two unfinished reactors and nearly $9 billion in costs. Florida and North Carolina, two other states that pursued nuclear investments, also abandoned their projects. Utilities forced ratepayers to shoulder much of the financial burden of these failed nuclear projects with very little to show for them, Welton and Harrison note.

Drawing on these case studies, Welton and Harrison identify a few hidden risks in derisking initiatives that threaten to derail future climate investment. For example, they cite permitting hurdles and legal challenges that have frequently delayed energy projects. Welton and Harrison explain that new energy ventures often unfold at a glacial pace, spanning decades. At the same time, energy markets undergo dramatic shifts in the background, changing the financial calculus that prompted the initial project investments. Political and institutional commitments also keep these failed projects alive long after investors should have withdrawn their support.

Welton and Harrison argue that poorly designed derisking strategies—ones that do not adequately address these hidden risks—result in clean energy projects that can harm communities and fail to decarbonize the grid. Local communities will frequently bear the financial burden of these projects, despite the promised national benefits these projects often fail to deliver. Welton and Harrison suggest that additional public oversight of derisking initiatives is necessary to manage the hidden risks associated with energy projects that rely on derisking policies.

Climate derisking is a complex and uncertain method for pursuing clean energy, Welton and Harrison acknowledge. But they note that derisking is the politically viable path chosen by Congress, through the IRA, to address a warming climate. It is now up to federal administrators to protect against misguided projects, and their agencies must expand their capacities to manage the clean energy transition, Welton and Harrison argue.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bradley11.19.2025-526258524.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 01:59:34.988862

The charging record also highlights an uncomfortable truth we’ve been tracking at EVXL: Chinese automakers are winning the ultra-fast charging race.
There’s also the infrastructure problem: where exactly are you supposed to use this 450 kW charging capability?","The Lotus Emeya has set a new benchmark for production electric vehicle charging performance, reaching a peak rate of 443 kW during independent testing conducted by Lotus Al Ghanim in Kuwait. Using Lotus’s proprietary 450 kW DC ultra-fast charger, the hyper-GT completed a 10-80% charge in just 13 minutes and 35 seconds, even under extreme heat conditions. The achievement cements the Emeya’s position as one of the fastest-charging electric vehicles available to consumers in 2025.

The record represents a significant improvement over the Emeya’s previous charging benchmark. Earlier this year, the same vehicle achieved 402 kW during testing, charging from 10-80% in 14 minutes. That performance already placed the Lotus ahead of high-performance rivals like the Porsche Taycan and Hyundai Ioniq 6, which typically charge in the 300 kW range.

Advanced Battery and Cooling Technology Enable Record Speed

The Emeya’s charging performance is enabled by a cell-to-pack battery structure, which increases usable cell density by around 20% compared with traditional module-based designs. Lotus pairs this with a redesigned cooling system to maintain thermal stability during sustained high-power charging events.

Its 800-volt architecture, shared with the Lotus Eletre, boosts charging speed and improves overall efficiency. The system reduces heat, supports repeated fast-charging sessions, and helps keep energy consumption as low as 18.7 kWh/100 km (62 miles). Under ideal conditions, the Emeya can add up to 310 km (193 miles) of range in just 10 minutes.

The 2026 Emeya variant boasts a WLTP-rated range of up to 379 miles (610 km), making it one of the most efficient long-range EVs in its class. This reinforces Lotus’s commitment to both performance and practical real-world range. The engineering precision philosophy extends across Lotus’s history, evident in its EVs and collectible lightweight sports cars.

Charging Ecosystem and European Rollout

Lotus is expanding its 450 kW DC charging network across Europe, starting in Germany, with additional markets to follow. The ecosystem integrates with the Lotus Cars app and the brand’s HyperOS infotainment platform, offering intelligent EV routing, energy-aware trip planning and real-time charging optimization.

This growth supports the brand’s broader multi-powertrain strategy, which now includes future models like the upcoming plug-in hybrid Emira, showing how Lotus is balancing its electrified future with more traditional performance offerings.

Why This Record Matters

Reaching 443 kW puts the Emeya right at the forefront of real-world charging performance, showing Lotus’s ambition to lead the performance-EV market. As charging networks get better around the world, this kind of high-power charging will be key to cutting down on long-distance travel times and making EVs with big batteries more feasible.

For Lotus, this achievement makes the Emeya a standout in technology and highlights the company’s goal to merge its performance heritage with the latest in electrification, even as the business itself is going through changes.

EVXL’s Take

Lotus just achieved something genuinely impressive: the fastest production EV charging speed we’ve seen outside China’s domestic market. The 443 kW peak and sub-14-minute charging time beat Porsche, beat Tesla, and beat every traditional Western automaker. That’s the good news.

Here’s the uncomfortable reality: technical excellence doesn’t pay the bills. Lotus announced 550 job cuts at its historic Hethel headquarters in August 2025—40% of its UK workforce—after sales dropped 42% in Q1 2025. The company posted a $183 million net loss and is drowning in $3.3 billion of debt despite Geely’s massive investment. The Emeya and Eletre EVs, built in China, delivered just 719 units combined in Q1. Meanwhile, the company is pivoting to plug-in hybrids because pure EV demand hasn’t materialized as expected.

The charging record also highlights an uncomfortable truth we’ve been tracking at EVXL: Chinese automakers are winning the ultra-fast charging race. While Lotus hits 443 kW, Chinese rival Zeekr is achieving 630 kW peaks with its 7X SUV, charging from 10-80% in under 10 minutes. BYD announced 1,000 kW charging capability that adds 249 miles in just five minutes. Lotus is celebrating a record that’s already been surpassed in the Chinese market where the Emeya is actually manufactured.

There’s also the infrastructure problem: where exactly are you supposed to use this 450 kW charging capability? In the U.S., Tesla’s V4 Superchargers max out at 500 kW, and those are still rare. Most public fast chargers deliver 150-250 kW. Electrify America stations hit 350 kW if you’re lucky and they’re working. Lotus is building its own 450 kW network in Europe, but that’s a chicken-and-egg problem: you need critical mass of vehicles to justify the infrastructure investment, and Lotus sold just 41 vehicles in Australia through July 2025.

The Emeya represents everything Lotus does well: brilliant engineering, cutting-edge technology, genuine performance credibility. It also represents everything Lotus struggles with: premium pricing in a value-conscious EV market, Chinese manufacturing facing Western tariff barriers, and a brand identity crisis between heritage sports cars and luxury EVs.

So yes, 443 kW is legitimately impressive. The engineering team at Lotus deserves recognition for pushing the boundaries of what’s commercially available. But world-class charging speed won’t save a company that can’t move metal off dealer lots. In the EV industry’s brutal shakeout, technical prowess is table stakes—survival requires solving the much harder problems of cost structure, market positioning, and achieving scale.

Most non-Tesla charging stations had become inoperable, suggesting a disturbing motive. Public outrage expressed how these actions could impede progress toward cleaner transportation.

The Redditor shared their situation in the r/Reno subreddit. They described widespread vandalism that had crippled the city's EV charging infrastructure. The post is from three years ago, yet it highlights an ongoing issue.

""Some nut job has cut all the EV charging cables in Reno except for Tesla,"" the user wrote. ""I have nowhere to charge my car for work now.""

The user said Electrify America stations in Sparks, Nevada, and EVgo cables were targets as well.

""The cables were cut at the base of the charging station. They didn't leave anything behind,"" they explained.

Some believed it was a deliberate act of destruction rather than theft. The pattern of vandalism had left many EV drivers in Reno without charging access.

Instances of EV and charging station vandalism such as this are frustrating for drivers.

By September 2024, vandals had cut 215 of the 1,000 Electrify America charging stations in North America, according to Insurance Journal. Similar incidents pose a significant barrier to the adoption of EVs.

Vandalized charging stations impact drivers' daily commute and ability to travel. This premeditated destruction can also make potential EV buyers hesitant. They may start thinking EVs have an unreliable infrastructure.

Vandalism can also slow the transition away from dirty energy sources such as gas and oil. Fewer EVs on the road means more tailpipe pollution, leading to poor air quality and public health in our communities.

Concerns about pollution from battery manufacturing are sometimes raised. However, cars with the ""dirtiest"" batteries are still cleaner than cars with no battery. Each year, millions of tons of minerals get used for the clean energy transition. This is a fraction of the billions of tons of dirty energy, burned and not reusable, extracted yearly.

More security and respect for charging stations could be a vital part of supporting a cleaner, safer future.

While progress may be on the way, EV drivers can reliably charge at home by installing solar panels. One of the many benefits of EVs is they are more cost-effective than gas-powered vehicles, with home solar energy being cheaper to use for charging than relying on the grid or public stations. Qmerit offers quick, free installation quotes for Level 2 chargers. EnergySage and its TCD-vetted local installers can save you up to $10,000 on installations.

The Reddit community called for action against the vandals.

""I bet they figured out a way to cut the cables … rather than take the time to figure out [Tesla's],"" one user guessed.

""You can always charge at the dealership for free too,"" another helpful Redditor wrote.

Power consumption has grown 20 gigawatts from the previous winter, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Tuesday in its winter assessment. A gigawatt is the typical size of a nuclear power reactor. Supply hasn’t kept up.

As as result, a repeat of severe winter storms in North America that unleash a polar vortex, of which there have been several in recent years, could trigger energy shortfalls across the US from the Northwest to Texas to the Carolinas. All regions have adequate resources in normal conditions.

“Data centers are a main contributor to load growth in those areas where demand has risen substantially since last winter.” Mark Olson, manager of the reliability assessment, said in an emailed statement.

America’s power grid has been facing rising blackout risks for years as aging infrastructure is increasingly stressed by severe storms and wildfires. Now the data center boom, driven by the spread of artificial intelligence, is adding to the strain by supercharging US electricity growth after being stagnant for two decades.

Winter is especially risky because solar generation is available for fewer hours and battery operations may be affected. Gas supplies, meantime, could drop off because of freeze-offs or pipeline constraints.

The areas designated by NERC as having elevated risks of shortfall shifted from the previous winter to include the US southeast and parts of the West, including Washington and Oregon.

The Texas grid continues to be highlighted after cascading failures in February 2021 left millions of people without power for days and resulted in more than 200 deaths. New England also continues to face elevated risks on potential natural gas pipeline constraints.

You pass through notorious Superfund marshes and speed through Newark's refinery smokestacks. East Coasters love to mock this “pollution alley,"" but here’s the twist: starting in the 1970s, New Jersey built some of the tightest refinery regulations in the country. If that corridor still feels toxic 50 years later, what's happening in states with far fewer protections?

When federal safeguards weaken, local rules decide how clean—or how dirty—the air gets. In mid-2025, the White House granted two-year delays for certain hazardous-air-pollutant standards covering dozens of large chemical-manufacturing facilities, including one within the Phillips 66 complex in Borger, Texas. Meanwhile, its sister refinery in New Jersey must carry on under the full force of both federal and state oversight. For families living near these plants, geography now dictates protection. Nearly 845,000 residents live within ten miles of New Jersey’s Bayway refinery—barely 2,200 around Borger’s—two very different stories emanating from similar operations and riding similar winds.

New Jersey — where the rules still mean something

The Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery in Linden processes about a quarter-million barrels of crude oil a day, bordered by neighborhoods, schools, and tidal marshes. Winds here usually blow from west to east, carrying faint refinery smells across Elizabeth and Bayonne toward the harbor and Staten Island. Residents notice it. But New Jersey’s environmental agency doesn’t wait for complaints; it has built some of the nation’s most stringent air pollutant regulations.

EPA modeling suggests that refineries the size and type of Bayway should carry some of the nation’s highest health risks from toxic air pollutants—driven mostly by formaldehyde and benzene. Yet that’s not what the real-world health impact data show. In the ten-mile corridor east and northeast of Bayway, where the emissions typically drift, COPD prevalence averages just under 5½ percent and cancer diagnoses just above 5½ percent—both below national levels. The likely reason: New Jersey’s unusually strict permitting rules and cumulative-risk reviews, which have forced steady reductions in emissions over time. The air isn’t pristine, but it’s measured, managed, and closely watched.

Each time Bayway seeks a permit or expansion, the state runs formal risk reviews that estimate potential cancer or health effects and require air-quality modeling to check whether emissions stay below safety targets. If the numbers don’t clear the bar, tighter limits or new controls follow. These reviews sit on top of federal rules that already require continuous benzene monitoring at refinery fencelines - think of a “fenceline” as where the plant’s air meets the public’s air, and the monitors are like smoke detectors that make sure pollution isn’t sneaking out. Bayway’s recent readings have stayed below the maximum levels, and state regulations go even further—folding the results into a broader look at cumulative risks (in NJ, other factors include automobile exhaust and pollutants from Newark International Airport) for nearby communities instead of treating each pollutant or permit in isolation.

Texas — where the guardrails are farther apart

A thousand miles from Linden, the Phillips 66 complex in Borger tells a similar story under looser rules. Built during the same early-20th-century oil boom as Bayway, it still anchors the skyline of this Panhandle town. The site actually includes two major operations: a refinery that handles about 150,000 barrels of crude a day and a chemical-manufacturing plant. The refinery remains covered by the federal refinery-sector standards, but the chemical unit was among roughly fifty facilities granted a two-year delay from updated federal hazardous-air-pollutant controls. For the next two years, that portion of the complex will rely primarily on Texas’s lighter-touch regulatory system.

Most of the year, Borger’s winds blow from the south, carrying emissions north toward Stinnett and Lake Meredith; in winter, they swing the other way. For many residents, the wind is simply part of life. Yet for those living downwind, the air doesn’t distinguish between refinery stacks and chemical stacks—it carries whatever leaves the fence line. In the ten-mile north-northeast sector downwind of Borger, the plant’s air toxins include a similar chemical profile: formaldehyde, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene. About 2,200 residents live inside that zone, and COPD rates sit at nearly 9½ percent, with cancer prevalence near 9 percent, both above Texas and national averages, and nearly double the rates seen in New Jersey.

Texas takes a lighter approach. The state environmental agency relies on Effects Screening Levels, guideline numbers for hundreds of chemicals that help decide whether a refinery’s projected emissions look acceptable. They’re not enforceable limits—just screens. If modeled levels exceed them, regulators may ask for adjustments, but plants usually keep operating while paperwork and negotiations continue. The refinery must still follow the same federal benzene fenceline rule as Bayway, yet other hazardous-air-pollutant controls that would tighten under HON are now paused. For the next two years, Borger’s air will depend largely on state discretion, not federal guidelines—a difference that runs like the wind.

Two refineries, same logo, different playbooks

On paper, the Bayway and Borger refineries operate under the same Clean Air Act rules and corporate safety commitments. In reality, though, their oversight couldn’t be more different. New Jersey measures and manages risk before a problem becomes a crisis; Texas trusts its screening levels and self-reporting to catch issues after the fact. With the federal HON standards on hold for at least two years, those differences now decide how much protection nearby families can count on. Same company, same history, same rulebook—but two entirely different games being played—one with referees on the field, one running only on the public’s trust.

Who’s in charge?

The EPA sets the national limits for hazardous organic emissions under the Clean Air Act. New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection goes further, layering its own risk thresholds and community reviews on top of those federal rules. Texas, by contrast, relies mainly on guideline numbers and industry self-reporting, stepping in only when those screens are exceeded. The result is a patchwork of protection that mirrors America’s political geography more than its science.

When federal protections pause, the air doesn’t. Pipes keep venting, wind keeps blowing, and communities keep breathing what comes their way. The real test will arrive not when rules restart, but when we measure what changed in their absence. New Jersey’s families will have spent those years under dual oversight. Borger’s will have spent them trusting that guidance levels and good intentions were enough. The question is not whether companies can meet the same standard, but whether the country still expects them to. Pollution and fairness drift on the same wind—and when safeguards go quiet, the air doesn’t wait. Neither should we.

For each refinery, I defined a 10-mile downwind sector based on prevailing winds (Bayway: ENE; Borger: NNE–ENE). I mapped a sector cone (±45–75° as needed to reflect seasonal shifts) and identified census tracts/ZCTAs whose centroids fall inside the cone.

See these rough images I used for all the screening tools:

Collected health indicators: COPD (age-adjusted %) from CDC PLACES; cancer (age-adjusted incidence per 100k) from state registries/USCS, using multi-year averages when tract/ZIP data were suppressed.

Quick note on federal government environmental data and monitoring tools

It’s shocking to see how federal data collection, online tools, and educational information have disappeared from federal websites like the EPA, FDA, and others. The scrubbing and removal of the tools and information will undoubtedly have significant, irreversible impacts…probably a really good topic for another piece. It reminds me of the story surrounding the public reporting of COVID infections and the unwillingness of a Florida official to manipulate the data in 2020.

For example:

AirToxScreen is still online at EPA and described as an annual screening tool. EPA pages indicate a 2020 assessment released May 2024 though there’s no indication that it will be updated going forward.

In early 2025 the administration removed EJScreen (the environmental justice mapping tool) and other equity/data tools from EPA’s website; lawsuits and watchdog reports have documented those removals. Data is certainly missing everywhere, but even basic usability has degraded on all sites.

As you cross the George Washington Bridge heading west, you can smell New Jersey. You pass through notorious Superfund marshes and speed through Newark's refinery smokestacks. East Coasters love to mock this “pollution alley,"" but here’s the twist: starting in the 1970s, New Jersey built some of the tightest refinery regulations in the country. If that corridor still feels toxic 50 years later, what's happening in states with far fewer protections?

When federal safeguards weaken, local rules decide how clean—or how dirty—the air gets. In mid-2025, the White House granted two-year delays for certain hazardous-air-pollutant standards covering dozens of large chemical-manufacturing facilities, including one within the Phillips 66 complex in Borger, Texas. Meanwhile, its sister refinery in New Jersey must carry on under the full force of both federal and state oversight. For families living near these plants, geography now dictates protection. Nearly 845,000 residents live within ten miles of New Jersey’s Bayway refinery—barely 2,200 around Borger’s—two very different stories emanating from similar operations and riding similar winds.

New Jersey — where the rules still mean something

The Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery in Linden processes about a quarter-million barrels of crude oil a day, bordered by neighborhoods, schools, and tidal marshes. Winds here usually blow from west to east, carrying faint refinery smells across Elizabeth and Bayonne toward the harbor and Staten Island. Residents notice it. But New Jersey’s environmental agency doesn’t wait for complaints; it has built some of the nation’s most stringent air pollutant regulations.

EPA modeling suggests that refineries the size and type of Bayway should carry some of the nation’s highest health risks from toxic air pollutants—driven mostly by formaldehyde and benzene. Yet that’s not what the real-world health impact data show. In the ten-mile corridor east and northeast of Bayway, where the emissions typically drift, COPD prevalence averages just under 5½ percent and cancer diagnoses just above 5½ percent—both below national levels. The likely reason: New Jersey’s unusually strict permitting rules and cumulative-risk reviews, which have forced steady reductions in emissions over time. The air isn’t pristine, but it’s measured, managed, and closely watched.

Each time Bayway seeks a permit or expansion, the state runs formal risk reviews that estimate potential cancer or health effects and require air-quality modeling to check whether emissions stay below safety targets. If the numbers don’t clear the bar, tighter limits or new controls follow. These reviews sit on top of federal rules that already require continuous benzene monitoring at refinery fencelines - think of a “fenceline” as where the plant’s air meets the public’s air, and the monitors are like smoke detectors that make sure pollution isn’t sneaking out. Bayway’s recent readings have stayed below the maximum levels, and state regulations go even further—folding the results into a broader look at cumulative risks (in NJ, other factors include automobile exhaust and pollutants from Newark International Airport) for nearby communities instead of treating each pollutant or permit in isolation.

Texas — where the guardrails are farther apart

A thousand miles from Linden, the Phillips 66 complex in Borger tells a similar story under looser rules. Built during the same early-20th-century oil boom as Bayway, it still anchors the skyline of this Panhandle town. The site actually includes two major operations: a refinery that handles about 150,000 barrels of crude a day and a chemical-manufacturing plant. The refinery remains covered by the federal refinery-sector standards, but the chemical unit was among roughly fifty facilities granted a two-year delay from updated federal hazardous-air-pollutant controls. For the next two years, that portion of the complex will rely primarily on Texas’s lighter-touch regulatory system.

Most of the year, Borger’s winds blow from the south, carrying emissions north toward Stinnett and Lake Meredith; in winter, they swing the other way. For many residents, the wind is simply part of life. Yet for those living downwind, the air doesn’t distinguish between refinery stacks and chemical stacks—it carries whatever leaves the fence line. In the ten-mile north-northeast sector downwind of Borger, the plant’s air toxins include a similar chemical profile: formaldehyde, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene. About 2,200 residents live inside that zone, and COPD rates sit at nearly 9½ percent, with cancer prevalence near 9 percent, both above Texas and national averages, and nearly double the rates seen in New Jersey.

Texas takes a lighter approach. The state environmental agency relies on Effects Screening Levels, guideline numbers for hundreds of chemicals that help decide whether a refinery’s projected emissions look acceptable. They’re not enforceable limits—just screens. If modeled levels exceed them, regulators may ask for adjustments, but plants usually keep operating while paperwork and negotiations continue. The refinery must still follow the same federal benzene fenceline rule as Bayway, yet other hazardous-air-pollutant controls that would tighten under HON are now paused. For the next two years, Borger’s air will depend largely on state discretion, not federal guidelines—a difference that runs like the wind.

Two refineries, same logo, different playbooks

On paper, the Bayway and Borger refineries operate under the same Clean Air Act rules and corporate safety commitments. In reality, though, their oversight couldn’t be more different. New Jersey measures and manages risk before a problem becomes a crisis; Texas trusts its screening levels and self-reporting to catch issues after the fact. With the federal HON standards on hold for at least two years, those differences now decide how much protection nearby families can count on.

China is eyeing the global electric truck market Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China’s trucking fleet, the world’s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and “in other countries, it might never take off,” he said.

Costs fall in China’s electric truck pivot

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are twice to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle’s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

“When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,” Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China’s 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.

Global energy markets will feel the impact

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“The rise of China’s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,” said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of ICCT Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell’s 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world’s largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China’s electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a “transitional step” unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China’s is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer’s fleet. This will make it “almost impossible” for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

China is eyeing the global electric truck market

Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China’s hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVS to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China’s Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It is has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey.

Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn’t comment on competitors but welcomed “competition on fair terms,” while Scania did not respond.

“Things are shaking up,” Daiss said. ___

November 5: CAC President Elizabeth Wydra joined Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to discuss Learning Resources v. Trump.","This month, the Supreme Court is considering two major challenges to Trump overreach—one on its merits docket and one on its shadow docket—and CAC has been involved in both.

At the beginning of November, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Trump’s unlawful tariffs. Our amicus brief ex

plained that President Trump doesn’t have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to single-handedly set global tariffs. As CAC Legal Fellow Simon Chin explained after oral argument, “The Government argues that when Congress passed IEEPA, in 1977, it carried forward authority over tariffs from an older law called the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). But as Neal Katyal, counsel for the private challengers, emphasized at oral argument when citing our brief, a 1933 amendment to TWEA severed that law from its original war powers foundations.”

The stakes of this case are high, as CAC President Elizabeth Wydra emphasized in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Elizabeth explained, the Court has “so far, in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs. This will be a test of whether they will actually be the check that the Constitution envisions on the Executive.”

Among Trump’s many other disturbing power grabs has been his deployment of the National Guard in American cities. CAC is fighting back in courts from coast to coast, filing amicus briefs against Trump’s unlawful use of the National Guard in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

Most recently, CAC filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining why it should deny the government’s request to stay a district court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. Our brief explains that Martin v. Mott, a case arising out of the War of 1812, doesn’t insulate the President’s deployment decision from judicial review.

Because the Trump administration relies on Mott in claiming that courts can’t review its decision to deploy the Guard, CAC’s historical research has been a helpful resource in setting the record straight. Our brief was cited as providing a valuable perspective in Slate magazine and the One First newsletter. And when Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, seemingly claimed that Trump had unreviewable “plenary power,” CAC’s Deputy Chief Counsel Brian Frazelle was quick to explain that he was “flat wrong.”

With both the Los Angeles National guard case and the consolidated tariffs cases before the Supreme Court, CAC’s historical research provides key context and insight for the Justices. As Elizabeth suggested, now is the Supreme Court’s chance to show it can serve as a check on the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Appalachian Voices v. Environmental Protection Agency — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally terminate an entire mandatory grant program created by Congress. Our brief argues that the Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits the President from unilaterally withholding federal funds based on disagreement with congressional policy, and because the Trump administration unilaterally terminated a mandatory grant program, the executive branch violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, brief filed November 3.

League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President — WIN — The D.C. District Court held that President Trump’s executive order requiring proof of citizenship on the Federal Form for registering voters violated the separation of powers. Echoing our brief, the court observed that the Elections Clause “provides that Congress—not the President—is the check on States’ authority to regulate federal elections.” C. District Court, decision rendered October 31.

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs—namely, that the relevant federal law incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA)—explaining why this narrative is unsound at every step. Supreme Court, brief filed October 24.

Illinois v. Trump— WIN — In October 2025, the Seventh Circuit denied the administration’s motion for a stay, leaving in place a district court order that prevents troops from deploying in Chicago. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit adopted the reasoning of CAC’s amicus brief to conclude that Martin v. Mott does not foreclose judicial review. The Trump administration subsequently asked the Supreme Court to stay the district court’s order, and CAC filed an amicus brief opposing the administration’s application, reiterating our arguments about why courts can review the President’s decisions to mobilize the National Guard. That application is currently pending. Seventh Circuit, brief filed October 12, decision rendered October 16, brief filed in Supreme Court October 20.

Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS — WIN — In a case challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to cut off funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. The Court addressed—and rejected—the government’s jurisdictional argument. Echoing our brief, the Court understood the Plaintiffs to challenge the government’s failure to comply with the TVPRA’s mandate, rather than raise a breach-of-contract claim. Ninth Circuit, decision rendered October 10.

Grundmann v. Trump — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether Donald Trump’s attempted firing of the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority was illegal. Our brief explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt, and also demonstrates that the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. C. Circuit, brief filed October 10.

“News of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners [and] governments that have been looking for a simple, prescriptive definition that the whole country can operate off of,” Zeldin said at the signing.

According to a fact sheet released by the agency on Monday, the proposal will impact the government’s definition of “waters of the United States,” commonly referred to as WOTUS, which defines the scope of federal jurisdiction over Clean Water Act permitting.

The proposed rule would exclude groundwater from the definition, and would no longer automatically protect interstate waters.

It would also significantly limit which wetlands and streams are protected under the Clean Water Act, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. According to NRDC, that move would exclude many critical wetlands and seasonal streams that it says are essential for drinking water supplies, flood control and ecosystem health.

In an interview on Monday, RJ Karney, senior director of public policy at the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, said that the move brings welcome relief to states and the agricultural sector.

“What this came down to was a recognition of ‘cooperative federalism,’” Karney said, referring to a “partnership between the federal government and states in the implementation of federal regulations.”

Karney also said that the proposed rule provides a boost to the agricultural industry by providing clearer definitions that make it easier to understand what bodies of water are or aren’t regulated under the Clean Water Act.

Industry groups similarly lauded Monday’s move as a return to a more state-based approach to water protection regulations.

“We applaud EPA and the [Army Corps of Engineers’] efforts to bring our nation’s job creators one step closer to relief from years of federal government overreach by offering a clear, durable ‘Waters of the U.S. rule,’” said the Waters Advocacy Coalition, whose members represent a variety of industries including mining, fossil fuel and agricultural groups.

However, environmentalists roundly decried the Trump administration’s proposal as a threat to water quality across the nation.

In a statement, the Natural Resources Defense Council said that the proposed rule would “dramatically narrow which waters are covered by federal safeguards, leaving many wetlands and headwaters vulnerable to pollution and destruction.”

“These waters are vital for filtering drinking water, reducing flood and drought risks, and sustaining wildlife—but under the planned rule, many of them would no longer be protected,” the NRDC said.

A geospatial analysis NRDC conducted this year found that between 38 to 70 million acres of wetlands are at risk of pollution or destruction under modeled scenarios similar to the changes included in Monday’s proposal, the group said in its statement.

Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC, also pushed back against the idea that states are in a better position to regulate water quality than the federal government.

“There are several things wrong with that claim,” Devine said in an interview with Inside Climate News.

“The first and most obvious is that a lot of waters aren’t contained within a state,” Devine said. “That allows for pollution on one side of a water body, or upstream in a water body, to contaminate folks on the other side or downstream—even if that state has really protective laws.”

Additionally, Devine said that about half of states have no protections outside of federal law—and that even in states with good laws, many of the state agencies that implement them are underfunded and have historically relied on federal agencies to assist with implementation.

For environmental advocates, the Trump administration’s move is the latest in a series of recent blows to the Clean Water Act.

In a ruling earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in City and County of San Francisco v. Environmental Protection Agency to limit the EPA’s power to enforce Clean Water Act permits.

And in a 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, the court ruled that the EPA’s ability to protect wetlands applied only to those that are indistinguishable from, and have a “continuous surface connection” to larger lakes, oceans, streams and rivers.

To J.W. Glass, EPA policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, Monday’s announcement showed that the administration is willing to step even further beyond the 2023 Supreme Court ruling to restrict the federal government’s role in protecting water quality.

“This is EPA looking at Sackett in the narrowest possible lens, and looking at what a wetland means in the narrowest possible legal lens, in an effort to make sure that the largest swath of wetlands are no longer considered jurisdictional, i.e. protected under the Clean Water Act,” Glass said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposed rule for 45 days once it is published in the Federal Register, and is required by law to consider the public’s feedback before finalizing the rule.",https://mavensnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upper-Newport-Bay-coastal-wetland-Ken-Lund.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 07:58:54.754658

Decades of government bureaucracy and red tape, overwhelming how, when, where, and how quickly we build in America, has led to Americans’ rising concerns about the affordability of electricity and energy. On Thursday, the House Committee on Natural Resources is holding a markup of the SPEED Act, a permitting reform bill introduced by Reps. Bruce Westerman (R) and Jared Golden (D), that will help ensure we clear the way for energy that is affordable, reliable, and produced in abundance here in America. Here’s how:

The SPEED Act primarily reforms the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process, a key procedural hurdle that often results in elongated delays for vital energy projects. This bill ensures NEPA reviews have consistent and predictable timelines, clarifies what is deemed a major Federal action to trigger a NEPA review, places reasonable judicial limitations on reviews, and simplifies the entire bureaucratic process.

Americans for Prosperity’s grassroots activists have been at the forefront of this issue during its Road to Prosperity campaign, travelling across the nation to more than half a dozen states, educating voters and lawmakers about why the permitting process needs to be fixed. We’ve visited oil rigs, coal and iron mines, energy processing sites, and more in states from Louisiana to Wyoming.

The SPEED Act markup on Thursday is a great first step to helping unleash prosperity in the form of more, better-paying jobs, reducing the backlog of hundreds of energy infrastructure projects stuck in permitting purgatory, and advancing a policy of energy abundance.

This is an encouraging step toward a policy that can make a real difference. Americans for Prosperity—and millions of Americans—welcome lawmakers’ efforts to pass legislation that will help lower energy costs and power the future for this and future generations.

The company currently operates a smaller magnet manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park. The new 1 million-square-foot site in Benson represents a major scale-up and is expected to become the largest magnet production plant outside China. Rare earth magnets play a critical role in technologies dependent on electric motors and precision motion systems, including but not limited to electronics, robotics, electric vehicles, data centers, and numerous defense applications.

Capacity

The plant will produce up to 10,000 metric tons of Neodymium Iron Boron magnets each year. This expansion addresses rising demand in advanced manufacturing and strengthens the domestic magnet supply chain.

The state’s Economic Investment Committee approved a Job Development Investment Grant to support the project. Over 12 years, the project is expected to add about $2.6 billion to the state economy. The JDIG allows the company to receive up to $17.58 million if it meets annual job creation and investment targets.

Because Johnston County is a Tier 3 county, the state will allocate up to $5.86 million to the Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account for rural infrastructure. The state may also provide up to $250,000 for road improvements.

The project will create new administrative, engineering, and production jobs, with an estimated annual payroll of $81.9 million. Multiple state and local partners, including the North Carolina Department of Commerce, the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, Johnston County, and the Town of Benson, supported the project.

On Reddit's r/energy, Texans raved about solar energy in a recent thread.","Texas occupies a unique place on the American energy landscape, something most non-Texans learned during a deadly statewide grid failure amid extreme weather in 2021.

Officially, 246 Texans died during the crisis, but experts believe as many as 814 died.

According to the Energy Information Administration, local grids connect to one of three larger regional interconnections: the Western Interconnection, the Eastern Interconnection, and, in Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Interconnection.

Texas' functional disconnection from the country's major grids was one of several factors that exacerbated the 2021 grid crisis.

Now, as Houston's KTRK recently reported, more residents of the Lone Star State are considering microgrids as a hedge against an unstable grid.

Microgrids enable the generation and storage of energy within a smaller area. Moreover, as the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory explains, microgrids can operate in ""island mode,"" ensuring a stable supply of power when main grids fail.

As KTRK noted, microgrids are common in facilities like hospitals and data centers — but a community solar residential microgrid in Florida, a state where extreme weather is prevalent, ensured all 37 connected homes maintained power during a regional outage.

A KTRK anchor explained that microgrids often use renewable, clean energy sources like solar panels, providing continuous power irrespective of the broader grid's status.

""These microgrids are another way to keep the lights on, even in the harshest of conditions or times of peak demand,"" a reporter explained. The anchors alluded to potentially prohibitive costs to establish a fully-fledged microgrid, and KTRK advised Texans to start smaller.

Installing solar panels was one of the first steps the outlet recommended, and home solar is one of the most resilient energy options, particularly when coupled with battery backups. After Hurricane Melissa battered Jamaica, solar-powered locals became a lifeline to neighbors.

As electricity rates soar across the U.S., solar is booming, and The Cool Down's Solar Explorer is designed to make the switch as easy and affordable as possible. Solar panels are the ultimate home energy hack, and they can bring electricity bills down to $0 or even lower.

The Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted local installers and can save homeowners up to $10,000 on new installations. As for upfront costs, the Solar Explorer offers $0 down options like Palmetto's LightReach, allowing users on a budget to lock in low rates.

World leaders have gathered in Brazil for the U.N. Climate Conference. The U.S. is not there, but China is. When it comes to energy transition, the U.S. and China couldn't be on more different paths. China is moving away from fossil fuels while the U.S. is doubling down. Experts say this will have consequences for the climate and these countries' economies. NPR sent two correspondents to opposite sides of the Pacific to learn more. We begin with NPR's Julia Simon in Eureka, California.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In far northern California, Chris Mikkelsen drives an old police cruiser past little wooden houses.

Pine trees with moss just, like, hanging off of them.

CHRIS MIKKELSEN: It's just an old seaside town.

SIMON: Mikkelsen is the executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which plans to assemble wind turbines for a massive new offshore wind project. About 20 miles off this misty coast, two companies - American Vineyard Offshore and German RWE - plan to build turbines to power more than 2 million homes. Mikkelsen says the project aims to make about 270 long-term local jobs.

MIKKELSEN: It's going to, you know, change the economic viability of our community. And I get a little - my voice gets a little shaky 'cause it's going to make a better opportunity for our kids.

SIMON: Yeah.

MIKKELSEN: That's pretty important.

SIMON: The new terminal was supposed to be shovel-ready as soon as 2026, Mikkelsen says. That's no longer realistic, in part because the Trump administration recently canceled more than $426 million in federal grants for the project. Mikkelsen says it's been pencils down since then as they try to find new sources of money. This is one of dozens of actions this administration has taken to starve the renewable energy industry of federal support from canceling tax credits years early to issuing stop-work orders.

Amanda Levin at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council says the U.S. renewable industry had been growing.

AMANDA LEVIN: For the first time last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal. Things were headed in the right direction, but this really just takes the wind out of their sails.

SIMON: The Trump administration is reversing support for renewables, which it incorrectly labels as risky and unreliable. But across the Pacific Ocean, America's biggest competitor - China - thinks otherwise. Let's throw the mic 5,000 miles to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's there.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: You are right, Julia. Here in China, renewable isn't a dirty word. China's leadership has made strategic choices to include renewables in its energy mix. We're in China's Zhangbei region, which is in between the capital Beijing and the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The area is rich in wind resources, and it's where a lot of China's wind and solar capacity is being installed.

(SOUNDBITE OF TURBINE BLADES SPINNING)

KUHN: Turbine blades swoosh past in huge circles. The electricity goes from here to a grid outside Beijing and on to the rest of China. China now dominates the global renewable sector. In the first half of this year, China built more solar than the rest of the world combined. Seventy-four percent of all large-scale wind and solar projects are being built in China. Compare that to the U.S. that's building 6%. China now has more installed generation capacity from solar and wind than from gas and coal.

It wasn't always this way. Until recently, China's economic growth came at the cost of air pollution from burning fossil fuels. But in the last few decades, authorities in Beijing began to consider a sustainable economic growth model, and renewables have been a key part of that, according to Qin Haiyan, director of the parent company of the wind farm we visited and vice president of the World Wind Energy Association.

QIN HAIYAN: (Through interpreter) Developing the economy and reducing carbon emissions to address climate change are now no longer contradictory.

KUHN: And this, according to the Asia Society's Li Shuo, is the biggest difference between the U.S. and China in climate policy today.

LI SHUO: It couldn't be a stronger contrast between the two countries.

KUHN: In China, solar and wind are now cheaper than coal and gas. Li Shuo says one of the most dramatic aspects of China's climate story is not just that they seem to be cutting their climate emissions...

LI: But also, to what extent other parts of the world can also benefit from China's low-carbon products.

SIMON: So China is now exporting turbines and solar panels and batteries around the world, from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan.

KUHN: That's right, Julia. All the renewables growth, both local and exports, is a bright spot amid China's slowing economy, especially its slumping real estate sector. David Fishman is a principal at the Lantau Group in Shanghai.

DAVID FISHMAN: People who used to be swinging hammers building commercial real estate are now swinging hammers installing solar panels. And that - well, yes, of course. You double - triple down on that.

(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)

SIMON: Back in Eureka, Mikkelsen walks along a creaky dock, an abandoned pulp mill looming behind us. He says he doesn't understand why the Trump administration would cancel the grants for the terminal supporting the wind project. He says this community has been suffering since 2008 when the pulp mill closed.

MIKKELSEN: Our administration that was recently elected, not only at the presidential level but even some of our Congress and senators, really ran on a platform that we're going to build back America, that we're going to create jobs in rural America - good, skilled, trained, you know, high-paying jobs. And there's no better place. You're looking around, you're seeing the remnants of what once was.

SIMON: It is still unclear what the nationwide cuts to renewable energy mean for U.S. climate emissions.

KUHN: But in China, the climate story is more clear, and it's a rare, encouraging indicator in the global warming story. The growth of renewable energy means that China's emissions seem to be on track to peak or are nearing their peak, Li Shuo says. And China's renewable exports mean the country is helping other countries reduce their emissions too.

“The impact of the Biden-era WOTUS rule would have been far-reaching and costly,” Hoeven said.
We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers,” Wehrbein said.
NCBA explained, “The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction.
“EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country,” Foster said.","Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, on Monday announced a proposed rule that they said “would establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of ‘waters of the United States'” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.

EPA has been under pressure for years to write a WOTUS rule because there were conflicting Supreme Court decisions about federal responsibility for waters that cross state lines. Various definitions of WOTUS have been challenged in the courts.

Zeldin and Telle maintained that the new proposed rule “follows the Supreme Court decision in Sackett and delivers on the Trump administration’s commitment to protect America’s waters while providing the regulatory certainty needed to support our nation’s farmers who feed and fuel the world and advance EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”

The agencies said they developed this proposed rule using input from multiple sources, including a pre-proposal recommendations docket, information from nine public listening sessions, and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

The agencies said that “key proposed revisions” include:

“Defining key terms like ‘relatively permanent,’ ‘continuous surface connection,’ and ‘tributary’ to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

“Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

“Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

“Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

“Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems;

“Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

“Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS;

“In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.”

The proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register and open for public comment for 45 days. EPA and the Army will host two public meetings, both in-person and online.

Details about commenting either in writing or during a public meeting can be found on EPA’s website. “The agencies look forward to reviewing public comment while working to expeditiously develop a final rule,” a news release said.

REACTIONS

Congressional Republicans and farm and manufacturing leaders praised the rule while congressional Democrats, the Waterkeeper Alliance and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation criticized it.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Pa., said, “For too long, WOTUS allowed Washington to overreach into the everyday work of farmers, ranchers and landowners.”

“Today’s action is a strong step in finally delivering a clear, practical definition that ends the needless permitting headaches created by the Biden-era rule,” Thompson said.

“By following through on a promise to rural America, Administrator Zeldin is restoring certainty and trust where it’s long been needed.”

Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Hoeven, R-N.D., noted that he had fought against what he called the “regulatory overreach” of the Biden and Obama administrations, but was also cautious in his reaction, urging North Dakotans to submit comments on the rule.

“The impact of the Biden-era WOTUS rule would have been far-reaching and costly,” Hoeven said.

“Our farmers, ranchers and energy producers, among many others, would have been bogged down in federal permitting for everyday activities, imposing an unworkable regulatory burden and inflating not only their operating costs, but ultimately prices for consumers.”

“That’s why I worked to hold back this regulatory overreach under the Biden and Obama administrations and support the Trump administration in advancing a WOTUS definition that respects private property rights and the regulatory role of states. I appreciate Administrator Zeldin for working with us on this priority, and I encourage North Dakotans to submit their feedback to the EPA to ensure the final rule meets the needs of our state,” Hoeven said.

“We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” Duvall said.

“We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.”

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association announced support for the rule.

“Waters of the U.S. has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers,” said NCBA President Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattleman.

“Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed. Often, this meant that small water features like prairie potholes or dry ditches suddenly fell under federal regulation.”

“NCBA has spent years fighting to protect cattle producers from excessive red tape. We went to the EPA, advocated on Capitol Hill, and even took this issue all the way up to the Supreme Court to protect our members from federal overreach. We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers,” Wehrbein said.

NCBA explained, “The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction. Past WOTUS rules issued under the Obama and Biden administrations placed small, isolated water features under federal regulation. Prairie potholes, playa lakes, and even ditches that only carried water after large storms became regulated as if they were a large lake, river or ocean.”

American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer, said, “Soybean farmers have been asking for a WOTUS definition we can actually put to work on the ground.”

“For too long, shifting interpretations have created real uncertainty about whether everyday decisions might trigger federal oversight,” Ragland said.

“We appreciate that the administration, along with Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, is moving toward a definition that reflects how water interacts with working farmland and respects the conservation practices growers already use.

“Aligning the rule with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and preserving long-standing exemptions for normal farm work gives producers clearer expectations and reduces the risk of costly delays or compliance surprises,” Ragland said.

National Council of Farmer Cooperatives President and CEO Duane Simpson said, “NCFC supports this effort to streamline permitting, reduce unnecessary red tape, and ensure that water regulations are both clear and workable for stakeholders, including agriculture.”

“Farmer co-ops and their members are committed to protecting our natural resources, and today’s action is a meaningful step toward giving them the certainty required to keep doing just that while continuing to power rural economies,” Simpson said.

The leaders of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, said, “Trump’s Polluted Water Rule will leave us with weaker clean water protections than we’ve had since the 1980s, allowing polluters free rein over our nation’s waters.”

“This reckless decision by the EPA — the agency with a mission to protect human health and the environment — now puts the drinking water supplies of millions of Americans at risk.”

“Clean drinking water is a necessity, not a privilege, and we’ve learned today just how far Trump’s EPA will go to ignore the health and safety of our families and communities,” the coalition said.

“When the American people turn on their taps to find dirty drinking water in the years to come, they can point to Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin. The EPA needs to wake up and remember its reason for existing, instead of selling out our clean water to Trump’s highest bidder.”

National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said, “Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability.”

“For too long, the regulatory structure under the WOTUS rule, which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S.,” Timmins said, “undermining our ability to invest and build across the country. Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the Clean Water Act is critical for manufacturers planning new projects.”

Waterkeeper Alliance said it was “sounding the alarm” about the rule.

“The Clean Water Act has already been severely weakened following the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, in which the court dramatically revoked protections for thousands of bodies of water across the country,” the group said.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance.

“EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country,” Foster said.

“This isn’t abstract policy, it’s a deliberate decision that disregards the real consequences for people’s health, safety and daily lives. Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”

Chesapeake Bay Foundation Senior Policy Director Keisha Sedlacek said, “EPA’s plan to further strip wetlands protections would deal a serious blow to Bay restoration.”

“Wetlands, including those isolated from other waters, and streams that don’t flow continuously all year are critical to clean water in the Bay and its local rivers and streams,” Sedlacek said.

“They also provide habitat and spawning grounds for fish, waterfowl, and wildlife important to our region’s seafood and outdoor recreation industries. And they’re invaluable for softening the blow of extreme weather on low-lying communities like Annapolis and Norfolk.

“Absent robust federal protections, the Bay states and D.C. must fill the gaps or risk losing wetlands and streams that help save the Bay to short-sighted and irresponsible development and destruction,” Sedlacek said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/12/2016/09/05123726/FarmlandValue-RFP-042913-1-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 07:58:59.208409

Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission heard recommendations from legal and regulatory staff on the case filed by NorthWestern Energy.
The Public Service Commission’s rules “emphasize the importance” of evaluating, managing and mitigating risk through “transparency and documentation,” the report said.
It said a “glaring example” of how its application failed regarding transparency and documentation involves the costs of potential alternatives to the Yellowstone plant.
The Public Service Commission is expected to take up the Yellowstone plant portion of the case at a meeting on Wednesday.","NorthWestern Energy didn’t adequately evaluate more affordable options before it built the Yellowstone County Generating Station, and it “knew it was making a risky decision” to build the plant, according to Public Service Commission legal and regulatory staff.

The monopoly utility also didn’t manage risks in a cost effective way, and it likely could have avoided $45 million in cost overruns, said the staff report.

As such, staff recommend the Public Service Commission exclude those costs from the amount NorthWestern can recover from customers in a pending rate case.

“Staff concludes that there were significant deficiencies in the planning and procurement processes that raise serious doubts about whether NorthWestern minimized total costs and risks for customers,” said Public Service Commission staff.

Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission heard recommendations from legal and regulatory staff on the case filed by NorthWestern Energy.

Public Service Commissioners did not take up a decision on the Yellowstone County Generating Station.

However, commissioners heard details from a staff report that outlined the ways NorthWestern Energy misstepped in selecting and building the methane-fired plant in Laurel, estimated at $320 million, as it evaluated its options to supply electricity to customers

In briefings, the Montana Consumer Counsel, a group of conservation organizations, a coalition of large businesses, and federal agencies agreed NorthWestern should not get to foist onto others the expenses that were the result of, as one party put it, the utility’s “lack of cost discipline.”

In the Public Service Commission staff report, analysts said NorthWestern botched the process to evaluate “the full range of cost-effective resource options” in the first place. It eliminated at least one viable option without explanation or justification, the report said.

The report also said NorthWestern never demonstrated that the Yellowstone County Generating Station “achieves the lowest long term total cost for customers.”

For example, the report said NorthWestern knew battery capacity paired with reciprocating internal combustion engine units would be low cost and low risk, but it conducted its request for proposals in a way that prevented that pairing in its cost analysis.

The analysts pointed to other problematic factors in the way NorthWestern evaluated its options, such as including the Yellowstone plant in 27 of the 36 different resource portfolios it designed, but including the “lowest-cost resource” on the shortlist in just one portfolio.

NorthWestern had resource offers that would have “entirely avoided” the risks and subsequent cost overruns to build the plant, the staff report said.

And it said NorthWestern clearly knew of the risks because it cited them when it withdrew its application for preapproval of the Yellowstone project by the Public Service Commission.

The report also said NorthWestern didn’t provide nearly enough information about the construction of the plant and its evolution, as the agency requires.

The Public Service Commission’s rules “emphasize the importance” of evaluating, managing and mitigating risk through “transparency and documentation,” the report said.

But it said NorthWestern didn’t provide any documentation to explain the reason the expected costs for the plant had increased when it terminated an agreement with one contractor and executed another, nor did it document a rationale for replacing its contractor.

In fact, the report said analysts agree with Renewable Northwest, a party that participated in the case and argued NorthWestern didn’t make its case the plant was a needed investment.

“NorthWestern has continually failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that YCGS represents a prudent investment, or to furnish the commission with sufficient data to verify that fact for itself,” the staff report said, citing Renewable Northwest.

It said a “glaring example” of how its application failed regarding transparency and documentation involves the costs of potential alternatives to the Yellowstone plant.

Over the course of nine months, NorthWestern was asked to provide the information about cost multiple times, but it failed to do so until the day the hearing started — a move that deprived the Public Service Commission and other parties of “essential information” and violated state regulations, the report said.

The staff report also said NorthWestern tried to earn a return on a portion of the Yellowstone plant that should be depreciated, which does not comply with “regulatory accounting fundamentals,” and staff recommended an adjustment accordingly.

“Staff’s recommendation would reduce NorthWestern’s proposed $287 million YCGS rate base, associated with 16 engines in use, to $227.7 million,” the report said.

As the U.S. market evolves, Toyota’s hybrid bet may prove to be a winning hand in an uncertain game.","In the rapidly evolving landscape of the U.S. automotive market, Toyota Motor Corp. is making a bold statement with its continued emphasis on hybrid vehicles. As electric vehicle (EV) adoption faces headwinds from infrastructure challenges and shifting consumer preferences, the Japanese automaker is investing heavily to expand its hybrid production capacity. This strategy comes at a time when hybrids are gaining traction, offering a bridge between traditional internal combustion engines and full electrification.

Recent announcements underscore Toyota’s commitment. On November 18, 2025, the company revealed plans to invest $912 million across five U.S. manufacturing plants in southern states, aimed at boosting hybrid component and vehicle output. This move is part of a larger $10 billion investment pledge in the U.S. over the next five years, as reported by TechCrunch. The investment will create 252 new jobs and enhance production lines for hybrid engines and components, signaling Toyota’s confidence in hybrids as a dominant force in the near term.

Toyota’s approach contrasts with rivals who have pivoted aggressively toward all-electric lineups. While companies like Ford and General Motors grapple with slowing EV sales, Toyota’s multi-pathway strategy—encompassing hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs)—has proven resilient. According to data from Toyota’s disclosures, electrified models accounted for 46.9% of its U.S. sales in the third quarter of 2025, outperforming the industry average.

Scaling Up Hybrid Production

The $912 million investment targets facilities in Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia. For instance, Toyota’s Alabama plant will receive $282 million to produce hybrid transaxles, while the Kentucky facility gets $145 million for engine production lines. This expansion is expected to come online gradually, with some projects not fully operational until 2027, as detailed in a report by Bloomberg.

Beyond immediate production boosts, Toyota is shifting key models to U.S. manufacturing. The company plans to move production of the hybrid Corolla from Japan to its Indiana plant, a strategic decision to localize supply chains amid global trade tensions. This aligns with broader industry trends where automakers are reshoring operations to mitigate risks from tariffs and supply disruptions.

Toyota’s executives have been vocal about their hybrid-first philosophy. “We believe in a multi-pathway approach to electrification,” said Jack Hollis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, in a statement cited by CNBC. This stance is backed by sales figures: Toyota reported 2,332,623 U.S. vehicle sales in 2024, with electrified vehicles driving a 3.7% year-over-year increase, according to the Toyota USA Newsroom.

A Response to Market Realities

The push for hybrids comes as EV enthusiasm wanes in the U.S. With the potential expiration of federal tax credits and concerns over charging infrastructure, consumers are increasingly opting for hybrids, which offer fuel efficiency without the range anxiety of pure EVs. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect this sentiment, with users praising Toyota’s pragmatic strategy amid reports of vanishing EV demand.

Industry analysts note that Toyota’s hybrid dominance stems from decades of investment in the technology, starting with the Prius in 1997. By 2030, Toyota aims to increase PHEV sales to 20% of its U.S. volume, up from 2.4% last year, as per sources in a CNBC article. This target reflects a calculated bet on consumer preferences, especially in segments like pickup trucks and SUVs where hybrids are gaining popularity.

Competitive pressures are also at play. Rivals such as Hyundai and Honda are expanding their hybrid offerings, but Toyota maintains a market lead with models like the RAV4 Hybrid and Camry Hybrid. A report from Electrek highlights Toyota’s upcoming wave of new hybrid, PHEV, and EV models, positioning the company to capture diverse market segments.

Broader Investment Commitments

Toyota’s $10 billion U.S. investment plan, announced just a week before the hybrid-specific funding, encompasses electrification, advanced manufacturing, and job creation. This follows a pattern of substantial commitments; in May 2025, Toyota outlined plans to scale PHEVs significantly, as covered by AInvest. The strategy has drawn investor attention, with Q3 2025 sales data showing strong demand for electrified vehicles.

Financially, Toyota is thriving. The company reported robust Q2 2025 results, with significant growth in operating income and sales revenues attributed to vehicle sales and innovations, according to Investing.com. This financial health enables aggressive investments, contrasting with EV-focused competitors facing losses on battery-powered models.

On X, discussions emphasize Toyota’s foresight. Posts from industry figures like Car Dealership Guy highlight the brand’s calculated moves, such as adding hybrid options to iconic models like the 4Runner, reflecting a shift toward hybrid-only lineups in the future.

Challenges and Criticisms

Despite the optimism, Toyota’s strategy isn’t without critics. Some argue it’s overly conservative, potentially leaving the company behind in the long-term race to full electrification. Environmental advocates push for faster EV adoption to meet climate goals, pointing out that hybrids still rely on fossil fuels.

However, Toyota counters with innovations like solid-state batteries, which could revolutionize both hybrids and EVs. As Brian Sullivan noted on X in 2024, Toyota’s hybrid focus combined with battery development positions it well until infrastructure catches up.

Regional challenges also loom. A Accio analysis from May 2025 discusses Toyota’s global dominance amid rising hybrid demand, but notes U.S.-specific hurdles like tariff tensions. Toyota’s investments aim to navigate these by bolstering domestic production.

Looking Ahead to 2030

As Toyota ramps up hybrid production, the industry watches closely. The company’s ability to blend hybrid reliability with emerging EV technologies could define the next decade of automotive electrification. With half of its U.S. sales already electrified—double the industry share—Toyota is poised for growth.

Investor sentiment remains positive, as evidenced by posts on X praising Toyota’s $14 billion battery push for hybrids. This investment, detailed in a Wall Street Journal piece referenced in social media, underscores a pivot from EV hype to practical solutions.

In the words of Toyota’s leadership, this is about meeting consumer needs today while preparing for tomorrow. As the U.S. market evolves, Toyota’s hybrid bet may prove to be a winning hand in an uncertain game.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-1700-1763510835.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 22:58:12.233929

“Warehouses have immense solar energy potential, and can be a key component in moving Pennsylvania towards more clean, renewable energy generation,” said Belle Sherwood, PennEnvironment Clean Energy Advocate.
They’re able to return any excess solar energy back to the grid, helping to alleviate the strain on the electricity grid and make their energy bills negative.","State Senators Saval and Comitta join Rep. Dougherty for tour of Greenfield Manufacturing warehouse. Tour highlights environmental and cost-saving benefits of large-scale rooftop solar on warehouses and distribution centers across the state.

Philadelphia, PA – State Senators Nikil Saval and Carolyn Comitta, State Rep. Dougherty, and Solar States joined PennEnvironment for a rooftop solar tour at Greenfield Manufacturing, a warehouse in Northeast Philadelphia with an extensive rooftop solar installation. The tour highlighted the immense potential for solar energy generation on warehouse rooftops, an under-utilized space for solar panels. A recent PennEnvironment study found that if all of the warehouses in Pennsylvania added solar to their roofs it would generate enough electricity to power more than 820,000 homes and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“Warehouses have immense solar energy potential, and can be a key component in moving Pennsylvania towards more clean, renewable energy generation,” said Belle Sherwood, PennEnvironment Clean Energy Advocate. “Putting solar panels on Pennsylvania’s warehouses would be good for communities, good for the electricity grid, and most importantly, good for our environment,”

Pennsylvania Senators Nikil Saval and Carolyn Comitta have proposed legislation that would help unlock the solar energy potential of warehouses and distribution centers across the state by requiring all new warehouses and distribution centers constructed in Pennsylvania be “solar-ready”. The senators’ legislation would also provide a tax credit for existing warehouses and distribution centers to make the necessary retrofits to be considered solar-ready.

“We have the technology we need right now to arrest climate change, advance a green and prosperous economy, and make life healthier, safer, and more affordable for working people and communities throughout Pennsylvania, and our built environment plays a key role,” said State Senator Nikil Saval. “If we harness the energy-generating capacity of the more than 500 million square feet of suitable rooftop space that sits atop warehouses across our commonwealth, we could power nearly a million households per year on solar energy alone.”

“Warehouses, distribution centers, and commercial buildings account for a significant portion of our carbon emissions. Meanwhile, they can be ideal sites for solar panels,” said State Senator Carolyn Comitta. “As the growth of e-commerce continues to drive warehouse development in Pennsylvania, this legislation can help ensure that they are ready to harness the economic, environmental, and public health benefits of solar energy.”

Greenfield Manufacturing is already seeing the benefits of their rooftop solar array. Their 3,600 panel system, installed by Solar States last year, generates more than 100% of the warehouse’s energy needs. They’re able to return any excess solar energy back to the grid, helping to alleviate the strain on the electricity grid and make their energy bills negative. Greenfield gets over $1,000 for their solar power production each month.

Greenfield Manufacturing is located in Pennsylvania Representative Sean Dougherty’s state house district in northeast Philadelphia. He says, “my neighbors are seeing energy costs increase exponentially because of energy-intensive warehouses popping up across Northeast Philadelphia. I’m proud to co-sponsor Solar Warehouses (HB 1260 sponsored by Rep. Josh Siegel) because it allows clean energy to be generated in-house, at their OWN warehouse. This will reduce the cost of electricity for everyone in our neighborhood.”

Advocates note that there’s never been a better time for businesses to invest in solar energy, since the cost of solar has decreased significantly over the past decade. It’s estimated that the cost of utility-scale solar decreased by 90 percent between 2009-2020.

According to official documentation, the proposed rule is intended to “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of “waters of the U.S.” There will be a public comment period on the proposal for 45 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

The proposed rule has pleased agricultural groups, but environmental groups are “sounding the alarm” about it. Here’s a closer look.

Agricultural Groups

American Farm Bureau Federation

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is the nation’s largest farmer-run organization and serves farmers in all 50 states.

On Monday, AFBF President Zippy Duvall commented on the rule.

“Clean water is a top priority for farmers and ranchers — we depend on it. We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines. We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity. We look forward to providing comments to EPA to ensure farmers can continue to safeguard the environment while growing the food America’s families rely on.”

American Soybean Association

The American Soybean Association (ASA) represents U.S. soybean farmers on domestic and international policy issues. ASA has 26 affiliate state associations representing 30 soybean-producing states and nearly 500,000 soybean farmers.

The ASA “applauded” the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for their proposed rule in a statement Monday.

“Soybean farmers have been asking for a WOTUS definition we can actually put to work on the ground,” said Caleb Ragland, ASA President and Kentucky farmer. “For too long, shifting interpretations have created real uncertainty about whether everyday decisions might trigger federal oversight. We appreciate that the administration, along with Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, is moving toward a definition that reflects how water interacts with working farmland and respects the conservation practices growers already use. Aligning the rule with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and preserving long-standing exemptions for normal farm work gives producers clearer expectations and reduces the risk of costly delays or compliance surprises.”

The statement ended noting, ""ASA will review the proposal in detail, but this is an important step toward providing farmers the predictability they need to manage their land responsibly and keep delivering food, feed, and fuel for America and the world.""

National Association of State Departments of Agriculture

The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit association which represents the elected and appointed commissioners, secretaries, and directors of the departments of agriculture in all 50 states and four U.S. territories.

NASDA commented Monday, stating the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have “duly recognized states’ expertise in managing and protecting local land and water resources.”

“NASDA appreciates EPA listening to input from state departments of agriculture and other stakeholders regarding problems with prior WOTUS rulemakings. NASDA is pleased that our federal colleagues are now working cooperatively with state co-regulators to ensure the goals of the Clean Water Act are met while minimizing unjustified interference with agricultural and other activities that feed, clothe, and house Americans and drive our nations’ economy,” NASDA CEO Ted McKinney said.

“NASDA is excited to properly re-engage with EPA under cooperative federalism to ensure our local water resources are protected and farmers have the information and resources they need to make the best decisions about how to manage their land.”

""NASDA will continue to review the proposed rule and intends to offer detailed comments in due course,"" the statement concluded.

National Cattleman’s Beef Association

The National Cattleman’s Beef Association (NCBA) has represented America's cattle producers since 1898 and is the largest association of cattle producers in the U.S.

NCBA announced support for the rule Monday in a statement.

“[WOTUS] has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers. Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed. Often, this meant that small water features like prairie potholes or dry ditches suddenly fell under federal regulation,” said NCBA President and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein. “NCBA has spent years fighting to protect cattle producers from excessive red tape. We went to the EPA, advocated on Capitol Hill, and even took this issue all the way up to the Supreme Court to protect our members from federal overreach. We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.”

“Today's WOTUS announcement finally acknowledges that the federal government should work to protect lakes, rivers, and oceans, rather than regulating ditches and ponds on family farms and ranches,” said NCBA Chief Counsel Mary-Thomas Hart. “NCBA is pleased to see the EPA stand up for cattle producers, and we look forward to providing input on this proposed rule.”

According to the statement, “NCBA and its state affiliate partners will submit comments to the agency on the rule, which will be considered before the rule is finalized.”

Waters Advocacy Coalition

The Waters Advocacy Coalition (WAC) is made up of farmers, homebuilders, manufacturers, and other job creators. The group released the following statement Monday in response to the rule.

“We applaud EPA and the Corps’ efforts to bring our nation’s job creators one step closer to relief from years of federal government overreach by offering a clear, durable [WOTUS] rule. WAC strongly endorses the agencies’ commitment to respect the legal boundaries articulated by the Supreme Court and to restore the balance Congress intended more than 50 years ago when it enacted the Clean Water Act.

“The Waters Advocacy Coalition represents America’s job creators who deliver the services families rely on every day; from producing energy [and] building homes and infrastructure, to growing food. These industries need regulations they can understand. We look forward to more closely analyzing the proposal and offering comments to ensure that this rule protects America’s waterways while offering certainty to landowners throughout the country.”

Environmental Groups

National Wildlife Federation

The National Wildlife Federation (NWF), America's largest and most trusted conservation organization, works across the country to unite Americans from all walks of life in giving wildlife a voice.

In a statement Monday, NWF said the rule would “protect fewer streams and wetlands from pollution and destruction than at any point since the law’s passage in 1972.”

“We’ve forgotten that we have clean water because of the Clean Water Act,” said Jim Murphy, the NWF’s senior director of legal advocacy. “This rule would further strip protection from streams that flow into the rivers and lakes that supply our drinking water. The wetlands now at risk of being bulldozed filter our water supplies and protect us from floods.

“Revoking these long-standing protections will hit families in their pocketbooks by raising water treatment costs and home insurance rates. This rule will increase the risk of elevated nitrates and cyanotoxins in drinking water, harming our health. Over time, the impacts to water quality, wildlife, and our way of life will be significant. The crisis facing aquatic wildlife will deepen and it will become harder to find places to fish, boat, and swim.”

Waterkeeper Alliance

Waterkeeper Alliance is a global movement united for clean, healthy, and abundant water for all people and the planet.

The group released a statement Monday “sounding the alarm” about the draft rule.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, Senior Attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance. “EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country. This isn’t abstract policy, it’s a deliberate decision that disregards the real consequences for people’s health, safety, and daily lives. Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/8aSWOKeQrC5hO8s9UvffnZBSeWI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/49445657561_b1fcbfbcec_o-ec05e784dff44a8498ec134555cf02c3.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:59:22.989683

The Cheap Energy Act The Cheap Energy Act is a statement of Democratic priorities, some of which include permitting.","Rising energy costs, stalled transmission lines, and clean energy projects under threat of cancellation: The need for permitting reform has never been more apparent. Yet, despite broad agreement that America’s build-out has slowed to a crawl, the political will to act remains elusive. Lawmakers in both parties continue to talk about modernizing our outdated permitting system, and this fall has seen a surge in new bills promising to do just that. But for all the legislative activity, it isn’t obvious that meaningful permitting reform will pass during this Congress. If we’re ever going to move beyond modest, technocratic tweaks, we’ll need to take a hard look at what’s truly necessary to build faster, to ensure credible and effective environmental review, and to get something passed.

The political challenges are well understood at this point. Democrats remain wary of efforts to overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, a cornerstone of the regulatory system. They worry that narrowing judicial remedies or procedural rules could result in significant environmental harm and silence public input. And in light of partisan acrimony and the Trump administration’s attacks on solar and wind energy, Democrats are nervous that permitting reform initiatives might fail to protect renewable energy, undercutting their climate policy preferences. Meanwhile, Republicans are skeptical of federal efforts to streamline transmission siting and planning, which they view as a backdoor to the wind-and-solar-heavy energy policy ambitions of the Biden administration. And both parties, with some justification on each side, continue to accuse the other of energy tribalism. Despite the momentum behind permitting reform, these sources of skepticism from both parties remain significant barriers to an eventual deal.

Committee dynamics compound these political divides. Two House and two Senate committees share jurisdiction over permitting and must coordinate to get anything through. Each committee prioritizes its interests. No chair can carry a comprehensive deal alone. But coordination efforts across committees are few and difficult. In the Senate, minority Democrats hold considerable negotiating leverage over legislation that emerges from the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over changes to NEPA. Meanwhile, the Energy and Natural Resources committee controls transmission issues. Any comprehensive deal will require both committees to be aligned and members of both parties to be on board.

The politics and substance of permitting reform have come a long way. Despite a seemingly paralyzed legislature, Congress is full of serious, well-developed ideas for fixing our broken system. The ePermit Act, which would modernize data sharing and digitize environmental reviews, stands out as popular, sensible, and achievable. And the SPEED Act, while flawed, is a disciplined policy proposal, reflecting a growing recognition that NEPA reform can’t simply mean repeal. With the Cheap Energy Act, the SPEED & Reliability Act, and the Fix Our Forests Act, Democrats as well as Republicans have begun to reckon with the depth of the nation’s environmental regulatory problems.

Permitting reform has never looked more plausible. But there remain significant substantive and political hurdles between introduced legislation and a successful, meaningful bipartisan deal. Clearing these hurdles would not only boost the prospects of reform this session, but could ideally initiate a legislative flywheel of regular environmental regulatory reform for Congress to pursue for years to come.

The SPEED Act

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, introduced by House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), is the most sweeping and talked-about proposal this fall. It correctly identifies the core problems—drawn-out reviews and obstructive litigation—and aims to address them through major changes to judicial review and the environmental review process itself.

These impulses are admirable. But by functionally eliminating how courts can enforce NEPA and loosening requirements agencies must follow, the bill risks weakening the very incentives that make environmental review credible in the first place. By eliminating courts’ ability to stop projects, the SPEED Act would remove the backstop that ensures agencies take their statutory obligations seriously. Without the teeth of enforcement, compliance could become optional, and the quality of review would likely erode. While it’s hard to predict, the consequences would likely extend beyond NEPA itself. Claims under other statutes, like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, are often litigated alongside NEPA. Neutering NEPA litigation could push more litigation toward these statutes.

A better approach would preserve a narrow but real role for the courts, enough to keep agencies honest without inviting endless litigation. The discretion SPEED offers to eliminate meaningful review could create a whipsaw of NEPA guidance from administration to administration, creating confusion for the courts and uncertainty for developers.

Successful reform would provide a voice, not a veto, to the public and other stakeholders. It would strengthen the public engagement process, require agencies to seriously consider comments, and then restrict judicial remedies that serve as veto points later in the process. One additional reform that deserves attention, though it’s received less discussion, is consolidating NEPA litigation in a single federal court. Centralized review could create precedent, shorten timelines, and end the inconsistent rulings that slow projects nationwide.

Whatever its merits, SPEED is unlikely to pass the Senate as written. Both the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) and the Energy and Natural Resources committees (ENR) are drafting their own visions for permitting reform and do not see SPEED as the starting point. Even though SPEED has Democratic House co-sponsors, its reforms are likely more aggressive than Senate Democrats wielding the filibuster would accept. As of this writing, Chairman Westerman is soliciting potential amendments on the bill. We’ll see how this shifts the dynamics in the ongoing negotiations.

Fix Our Forests Act

The Fix Our Forests Act offers a compelling contrast to SPEED. Reps. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Scott Peters (D-CA) introduced FOFA in the House, and Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) introduced it in the Senate with bipartisan co-sponsors including Tim Shelly (R-MT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO). FOFA’s judicial reforms strike a sensible balance between cutting down on litigation and doing so in a way that preserves agencies’ incentives to prepare adequate NEPA analyses. Specifically, in the Senate version, FOFA’s judicial reforms limit but don’t eliminate the circumstances under which a court can stop a fireshed management project subject to NEPA. FOFA also forces judges to consider the purpose and likely effectiveness of the project before granting project-stopping relief. And finally, FOFA reduces the timeframe for filing claims covered by the Act from six years to 150 days.

The fact that FOFA’s narrower, carefully negotiated bipartisan package represents the Senate’s ceiling for agreement signals that SPEED’s judicial reforms, which would functionally eliminate courts’ ability to stop projects, go too far to pass the Senate.

While FOFA would be a clear victory for permitting reform if it passes, there are ramifications to advancing it alone. Pulling forest management out of the broader permitting debate risks draining momentum for more comprehensive NEPA reform. Democrats are more comfortable reforming NEPA to address wildfires but reluctant to open bedrock environmental statutes to broader revision. Without forest management as an impetus for NEPA reform, the Democrats’ willingness to engage in broader reform may dwindle. One possible solution would be to expand the judicial review provisions in FOFA to cover a broader set of infrastructure projects outside forestry.

ePermit Act

A bill from Reps. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD), the ePermit Act, focuses on modernizing the administrative process of permitting rather than changing the substance of environmental review laws. Rather than getting caught in partisan debates over statutory reform, the bill finds bipartisan footing in the low-hanging fruit of technology and communications modernization. Updated technology and interagency communications capacity could, without additional reforms, make the current permitting process faster, more transparent, and easier to navigate.

While other bills seek to rewrite NEPA itself, ePermit aims to improve how it works. Standardizing data, improving interagency coordination, and increasing public visibility into project reviews would resolve government-wide inefficiencies while improving transparency and accountability. The ePermit Act could and should pass in something like its current form, almost no matter how the broader permitting negotiations proceed.

The SPEED & Reliability Act

Initially introduced in 2024 and reintroduced this year by Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Andy Barr (R-KY), the SPEED & Reliability Act would update how major transmission lines are approved. The 2025 version keeps the same goal of improving grid reliability but scales back federal authority over siting and cost-sharing in an effort to make the bill more appealing to Republicans. It moves away from the cumbersome National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) process by giving FERC greater permitting authority. But it does not grant the clear, centralized authority that is likely necessary to expedite review and resolve interstate siting conflicts.

Despite bipartisan sponsors, the politics of this bill remain difficult. Expanding federal siting authority has little traction in the current Congress, and Republican hesitation to move meaningfully on transmission leaves few paths forward. Discussions often stop short of significant reform, settling instead on so-called “grid enhancing technologies” (GETs). These upgrades can help utilities squeeze more capacity from existing infrastructure, but they don’t replace the need to build new high-voltage lines. These make the grid smarter, not bigger. Without a broader shared interest in policies that would expand construction and coordination, the SPEED & Reliability Act has little chance of making it to the House floor.

The Cheap Energy Act

The Cheap Energy Act is a statement of Democratic priorities, some of which include permitting. The bill also covers clean energy tax credits, energy efficiency, and other subjects. While the GOP holds Congress, this bill likely won’t see further legislative action this session.

Introduced by Reps. Mike Levin (D-CA) and Sean Casten (D-IL), co-chairs of the SEEC Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, the Act would expand FERC’s authority over transmission and—like the ePermit Act—invest in permitting and data capacity to make the NEPA process more transparent and predictable.

The bill matters less for what it would build than for what it signals. For years, Democrats have centered energy debates on climate goals and belatedly focused on the practical need to make power cheaper. Hence, Democrats made a late shift from “Build Back Better” to the “Inflation Reduction Act” before the law passed in Summer 2022. The Cheap Energy Act marks a clear rhetorical shift toward affordability and reliability; it does not emphasize emissions reductions. Still, much of the bill includes subsidies and spending that echo earlier legislative efforts. With no Republican support and the Senate focused on different approaches to energy policy, this bill serves primarily as a useful if symbolic Democratic signal rather than viable legislation.

The Complete Package

Both parties agree that permitting is too slow and fractured, but they often differ on what fixing it would entail. Republicans want to scale back NEPA and limit lawsuits; Democrats often see those changes as going too far, weakening environmental safeguards and community input. The politics of permitting follow a familiar pattern. It’s easy to tweak the process around the edges, but it’s much harder to change the rules that make it slow in the first place.

On the surface, the ePermit Act appears to fit this pattern. But it should not be misunderstood as a modest reform. It would overhaul the archaic systems of the federal government for implementing NEPA, a vast organizational undertaking. Even still, it probably wouldn’t move as a stand-alone bill. But it could be attached to a must-pass package, possibly the Surface Transportation Board reauthorization, which is due before September 2026.

The Fix Our Forests Act also has a path forward. Its balanced approach to judicial reform shows that it is possible to accelerate projects without delaying environmental review. While passing as a standalone bill could complicate broader reform later, forest permitting is an urgent and achievable step. A large share of NEPA litigation concerns forest management projects. And new research from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory finds that replacing transmission lines and wires after wildfires is one of the most significant factors driving rising energy costs in the American West.

The SPEED Act faces slim odds of reaching cloture in the Senate in its current form. But it has five Democratic co-sponsors and may have the momentum to pass the House. Both Senate committees are drafting their own bill text, which may emerge as wholly new legislation or form the basis for revising SPEED.

To work, SPEED would need to restore a narrow role for courts to keep agencies accountable. It would also need to raise the statutory floor for public comment, facilitating early public engagement that helps agencies and developers avoid challenges to their projects later in the process. SPEED should also codify Seven County with greater fidelity. In Seven County, the Supreme Court gave agencies discretion not to analyze effects “separate in time or place” from the project itself. SPEED tells agencies that may not consider those effects, even if they want to. Lawmakers working on SPEED should consider borrowing from the Fix Our Forest Act, whose judicial review framework strikes a better balance—speeding up approvals without eliminating accountability. Adopting that model would help preserve a narrow but real enforcement backstop that keeps agencies honest without inviting endless litigation.

Markup of the SPEED Act in the House is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Senate EPW and ENR are both drafting bill language for companion bills, though neither has released text. EPW’s approach is likely to contain elements of Senator Capito’s RESTART Act of 2024, which would have established deadlines for court review and agency NEPA work, among other procedural changes. A successful bipartisan deal would hammer out a consensus on the various judicial review provisions under consideration, ideally one that opens up a compromise space for future reforms to other environmental statutes like the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act.

The politics of permitting reform have advanced considerably in recent years, and they represent an encouraging exception to the hyperpartisan gridlock that characterizes many other issues. Getting the policy details right matters, not only for passing meaningful reforms this Congress, but for compounding the political momentum for years to come.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/PermittingFall.png?mtime=1763502545,N,,2025-11-19 00:59:25.223232

And for decades, many of those waterways have enjoyed an extra layer of protection after regulators designated them “waters of the U.S.”

On Monday, developers got a big win from the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers, which proposed a regulation that would sharply winnow down the number of water bodies receiving that federal scrutiny, Annie Snider writes.

Arcane questions about whether Clean Water Act protections apply to a river, creek, bog or marsh that serves as a source of drinking water or restrains flood waters or filters out pollution have — like so much else — become political hot buttons. Supporters of the proposal say the traditionally broad definition has led to federal overreach, making it harder and more expensive to do construction or discharge pollution.

Environmental interests say broad federal protections are essential for protecting a precious resource. But a series of bewildering Supreme Court rulings has left the line between federally protected and unprotected waters in flux.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Monday that the new proposal is “a clear, simple, prescriptive rule that will withstand the test of time.”

“My goal right from the onset was to come up with a definition that — no matter what would happen in November of ’28 or November of 2032 — that you’re going to keep this definition,” Zeldin said, referring to the next two presidential elections. “This wasn’t about taking a pendulum and swinging it as far as you can up against another edge.”

The proposal comes two years after the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the protections under the 1972 landmark law. Industry groups were sharply critical of how the Biden administration handled the decision, saying the definition of U.S. waters was still too broad.

Shrinking the map

Energy companies stand to benefit if the Trump administration finishes its version of the regulation, Hannah Northey reports.

Opening the door to more domestic mining from copper in Arizona to coal in Appalachia has been a White House priority. The administration has opened more public land to mining, fast-tracked permitting and taken private equity stakes in companies to boost production.

Former regulators and analysts say shrinking the regulatory map could help.

The price would be that miners seeking to dump dredge into waterways or dig up metals in sensitive headwaters will probably face fewer federal limits. And states with far weaker protections would be left to jump into the breach.

COP Corner

Speeding ahead: Brazil is pushing to gather countries Wednesday to decide on key issues, such as adaptation, finance and boosting ambition at the U.N. climate summit in Belém, according to the latest letter by COP30 President André Aranha Corrêa do Lago. Among the top issues is a call by a coalition of developing countries to triple the funding that helps them withstand the effects of a hotter world.

Trade is another unresolved issue. India and other developing countries take issue with the EU’s upcoming carbon tariff. Options on the table range from more technical talks on climate-related trade measures to setting up an annual debate assessing policies such as the European measure. The EU has made clear it rejects attempts to turn the U.N. talks into a space to resolve trade issues.

Push to abandon fossil fuels: Dozens of governments are calling for countries to agree on a “roadmap” for phasing out coal, oil and natural gas, writes Zack Colman. The call from 82 countries spanning Europe, the Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa immediately elevated the topic to the top of the COP30 agenda, making it one of the most substantial and likely divisive topics of the two-week negotiations.

The effort seeks to put teeth in a bold but nonbinding pledge from the 2023 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in which nearly 200 nations agreed to begin “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” Missing from the list of supporters: the United States, the world’s top oil and gas producer, which is skipping COP30 entirely.

China makes bank: With Trump slamming the door on clean energy, Beijing is sending the message at COP30 that it’s open for business, Zack writes. China’s section of the climate summit’s main hall features 5-foot-tall poster boards boasting of the country’s battery and electrical projects. BYD, the crown jewel of China’s world-leading electric vehicle empire, is an official sponsor of the summit, as is fellow Chinese electric car manufacturer GWM.

And while Beijing has 789 delegates at the summit — behind only Brazil, the host country — the official U.S. delegation has consisted solely of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

Request denied

Trump denied disaster aid to thousands of Chicago residents after two devastating storms this summer, writes Thomas Frank.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency documented extensive damage from the July and August storms, projecting more than $129 million in recovery costs for residents. But Trump denied the aid requests from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Oct. 22, two weeks after saying the Democratic governor and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) “should be in jail” for “failing to protect” federal immigration enforcement officers.

White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson answered questions about Trump’s denials by highlighting Illinois’ status as a sanctuary state for undocumented immigrants.

Pritzker “should know how to balance his budget for these types of repetitive losses,” Johnson said in a statement, referring to damaging storms, “but instead prioritizes the state’s budget for illegals over Americans.”

Nuclear sticker shock

Utilities aren’t inking contracts to build new nuclear plants despite Trump’s push for a nuclear revival, write Brian Dabbs and Francisco “A.J.” Camacho.

“I wouldn’t build a nuclear plant,” Calvin Butler, CEO of Exelon, a major U.S. utility that doesn’t produce power but is aiming to do so in the future, told CNBC last week. “What I could do is lean in on combined-cycle gas turbines. What I could do is build community solar. What I could do is own battery storage.”

That hesitation is throttling the Trump administration’s plans to reassert U.S. nuclear leadership globally and power an artificial intelligence boom. America’s nuclear fleet is aging, with many of the country’s 94 reactors near retirement.

The Pennsylvania House Energy Committee voted Tuesday on two bills intended to advance clean energy generation in the state.

House Bill 2017, sponsored by Rep. Jose Giral, D-Phila, would authorize the Department of Environmental Protection to reduce annual fees for Small Modular Nuclear systems. The bill was reported out of committee unanimously.

“I’m proud of the unanimous vote on H.B. 2017: it’s a testament to the Energy Committee’s bipartisan efforts to support commonsense legislation that removes barriers to investment to the Commonwealth,” said House Energy Committee Chair Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Phila. “Soaring energy costs make it clear that we need to get more generation on the grid. Since SMRs are less costly to construct than traditional nuclear projects and are just as reliable, I’m eager to see projects break ground in Pennsylvania within the next decade.”

House Bill 1260, sponsored by Rep. Josh Siegel, D-Lehigh, known as the Solar Warehouses bill, advanced to the House floor with amendments. If enacted, the bill would require newly constructed warehouses and distribution centers to be built to accommodate solar panels and encourage existing warehouses to be retrofitted for them through a tax incentive.

The House Energy Committee previously held a public hearing on the bill in October.

“It is crucial for Pennsylvania to lead when it comes to lowering costs for our residents,” Siegel said. “H.B.1260 incentivizes warehouses to be built solar-ready, which not only will help keep energy prices lower by adding capacity to the grid, it also will add good paying jobs to our economy.”

While China came to dominate the supply chain in batteries, solar energy equipment and electric vehicles, it has also resulted in massive overcapacity, or as the Chinese like to call it, ‘involution’. Involutionary competition, although a recurring phenomenon in the Chinese economy, has impacted it severely this time due to a combination of several factors.

Chinese regulators have introduced anti-involution policies to address the deteriorating situation. These measures are often compared to supply side reforms in the previous decade but they represent a distinct approach, and are implemented in a different context. For this time, the policies are focused on setting quality and safety standards for products, testing requirements, maximising R&D spending, and implementing stricter Intellectual Property rights as well as labour laws.

Potential efficacy of anti-involution measures

Current measures to limit outputs in the new energy sector are likely to take longer than previous supply-side reforms to consolidate the market. This is mainly due to the dominant share of privately-owned enterprises in these sectors, specifically EVs, batteries and solar. As opposed to regulating state-owned enterprises that followed the directive to slash outputs in the previous reforms, POEs will be more sensitive to market pressure and will require incentives to follow the set caps, and might revert to competitive pricing to survive longer. Another implication that is highly likely to follow this consolidation is massive job losses as second and third tier firms are pushed out of the market. The private sector is responsible for a large number of additional employment generated annually.

Furthermore, local governments that are used to incentives based on increasing manufacturing output, are highly indebted, and dependent on private sector enterprises for revenues are also likely to resist or delay directly reducing outputs or industrial consolidation. Local governments affected the most by a decline in land revenues have invested heavily in building these manufacturing clusters as means to generate revenues in the form of tax and social contributions.

Firms dealing with overcapacity

While China’s central leadership strives to push industry consolidation, companies have been trying to survive as well as come up with innovative products to distinguish themselves amid fierce competition. The most impacted by such price wars, especially in the battery manufacturing segment, are the second and third tier producers. Firms with a dominant share in the market or Tier-1 firms can absorb losses for a longer period, surviving until the market consolidates, and yet innovate with new technologies. The producers with smaller shares however, which mainly rely on price competitiveness rather than product differentiation will find it difficult to absorb losses.

In the case of lithium-ion batteries, China today supplies over 75% of batteries sold globally and has witnessed a 30% drop in battery prices in the year 2024 alone. This price drop is a result of two factors, decreasing cost of lithium and high price competition amid tier-2 suppliers. The country has installed over 2 TWh of production capacity in 2024, which is already 60% higher than the demand. With this gap, the Li-ion battery industry in China is bound to face the impact of ‘involution’.

The case of Li-ion batteries is similar to those of EVs- too many players, and too much capacity resulting in shrinking margins for second and third tier suppliers. Major suppliers like CATL have managed to remain profitable due to their larger share in the market. Tier 1 suppliers produce nearly 50% of the total battery cells in China. Reportedly, CATL’s gross profit margins increased between 2023-24 despite the fall in battery prices during thisperiod. Similarly, EVE energy has also remained relatively stable. Leading firms therefore, are likely to emerge stronger from the domestic consolidation efforts due to their continued focus on R&D, cost efficiency along with technologically advanced products.

As competitive pressures increase, smaller players will be squeezed out. Meanwhile, safety standards in batteries are increasingly being compromised to achieve cost efficiency by smaller players. This is one of the reasons for setting higher quality standards and testing requirements by the regulators to eliminate lower quality and low-cost products.

The current scenario represents closing avenues for Chinese enterprises wherein domestic demand remains stagnant, and domestic markets flooded while major export markets are increasingly imposing duties on Chinese products in the new energy sectors. Additionally, the Chinese government has introduced controls that affect investments to manufacture outside of countries and restrict technology transfer. Such restrictions even hamper the growth of the enterprises that survive from the involutionary competition.

Window of opportunity

Between 2020 and 2025, prices of Li-ion batteries have dropped 80%, stripping companies of their profits. As Chinese enterprises undergo ‘involutionary’ pressures, and restrictions at both home and abroad, it presents an opportunity for producers outside China to reclaim their share in global markets by forging partnerships. While leading suppliers from China are likely to emerge stronger after the implementation of anti-involution policies, they will be eager to invest in foreign markets to retain their position.

It might take a longer time for the anti-involution policies to yield results as they pertain to setting product standards

and strengthening patent regulations, it could replace the unexpected price cuts from Chinese firms for global markets with price stability in sectors, especially EV and Li-ion batteries. The deflationary pressures in the Chinese economy can also be used to navigate and negotiate for concessions in the export controls on concerned sectors such as advanced lithium-ion batteries, and technologies used to produce lithium-ion cells.

Prior to the imposition of export controls, Chinese firms have been partnering with Southeast Asian firms extensively. Gotion High-tech has partnered with Vietnam’s VinES to jointly build a lithium iron phosphate battery plant, and CATL is also collaborating with the state-owned Indonesia Battery Corporation to build a battery production facility. For Chinese firms to successfully capture export markets, joint ventures and partnerships are becoming a necessary tool as countries demand them to invest in their economies and some form of technology transfer rather than simply furthering import dependence on China.

Progress on partnerships between Indian and Chinese companies in EV and battery manufacturing has been limited due to regulatory uncertainties in both countries. Exide batteries, for instance, entered an agreement with SVOLT energy to use and commercialise its lithium-ion cell manufacturing technology in 2022. Recently, Exide has also secured a deal to supply LFP batteries for Hyundai EVs in the Indian market. Viewing such partnerships involving transfer of technology as a threat to China’s dominance in the market, the Chinese government had reportedly advised EV companies against transferring advanced EV technology and investing in countries like India and Turkey that can later become competitors. Pressure from firms facing thinning profit margins at home could compel China to reconsider this position.

“Being good corporate citizens in Michigan requires data centers to do their fair share to transition the state to clean, affordable energy.","LANSING, MI – In a letter to the board of the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF), environmental and utility watchdog groups are requesting revisions of recently released guidelines for data center tax exemptions that do not currently comply with Michigan law.

The Michigan Environmental Council, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Sierra Club, and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan in a letter drafted on their behalf by Troposphere Legal point out that MSF’s current guidelines for enterprise data center tax exemptions do not adequately enforce the clean energy requirements enshrined in Michigan state law.

MSF’s guidelines currently state that an enterprise data centers comply with tax exempt status by merely contracting with a utility provider that is subject to Michigan’s clean energy regulatory framework. This is an incorrect interpretation of the law.

Statements from MEC, NRDC, Sierra Club, and CUB leaders:

“Michigan lawmakers created a clear standard: If a data center wants a tax break, it must show it will run on 90 percent clean energy. But this interpretation creates a massive loophole,” said Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director, Climate & Energy, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “Without clear and firm language to enforce the clean energy provisions, the standard becomes something companies can evade, and the costs and consequences land on Michigan communities and ratepayers. The board should close this loophole and ensure these large new customers strengthen our clean energy goals rather than weaken Michigan’s ability to meet them.”

“The MSF’s current interpretation creates a loophole big enough for any data center to walk through, one that undermines Michigan’s nation-leading clean energy laws,” said Tim Minotas, Sierra Club Michigan’s legislative & political director. “As energy-hungry data centers expand into our state, MSF must correct these guidelines to conform with Michigan’s values and our clean energy requirements.”

“Across the country, data centers are prolonging the life of expensive, dirty fossil fuel power plants or leading to the build out of more. Michigan’s legislature clearly recognized the threat of energy intensive data centers to our climate and acted to ensure the onus was on data centers to power their operations with 90 percent clean energy,” said Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council. “Being good corporate citizens in Michigan requires data centers to do their fair share to transition the state to clean, affordable energy. We urge the Strategic Fund Board to correct their guidance, which currently renders the law’s 90 percent clean energy requirement meaningless and undermines Michigan’s clean energy future.”

“Without strong enforcement of the laws, data centers could cause Michigan ratepayers to be saddled with new dirty energy sources for decades,"" said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan. ""The Strategic Fund Board must close this loophole to protect both consumers and the future of Michigan's energy economy.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-18 21:59:16.490667

“Clean water protections shouldn’t change with each administration,” said Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Water.
Wetlands provide critical wildlife habitats, replenish groundwater, control flooding, and protect clean water by filtering pollution.
“This is one of the most significant setbacks to clean water protections in half a century,” she said.
""Many waters that have been protected by the Clean Water Act for over 50 years would lose those protections under this proposal.""","Environmental justice campaigners on Monday said the Trump administration's latest rollback of wetland protections was ""a gift to developers and polluters at the expense of communities"" and demanded permanent protections for waterways.

“Clean water protections shouldn’t change with each administration,” said Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Water. “Every family deserves the same right to safe water, no matter where they live or who’s in office.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed changes to the rule known as ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS), which has been the subject of debate and legal challenges in recent decades. Under the Trump administration, as in President Donald Trump's first term, the EPA will focus on regulating permanent bodies of water like oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams.

The administration would more closely follow a 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. EPA, which the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) found this year would remove federal protections from 60-95% of wetlands across the nation.

The Zeldin rule would eliminate protections for most wetlands without visible surface water, going even further than Sackett v. EPA in codifying a narrower definition of wetlands that should be protected, said the Environmental Protection Network (EPN). The rule comes after pressure from industry groups that have bristled over past requirements to protect all waterways.

Wetlands provide critical wildlife habitats, replenish groundwater, control flooding, and protect clean water by filtering pollution.

The Biden administration required the Clean Water Act to protect “traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, interstate waters, as well as upstream water resources that significantly affect those waters,"" but was constrained by the Sackett ruling in 2023.

“This proposed rule is unnecessary and damaging, and ignores the scientific reality of what is happening to our nation’s water supply.""

Tarah Heinzen, legal director for Food and Water Watch, said the new rule ""weakens the bedrock Clean Water Act, making it easier to fill, drain, and pollute sensitive waterways from coast to coast.""

“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters—Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,"" said Heinzen. “This rule flies in the face of science and commonsense. Eliminating protections from small streams and wetlands will mean more pollution downstream—in our drinking water, at our beaches, and in our rivers.""

The ""critical functions"" of wetlands, she added, ""will only become more important as worsening climate change makes extreme weather more frequent. EPA must reverse course.""

Leda Huta, vice president of government relations for American Rivers, added that the change to WOTUS will ""likely make things worse for flood-prone communities and industries dependent on clean, reliable water.""

“This proposed rule is unnecessary and damaging, and ignores the scientific reality of what is happening to our nation’s water supply,” said Huta. ""The EPA is taking a big swipe at the Clean Water Act, our greatest tool for ensuring clean water nationwide.”

The proposal was applauded by the National Association of Manufacturers, whose president, Jay Timmins, said companies' ""ability to invest and build across the country"" has been ""undermined"" by the Obama and Biden administration's broader interpretation of WOTUS.

But Southerland said Zeldin's proposal ""ignores decades of science showing that wetlands and intermittent streams are essential to maintaining the health of our rivers, lakes, and drinking water supplies.""

“This is one of the most significant setbacks to clean water protections in half a century,” she said. ""It’s a direct assault on the clean water Americans rely on.”

Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife, and oceans at Earthjustice, said the group was evaluating the legality of the proposal and would ""not hesitate to go to court to protect the cherished rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands that all Americans need and depend on.”

""The proposal avoids specifying the exact scale of the deregulation it proposes, but it clearly would result in a serious reduction in legal protections for waters across the United States,"" said Caputo. ""Many waters that have been protected by the Clean Water Act for over 50 years would lose those protections under this proposal.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62206821&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C476%2C0%2C477,N,,2025-11-18 21:59:29.756306

Based on company research, the U.S. must add more than 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity within the coming decade to meet rising demand from AI, electrification and industrial growth

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric, a global energy technology leader, opened the company's Innovation Summit North America 2025 today, convening more than 2,500 business leaders and market innovators representing nearly every industry to accelerate solutions for a more resilient, affordable and intelligent energy future. The two-day summit (November 18–19) features technology showcases, partner announcements and new research designed to help organizations build ahead of demand and unlock new productivity with AI, software and services.

In his keynote address, Schneider Electric CEO Olivier Blum spoke to the evolving energy landscape, highlighting the company's continuing transformation to meet industry demands. He presented a forward-looking vision that further establishes the company's position as an energy technology partner.

Schneider Electric is advancing energy technology, the integration of electrification, automation and digital intelligence, across buildings, data centers, industrial applications and power grids. The company's open, AI-powered EcoStruxure™ Platform creates intelligent ecosystems to drive real-time insights, resilience, and efficiency.

""By converging electrification, automation and digitalization, we unlock the full value of energy, creating efficiency and sustainability for all,"" said Olivier Blum, CEO, Schneider Electric. ""As your dedicated energy technology partner, our role is to translate that vision into concrete solutions that help you rapidly digitalize and strengthen your resilience. Innovation Summit North America is where we bring this to life, moving faster from ambition to action, advancing Energy Tech together with our entire ecosystem of partners and customers.""

North America is entering a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads, re-industrialization and transport electrification. Much of today's infrastructure was not built to handle fast-ramping, highly variable demand, creating a gap between when capacity is needed and when it comes online. According to Schneider Electric's Sustainability Research Institute, grid instability costs U.S. businesses billions annually. The nation must add 1,000–2,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per decade to meet demand from AI computing, manufacturing and electrification (one TWh powers about 90,000 homes for a year). Schneider Electric's call at Innovation Summit North America is for public and private partnerships to address the time to power gap by adding capacity closer to where it's consumed; using software and AI to unlock headroom, reliability and efficiency from existing systems; and modernizing grid operations so energy can be orchestrated at scale.

The average price of a new vehicle — including light-duty cars and trucks — pushed past $50,000 for the first time in September, according to Cox Automotive.
Automakers have urged Trump and lawmakers in Congress to renew the deal, citing decades of business integration across North America.","Washington — The CEOs of all three Detroit automakers have been invited to publicly testify before Congress on Jan. 14 for the first time in more than 17 years.

The last congressional hearing that featured the top executives of Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV (formerly Chrysler LLC) was in late 2008, when concurrent financial and automotive crises were beginning to crash down on the global, national and Michigan economies.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced the upcoming meeting Tuesday evening via a press release. Cruz is chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. He said the hearing will be titled ""Pedal to the Policy: The Views of the American Auto Industry on the Upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization.”

The hearing, if all invitees attend, will feature testimony from Ford's Jim Farley, GM's Mary Barra and Stellantis' Antonio Filosa. Tesla, Inc. Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy was also invited to round out the panel of top U.S. automaker executives.

The hearing will touch on fuel economy regulations, vehicle affordability, a bumpy transition to electric vehicles and more.

Commerce Committee Republicans, in a press release, framed the meeting as an opportunity to examine ""how radical global warming regulations and mandated technologies have driven up the cost of vehicles for American consumers.""

Cruz said in a statement: “Americans have been clear that they are hyper-focused on affordability — and so is this committee. The average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade, driven up by onerous government-mandated technologies and radical environmental regulations.""

The average price of a new vehicle — including light-duty cars and trucks — pushed past $50,000 for the first time in September, according to Cox Automotive. Price tags hovered around $32,500 a decade earlier, per Cox.

Erin Keating, Cox's executive analyst, explained that trend as a mix of factors.

""It is important to remember that the new-vehicle market is inflationary. Prices go up over time, and today’s market is certainly reminding us of that. While there are many affordable options out there, many price-conscious buyers are choosing to stay on the sidelines or cruising in the used-vehicle market,"" she wrote in an Oct. 14 analysis.

Keating continued: ""Today’s auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market. Tariffs have introduced new cost pressure to the business, but the pricing story in September was mostly driven by the healthy mix of EVs and higher-end vehicles pushing the new-vehicle (average transaction price) into uncharted territory.""

Cruz suggested that Republicans, since they gained control of Washington earlier this year, have pulled policy levers to bring prices down.

""The One Big Beautiful Bill Act took crucial steps to drive costs down with the repeal of the EV mandate and (corporate average fuel economy) standards, but we must do more,"" he said. ""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice.”

The January session could give Republican and Democratic lawmakers a rare chance to ask executives of the country's largest retail business sector about company plans and how federal policymaking affects them. U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, sits on the committee, as does Republican Ohio U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno.

The freshman lawmaker from the Buckeye State, who has been influential in automotive policymaking this year, previously amassed a personal fortune running and selling car dealerships.

The meeting will also come as negotiations ramp up over a mandatory review of the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement that President Donald Trump signed during his first term in office. The countries must agree to a renewal by July 1 or reach alternative arrangements. If they do not, the key regional trade deal will lapse.

Automakers have urged Trump and lawmakers in Congress to renew the deal, citing decades of business integration across North America.

Even though it has been a generation since the Detroit Three sent all three of their CEOs to publicly speak with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the automakers have been active in Washington.

Company executives lobbied Trump directly on tariffs earlier this year and visited him at the White House in 2017 during the Republican president's first term.

“We deserve democracy. Democracy over our water solutions,” Armon Alex, member of Gulf of Mexico Youth Climate Summit, said.

Jake Hernandez with the Texas Campaign for the Environment echoed those concerns.

“The desalination project is a bad deal for residents, no matter the cost,” Hernandez added.

The Inner Harbor Desalination Project had been paused in September after city leaders raised questions about funding and environmental impacts. On Tuesday, the proposal returned to the city council agenda, with City Manager Peter Zanoni presenting it as a plan that comes at no direct cost to the city.

“Water conservation and reuse should be the first alternatives considered by the City of Corpus Christi or any other water providers when evaluating additional sources of water for the community and industry,” Texas Coastal Bend Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation member, Neil McQueen, said during Tuesday's press conference.

The mayor of Taft and program director of Chispa Texas, Elida Castillo, echoed the concerns.

“This is not what’s going to impact us now, but also for the future. We are concerned about desalination. We are concerned about the quality of water in our bays. They have not tested that water,” Castillo said.

Neighbors have also showed support for those living near the Inner Harbor and Hillcrest-Washington Coles neighborhoods.

Mona Lyttle, a Hillcrest resident and member of the Hillcrest Resident Association spoke during the press conference as well.

“We in Hillcrest, we are saying ‘no’ to desal, from the beginning, to the end, to our last breath,"" Lyttle said.

“It takes our community to stand up and say what is happening in Hillcrest is not okay. Because if it’s going to happen there, it will happen to your neighborhood eventually,"" Alex mentioned to Neighborhood News Reporter, Alexis Scott.

The project, initially introduced as a long-term solution to Corpus Christi’s water supply challenges, has faced criticism for its potential environmental effects, cost, and impacts on surrounding communities. City officials have maintained that the project could secure additional water capacity while minimizing financial risk to the city.

The project will prioritize South Carolina vendors and suppliers, creating sustained demand for local businesses.
South Carolina gains transformative first-mover advantage: while the 10 new reactors require years for siting and permitting, VC Summer can deliver power sooner, positioning South Carolina as the anchor of America’s nuclear renaissance.
South Carolina has a chance to turn a painful chapter into a success story.
It’s the deal South Carolina needs.","South Carolina stands at a crossroads. Our state faces surging electricity demand driven by population growth, advanced manufacturing and data center expansion.

Meanwhile, two partially built nuclear reactors at V.C. Summer in Fairfield County have sat dormant since July 2017. The Santee Cooper board’s unanimous decision on Oct. 24 to enter final negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management to sell and complete those reactors with private capital changes everything.

This proposed deal transforms an abandoned liability into a strategic asset. It delivers 2,200 megawatts of reliable baseload power without asking taxpayers for another dime, positioning South Carolina as the national leader in America’s nuclear resurgence.

Nuclear power remains the only reliable, scalable energy source capable of meeting our state’s growing needs. While wind and solar have their place, they cannot provide the around-the-clock baseload power that manufacturers, data centers and households depend on. As China accelerates nuclear deployment and states like Texas and Tennessee expand their energy portfolios, South Carolina cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.

The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design represents a quantum leap in safety. It features passive safety systems that rely on gravity and natural circulation rather than pumps, meaning the reactor can safely shut down and cool itself even during complete power loss. This eliminates vulnerabilities that led to accidents like Three Mile Island and Fukushima. If power systems fail, physics itself takes over, with water naturally flowing downward to cool the reactor core, and heat naturally rising to dissipate through the containment structure. No human intervention, electricity or backup generators needed.

The deal itself has been thoroughly de-risked. Since July 2017, Westinghouse has successfully delivered six AP1000 units worldwide, including Georgia’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which now power more than 1 million homes. Fourteen more units are under construction in China. Construction efficiencies improved 30% between Vogtle’s third and fourth units, and the design is fully licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission until 2046.

Critically, Santee Cooper has maintained V.C. Summer in good condition since 2017, keeping the site among the best-preserved nuclear assets globally. We’re not starting from scratch; we’re finishing what we started.

The financial structure protects South Carolina ratepayers while securing massive benefits. Brookfield’s proposal includes a multi-billion-dollar ratepayer relief package and provides Santee Cooper with percentage ownership and power share through a structure that delivers below-market electricity rates without equity investment or project-level financial risk.

Brookfield brings extraordinary resources: approximately $1 trillion in assets under management, including $500 billion invested in U.S. infrastructure. As majority owner of Westinghouse, Brookfield uniquely aligns capital, technology and execution expertise. The company is negotiating with major tech companies for long-term power purchase agreements at premium rates, ensuring stable revenues while guaranteeing that Santee Cooper’s customers receive power at below-market rates.

Beyond electricity generation, Brookfield’s investment will rebuild South Carolina’s nuclear workforce and strengthen the state’s manufacturing ecosystem. The project will prioritize South Carolina vendors and suppliers, creating sustained demand for local businesses. Through partnerships with trade schools and universities, Brookfield will establish comprehensive training pipelines for nuclear technicians, welders and engineers.

This commitment to workforce development will revitalize the Midlands economy and position South Carolina as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and nuclear research. The ripple effects will extend far beyond Fairfield County, creating opportunities for the next generation of South Carolinians in careers that didn’t exist when the project was first conceived.

.

The completion of V.C. Summer’s two reactors also creates powerful synergies with the $80 billion initiative to build 10 additional AP1000 reactors nationwide recently announced by the Trump Administration. South Carolina gains transformative first-mover advantage: while the 10 new reactors require years for siting and permitting, VC Summer can deliver power sooner, positioning South Carolina as the anchor of America’s nuclear renaissance.

The alternative is leaving 2,200 megawatts of potential capacity on the table while competitors surge ahead. South Carolina has a chance to turn a painful chapter into a success story. The Brookfield-Santee Cooper partnership delivers reliable power, protects ratepayers, creates jobs, requires no new taxpayer funding and positions our state as a national energy leader. That’s not just a good deal. It’s the deal South Carolina needs.

Starting as a part-time donation attendant, Martinez persevered through challenges, including time spent incarcerated, to become a regional turnaround manager, an achievement he attributes to Goodwill’s focus on leadership development and grace.

Martinez now helps other leaders thrive, informed by his own experience of being given a second chance.

“My whole journey, I look now and say that Goodwill didn’t just change the direction of my life, they gave me a space to create a new life,” Martinez said. “It’s one thing to be gainfully employed; it’s another to have a career, and to me, that is humbling.”

For Martinez, who was under pressure to find a job after his release from prison, Goodwill provided the foundation for a career.

Stephanie Bell, Goodwill’s customer experience manager, noted that Goodwill took a chance on Martinez, who lacked traditional references and job history. Today, as a regional turnaround manager, Martinez mentors store teams, teaching what he learned: that success is about growth and measurable improvement, not perfection.

“The biggest one is grace,” Martinez said. “Goodwill has given that to me. … I’ve been allowed to make mistakes and take that and learn.”

Gary Smith, Goodwill’s chief mission officer, sees Martinez’s transformation as proof of the organization’s model.

“Anthony came to Goodwill and needed help,” Smith said. “Now, he’s helping all the managers that he’s been working with day to day. It’s an amazing transformation.”

Martinez’s ascent from the donation line to managing one of the largest stores in Denver and, now, consulting other leaders was fueled by key skills from Goodwill’s programs: leadership development and a deep understanding of individual capabilities and self-awareness.

Martinez’s story aligns with the goal of Goodwill’s new Clean Tech Accelerator, which aims to address the mismatch between available jobs and in-demand skills in Colorado.

“The biggest thing is we’re partnering with those employers,” Smith said. “We ask them what the skill gaps they’re seeing are, and we will build our curriculum to make sure those skill gaps are addressed. We’re focused largely on the jobs of the future.”

The accelerator is a free, four-week training program that provides participants, including justice-impacted people, veterans and the underemployed, with the skills and certifications they need to maintain and repair electric vehicle charging stations and other clean energy equipment.

The program offers a stipend and support for needs such as transportation and job coaching for a minimum of six months post-placement. Graduates are projected to start at about $27 per hour, offering a significant step toward financial independence.

The initiative comes as Colorado’s clean energy sector continues to grow at more than double the rate of the state’s overall employment.

Smith emphasized that the success of Goodwill’s mission-driven programs, which are free to participants, relies on a mix of funding from retail stores, grants and private donors, including the recently opened Excel Center adult high school.

He also stressed the need for Colorado businesses to embrace a fair-chance employment model and partner with Goodwill.

“Employers can partner with us with a willingness to hire our graduates,” he said. We often have businesses that come into our programs … and ultimately hire our graduates.”",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-134050.png,N,,2025-11-18 19:59:17.741477

He explained to ABC13 how these battery storage systems can be utilized.
""Battery energy storage system is more so the sense of a seamless transition to short term.""
When it comes to the statewide grid, battery storage systems can both support the grid during an outage and times of peak demand.
Which is why plans are in place to expand battery storage capacity in Texas five times over in the next three years.","One of the latest advances in renewable energy is called a Battery Energy Storage System, known by the acronym BESS. There are residential versions like the Telsa Powerwall, industrial sized batteries large enough to power entire office buildings, and even ones that backup the Texas power grid. One of the newest BESS sites has just finished completion in Galveston County. Batteries near a substation in Dickison can now support the statewide grid.

This clean, green energy is on the rise in Texas to help keep the lights on even during an outage. ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith visited the Eaton Experience Center in north Houston to learn more about this energy innovation. The site has their own BESS which the team de-energized for safety during the visit.

Rolando Barcenas is an expert in the energy field for power company Eaton. He explained to ABC13 how these battery storage systems can be utilized.

""The benefit of the BESS is not having to use it immediately and store it for later use,"" Barcenas said.

It operates like a standby generator but with an important difference.

With a standby generator, you still lose power for a moment if the main power grid were to go down. That's because the generator has to turn on and begin running. With a battery, you don't lose power at all because the energy is already there, stored in the battery. ""Battery energy storage system is more so the sense of a seamless transition to short term."" In other words, these battery storage systems are the only way to store power in case of an outage.

So, during an outage, Barcenas explains how the computer system associated with a BESS would work. The system's controller activates the battery's energy storage to keep the power flowing. And while most batteries have a lifespan of 20 to 25 years before needing to be updated or replaced, the amount of energy a battery can hold is typically only a few hours, depending on the size. That's why experts recommend having additional power sources like a generator or solar panels to keep things running if the main power grid were to go down.

When it comes to the statewide grid, battery storage systems can both support the grid during an outage and times of peak demand. In August 2023, during the record heat wave that lasted nearly the entire month, the Texas Comptroller's office reports that extra power stored in statewide battery systems connected to the grid helped reduce energy costs by nearly 50 percent.

And while batteries alone may not be how to foolproof the Texas grid, this type of energy storage is one of a kind and plays an important role in power resiliency. Reminder, most solar panels, wind turbines, and even backup generators can't store energy for later use like a battery can. Proving to be a safe and effective way to add resiliency to the statewide grid. Which is why plans are in place to expand battery storage capacity in Texas five times over in the next three years. This is to help make our grid more resilient for when we need power the most.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18170844_111825-ktrk-BESS-img.png?w=1600,N,,2025-11-18 21:00:31.667621

The plant will onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules.

According to First Solar officials, the company plans to spend around $330 million to establish the new complex, which is scheduled to begin operating in the second half of 2026. The facility is expected to create more than 600 new jobs. Officials say the expansion is in response to increased demand for domestically produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by the White House in June 2025.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” says CEO Mark Widmar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

As reported in an upcoming news analysis in the November issue of USGlass magazine, the growth of solar power is a promising but underutilized niche for the glass industry, with some companies adding production capabilities to produce specialized glass panels or focusing on recycling solar glass and components. First Solar has partnered with several glass manufacturers to supply glass for its panels, including NSG Group and Vitro Architectural Glass.

“The past decade has marked a substantial evolution in residential and grid-scale utility solar markets,” Paul Bush, vice president of sustainability, technical services and government affairs at Vitro, told USGlass for the November article on the state of the solar industry. “Within the residential sector, the adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems by developers and homeowners has experienced significant growth, leading to a correlated increase in qualified installers. Diverse governmental tax incentives and financial subsidies primarily drive this expansion. Grid-scale utilities are experiencing rapid growth, driven by tax incentives and a push for domestically manufactured products in PV systems.”

First Solar officials explain that the new facility expands the company’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere. That footprint includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California.

The Gaffney facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern guidance by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

As Senator Budd said in his remarks: “This is a great day to celebrate a more than a billion-dollar investment and one thousand new jobs.
“Vulcan, uniquely, and this is what got my attention in Washington, is that Vulcan is fully decoupled from China.
“But also, North Carolina is key in this.","Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-N.C.) joined state and local leaders in delivering remarks after Vulcan Elements announced that they will be building a new $1 billion ‘Polaris facility’ in Benson, North Carolina. Senator Budd has championed the U.S. Government’s partnership with Vulcan Elements in their efforts to reshore the rare earth magnet manufacturing industry. The Polaris facility will create 1,000 new manufacturing jobs in North Carolina and bolster America’s national security by breaking our reliance on China for these vital components.

As Senator Budd said in his remarks:

“This is a great day to celebrate a more than a billion-dollar investment and one thousand new jobs. It’s a boost to the local economy, but I want you all to know how important this is for our national security.

“Vulcan, uniquely, and this is what got my attention in Washington, is that Vulcan is fully decoupled from China. We had some earlier conversations, and it was interesting that China tipped their hand to what they intended to do to constrain the American supply chain, or supplies to the United States. So, this is well timed. This is well-timed for the security of our nation. You know, after meeting the Vulcan team in Washington, I immediately realized the need to prioritize Vulcan’s efforts.

“I want to give you a few specifics, including the lead to push the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment, or the IBAS program funding, also working to reduce barriers to magnet production, and then talking to all of the presidential nominees who come through our Senate offices that are related to Armed Services and the Department of War supply chain. So, if they didn’t know about Vulcan, and most of them did know about Vulcan, when I asked them—if they didn’t when they came in, they sure did when they left.

“Almost every weapon in our supply chain uses magnets, including jets, submarines, and the missiles that they fire, but they’re also in things that we mentioned earlier, data centers, drones, robotics, and chips; all of which depend on rare earth magnets.

“The U.S. should have done this decades ago, but now we are, and we’re moving the critical supply chain for rare earths and so many other things away from China. Vulcan, you’re in the lead for that. So, thank you.

“But also, North Carolina is key in this. This is a great state for so many reasons, whether it’s semiconductors or batteries, and now rare earths. So, congratulations. We appreciate all that you do. We’re glad that you’re here, and we look forward to the future together.”

BACKGROUND

Senator Budd has led the charge in the U.S. Senate to support Vulcan’s efforts to reshore the rare earth magnet industry:

Led a North Carolina delegation letter to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Michael Duffy, highlighting the impressive work of Vulcan Elements and supporting the company’s application for funding through the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) Program.

Pushed for a provision in the FY26 NDAA directing the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, no later than March 2026, on an analysis of domestic Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) manufacturing in the United States or allied nations and identify barriers to domestic rare earth magnet production.

Championed a $4 million increase in IBAS funding in the Senate’s Defense Appropriations bill.

Cogeneration in the National Energy Mix

The current state of cogeneration in Mexico reflects both growing industrial interest and ongoing regulatory adjustments. According to sector data, cogeneration supplies an important share of electricity and thermal energy for large users such as chemicals, food and beverage, and manufacturing. High-efficiency cogeneration has expanded over the past decade, driven by cost-reduction needs and emissions-mitigation goals. However, changes in the regulatory environment and evolving permitting processes have introduced operational challenges for project developers. The updated electricity framework now places greater emphasis on efficiency and reliability metrics, pushing companies to modernize equipment and pursue cleaner fuels. Industry groups at the Congress noted that cogeneration remains one of the most effective technologies for reducing industrial emissions and stabilizing energy costs, particularly as natural gas supply and renewable integration become central to national planning.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/gas-turbine-inlet-air-hole-filter-system-large-ai-2025-03-06-04-57-25-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=62c404c8&itok=Hy1dC2Rf,N,,2025-11-18 21:00:15.137567

Those threats to reliability stem partly from a large number of fossil fuel power plant retirements in the U.S., as well as surging demand from data centers and other large loads.
But amid shrinking power supply margins, more severe cold or wintry weather over a wide area could result in supply shortages, according to NERC.
“Record-setting demand is anticipated for some areas and may strain the grid in areas with double-digit growth rates,” the grid watchdog said in a video on its new report.
Peak demand for all areas NERC assesses has increased by 20 gigawatts, or 2.5%, since the previous winter, surpassing a 9.4 GW net gain in bulk power system resources.","Soaring power demand, including from data centers and the electrification of the economy, could contribute to energy supply shortfalls in some areas during extreme weather this winter, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned on Tuesday.

The report echoed other recent assessments from NERC, including longer-term outlooks, that expect sufficient energy resources during normal conditions but potential supply shortfalls and power outages under more intense weather. Those threats to reliability stem partly from a large number of fossil fuel power plant retirements in the U.S., as well as surging demand from data centers and other large loads.

“This report clearly shows that demand for electricity is skyrocketing—especially in areas serving new data centers—and reliability is still at risk,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “The addition of new resources, though significant, isn’t keeping up. Now more than ever, we need smart energy policies that keep the lights on and address this growing energy deficit.”

In NERC’s winter reliability report released Nov. 18, all areas assessed by the grid watchdog are expected to have adequate energy resources during normal winter weather conditions.

But amid shrinking power supply margins, more severe cold or wintry weather over a wide area could result in supply shortages, according to NERC.

“Record-setting demand is anticipated for some areas and may strain the grid in areas with double-digit growth rates,” the grid watchdog said in a video on its new report.

Areas at elevated risk of electricity supply shortfalls during extreme conditions this winter include the Pacific Northwest, Texas, New England and much of the Southeast. New England also faces risks to natural gas pipeline capacity in the event of extreme weather.

Peak demand for all areas NERC assesses has increased by 20 gigawatts, or 2.5%, since the previous winter, surpassing a 9.4 GW net gain in bulk power system resources. The vast majority of net capacity additions—or 8.1 GW—is from demand response resources, which can encourage customers to reduce their energy usage, rather than generation.

Some of the regions in NERC’s assessment are forecasting almost 10% demand growth. Areas with the biggest forecasted peak demand increases include the Southeast, parts of the West and the PJM Interconnection, which spans sections of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.

NERC noted that freezing temperatures can threaten natural gas-based generation and fuel supplies, particularly in the South. It urged natural gas utilities to prepare for severe cold and advised utilities and grid operators to require freeze protection measures and other cold weather preparedness plans.

“Electricity demand continues to grow faster than the resources being added to the grid, especially during the most extreme winter conditions where actual demand can topple forecasts,” said John Moura, NERC’s director of reliability assessments and performance analysis. “This latest assessment highlights progress on cold weather readiness but underscores that more work remains to ensure energy and fuel supplies can be reliably delivered even during the harshest conditions.”

Like every other automaker operating in North America, Stellantis announced a move to Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug back in 2024. The company said that this would begin in 2025, so it's a few months off schedule, but likely a godsend to Dodge and Jeep EV drivers nonetheless. The move will give those owners access to more than 20,000 Tesla Supercharger stations in North America alone.

Stellantis officials said Supercharger availability will start with the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona EV, followed by the 2026 Jeep Recon ""and other future products to be announced."" By and large, Stellantis is quite behind on its EV strategy and is using the current rollback of EV tax credits and fuel economy regulations to pivot back to gasoline-powered cars. However, like the aforementioned Recon, it still has some plans in the battery department, even if its existing models have been met with mixed reviews and slow sales.

Over the past few years, the Tesla plug has increasingly become the standard for new EVs sold in America, due to its slimmer size, ease of use and access to the vast Supercharger network. Automakers like Toyota, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid and Rivian have already equipped their EVs with the NACS plug from the factory. Most start with NACS adapters first and then move to the native NACS plug in subsequent model years.

Stellantis isn't revealing its strategy for this, but presumably, NACS adapters will be provided to customers first before the cars themselves are outfitted with the Tesla plug.

With this approval, developers pursuing carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in Texas will work directly with the RRC for Class VI well permitting, rather than navigating the EPA’s permit queue.

What the New Regulatory Framework Means

Under Texas’s new Class VI program:

The RRC is now the primary permitting authority for Class VI wells, overseeing applications, technical review, construction, operation, monitoring, and long-term site care. Concurrent authorization by both the EPA and the RRC will no longer be required.

The state’s Class VI rules have been developed to meet or exceed federal UIC requirements, with the EPA maintaining an oversight role.

Texas-based regulation is expected to streamline permit timing, increase regulatory certainty, and align CCS development with the state’s existing subsurface and injection-well experience.

This shift is significant for CCS developers seeking to advance projects under the federal Section 45Q tax credit framework, where a permitted Class VI well is essential for secure geological storage.

The final rule granting primacy to the RRC is effective on December 15, 2025.

The swift proliferation of data centers in the U.S., along with the electrification of buildings and transportation, is driving up electricity use across the country faster than new power supplies are added to the grid. That dwindling supply can raise the possibility of power shortfalls in extremely cold weather, when energy-intensive heating systems increase overall demand.

After multiple years of flat or near-flat growth, peak demand has grown by about 20 gigawatts, or 2.5%, from last year, NERC officials said in their annual winter assessment of the reliability of the U.S. and Canada’s power grids. New electricity net supplies added since last year were less than 10 gigawatts.

“As a result, record-setting demand is anticipated for some areas and may strain the grid in areas with double-digit growth rates,” NERC said.

Areas including PJM, the U.S. Southeast, and parts of the U.S. West have the largest increase in peak demand forecasts, NERC said.

The areas that NERC assesses, which include the U.S. and Canada, had adequate power supplies under normal expected winter weather for the three months ending in February, the regulator said. Prolonged and widespread severe frigid weather, however, raises the likelihood of supply shortages in areas including New England, the West, Texas and the Southeast, NERC said.

Growth in power sources like wind and solar, which only produce energy when the wind blows and the sun shines, has added complexity to the grid and intensified reliability concerns in some areas, said NERC. Frigid temperatures can also freeze off natural gas power production and fuel sources, increasing risks.

Work to restart the reactor comes at a time of unprecedented electric demand growth from electrification and the new data centers needed to support a growing digital economy and to help America win the AI race. Crane will support grid stability by delivering reliable, around-the-clock electric supply. An economic impact study commissioned by the Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council found that restarting the reactor at Crane will help keep electricity prices in check; add approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs; generate over $16 billion for Pennsylvania's GDP and deliver more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is currently more than 80% staffed with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians and licensed operator trainees. Inspections of key plant components and regulatory reviews continue on schedule. Constellation has also committed more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations in the region. In 2025 the company has donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Launching the Crane Clean Energy Center is part of a broader multi-billion dollar investment that Constellation is making in America's largest and growing nuclear fleet to extend the lives of existing nuclear plants and boost their output, helping ensure the fleet’s always-on power continues to meet the needs of America's families and businesses for decades to come.

KUHN: China, he says, is now the main character in the story of fighting climate change.
SIMON: Julia Simon, NPR News, Eureka, California.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

World leaders have gathered in Brazil for the U.N. Climate Conference. The U.S. is not there, but China is. When it comes to energy transition, the U.S. and China couldn't be on more different paths. China is moving away from fossil fuels while the U.S. is doubling down. Experts say this will have consequences for the climate and these countries' economies. NPR sent two correspondents to opposite sides of the Pacific to learn more. We begin with NPR's Julia Simon in Eureka, California.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In far northern California, Chris Mikkelsen drives an old police cruiser past little wooden houses.

Pine trees with moss just, like, hanging off of them.

CHRIS MIKKELSEN: It's just an old seaside town.

SIMON: Mikkelsen is the executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which plans to assemble wind turbines for a massive new offshore wind project. About 20 miles off this misty coast, two companies - American Vineyard Offshore and German RWE - plan to build turbines to power more than 2 million homes. Mikkelsen says the project aims to make about 270 long-term local jobs.

MIKKELSEN: It's going to, you know, change the economic viability of our community. And I get a little - my voice gets a little shaky 'cause it's going to make a better opportunity for our kids.

SIMON: Yeah.

MIKKELSEN: That's pretty important.

SIMON: The new terminal was supposed to be shovel-ready as soon as 2026, Mikkelsen says. That's no longer realistic, in part because the Trump administration recently canceled more than $426 million in federal grants for the project. Mikkelsen says it's been pencils down since then as they try to find new sources of money. This is one of dozens of actions this administration has taken to starve the renewable energy industry of federal support from canceling tax credits years early to issuing stop-work orders.

Amanda Levin at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council says the U.S. renewable industry had been growing.

AMANDA LEVIN: For the first time last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal. Things were headed in the right direction, but this really just takes the wind out of their sails.

SIMON: The Trump administration is reversing support for renewables, which it incorrectly labels as risky and unreliable. But across the Pacific Ocean, America's biggest competitor - China - thinks otherwise. Let's throw the mic 5,000 miles to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's there.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: You are right, Julia. Here in China, renewable isn't a dirty word. China's leadership has made strategic choices to include renewables in its energy mix. We're in China's Zhangbei region, which is in between the capital Beijing and the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The area is rich in wind resources, and it's where a lot of China's wind and solar capacity is being installed.

(SOUNDBITE OF TURBINE BLADES SPINNING)

KUHN: Turbine blades swoosh past in huge circles. The electricity goes from here to a grid outside Beijing and on to the rest of China. China now dominates the global renewable sector. In the first half of this year, China built more solar than the rest of the world combined. Seventy-four percent of all large-scale wind and solar projects are being built in China. Compare that to the U.S. that's building 6%. China now has more installed generation capacity from solar and wind than from gas and coal.

It wasn't always this way. Until recently, China's economic growth came at the cost of air pollution from burning fossil fuels. But in the last few decades, authorities in Beijing began to consider a sustainable economic growth model, and renewables have been a key part of that, according to Qin Haiyan, director of the parent company of the wind farm we visited and vice president of the World Wind Energy Association.

QIN HAIYAN: (Through interpreter) Developing the economy and reducing carbon emissions to address climate change are now no longer contradictory.

KUHN: And this, according to the Asia Society's Li Shuo, is the biggest difference between the U.S. and China in climate policy today.

LI SHUO: It couldn't be a stronger contrast between the two countries.

KUHN: In China, solar and wind are now cheaper than coal and gas. Li Shuo says one of the most dramatic aspects of China's climate story is not just that they seem to be cutting their climate emissions...

LI: But also, to what extent other parts of the world can also benefit from China's low-carbon products.

SIMON: So China is now exporting turbines and solar panels and batteries around the world, from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan.

KUHN: That's right, Julia. All the renewables growth, both local and exports, is a bright spot amid China's slowing economy, especially its slumping real estate sector. David Fishman is a principal at the Lantau Group in Shanghai.

DAVID FISHMAN: People who used to be swinging hammers building commercial real estate are now swinging hammers installing solar panels. And that - well, yes, of course. You double - triple down on that.

SIMON: Back in Eureka, Mikkelsen walks along a creaky dock, an abandoned pulp mill looming behind us. He says he doesn't understand why the Trump administration would cancel the grants for the terminal supporting the wind project. He says this community has been suffering since 2008 when the pulp mill closed.

MIKKELSEN: Our administration that was recently elected, not only at the presidential level but even some of our Congress and senators, really ran on a platform that we're going to build back America, that we're going to create jobs in rural America - good, skilled, trained, you know, high-paying jobs. And there's no better place. You're looking around, you're seeing the remnants of what once was.

SIMON: It is still unclear what the nationwide cuts to renewable energy mean for U.S. climate emissions.

KUHN: But in China, the climate story is more clear, and it's a rare, encouraging indicator in the global warming story. The growth of renewable energy means that China's emissions seem to be on track to peak or are nearing their peak, Li Shuo says. And China's renewable exports mean the country is helping other countries reduce their emissions too.

SIMON: Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins University, says now, at the end of the day...

JEREMY WALLACE: What America does is part of a story, and it is not the main part of the story. It's a cute side character.

Instead, that water will be diverted to the evaporation ponds.
Craig Reese, project manager with ICP contractor Idaho Environmental Coalition, recognizes the importance of environmental responsibility as his team constructs the new disposal area.
“Every aspect of the design, construction and future operation of the engineered Cell 3 landfill and leachate collection system focuses on environmental protection,” said Reese.","IDAHO FALLS, Idaho —The Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) is expanding a critical disposal facility, employing lessons learned from two decades of operational success and the best of American technology to continue safely disposing of waste and enabling the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (EM) to meet its commitments to the state of Idaho.

The Idaho CERCLA Disposal Facility (ICDF) has provided safe, cost effective and environmentally responsible disposal for contaminated waste generated by cleanup on the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site.

CERCLA stands for Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, a law enacted by Congress in 1980 that requires stringent waste acceptance criteria, ensuring protection of the public and the underlying Snake River Plain Aquifer.

In 2020, ICP determined it would need to expand the landfill to dispose of a projected 340,000 cubic meters of waste — comparable in size to more than 150 hot air balloons — over the next several decades, far outpacing the ICDF’s remaining available disposal capacity of 90,000 cubic meters.

The ICDF’s new disposal cell and evaporation ponds will be constructed using multiple layers of liners made specifically for disposal of CERCLA-generated waste.

In addition, an engineered collection and detection system for leachate, or liquid that seeps through the landfill, is critical to the facility.

Together, that system and the liners significantly reduce the likelihood of water percolating through the landfill into the aquifer. Instead, that water will be diverted to the evaporation ponds.

Prior to the expansion project, a coordinated effort with EM identified several lessons learned to improve operations. For instance, the expansion will offer more operational space, better management of occasional spring snowmelt water surges, easier control of water levels by linking the new evaporation ponds with the original evaporation ponds, and the capability to dispose of larger debris while maintaining landfill safety.

Craig Reese, project manager with ICP contractor Idaho Environmental Coalition, recognizes the importance of environmental responsibility as his team constructs the new disposal area.

“Every aspect of the design, construction and future operation of the engineered Cell 3 landfill and leachate collection system focuses on environmental protection,” said Reese. “This includes learning from more than 20 years of operation that will allow us to fulfill our mission.”

See EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

The stated intent of the proposed rule includes:

Amending the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) in light of the United States Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.

Provide greater regulatory certainty/predictability/consistency by clarifying the definition of WOTUS.

Implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.

The definition of WOTUS is arguably one of the most critical jurisdictional terms in the Clean Water Act. Its importance is magnified since it is relevant to both National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting and non-NPDES programs such as:

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act wetland permits.

Section 311 oil/hazardous substance release requirements.

Clean Water Act Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure regulations.

As a result, the definition of WOTUS has been and continues to be the subject of frequent litigation, legislative oversight, rulemakings, and public policy debates since the enactment of the modern version of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

The Trump Administration has sought to narrow aspects of the Biden-era rulemaking addressing this definition in regard to a determination of Sackett’s outline of when adjacent wetlands are jurisdictional.

The United States Supreme Court in Sackett articulated a two-part process for determining a WOTUS:

The CWA’s use of “waters” in §1362(7) refers only to “geo-graphic[al] features that are described in ordinary parlance as ‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes’ ” and to adjacent wetlands that are “indistinguishable” from those bodies of water due to a continuous sur-face connection. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 755, 742, 739.

To assert jurisdiction over an adjacent wetland un-der the CWA, a party must establish “first, that the adjacent [body of water constitutes] . . . ‘water[s] of the United States’ (i.e., a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

EPA states by way of introduction to the proposed rule that in September 2023, the agencies issued a final rule without notice and comment amending the regulations defining WOTUS to conform to the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision. They state that numerous concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court’s interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction under the Act as well as identifying implementation-related issues. The agencies argue that in this proposed rule they are revising the 2023 rule to:

Implement the Sackett decision.

Provide greater regulatory certainty.

Increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.

This is argued to be based on the text, structure, and history of the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent, taking into account other relevant factors.

EPA describes the key revisions in the proposed rule as including:

Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems; Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as ""wet season,"" to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS;

In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

Same-day comment by industrial trade associations and the environmental organizations include predictable responses such as National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons states in part:

… Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability … For too long, the regulatory structure under the WOTUS rule, which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S., undermining our ability to invest and build across the country. Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the Clean Water Act is critical for manufacturers planning new projects.

Water Keeper Alliance states in part that:

… By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life … Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 19:59:44.734702

A practical path forward Although Congress has taken some steps to improve the permitting process, more must be done.
Public power utilities have long set standards for reliability, affordability, and innovation.","The United States faces a complex power challenge. The rise of data centers, the return of American manufacturing and the push to electrify vehicles and homes are all driving new demands on the nation’s electrical grid. Public power utilities, which are community-owned and not-for-profit providers, are prepared to meet these needs, serving nearly 55 million Americans in more than 2,000 communities across 49 states and several territories.

However, these utilities are often slowed by an outdated, unpredictable federal permitting system. This is particularly challenging for new generation projects, as regulatory barriers and red tape can prolong timelines by years and raise costs by millions. In the end, these costs are borne by communities and leave families and businesses more vulnerable to supply disruptions or delayed improvements in reliability.

Permitting reform is not about diminishing environmental protections. Instead, it is about removing unnecessary and duplicative regulatory hurdles that slow the construction of new generation resources and other needed energy infrastructure. The American Public Power Association supports pragmatic legislative efforts that streamline the permitting and siting process, provide clearer federal guidance, and produce timelier decisions. Reform must maintain strong environmental oversight but deliver outcomes that allow vital energy projects to proceed without unnecessary delay.

When the permitting process is lengthy or unpredictable, the difficulty and expense of building new infrastructure grows. Customers are directly affected; they may see higher energy bills or even miss economic development opportunities because the process takes too long. Projects that meet environmental standards should move through federal review with clear milestones and prompt decisions. Federal policy must also ensure reviews are coordinated, not conducted in succession, so agencies work together with established schedules.

Regulatory guidance should be consistent, even as administrations change, to enable local planners to chart paths for long-term investment. Ultimately, reforms must respect local governance and accountability, so public power investments reflect the unique needs of their communities.

The customer impact of permitting delays

The impact of permitting delay is felt from America’s largest cities to its smallest. Public power utilities make up the majority of U.S. electric utilities but serve about 15% of customers, roughly 55 million people nationwide. Most of these utilities operate in smaller communities, with a typical service population of just 4,400. As a result, every increase in project cost caused by permitting delays is felt directly by those communities.

Bureaucratic delays can stretch out a single project for years, raising financing and construction costs and making it harder for utilities to invest in reliable and affordable generation or the infrastructure needed to deliver power. Uncertainty about shifting federal requirements further discourages timely investment, slowing progress on projects that will benefit public power communities.

A practical path forward

Although Congress has taken some steps to improve the permitting process, more must be done. Lawmakers should recognize when state and local environmental reviews satisfy or exceed federal requirements, reducing duplication for critical, low-impact projects. Reasonable, enforceable deadlines for federal agency decisions will remove much of the unpredictability from the current process. When projects pose minimal environmental impact, an expedited review option should be available. These improvements should clarify compliance expectations without weakening environmental stewardship.

APPA supports four guiding principles for reform: predictability, so utilities know what to expect and when; efficiency, through better agency cooperation and fewer duplicative steps; transparency, by tracking project milestones openly; and meaningful stakeholder input at each stage. Sustained funding for federal agencies is also critical, as under-resourced offices are often a root cause of slow permitting.

Public power utilities have long set standards for reliability, affordability, and innovation. Their ability to build energy infrastructure where and when it is needed is essential for powering schools, hospitals, businesses, and homes nationwide. Smart, infrastructure-neutral reforms grounded in predictability and efficiency will support further investment in safe, reliable, affordable power.

President Biden once promised to lift up American workers by creating good jobs in clean energy. The U.S. committed a lot of money to that. President Trump's distaste for renewables scrambled that plan, but the effort is still alive in Illinois. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports from Chicago.

ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Asante McKinney's first job out of school was as a dental assistant. For a while, she thought, this might be my calling.

ASANTE MCKINNEY: I enjoyed it. Like I always tell people, good health starts at the mouth.

HSU: But in the back of her mind lingered a long-held dream - getting into the skilled trades.

MCKINNEY: You know, they say that's hard labor, but I like to use my hands. I like thinking. I just didn't know how to go about doing it until I found HIRE360.

HSU: HIRE360. That's a nonprofit that recruits people from underserved communities for good-paying jobs in construction. I meet McKinney inside their training center, a converted warehouse. Through a nine-week program, she refreshed her math skills, earned safety certifications and landed a spot as a trainee with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Already, she's on job sites installing high-voltage wiring.

MCKINNEY: I'm very hands-on - more than what I thought I would be allowed to be, which is really good for me.

HSU: Now McKinney is hoping, striving for a career as a union electrician, and she has the state's backing. In 2021, Illinois passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, a landmark bill talked about as a model for the country. It set a goal for Illinois to get to 100% clean energy by 2050 with a workforce that includes those deemed equity-eligible. That includes people like McKinney, who live in communities that have long faced discrimination and heavy pollution. Pat Devaney of the Illinois AFL-CIO took part in negotiations.

PAT DEVANEY: So equity and making sure our workforce was diverse around clean energy was very much a top priority of labor.

HSU: If that sounds familiar, it's because the Biden administration would later advance those same goals. The administration allocated billions of dollars in federal grants and clean energy tax credits to encourage contractors to use union labor and seek a diverse talent pool. The hope was those incentives would create millions of middle-class jobs, but President Trump isn't a fan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a green new scam, greatest scam in history - the greatest in history.

HSU: So now tax credits for wind and solar projects are getting phased out within a few years - far sooner than planned - and the vision for pulling historically disadvantaged workers into clean energy jobs has gotten murky. In a statement to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote, instead of DEI boondoggles that accomplish nothing, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for Americans of all backgrounds to help build our next golden age. Still, in Illinois, Pat Devaney says the work is getting results.

DEVANEY: I don't see Illinois changing course one bit in how we're approaching renewable investments, climate change, and certainly how we approach DEI and promoting diversity in our workforce.

HSU: He says Illinois is still pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of its own into the transition to clean energy. The problem is, contractors were anticipating those generous federal tax credits on top of state investments. Devaney fears the early sunsetting of those tax credits will lead contractors to cancel planned projects, costing Illinois tens of thousands of jobs. What's more, they may not plan new projects.

DEVANEY: I still don't think people can wrap their mind around the massive amounts of investments that they were going to make and the positive impact that was going to have on our country in terms of job creation.

HSU: Now, not everything has come to a screeching halt. In fact, right now there's a rush to get renewable projects going while the tax credits are still available. Asante McKinney is excited about her new career and what it will mean for her family. She and her wife live on the south side of Chicago with their 2-year-old son.

MCKINNEY: You know, he's an amazing kid, but I always ask myself, can I see my son walking to school from over here? No.

HSU: She's already imagining the day when she can buy a house elsewhere.

MCKINNEY: That was a big part of why I wanted to get into the trades - is for better living.

The $1 billion loan to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) will help finance the Crane Clean Energy Center, an 835 MW plant located on the Susquehanna River in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania.

Today’s announcement, funded by the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program created under the Working Families Tax Cut, highlights the Energy Department’s role in advancing President Trump’s Executive Order, Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base(link is external), by supporting the restart of nuclear power plants.

“Thanks to President Trump’s bold leadership and the Working Families Tax Cut, the United States is taking unprecedented steps to lower energy costs and bring about the next American nuclear renaissance,” said Energy Secretary Wright. “Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region. It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

This announcement marks the first project to receive a concurrent conditional commitment and financial close under the Trump Administration. The loan will partially finance the restart of a reactor which ceased operations in 2019 but was never fully decommissioned. Once restarted, pending U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing approvals, the 835 MW reactor will provide reliable and affordable baseload power to the PJM Interconnection region, powering the equivalent of approximately 800,000 homes. The Crane Restart project will help lower electricity costs, strengthen grid reliability, create over 600 American jobs, and advance the Administration’s mission to lead in global AI innovation and restore domestic manufacturing industries.

DOE remains committed to fulfilling this mission to maximize the speed and scale of nuclear capacity in the United States, ensuring the American people’s access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy.

Funded by the Energy Dominance Financing Program, this interest-bearing loan will lower Constellation's cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore reliable nuclear energy to the grid and help America win the AI race.

“DOE’s quick action and leadership is another huge step towards bringing hundreds of megawatts of reliable nuclear power onto the grid at this critical moment,"" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. ""Under the Trump administration, the FERC and DOE have made it possible for us to vastly expedite this restart without compromising quality or safety. It’s a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable. Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the ‘energy’ back into DOE.”

“Pennsylvania is leading America's energy independence and the AI revolution by providing safe, clean, reliable nuclear power,” said Senator Dave McCormick. “Today’s loan by President Trump and the Department of Energy is great news as it helps Constellation advance the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center, while creating 3,400 new jobs and more than 800 megawatts of carbon-free electricity operating 24/7 to meet our increasing energy demands and economic growth across the region. I am thrilled to see Constellation’s continued commitment to the Commonwealth, beyond those investments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit this past July.”

Work to restart the reactor comes at a time of unprecedented electric demand growth from electrification and the new data centers needed to support a growing digital economy and to help America win the AI race. Crane will support grid stability by delivering reliable, around-the-clock electric supply. An economic impact study commissioned by the Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council found that restarting the reactor at Crane will help keep electricity prices in check; add approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs; generate over $16 billion for Pennsylvania’s GDP and deliver more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is currently more than 80% staffed with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians and licensed operator trainees. Inspections of key plant components and regulatory reviews continue on schedule. Constellation has also committed more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations in the region. In 2025 the company has donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Launching the Crane Clean Energy Center is part of a broader multi-billion dollar investment that Constellation is making in America’s largest and growing nuclear fleet to extend the lives of existing nuclear plants and boost their output, helping ensure the fleet’s always-on power continues to meet the needs of America’s families and businesses for decades to come.

In focus

In the first week of Cop30, I spoke with Konrad Beston, a stormwater supervisor in south-western Canada, who is attending the talks for the first time. His field is being reshaped by global warming. “My job involves replacing infrastructure that is undersized and cannot handle the current conditions of climate change,” he told me. “And it involves protecting the wildlife affected by the changes, protecting the salmon – which is something that’s so important to me.”

Heavy rainstorms are becoming more severe and frequent in south-western Canada, he said. Then there are atmospheric river events, or long, narrow bands of vapour that pick up water from the ocean and dump it as rain. “It’s pretty much a river falling from the sky,” said Beston, who is a member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees and works in British Columbia.

All that rain has destroyed infrastructure while increasing runoff, threatening people and nature. Beston’s responsibility is to fix that, but his department is understaffed. “We’re overwhelmed, so we need more workers to come in – and workers need to have a say in how new infrastructure is getting built,” he told me.

Beston made the long journey to Brazil to advocate for workers to have a voice in climate policy. “We need workers to be a part of the plans to fix the infrastructure, to make it stronger,” he said. “We know what we’re dealing with, and without our expertise mistakes get made.”

He is backing a proposal that would make worker input a reality in UN talks. Known as the Belém Action Mechanism, or Bam, it’s the top demand by civil society groups at this year’s talks. The plan is focused on a “just transition” towards a green, resilient economy that does not leave workers or communities behind.

The just transition has been discussed in UN climate talks before and is mentioned in the preamble to the 2015 Paris agreement. But Bam proponents say countries don’t have to track or measure effects of such policies on workers or share best practices on how to protect them. Their new proposal would require countries to accelerate, coordinate and support a true global just transition.

Last week, the proposal saw a major advance when the G77 plus China – countries that together represent 80% of the world’s population – issued a call for a just transition mechanism to be created. “It was a major moment, a huge breakthrough,” Teresa Anderson, an ActionAid spokesperson, told me at Cop.

Putting meat on the bones of just transition-focused pledges could help build support for climate action, advocates say. “There’s a lot of focus on job creation, but not on the quality of those jobs, and that’s a key problem,” said Giulia Laganà, director of the International Trade Union Commission’s just transition and climate department. Workers won’t want new green jobs if they are less stable, worse paid, or offer subpar benefits to ones from the incumbent economy, she explained in Belém.

“That’s the reason why a greenlash is happening across a lot of the world,” she said. “There’s been talk at climate summits, but it isn’t happening on the ground. That’s leaving workers disillusioned, and that is something that is monetized and exploited by certain political actors to backtrack on climate commitments.”

Support for a just transition is in alignment with ancient principles, said Beston, who is Métis, one of Canada’s three legally recognised Indigenous peoples. “One thing I hold close to my heart is the seven generations teaching,” he said, referring to the belief that those making decisions today should consider their impact on the next seven generations of communities.

Many advocates for more green jobs around the world echo this notion, with Anderson noting the problems with short-term thinking, saying: “There’s an idea that considerations for workers and communities are a ‘nice to have’ thing in climate action, but that short-sightedness doesn’t get us anywhere.

“The transition needs to include those considerations to be effective.”

Red and Blue States: Complementary Risk Ecosystems Red and blue states play different but complementary roles: Red states provide industrial infrastructure, labor, and permitting conditions favorable to large-scale deployment.","When Federal Catalysts Stall

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) represent the most significant public investment in U.S. clean energy history. Thousands of projects, spanning carbon capture, hydrogen hubs, and advanced manufacturing, are now underway across federal agencies.

Within this landscape, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded more than 500 projects that aim to commercialize first-of-a-kind (FOAK) technologies, demonstrating deep industrial decarbonization. But as political uncertainty grows and some projects face delays or cancellations, one question looms: who buys down the risk when federal funding recedes?

Our De-Risking Rubric offers a structured way to assess where risk resides—technical, financial, and social—and how the private sector can share responsibility for sustaining progress.

Geography of Risk

Public investment is reshaping the industrial map in surprising ways. Roughly 85 percent of IRA-related clean-tech dollars—and 60 percent of DOE demonstration projects—are located in states that voted Republican in the last presidential election.

These include Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama—regions historically tied to fossil energy but rich in infrastructure, workforce, and land for large-scale deployment. Meanwhile, blue states such as California, New York, and Massachusetts continue to lead in research, procurement standards, and market-shaping policies like Buy Clean.

Together, red and blue states are creating a geographically diverse ecosystem of risk reduction and opportunity.

The De-Risking Rubric: Technical, Financial, and Social Dimensions

The De-Risking Rubric evaluates projects along three interlocking axes:

Technical risk declines when projects collect and share real-world performance data—cost, uptime, and energy use—creating a factual base for replication.

Financial risk falls when projects meet schedules and budgets, giving lenders and off-takers confidence to finance “next-of-a-kind” deployments.

Social risk diminishes when communities and workers are engaged early, permitting is predictable, and benefits are transparent and measurable.

Across all dimensions, the goal is the same: build the evidence needed to reduce uncertainty and lower the cost of capital. Shared data transforms isolated demonstrations into an investable market class, accelerating replication and attracting private investment.

Public to Private Data Bridge

As IRA and BIL funds flow, the next challenge is ensuring projects remain financeable and insurable after federal dollars expire. Investors now prize one thing above all: transparency. They need consistent, verified data comparing projected and actual costs, schedules, and operations. Put simply, the FOAK gap is a data gap. Even projects that lose federal support can still de-risk their sector by disclosing performance metrics that refine investor and insurer models.

Red and Blue States: Complementary Risk Ecosystems

Red and blue states play different but complementary roles:

Red states provide industrial infrastructure, labor, and permitting conditions favorable to large-scale deployment.

Blue states generate early markets, innovation ecosystems, and policy frameworks that sustain demand for low-carbon products.

Federal dollars catalyze innovation, but state and local governance anchor deployment—each reducing risk in complementary ways.

Toward Durable, Insurable Markets

The energy transition ultimately depends on projects that can stand on their own—technically, socially, and financially. Programs that generate verifiable, high-quality data will continue to attract insurers and financiers as public funds wane.

De-risking, in this sense, is the bridge from federally backed pilots to market-driven deployment. When projects demonstrate not only innovation but reliability, they earn capital-market confidence—and that confidence sustains long-term decarbonization.

Conclusion

America’s energy transition is not a story of partisanship but of risk management. Federal investments have catalyzed thousands of projects, but the lasting challenge is building systems that endure beyond political cycles.

Understanding and mitigating technical, financial, and social risk is essential to a durable energy economy. Mastering that de-risking bridge will determine whether the United States leads the next industrial revolution or watches it happen elsewhere.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2212401536-aspect-ratio-1280-225-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:00:36.786197

The report, prepared by the Colorado Energy Office with support from the Colorado Department of Transportation and in coordination with the Colorado Workforce Development Council, identifies the careers most essential to the state’s clean energy transition. Funded by a federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grant and state dollars, the analysis evaluates workforce gaps, training pathways, and strategies to build an equitable climate workforce.

Governor Jared Polis said clean energy continues to drive economic growth and job creation in Colorado. “These innovative technologies are protecting air quality and the environment while creating new opportunities for our state’s workforce,” he said. “We are proud to support the strong workforce needed to drive innovation and achieve our climate goals.”

The report highlights the need for skilled workers, including electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, construction laborers and technicians who service renewable energy and electric vehicle systems. Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor said the state’s clean energy transition depends on workers who build efficient homes, install solar and geothermal systems and maintain zero-emission vehicles and charging stations.

The analysis identifies 20 “climate critical occupations” with the largest gaps between projected job growth and workforce demand. Occupations facing the most significant shortages include electricians, construction laborers and managers, wind turbine service technicians, solar installers, power-line workers, electric vehicle technicians and HVAC technicians trained in heat pump technology.

Training challenges vary across occupations and include limited opportunities in rural areas, shortages of qualified instructors, and gaps in specific technical skills. Barriers for new workers include financial constraints, lack of transportation or childcare and limited access to training in their preferred language.

To address these issues, the report recommends expanding early exposure to climate careers in K-12 schools, increasing training options across the state, strengthening Registered Apprenticeship programs, improving coordination among state agencies and training organizations and prioritizing access for rural and resort communities.

“Achieving Colorado’s ambitious climate goals depends on our ability to rapidly train a skilled and diverse pipeline of talent across the state,” said CWDC Managing Director Lee Wheeler-Berliner. “We must move to action collaboratively.”

The report aligns with broader state efforts to build a climate-ready workforce, including a Registered Apprenticeship through the Weatherization Assistance Program, new training dollars through the Training for Residential Energy Contractors grant, and a Zero Emissions Vehicle Workforce Development group.",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133241.png,N,,2025-11-18 17:03:07.973727

According to the VF Corp.-owned brand, the store’s footwear assortment will focus on signature silhouettes such as the 6-Inch Premium Waterproof Boots, Field Boots, Euro Hikers, and 3-Eye Handsewn Boat Shoes for men; and 6-Inch Premium Waterproof Boots, Noreen Boat Shoes, and the new Stone Street collection for women. Apparel will focus primarily on outerwear, the company noted.

Gautham Rao, vice president and general manager of Americas, told FN in an interview that the brand’s newest store was “designed to reflect Timberland’s 50+ year heritage of crafted, weather-ready style, in an open floorplan that invites exploration.”

The executive noted that design details throughout the space include oak wood, brushed steel fixtures, textured concrete walls and leather accents.

As for why Timberland chose to open its own brick-and-mortar location in Detroit, Rao attributes the city’s “resilience and creativity” as some of the reasons.

“[Detroit] is a place that has reinvented itself time and again, and that spirit really resonates with Timberland,” Rao maintained. “Our brand is rooted in hard work, community, and self-expression – values that Detroit embodies. Opening our first freestanding store on Woodward Avenue is about honoring that connection and being part of the city’s ongoing story.”

The executive also noted that the city has an “amazing duality” of both grit and style. “It’s a city built on industry, but it’s also a hub for music, art, and fashion,” Rao said. “While Timberland has grown to become a global streetwear icon, we’ve never forgotten that we started on job sites. That blend of culture and utility is exactly what Detroit represents. People here know how to work hard and look good doing it, and that’s the essence of Timberland.”

As for how the local community is responding to the new store so far, Rao said the company is already “seeing great energy” from the public. He added that Timberland hosted a pop-up activation at Riverfront Fall Fest last month that was well received

“There seems to be genuine excitement around Timberland coming to Detroit – not only for the core Timberland brand, but also for our Timberland Pro line for skilled trade workers,” Rao added. “We can’t wait to open and have the chance to engage with the good people of Detroit every day!”

This news comes after VF Corporation president and chief executive officer Bracken Darrell told analysts in October that Timberland, along with The North Face, “delivered broad-based growth” in the second quarter.

In Q2, Timberland saw sales increase 7 percent to $506.4 million. VF noted that Timberland saw strong demand in the Americas driven by a strong back-to-school season. The shoe brand also saw strong demand for the 6-Inch Premium boot, led by the Americans and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), as the boat shoe also grew in all regions.

“The opportunity in Timberland is really significant because we can continue to grow the boot, we can grow in other footwear franchises and we can unlock apparel around the world, all at the same time,” Darrell told analysts last month. “And in the U.S., especially, this will be supported by expanded and enhanced distribution. We have the game plan to do that now.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04709.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-11-18 17:01:57.902133

This petition parallels a lawsuit also initiated today by the Sierra Club and clean energy trade organizations, which challenges a similar fast track in MISO’s neighboring grid operator, Southwest Power Pool.
It lacks meaningful guardrails that ensure new energy projects come online on a timeframe that keeps up with MISO’s claimed needs,” said Caroline Reiser, Senior Attorney for Climate & Energy at NRDC.

This is just another example of the unfair advantage given to polluting, last-century technology,” said Katie Nekola, General Counsel for Clean Wisconsin.","—

Earthjustice filed the lawsuit today on behalf of environmental groups Clean Wisconsin and Natural Resources Defense Council, and together with Sierra Club, challenged FERC’s approval to fast-track the interconnection of mostly fossil-fueled generation in states where Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) operates.

The lawsuit challenges FERC’s approval of the Expedited Resource Addition Study (ERAS) process, which allows the fast-tracked projects to pass on significant upgrade costs to residential customers and to skip over clean energy projects that have been waiting for years to connect to the grid. MISO, which submitted the proposal to FERC, claims that the fast track is necessary to meet increased demand from data centers powering artificial intelligence.

So far, requests for the FERC-approved fast track are three-quarters gas capacity. That would add at least 18 gigawatts of gas-burning generation in MISO’s footprint, which stretches from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan south to Louisiana and Mississippi. Some of the largest projects include a 1.2 gigawatt gas plant in Paris, Wisconsin—where Clean Wisconsin has already challenged another new gas plant—and three new 1.5 gigawatt gas units to serve Meta data centers in Louisiana, where the state Public Service Commission ignored Earthjustice’s partners’ concerns in fast-tracking state processes as well. Gas-fired generation is more expensive for consumers than the affordable clean energy that dominates MISO’s normal interconnection queue. This year, solar had the lowest levelized cost of energy value at $38-79 per megawatt hour.

Clean Wisconsin, NRDC, and Sierra Club challenge FERC’s decision granting MISO approval to shift the costs of fast-tracked projects to residential customers, and the undue advantages the fast-tracked process will grant to mostly gas-burning power plants over thousands of megawatts of clean energy that could also serve to meet needs. As petitioners raised in the FERC proceeding, the agency improperly dismissed the potential for the fast track to exacerbate challenges in processing and connecting the rest of the queued resources in MISO.

This petition parallels a lawsuit also initiated today by the Sierra Club and clean energy trade organizations, which challenges a similar fast track in MISO’s neighboring grid operator, Southwest Power Pool.

“FERC is letting grid operators like MISO rewrite the rule book to the benefit of fossil fuel and data center companies, and at the expense of everyone else,” said Ada Statler, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice. “FERC is sidelining cheaper clean energy projects, and allowing utilities to pass on the higher costs of methane gas to other customers, despite its legal mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates.”

“ERAS creates a system where a handful of projects, primarily gas plants, get to shortcut the line and receive major financial advantages. It lacks meaningful guardrails that ensure new energy projects come online on a timeframe that keeps up with MISO’s claimed needs,” said Caroline Reiser, Senior Attorney for Climate & Energy at NRDC. “We need an interconnection process that is fair, transparent, and focused on getting the most reliable and affordable resources on the grid quickly. ERAS does the opposite.”

Developing a Policy Roadmap for the Southeast Battery Industry Over the past year, C2ES has hosted four roundtables related to the battery and critical material industry across the Southeast.","Georgia occupies a crucial position in the Southeast battery supply chain. As the region’s leader in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing investment, the state is a key market for batteries produced locally. Since 2018, Georgia has announced over $27.3 billion in investments to manufacture electric mobility products, including Kia’s West Point manufacturing facility, Hyundai’s Bryan County Metaplant, and Rivian’s upcoming Atlanta East Coast headquarters and Social Circle, GA manufacturing facility. This rapid growth in manufacturing has attracted suppliers to the state and sent a clear demand signal for the region that the industry is here.

Georgia’s success in attracting EV companies to build large scale final assembly plants is creating opportunity for other states in the region to benefit from the development of an end-to-end battery supply chain. States across the region are leaning into their individual strengths to take advantage of new opportunities afforded from different parts of the value chain, including mineral sourcing, mid-stream manufacturing, and battery recycling. This growth across Georgia and the broader region’s economy is fundamental to supporting the long-term success of the robust EV ecosystem in the state. Each state in the region has a role to play in establishing a cluster of new technology development and industry growth and stands to gain significant job creation and economic benefits.

Convening Industry Stakeholders to Support Regional Development

On November 5, C2ES cohosted a roundtable with the Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute to highlight the current industry landscape in Georgia and explore actions to secure the domestic battery and critical materials supply chain in the region. The event brought together over 45 stakeholders from the Georgia and across the Southeast to discuss supportive strategies and next steps for an industry at an inflection point in its development.

Several key themes emerged throughout the event:

Workforce development is a linchpin for the long-term growth potential of the industry.

There was broad agreement that Georgia must build on its existing workforce development programs to broaden access to training for emerging sectors. The battery industry provides new career pathways in advanced manufacturing and innovation in a sector that may be unfamiliar to jobseekers. Participants suggested that the industry should engage with technical colleges to identify more direct opportunities to support training, and the need for educational campaigns to increase young students’ awareness of opportunities in the battery sector.

Commercialization pathways must be clearer for the new technological innovations emerging from Southeast research institutions.

Currently, gaps exist in the translation of new technologies from concepts developed in a lab to real-world companies with commercial offerings. This is due in part to a lack of early-stage investors for the battery industry in the Southeast. Further challenges exist in the funding landscape for nascent companies, who are challenged to secure capital to prove the scalability of their technologies. Roundtable participants called for more integrated partnerships between industry and research institutions, and more education of investors on the Southeast battery landscape to facilitate the commercialization of newly developed technologies.

New battery and material manufacturing facilities in the Southeast need near-term policy support to be more competitive on global price today.

To develop an American battery industry that is competitive in the long term with other global producers, Southeast states must invest today in building out an industrial base for battery material manufacturing. This includes near-term policy support and industry actions to enable producers to compete on price in the global market currently dominated by mature actors that benefit from low input costs and economies of scale. Participants identified several ways to lower costs for manufacturers, including providing access to low-cost renewable energy, offering preferential funding terms for new manufacturing lines, and supporting increased high-volume scale automated manufacturing processes.

Developing a Policy Roadmap for the Southeast Battery Industry

Over the past year, C2ES has hosted four roundtables related to the battery and critical material industry across the Southeast. Throughout the series, participants collaboratively developed a set of near-term, actionable recommendations to drive the industry forward. This includes conversations hosted in the following states, each of which includes takeaways and recommendations from the conversation:

Knoxville, Tennessee

Tuscaloosa, Alabama

Charlotte, North Carolina

In the coming days, C2ES will compile and publish the takeaways from the roundtable Atlanta, Georgia. Next year, participants from each event and other stakeholders will reconvene for a regional summit to turn ideas into action and build a path forward for a secure, resilient Southeast U.S. battery materials supply chain.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iStock-1383415209.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:00:42.044040

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which passed in July, cut several tax credits aimed at encouraging long-term investment in energy efficiency and clean energy.
These tax credits were implemented as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and were originally set to be phased out in 2032.
On Dec. 31, the full 30% credit offered through the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit expires, leaving only the 6% base credit through 2028, before it is phased out entirely.
“It’ll be easy to maintain, and it’ll be cheaper to run, but if you can’t afford it, the tax credits aren’t (going to be) there that helps some of our clients afford it.","Since President Donald Trump took office again in January, costs for imported steel, lumber and more have fluctuated wildly as tariffs have been implemented, raised or reduced over the past year.

This uncertainty has made project planning more challenging for professionals in architecture and construction.

Construction cost estimation is a “losing battle” these days, Rachel Smith-Streck, director of strategy and partner at TAP Architecture in Oklahoma City said.

“Just in general, tariffs are affecting everything, so you can’t pinpoint your target,” Smith-Streck said. “Usually, we can do some cost estimation, but now it’s a losing battle. What we think the numbers are going to be when we get to working with the construction team, who has a real job to do, (the cost) is over here,” she said, gesturing up, “and we thought it was right here,” gesturing down.

The impending expiration or reduction of several commercial and residential tax credits for HVAC and renewable energy sources at the end of the year are also raising final construction costs, Smith-Streck said.

These tax credits were implemented as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and were originally set to be phased out in 2032.

On Dec. 31, the full 30% credit offered through the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit expires, leaving only the 6% base credit through 2028, before it is phased out entirely. The ITC applies to the cost of commercial installations of qualifying energy systems, including solar, storage, geothermal, fuel cells and wind.

“I know the expiration is coming up, and that’s going to be a challenge, mainly because (geothermal) is something we always push if our client can do it,” Smith-Streck said. “If you can afford that upfront cost, it’s way better, but obviously, now that you don’t have those credits either, that’s going to be a challenge.”

Smith-Streck said TAP Architecture is working with Mid-America Christian University on a project now, and they’re considering a geothermal energy system.

“When we’re thinking about their project, if they can buy that in the beginning of a new build, it’s going to save them money in the long run, because they’re going to keep that building forever,” Smith-Streck said. “It’ll be easy to maintain, and it’ll be cheaper to run, but if you can’t afford it, the tax credits aren’t (going to be) there that helps some of our clients afford it.

The company wants to add 30 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of additional LNG capacity to the previously approved 28 mtpa. Plaquemines is already the second-largest LNG facility in the U.S. and last month was responsible for 22% of total exports from the country, according to data from financial firm LSEG.

“Our decision to significantly increase the project’s permitted capacity reflects the strong market demand we continue to see and this expansion will play a vital role in meeting that demand,” Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said in a statement.

The proposed expansion would allow the company to produce over 100 million mtpa of the liquid fuel and challenge QatarEnergy and Cheniere as the world’s top exporter of LNG.

A mere startup three years ago, Venture Global quickly became the second-largest U.S. LNG exporter with a business model that lets it export cargoes while construction and commissioning phases are still underway.

The strategy has allowed the company to profit from higher spot market prices before it begins supplying longer-term customers, but the practice has also resulted in arbitration cases and lawsuits from customers that include several of the world’s largest energy companies.

The Plaquemines expansion will be built incrementally in three phases and consist of 32 modular liquefaction trains, the company said.

Venture Global has also filed an application with the U.S. Department of Energy for the export authorizations associated with the additional planned capacity, the company said.

Campbell Plant.","WEST OLIVE, Mich. — A coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., could finish its long-awaited sunsetting following the expiration of an emergency order by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) at 12:00 a.m. Wednesday.

Consumers Energy's J.H. Campbell Plant was slated to close its doors for good in May, but on the eve of its retirement, the DOE declared an emergency and ordered the plant to remain open temporarily. That order was set to expire in August, but the DOE handed down a second order to keep the plant open through Nov. 19 at 12:00 a.m.

In an Oct. 30 Consumers Energy quarterly earnings call, the utility company said keeping the plant open cost the company about $80 million between May 23 and Sept. 30, which equates to about $610,000 per day.

The utility company said it was passing the cost on to customers of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), an electrical grid operator that provides service to 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. The cost will be spread across utility companies in the MISO grid, which include about 45 million people in the United States and Canada.

The DOE said its emergency declaration was ""due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electricity, and other causes"" in the Midwest region of the country.

The DOE laid out four justifications of its emergency declarations in the order, saying first that the initial emergency declaration was in response to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment in May.

“[D]emand forecasts and resource data indicate that MISO is at elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand or low resource output,” the DOE order cited from the reliability assessment.

The DOE also points to multiple electrical generation facilities in Michigan having retired in recent years, claiming that about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity have been lost since 2020. The DOE warns of further loss of electrical generation on the MISO grid if the J.H. Campbell Plant retired on schedule, despite Consumers Energy acquiring a natural gas plant in Covert, Michigan.

Finally, the DOE said that the MISO's Planning Resource Auction Results for the 2025-2026 Planning Year noted that for parts of the grid, including Michigan, “new capacity additions were insufficient to offset the negative impacts of decreased accreditation, suspensions/retirements and external resources.”

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the initial order in May a ""fabricated energy emergency"" and filed suit, claiming the postponement of the closure was arbitrary and illegal. She later also filed suit against the second order, but neither of the lawsuits resulted in an injunction against the DOE's order.

In 2019, contaminated water was found in drinking water near the J.H. Campbell Plant, the Sierra Club announced. The results found elevated levels of arsenic, lead and radium in homes that draw their water from private wells.

In August of this year, locals and leaders, headed by the Michigan League of Conservation Voters and the state chapter of the Sierra Club, gathered nearby to say it's time to let the plant go.

The first power-generating unit of the J.H. Campbell Plant was commissioned in 1962, with two more units being commissioned in 1967 and 1980.

As alleged in a complaint filed with the proposed consent decree, Hanover Foods failed to comply with a state-issued National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to operate its wastewater treatment facility in Hanover. NDPES permits are required if wastewater is being discharged into a water of the United States.

At this facility, Hanover Foods industrially processes foods, including beans and vegetables, for canning and fresh packing. Hanover Foods treats industrial waste associated with these operations before discharging wastewater into Oil Creek, which eventually flows into the Susquehanna River and then the Chesapeake Bay. Since 2016, Hanover Foods violated its NPDES permit on more than 600 occasions by exceeding its permit limits for pollutants including suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, and phosphorus. In addition, environmental inspections identified numerous alleged violations of operations and maintenance requirements at Hanover Foods’ facility.

Under the terms of the proposed consent decree, Hanover will install new equipment and take other measures to prevent violations of its permit limits for certain nutrients and for temperature.

The intent was to significantly lower the imputed fuel efficiency for electric vehicles when manufacturers used them to comply with fuel economy standards. But auto manufacturers pushed back hard on the proposed revised PEF, arguing in comments to the proposed rule that the transition to a new PEF was too abrupt. Instead, they argued that the fuel content factor be continued or phased out more slowly.

DOE responded to the auto industry concerns about an abrupt shift in the PEF by issuing a final rule that phased out the fuel content factor over three years rather than eliminating it immediately. In other words, DOE listened to the auto industry’s concerns and responded to them by making the PEF somewhat less strong in its first three years.

The Eighth Circuit threw out the new PEF on the grounds that the statutory language directing DOE to establish a PEF doesn’t authorize a fuel content factor. The language is very broad and included as a factor “the need of the United States to conserve all forms of energy and the relative scarcity and value to the United States of all fuel used to generate electricity.” DOE argued in the Iowa case that the language gave the agency ample room to transition the PEF’s stringency by phasing out the fuel content factor rather than eliminating it immediately.

Relying on both Loper Bright v Raimondo and the major questions doctrine, the Eighth Circuit rejected DOE’s argument. It gave no deference to the agency’s application of the governing statute to a very complicated set of facts and said that the statute could not be used to promote electric vehicles without express Congressional delegation under the major questions doctrine.

Now that the new PEF has been thrown out, under the court’s ruling the old PEF goes back into effect for compliance with the CAFE standards. The entire question of CAFE compliance is up in the air right now: Congress has zeroed out penalties for failure to comply; NHTSA is also claiming that the Biden standards are illegal and that the agency will “exercise its enforcement authority regarding all existing CAFE and medium- and heavy-duty standards in accordance with the interpretation set forth in this rulemaking.” But if auto companies do attempt to comply, the court has directed that the old 2000 PEF should be used. Of course the old PEF favors electric vehicles much more heavily than the Biden PEF and uses a fuel economy factor indefinitely rather than phasing it out. So the result of the court’s decision is to exacerbate the problem it claims the new Biden PEF created: EVs will be weighted more heavily than they should, allowing automakers to use fewer of them for compliance purposes and allowing internal combustion engine vehicles to be less fuel efficient.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/republican-climate-deniers1.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:00:45.646992

""In the current federal environment, having more flexible and local funding streams is more important than ever,"" said Grace Rogers, Manager for Climate Resilient Coasts and Watersheds at EDF.
This report shows local governments can support residents with the costs of relocating by using familiar tools in new ways or deploying new tools to fund buyouts.
Since 1993, FEMA has provided more than $6.8 billion to support more than 45,000 buyouts, with most funds distributed after federal disaster declarations.
New Jersey’s Blue Acres program focuses on voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties.","CHICAGO (Nov. 18, 2025) – As costs for damages from climate-fueled disasters continue to mount, a new report from NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) and EDF (Environmental Defense Fund) shows how states and local governments can pay for voluntary home buyouts and relocation assistance without relying so heavily on federal grants.

“Buyouts are an increasingly important way to help people relocate to safer locations,” said Rob Moore, a director within NRDC’s Climate Adaptation Division. “They not only allow high-risk property owners to move somewhere safer, but the newly acquired properties can become part of the community’s longer-term climate resilience plans.”

The current administration has canceled billions of dollars in previously approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resilience grants and halted or scaled back key mitigation programs, leaving communities with more risk and fewer federal options. This report, Funding and Financing Voluntary Buyouts and Relocation: Going Beyond Federal Grants, lays out six specific ways states or localities could step up as the federal government steps out.

""In the current federal environment, having more flexible and local funding streams is more important than ever,"" said Grace Rogers, Manager for Climate Resilient Coasts and Watersheds at EDF. ""Proactively funding and financing buyouts, rather than waiting to act until disaster recovery funds are made available, enables state and local governments to be more responsive to communities' adaptation needs.""

Climate change is causing people to rethink where they live, but most do not have the resources to relocate without some level of assistance. Voluntary home buyouts are an essential part of helping people find their way to a safer location. This report shows local governments can support residents with the costs of relocating by using familiar tools in new ways or deploying new tools to fund buyouts.

The report highlights six funding and financing mechanisms that states and local governments can use to supplement, or in some cases replace, federal grants:

● Municipal bonds: Serving as a funding source for buyout programs by providing upfront capital to purchase disaster-prone properties and reduce long-term disaster risk.

● Locally assessed fees and taxes: Leveraging stormwater fees, special district fees, real estate transfer taxes, or targeted sales taxes to support ongoing buyout programs and match federal grants when available.

● Parametric insurance and catastrophe bonds: Securing fast, flexible payouts after a disaster through parametric insurance or catastrophe bonds.

● Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund (STRLF): Capitalizing state-specific low-interest revolving loan funds that support flood mitigation and resilience projects.

● Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF): Typically administered by state environmental agencies, this could be a source of financing for post-buyout land restoration.

● Leveraging insurance claims: Using payouts from flood insurance or homeowners’ policies to offset acquisition costs and stretch limited public dollars further.

Those buyouts have helped remove thousands of repeatedly flooded homes, but the process is often so long and complex that many homeowners drop out or sell to the next unsuspecting buyer just to avoid the next disaster. Nationwide, previous NRDC research found that the average buyout project funded by FEMA has taken more than five years to complete, from the time a flood occurs until the project’s closing documents are filed.

“Federal cuts in disaster and climate-adaptation funding are creating a significant gap for communities nationwide,” said Kristin Marcell, Climigration Network Director. “State and local partners are asking for actionable, sustainable ways to fund voluntary home buyouts that help residents in dangerous situations move to safer, affordable homes. This report lays out practical alternatives and lessons from communities that can be applied and shared nationally.”

Most voluntary buyouts have been funded by FEMA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and other federal programs. Since 1993, FEMA has provided more than $6.8 billion to support more than 45,000 buyouts, with most funds distributed after federal disaster declarations.

The report highlights places where local governments have taken the initiative to finance buyout programs like in North Carolina, where the Charlotte–Mecklenburg Stormwater Services (CMSWS) agency used stormwater fees to conduct buyouts using funding from a stormwater fee and acquired nearly 500 properties. New Jersey’s Blue Acres program focuses on voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties. Since inception, the program has purchased approximately 1,200 properties (about 700 after Superstorm Sandy in 2012) and plans to acquire hundreds more using a mix of bonds, state appropriations, and federal funding. While the New York Office of Resilient Homes and Communities is administering the $250 million in bond funds to purchase flood prone properties from willing sellers, demolish and remove the structures, and facilitate the restoration and stewardship of these properties.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The CEOs of the Detroit Three automakers and a senior executive have been invited to appear at a Jan. 14 Senate hearing on the impact of auto regulations and vehicle prices, Reuters has learned.

CEO Mary Barra, CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting U.S. fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

The Trump administration has taken aim at vehicle environmental rules on a number of fronts. In June, Trump signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California’s landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last week the administration will soon propose rolling back NHTSA fuel economy rules from the 2022 through 2031 model years.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPELAH13T_L.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 17:02:03.108911

“Clean water is vital to community health and a fundamental right of every Pennsylvanian,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “These projects are examples of good stewardship and best practices to create healthier streams and wetlands, reduce flood risk, and improve fish and wildlife habitat.”

The Section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Grant program, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and selected for by DEP, supports projects that carry out best management practices (BMPs) specified in Watershed Implementation Plans (WIP) for 44 watersheds around the state, with special consideration for projects in Pennsylvania’s share of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The program also supports development of new WIPs for additional impaired watersheds.

Nonpoint source pollution is water pollution that doesn’t come from a single specific discharge point, such as a pipe from a factory, but rather from diffuse sources, such as stormwater runoff, mine drainage, and farm fields. Around 53% of the water-quality-impaired watersheds in Pennsylvania are affected by nonpoint source pollution. Section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Grants focus on reducing:

Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment pollution from agricultural activities, urban stormwater runoff, and streambank and shoreline erosion; and

Iron, aluminum, and acidity pollution associated with energy resource extraction and acid mine drainage (AMD).

Projects in the following counties received Section 319 Grant awards:

Berks County

Berks County Conservation District received $317,872 for the Upper Little Swatara Creek WIP Implementation project to do streambank restoration on Crosskill Creek and install agricultural BMPs on an unnamed tributary to Little Swatara Creek with Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). The Berks County Conservation District will implement a multi-year water quality monitoring program to determine and evaluate WIP progress. The estimated load reductions are 2,215 lbs./yr. of nitrogen, 5,901 lbs./yr. of phosphorus and 223 tons/yr. of sediment.

Columbia County

Columbia County Conservation District received $148,726 for the Catawissa WIP Revision project to update the Catawissa Creek WIP originally completed in 2007. The WIP revision will include both Columbia and Schuylkill counties and provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on water quality data, land use, remediation priorities, land reclamation efforts, pollutant load reductions, and construction of AMD treatment facilities.

Dauphin County

Tri-County Conewago Creek Association received $899,721 for the 2025 Conewago Creek Restoration Projects implement two priority stream restoration projects in the Conewago Creek watershed: 1st Unnamed Tributary North and Brills Run. The project will fund other stream restoration and agricultural BMPs in the watershed as willing landowners are identified through the Conewago Creek Initiative, a partnership of watershed stakeholders. The estimated pollutant load reductions are 3,853 lbs./yr. of nitrogen, 801 lbs./yr. of phosphorus, and 371 tons/yr. of sediment.

Indiana County

Indiana County Conservation District received $254,758 for the South Branch of Plum Creek WIP Revision project to revise the 2008 South Branch Plum Creek WIP by assessing water quality impairments. The assessment will guide the efforts to restore the watershed by locating the sources and causes of impairments and identifying and prioritizing BMP projects.

Lancaster County

The U.S., which backed the pledge two years ago, has renounced the idea of moving away from fossil fuels following last year’s election of President Donald Trump.
Other fossil-fuel-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, have attempted to frame the 2023 promise as something that falls short of a wholesale pivot away from consuming fossil fuels.
Even so, the U.N. said, concerted action to rein in heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels and preserve and plant forests would help limit that overshoot.
Yet those same nations agreed two years ago to embark on a transition from fossil fuels, she said.","Even so, “this is a coalition of Global North and Global South … saying with one voice that this is an issue that cannot be ignored,” U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said at a press conference.

The effort seeks to put teeth in a bold but nonbinding pledge from the 2023 climate summit in Dubai in which nearly 200 nations agreed to begin “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” While it is unclear what specific language, shape or form such a template could take, the nations backing the roadmap said it would offer more tangible metrics and guideposts for realizing the goal in hopes of limiting the dangerous rise in global temperatures.

Reaching a final deal at the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, will be challenging. And it would be even more daunting to get the world’s biggest energy-producing countries and their mix of state-run and multinational fossil fuel companies to follow suit.

For one thing, production of oil and gas has only increased since 2023, and fossil fuel use has remained stubborn amid growing energy needs in the developed and developing worlds. The U.S., which backed the pledge two years ago, has renounced the idea of moving away from fossil fuels following last year’s election of President Donald Trump.

Other fossil-fuel-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, have attempted to frame the 2023 promise as something that falls short of a wholesale pivot away from consuming fossil fuels.

In addition, the United Nations process requires unanimity, so any one country could derail the newest proposal.

“I think it’s a little bit premature to have a roadmap when we haven’t had a discussion on what a roadmap would constitute,” Adnan Amin, the CEO of the United Arab Emirates-led Dubai summit, told POLITICO on Tuesday. “If this is going to be yet another kind of directive coming out of the process without resources attached to it, that’s going to be very difficult to agree to at this meeting.”

Global temperatures have also continued rising, hitting 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming since the preindustrial era. The 2015 Paris Agreement had set an ambitious target of limiting warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius to limit catastrophic damage, but the U.N. predicted this year that temperatures will eclipse that line.

Even so, the U.N. said, concerted action to rein in heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels and preserve and plant forests would help limit that overshoot.

The countries supporting a roadmap away from fossil fuels said those realities demand urgency and more specificity from nations that, to date, have offered 10-year climate strategies that fall far short of the 1.5-degree goal.

“I don’t want the COP to be a failure. We want this COP to succeed and we will continue pushing for this in some form,” Kenyan climate envoy Ali Mohamed told reporters. “I’m sure there is general understanding that it is important that the decision in Dubai is taken forward.”

The coalition backing the roadmap united governments that have often been crosswise with each other on several issues at these annual talks, chiefly over who shares the burden for quickly ditching fossil fuels and how to pay for shifting to cleaner energy sources.

Poorer countries such as Sierra Leone, which still have tremendous needs to improve their access to energy, joined the call because they already spend far too much of their slim budgets adapting to the effects of a hotter planet that impose costs on their citizens, said Jiwoh Abdulai, the nation’s environment minister.

“We still need to grow our economies to lift our people out of extreme poverty. But we are coming to the table. We want to be part of the solution,” he said. “Climate action and economic growth are not mutually exclusive.”

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva “opened the door” when he called for such a roadmap earlier this month, said Vanuatu climate envoy Ralph Regenvanu. He called Lula’s announcement a “half” surprise given that Brazil, whose Congress is controlled by an opposing coalition, has backed more oil and gas exploration.

“His country is a big fossil fuel producer,” Regenvanu said in an interview. “It’s a personal thing for him. I don’t think it necessarily reflects Brazil, but it’s so great he said it because it gives us this opportunity.”

While some fossil-fuel-producing countries may present challenges in cementing a deal, U.K. climate envoy Rachel Kyte told reporters that has always been true. Yet those same nations agreed two years ago to embark on a transition from fossil fuels, she said.

The roadmap serves to mark progress and hold nations accountable to that goal, Kyte said.

“If you make this just about one side or the other, it doesn’t work politically, but it also doesn’t work in the real world,” she said. “At the moment, there’s more people that want to move through a road map process than there are not.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb1%2Fcb%2F63db4bfc49c6ae688e1fae18c781%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2246580833,N,,2025-11-18 17:01:39.332682

Regulators in both states granted required water quality permits on Nov. 7 for the 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement project, despite growing opposition from environmentalists and previous permit denials in 2019 and 2020 over concerns the project would violate water quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as a coalition of New Jersey-based environmental groups, filed separate petitions in federal appeals court seeking review.
“New Jersey’s approval completely disregards its prior, sound decision to reject this pipeline over threats to the state’s water quality.
“New Jersey’s decision to approve NESE after repeatedly rejecting the same project is indefensible,” Miller said in a statement.","Environmentalists have asked a federal judge to review a key approval New Jersey regulators granted earlier this month that will allow an energy developer to proceed with a controversial $1 billion underwater natural gas pipeline project between New Jersey and New York.

Regulators in both states granted required water quality permits on Nov. 7 for the 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement project, despite growing opposition from environmentalists and previous permit denials in 2019 and 2020 over concerns the project would violate water quality standards.

On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as a coalition of New Jersey-based environmental groups, filed separate petitions in federal appeals court seeking review.

New Jersey’s Nov. 7 permit approval is “unjustifiable” because energy developer Williams, whose subsidiary Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company first proposed the pipeline in 2017, did not remedy the reasons for the denials when it applied for permits again last June, the groups said.

They warned the underwater segment of the proposed pipeline, which would run beneath the Raritan Bay in the New Jersey-New York Harbor, would endanger marine habitats and dredge up sediments contaminated with mercury, copper, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The pipeline also would threaten wetlands and the environment in Somerset County, where Williams wants to build a compressor station, and Middlesex and Monmouth counties, where it would link existing pipelines between Pennsylvania and New York City, the groups said.

“New Jersey’s approval completely disregards its prior, sound decision to reject this pipeline over threats to the state’s water quality. This pipeline will not only destroy wetlands across New Jersey, but also would tear up the sea floor of Raritan Bay,” the NRDC’s Jared Knicley said in a statement. “We’re taking New Jersey to court to enforce the state’s water quality standards, which are incompatible with building this harmful pipeline.”

Williams said in a statement that the project is “critical to addressing persistent natural gas supply constraints in the Northeast” that have driven up consumers’ energy costs and deepened their reliance on alternatives like oil that are worse for the environment.

“By advancing NESE, we will deliver reliable, lower-emission energy, reduce environmental impacts, and support economic growth across the region,” the company said in an unsigned statement.

Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, declined to comment.

Christopher Miller is executive director of the Eastern Environmental Law Center, which filed a petition Tuesday on behalf of the NY/NJ Baykeeper, Princeton Manor Homeowners Association, Central Jersey Safe Energy Coalition, Food & Water Watch, New Jersey League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, and Sierra Club.

“New Jersey’s decision to approve NESE after repeatedly rejecting the same project is indefensible,” Miller said in a statement. “It wrongly puts the interests of the fossil fuel industry above the public interest in clean water.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/evanleong-84-1024x6831763509659.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=krnyHVDC,N,,2025-11-18 21:01:12.583323

PHOENIX (Nov. 18, 2025) – The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) Underground Storage Tank (UST) Program recently completed environmental site assessments that included the removal of abandoned, orphaned petroleum tanks from private properties in Ash Fork and Phoenix, using federal Brownfields funding. These long unused tank sites, with no identified owners or operators, posed potential environmental risks and barriers to redevelopment.

“Properties with abandoned underground storage tanks that have not been adequately assessed may have hidden environmental risks and could impact the potential for redevelopment,” said ADEQ Waste Programs Division Director Julie Riemenschneider. “Thanks to the grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) we were able to remove those tanks and give communities peace of mind knowing their land is safe for continued use.”

ADEQ completed the assessments in Oct. 2025 using approximately $450,000 from a $2 million Brownfields Assessment Grant awarded to ADEQ by the EPA. The grant is part of expanded federal resources through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which support state and local efforts to assess and restore underused or contaminated properties.

ADEQ reviewed historical records and available environmental data statewide to identify and prioritize sites for assessment. The review verified that no documentation existed showing the tanks had been properly and permanently closed and evaluated each site based on risk factors and the willingness of property owners to participate. ADEQ then used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the locations of the underground storage tanks which were then removed. The successful assessments eliminated potential hazards and cleared the way for safe redevelopment opportunities in Arizona.

In Ash Fork, one of the site cleanups cleared a small commercial parcel for potential reuse, while in Phoenix, the work addressed aging underground infrastructure in a mixed-use corridor.

“These projects demonstrate how environmental cleanup and community revitalization go hand in hand,” said ADEQ UST Manager Joey Kiker. “We’re excited to build on this momentum by assessing more orphan UST sites across Arizona to help more communities turn underused land into opportunities for growth.”

ADEQ plans to assess about 10 additional orphaned UST sites across Arizona as funding becomes available. These efforts help communities reclaim valuable land for redevelopment, align with ADEQ’s mission to protect public health and the environment, and ensure Arizona’s towns continue to grow safely and sustainably.

Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy.
Broader Trend Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming.","The rule positions the Railroad Commission of Texas as the primary permitting authority over Class VI wells and could expedite CCS projects in the state.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved Texas’s application to assume primary enforcement responsibility, or “primacy,” for Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells within the state. Class VI UIC wells are used for the permanent geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep underground rock formations. Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide. For more details on the proposed rule to grant Texas primacy, see this Latham blog post.

EPA’s approval follows a comprehensive technical and legal review of Texas’s program revision application, which concluded that the state’s statutes, regulations, and administrative framework for permitting and regulating Class VI UIC wells meet the federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Texas already administers UIC programs for other well classes. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality oversees Class I (deep waste disposal), III (mineral extraction), IV (hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup), and V (non-hazardous fluid disposal) wells. The RRC oversees certain Class V wells (shallow geothermal injection wells) and Class II (oil and gas waste disposal and enhanced oil recovery wells).

Class VI primacy could accelerate permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by leveraging local technical expertise and Texas’s established regulatory infrastructure.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy

The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy. RRC Chairman Jim Wright called it “an important step forward for [the] state’s energy sector” that could serve “to reduce regulatory overlap.” According to Senator John Cornyn, primacy allows Texas “to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency.”

The RRC reports that it has already received 18 Class VI UIC well applications and is aware of additional projects being planned across the state.

Broader Trend

Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Most recently, EPA granted Arizona primacy for all UIC well classes. These approvals underscore a broader national trend toward state-level administration of CCS permitting.

What’s Next

EPA’s final rule will take effect December 15, 2025. Project proponents should track the RRC’s Class VI program implementation — including application forms, guidance, and timelines — and prepare to participate in state permitting processes.

Environmental Alert

(by Lisa Bruderly and Ethan Johnson)

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) proposed a revised definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (Proposed Rule). The Trump administration announced that the Proposed Rule would “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.”

The new definition is expected to reduce the number of streams and wetlands that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and will impact several federal regulatory programs, including Section 404 permitting of impacts to regulated waters. The agencies drafted the Proposed Rule to closely mirror the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which held that the Clean Water Act extends to “relatively permanent” bodies of water connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to those waters.

The Proposed Rule adds definitions for several terms, including “relatively permanent,” “tributary,” “continuous surface connection,” “prior converted cropland,” and “ditch.”

The public comment period will begin when the Proposed Rule is published in the Federal Register. If finalized, it will replace the Biden administration’s 2023 definition of WOTUS. The definition of WOTUS has changed several times in the last decade.

This dual-use capability breaks down traditional walls between transportation and energy,” said Mike Bagot of Net Zero Battery Solutions.

“I expect my business to reach national customers,” said Bagot. “I have an electric vehicle and know the struggles of charging on the road and range anxiety. I wanted to make an electric vehicle battery that could do more and go further.”

Medvient – Nicole Oliver

Medvient is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to revolutionize medical billing, coding, and reimbursement. “Medvient replaces outdated, labor-heavy medical billing with AI-driven automation. Our platform uses a three-tier autonomous agent system that handles transcription, coding, compliance, and claim preparation with speed and precision. This reduces administrative costs, accelerates reimbursement, and gives providers a modern, reliable revenue cycle infrastructure,” said Nicole Oliver of Medvient.

“We are starting with a clear mission: support Louisiana clinics by modernizing their revenue cycle operations. From there, Medvient is built to scale regionally and nationally, particularly into rural and underserved areas that lack billing resources. Over time, our AI architecture can support global healthcare systems seeking faster reimbursement and reduced administrative burden,” said Oliver.

“Pitch Night is an opportunity to share our progress, connect with the region’s innovation ecosystem, and build relationships with partners and investors who believe healthcare deserves better technology. We aim to expand our pilot opportunities, increase visibility, and move Medvient closer to full deployment in clinical environments,” said Oliver.

“After 25 years working in revenue cycle operations, I saw how much time, money, and human energy are wasted on outdated billing systems. I built Medvient to solve the problems I’ve lived firsthand, using modern AI to create faster, more accurate, and more sustainable billing for healthcare providers,” said Oliver.

Intelligent Archives — Joseph Makkos

“Intelligent Archives converts one million pages of historic New Orleans newspapers into AI-ready datasets and story IP, creating a dual monetization engine that merges preservation with advanced machine learning and media production. It’s a new model where cultural heritage becomes high-value data infrastructure,” said Joseph Makkos of Intelligent Archives.

“We’re looking to build relationships with mentors, partners, and investors who understand both the commercial potential and cultural importance of ethical, high-quality training data and IP. Pitch Night offers visibility, validation, and strategic alignment for rapid growth,” said Makkos.

“After Katrina, I began rescuing historic New Orleans print ephemera and equipment. After acquiring the archives, I realized they weren’t just artifacts—they were powerful training data and narrative engines waiting to be activated. This work is driven by a belief that the future of AI and storytelling must be rooted in real human history,” said Makkos.

Regions Foundation Grant Announcement

The IDEAinstitute Fall 2025 Pitch Night will include the announcement of a major grant from the Regions Foundation, a nonprofit funded primarily by Regions Bank, in support of Idea Village initiatives.

About Entergy New Orleans Entergy New Orleans LLC is an electric and gas utility that serves Louisiana’s Orleans Parish.","As winter approaches and temperatures begin dropping, customers will begin using their heating systems more and this could lead to an increase in electricity usage. However, staying warm and comfortable does not have to come at the cost of high electric bills. By making a few simple changes around your home, you can improve its energy efficiency and keep costs down throughout the colder months.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating and cooling costs can make up more than 52% of an average customer’s electric bill. In some cases, poor insulation, air leaks and inefficient HVAC systems can lead to even greater energy costs each year. To keep your home warm without significantly raising the thermostat, try these low to no-cost tips.

Improving energy efficiency with low-to-no-cost tips

Use solar energy: Open curtains on the south-facing windows during the day to allow sunlight to naturally heat the home and close them at night to reduce the chill from cold windows.

Insulate drafty windows: Use a heavy-duty, clear plastic sheet on a frame or tape clear plastic film to the inside of window frames and make sure the plastic is sealed tightly to the frame to help reduce infiltration.

Adjust the thermostat: When you are home and awake, set the thermostat as low as is comfortable, but when you are asleep or out of the house, turn the thermostat back to save on your heating and cooling bills.

Find and seal leaks: Seal air leaks around utility cut-throughs for pipes and recessed lights in insulated ceilings, and unfinished spaces behind cupboards and closets.

Maintain heating systems: Schedule routine service for home heating systems and replace furnace and heat pump filters once a month or as needed.

Reduce heat loss from the fireplace: Keep the fireplace damper closed unless a fire is burning and check the seal on the fireplace flue damper and make it as snug as possible.

By following these simple steps, you can stay warm and comfortable all winter long while keeping your bills under control. We also offer free comprehensive residential energy audits and rebates to help reduce the upfront cost of installing energy-efficient equipment.

Exploring resources through Bill Toolkit

To make sure customers have quick access to energy efficiency, bill management and financial assistance resources, Entergy created an online platform called Bill Toolkit. The platform consolidates helpful resources for customers interested in exploring ways to lower their electric use and costs and learn more about different payment options the company offers. It also provides information on our energy efficiency programs and incentives and rebates associated with these programs.

Tracking energy use through myAdvisor

Entergy customers can set electric usage alerts and monitor how much energy they use each day through bill management tools like myAdvisor, which is available through their myEntergy account online. Tracking usage over time can help customers identify trends that contribute to higher usage and budget their monthly expenses. With the myAdvisor dashboard, customers have access to not only usage and cost details, but also bill history and projections, analyzer tools and more. On the Entergy mobile app this information can be found by tapping the “usage” tab.

Managing bills through payment and assistance options

Entergy offers several flexible payment options so customers can choose when, where and how they receive their bills.

Pick-A-Date allows customers to pay their bills when it works best for them.

Level Billing allows customers to “level out” seasonal energy use fluctuations, making their bills more consistent every month.

PaperFREE billing allows customers to get their bills emailed as soon as they post and instant access to two years of billing history.

AutoPay allows customers to avoid late fees, writing checks and paying for postage by having bills automatically deduct from their bank accounts.

We also offer flexible payment options such as deferred payment arrangements or payment extensions. Customers can find out if they qualify for these options through our mobile app or myEntergy online.

Smartphone maker Xiaomi said on Tuesday that its electric vehicle business had turned a quarterly profit for the first time, less than two years after launching its first car.

The Apple rival's EV, AI, and other new initiatives division reported a gross profit of $98.5 million for the quarter ending in September.

Revenues in the division hit a record high of $4 billion, with 28.3 billion yuan ($3.98 billion) coming from EV sales and 0.7 billion yuan ($98.5 million) from ""related businesses.""

Hitting profitability caps a meteoric rise for Xiaomi's EV venture.

Like Western rival Apple, the Chinese tech giant invested billions in building an electric car to rival Tesla and BYD — but unlike Apple, Xiaomi actually managed to ship an EV, launching the sleek SU7 sedan in March 2024.

The SU7 was a smash hit, selling over 130,000 units last year, and Xiaomi's second vehicle, a Tesla Model Y competitor called the YU7, amassed 240,000 preorders in 24 hours when it launched in June 2025.

Xiaomi has faced headwinds, with the company's stock price falling after a fatal crash involving an SU7 earlier this year, but sales have continued to grow. Xiaomi said on Tuesday it had delivered over 100,000 EVs in the third quarter, up from around 40,000 over the same period last year.

A tough road to profitability

Making money from selling EVs is notoriously difficult. By reaching profitability in under two years, Xiaomi has joined the small list of companies that have avoided the so-called ""Valley of Death"" that has claimed many promising EV startups.

Elon Musk's Tesla reported its first profitable quarter in 2013, around 10 years after the company's foundation and five years after Tesla began deliveries of its first vehicle, the Roadster.

It took Tesla another seven years to report a full year of profitability, during which the company nearly went bankrupt as it scaled up production of new models. Tesla reported $1.62 billion in operating income in the most recent quarter.

BYD, China's largest seller of EVs, has also been consistently profitable. The Chinese automaker reported $1.1 billion in net income in the third quarter and saw its revenues eclipse Tesla's for the first time last year.

However, BYD benefits from selling both hybrids and pure battery-electric vehicles, unlike Tesla and Xiaomi.

Other automakers have struggled to make money from building electric vehicles. Detroit giants Ford and GM continue to lose billions on their EV businesses, while startups Lucid and Rivian both reported losses of around $1 billion in the third quarter.

Even in China, where electric vehicle adoption is far ahead of the US, brutal price wars and cutthroat competition mean that only a few companies have managed to turn a profit.

Xiaomi rival Nio reported a net loss of nearly $700 million in the second quarter of 2025, while fellow EV startup Xpeng is closing in on profitability after cutting its own loss to just $50 million in the third quarter.",https://i.insider.com/691c6f56e1a9cbb014de65f6?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 17:02:27.790083

Car and Driver reached out to Kia, which confirmed the model had been postponed until further notice due to ""changing market conditions.""

It would have cost over $80,000, which is a hard sell in a world with no tax credits and potential import duties.

Kia was supposed to launch a hot GT version of the EV9 in the United States before the end of 2025. This top variant was supposed to have around 500 horsepower, drop the sprint time to just over 4 seconds and offer sporty visual touches to go with the extra performance. However, the EV9 GT won’t debut this year, and it’s now unclear if it’s ever coming to the U.S., due to “changing market conditions.""

Since the EV9 GT’s announced launch window was drawing to a close, Car and Driver reached out to the manufacturer, which confirmed it had been “delayed until further notice,” just like the EV4 sedan. That may mean it's not coming, since the U.S. luxury electric car market is cooling and selling expensive EVs is harder than it used to be, especially after the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Tariffs may also play a role here. While both Hyundai and Kia manufacturer their high-volume EVs in the U.S., their performance products tend to come from Korea. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 are both built in the U.S., but if you want a hot Ioniq 5 N or EV6 GT, it'll come from Korea. If Kia planned the same split for the EV9, it's possible that the 15% tariff on imported South Korean cars made the plans unworkable.

Photo by: Kia

The EV9 GT was expected to cost around $10,000 more than the most expensive current variant, the EV9 GT-Line, which costs $71,900. Kia likely thinks an even more expensive variant would not sell well enough to justify putting it on sale, especially since buyers in this segment probably don’t see the point in paying extra for an adjustable rear limited-slip differential, bigger brakes or better tires.

Kia also gave the EV9 GT electronically controlled suspension (ECS), which could make the car stiffer or softer depending on the driving mode, and it likely would have simulated a combustion engine, just like the revised EV6 GT, which was the first Kia to get this feature, inspired by the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.

More aggressive bumpers, different wheels and green-painted brake calipers completed the list of exterior modifications. Inside, a sporty three-spoke steering wheel with a center mark, sportier seats with big side bolsters and green detailing let you know that you were looking at the top-tier GT.

It’s unclear if this applies to the rest of the world, because Kia began taking orders for the EV9 GT in some markets. The UK order books opened in June, and the model was priced at £82,185 ($108,000), but we don’t know if customer deliveries have started. In the U.S., some dealers apparently received GT demo vehicles, but there are no driving videos or reviews of the car anywhere, just some static walkaround videos from the U.S. and Canada.

Key Changes EPA proposes several notable changes in the revised rule: De minimis exemption: PFAS in mixtures or articles at less than 0.1% would be exempt.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced critical changes to its long-deferred Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) PFAS Reporting Rule. The revised rule narrows the scope of information to be reported and eliminates the reporting obligations faced by importers of PFAS-containing articles.

Practical Implications

If finalized, the revised rule would significantly narrow the universe of entities required to report and clarify the information required to be reported. Previously, entities that imported any amount of PFAS — even as part of an imported article — were required to gather information for more than a ten-year lookback period. Under the revised rule, article importers and entities generating PFAS only as impurities, byproducts or non‑isolated intermediates are no longer required to report. EPA has also created a de minimis exemption, meaning mixtures and articles that contain less than 0.1% PFAS are not required to report.

But the relief isn’t universal. EPA is maintaining the broad definition of PFAS for purposes of the rule and has proposed a compressed reporting window, beginning 60 days after adoption of the final rule and lasting just three months. Entities that remain in scope should plan accordingly.

Key Changes

EPA proposes several notable changes in the revised rule:

De minimis exemption: PFAS in mixtures or articles at less than 0.1% would be exempt. This exemption would apply regardless of the total production volume of the mixture or article.

Article import exemption: Importing PFAS as part of an article would no longer trigger reporting; the streamlined article‑importer form and extended deadline would be eliminated.

Alignment with TSCA exemptions: PFAS manufactured solely as byproducts, impurities or non‑isolated intermediates, and small‑quantity R&D production, would be exempt. PFAS-containing byproducts later used for commercial purposes remain subject to reporting requirements.

Product category updates: Consumer and commercial category names would be refined to reduce ambiguity.

Submission window changes: The reporting period would begin 60 days after the final rule’s effective date and run for three months; the special window for small manufacturers reporting only as article importers would be removed.

What Is Not Changing

EPA would retain the PFAS structural definition in 40 CFR 705.3 and the lookback period of Jan. 1, 2011 through Dec. 31, 2022. One‑time, substance‑specific reporting for PFAS manufacturers, including importers, not subject to an exemption will continue with no production‑volume threshold.

Call for Comments

EPA has requested public comments on several specific areas of the proposed rule, including the de minimis exemption, the imported articles exemption and the proposed change to the reporting window. Manufacturers affected by this rule should consider submitting comments by the Dec. 29, 2025 deadline.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (Nov. 18, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a settlement with Apple Inc. over claims of violations of federal hazardous waste law at a facility located on Scott Boulevard, Santa Clara, California. As a result of EPA’s action, the company addressed hazardous waste management and air emissions issues and has come into compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

“Hazardous waste regulations serve as critical safeguards for facility workers, communities, and the environment,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division Director Amy Miller. “EPA’s actions will protect human health and the environment in the community of Santa Clara from the risk of hazardous waste.”

The Apple Inc. facility generates hazardous waste regulated under RCRA. In August 2023 and January 2024, EPA conducted inspections of the facility after receiving a tip and complaint from the public. During the inspections and reviews of facility records, EPA inspectors identified multiple violations of federal requirements for the management of hazardous waste.

These violations included failure to:

Properly characterize hazardous waste.

Identify land disposal restriction requirements and provide written notification of the restrictions.

Maintain a permit to store hazardous waste for more than 90 days.

Control air emissions from a solvent waste tank.

Properly label and date hazardous waste containers.

Follow hazardous waste container management standards.

Perform and document daily inspections of hazardous waste tanks.

Due to EPA’s action, the company updated the characterization and management of solvent waste, installed a device to control air emissions from the solvent tank, and resolved the remaining identified violations. The company will also pay a penalty of $261,283 to resolve EPA’s claims.

Background

Hazardous waste that is improperly managed poses a serious threat to human health and the environment. RCRA, passed in 1976, was established to set up a framework for the proper management of hazardous waste. EPA’s RCRA regulations work to protect humans and the environment from exposures to pollutants in hazardous waste.

That era is over. The convergence of electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, technology advancements, and population growth and shifting is driving an unprecedented surge in electricity demand. According to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to grow 50% by 2050, reflecting the greater imperative to modernize the transmission system.

This rising load is straining an aging grid. Many of the components that keep power flowing—wood and concrete poles, steel towers, conductors, cross-arms, and insulators—are well past their intended lifespans. Some transmission structures have been in service for more than 60 years, showing signs of rust, decay, and fatigue. The result is a system that is vulnerable to outages, bottlenecks, and costly delays in connecting new sources of clean energy.

Simultaneously, we are experiencing more and greater extreme weather events. Older transmission and distribution structures—and even more recent ones—were not designed for the meteorological loadings that our electric grid must handle today.

The U.S. grid was largely designed in the mid-20th century for a world where most electricity was generated by large, centralized fossil fuel plants and consumed in steady, predictable patterns. That grid was never built to handle today’s bidirectional power flows, distributed energy resources, or the sudden spikes in demand caused by high-performance computing. Modernizing the transmission grid is the only way to bring this mid-century network into the 21st century and prepare it for decades of growth.

The good news is that meeting growing electricity demand doesn’t require building new generation plants alone. Upgrading and optimizing existing transmission lines—the arteries that move electricity from generation sites to users—can increase capacity, improve efficiency, and strengthen grid reliability.

Infrastructure That Carries Renewable Energy

When most people think about the energy transition, they picture solar panels, wind turbines, or battery storage. Transmission lines rarely come to mind. Yet, these lines are the invisible highways of our power system. They carry electricity from remote wind farms and solar arrays to population centers, move power between regions, and provide redundancy when local generation falters.

This role is becoming even more critical as the grid shifts from centralized fossil fuel generation to distributed, renewable sources. Unlike coal or natural gas plants, which could be built near demand centers, wind and solar projects are often located hundreds of miles away. This means the electricity they produce must travel long distances to reach those who need it.

Without sufficient transmission capacity, clean energy projects are delayed, curtailed, or canceled altogether. The backlog of renewable projects waiting for grid interconnection is now one of the largest barriers to decarbonization.

Digital Tools Driving Transmission Line Upgrades

Modern digital design and modeling techniques are transforming how transmission lines are engineered and maintained. Sophisticated software now enables a single engineer to accomplish in months what once took a team of dozens years to complete, accelerating planning, reducing errors, and allowing upgrades to be completed quickly and efficiently.

The impact goes beyond efficiency. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and high-resolution satellite imagery were already being used to model existing power corridors with unprecedented accuracy. After the Northeast blackout in 2003, which left 50 million people without power, utilities relying on digital tools were able to meet updated regulatory standards and strengthen system reliability. These technologies have been used to model more than 80% of high-voltage lines in the U.S. and Canada, improving both capacity and resilience.

By combining advanced software with detailed geospatial and engineering data, engineers can identify chokepoints, optimize upgrades, and prepare the grid to meet the growing demands of renewable energy, EVs, and data-driven infrastructure. Existing transmission and distribution lines can be modeled in a digital twin to quickly identify the areas that need to be strengthened to meet today’s weather events. These tools are helping the transmission and distribution system evolve from a reactive network into a modern, resilient backbone for America’s electrified future.

The Cost of Inaction

Neglecting the transmission system is not just an inconvenience, it is a risk to reliability and economic growth. The American Society of Civil Engineer’s (ASCE’s) recent infrastructure report card gave America’s energy grid a D-plus, citing aging equipment and lack of investment as key concerns.

Failing components can trigger cascading outages that leave millions without power. Today, the stakes are even higher. When the grid goes down, data centers go offline, commerce stops, and we can’t charge our cellphones or stream our favorite TV shows. That’s just a few examples of how deeply the economy and our everyday lives depend on a reliable power grid.

Utilities also face mounting pressure to connect large-scale data centers, which are power-hungry by design. By some estimates, supporting artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers alone will require an additional 35 GW of capacity by 2030, the equivalent of adding dozens of large power plants to the grid. Without significant transmission upgrades, this demand cannot be met.

Modernization Beats Greenfield Construction

One of the most effective ways to address these challenges is to upgrade and optimize existing transmission corridors. Replacing aging conductors with modern high-capacity wires, raising structures to meet newly required clearances, strengthening structures to meet updated safety and design codes, and re-rating lines can unlock significant capacity without waiting years for new rights-of-way.

This approach delivers several benefits, such as:

Speed. Utilities can add capacity in months rather than the years it can take to permit and build new lines.

Cost Savings. Upgrades are typically less expensive than building new generation or new transmission corridors.

Reduced Environmental Impact. Reusing existing rights-of-way minimizes the need for new land acquisition and lowers permitting complexity.

Improved Resilience. Modern materials and design standards help transmission and distribution systems withstand extreme weather and reduce maintenance costs.

To make this strategy work, though, utilities need accurate, high-resolution data on the current state of their assets. With aerial technology such as drones, engineers can create detailed models—digital twins—of existing systems, identify obstacles, and optimize upgrades before crews even step onsite. Modern digital modeling not only speeds planning and construction but also reduces risk, ensures compliance with updated standards, and unlocks additional capacity within existing transmission corridors.

Clearing the Permitting Bottleneck

Technical solutions alone are not enough. The permitting process for new transmission projects remains one of the most significant barriers to grid modernization. A single project crossing federal land can require approvals from dozens of agencies, leading to delays of 10 years or more.

Regulatory reform is essential. Streamlining reviews, setting clear timelines, and coordinating between agencies could dramatically accelerate critical projects. Policymakers and regulators have an opportunity to treat transmission upgrades with the same urgency as other national infrastructure priorities, recognizing their role in economic security and decarbonization.

Building the Workforce for the Grid of the Future

Upgrading the grid is also a workforce challenge. The transmission sector is facing a shortage of skilled engineers, line workers, and planners at the same time demand for their expertise is rising. Investment in workforce development will be just as important as investment in steel and concrete. Partnerships with universities, training programs for new technicians, and mentorship initiatives can ensure the next generation of engineers is prepared to tackle the complexity of grid modernization.

Technology can play a role here, too. Digital design and simulation tools allow junior engineers to experiment safely, learn from modeled scenarios, and build confidence before they work on live systems. A stronger, more skilled workforce will be essential to deliver projects on time and maintain reliability as the grid grows more complex.

Where We Go from Here

The U.S. is at an inflection point. The electricity grid we rely on every day is under strain from forces it was never designed to handle. At the same time, we have the tools, technology, and expertise to strengthen it if we act decisively.

Modernizing the transmission system is not just an engineering challenge; it is an economic and societal imperative. Investment in transmission delivers outsized returns in reliability, resiliency, and access to clean energy.

Utilities, regulators, and policymakers must work together to prioritize transmission upgrades, adopt and enforce modern design standards, and streamline permitting processes. By doing so, we can build a grid that is not only capable of meeting today’s demand but also ready for the reliable electrified future, supporting data centers, EVs, and technologies that have yet to be invented.

The grid is the backbone of modern life. Strengthening it now is the surest way to power the next chapter of American progress.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig1-power-lines-transmission-distribution-td.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 16:02:14.553715

“The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Governor Josh Stein.
“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ 10,000 metric ton facility,” said John Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements.
As home to our current commercial facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three.
Vulcan Elements is also a 2025 recipient of a One North Carolina Small Business Program Matching grant that helped accelerate the company’s innovation, growth, and positioning for additional federal funding.","Today Governor Josh Stein announced Vulcan Elements Inc., a manufacturer of rare earth magnets, will invest $918.1 million in the town of Benson to expand its magnet production capacity and establish the largest magnet factory in the world outside of China. The company will add 1,000 new jobs to Johnston County.

“The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Governor Josh Stein. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

Vulcan Elements opened its first facility in the Research Triangle Park to manufacture Neodymium Iron Boron rare earth magnets. These magnets convert electricity into motion and are required components for virtually all electronic devices. Along with semiconductors and batteries, rare earth magnets are critical components for almost all technologies that use motors, sensors, generators, or actuators – from hard disk drives, robotics, and drones to satellites, submarines, and nearly every defense system. The accelerating demand for advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, robotics, electric vehicles, and military systems, will support the company’s expansion into a 1 million-square-foot site in Benson. This manufacturing plant will achieve 10,000 metric tonnes of magnet production capacity and play a critical role in reshoring the magnet supply chain.

“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ 10,000 metric ton facility,” said John Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements. “We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation, and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current commercial facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three. As we create 1,000 new American jobs, we’ll tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries – from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy equipment, and serving their country.”

“This major expansion by Vulcan Elements is why North Carolina continues to be recognized as the best state to do business in America,” said N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “North Carolina brings a worldclass workforce, a business-friendly environment, and an incredible research network to support our shared goals of national security, innovation, and great jobs.”

New positions for the company include administrative, engineering, and production staff. These new jobs could create a potential annual payroll impact of more than $81.9 million for the region.

Vulcan Elements’ expansion in North Carolina will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG), which was approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee earlier today. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $2.6 billion. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $17,584,500, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification each year by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

The project’s projected return on investment of public dollars is 65 percent, meaning for every dollar of potential cost to the state, the state receives $1.65 in state revenue. JDIG projects result in positive net tax revenue to the state treasury, even after taking into consideration the grant’s reimbursement payments to a given company.

Because Vulcan Elements chose a site in Johnston County, classified by the state’s economic tier system as Tier 3, the company’s JDIG agreement also calls for moving as much as $5,861,500 into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account. The Utility Account helps rural communities anywhere in the state finance infrastructure upgrades necessary to attract future business.

The state also anticipates providing additional support to the project from the North Carolina General Assembly, including as much as $250,000 for road improvements.

“Vulcan Elements’ investment today is going to have a global impact as they become the first completely domestic producer of magnets needed for data centers, robotics, semiconductors, cars, and the new economy,” said Senator Benton Sawrey. “Johnston County is excited to be part of this journey, and Vulcan Elements can count on our community and transitioning military personnel to fill these positions and support its next phase of growth.”

“Announcements like this don’t happen by chance,” said Representative Larry C. Strickland. “We appreciate the partnership on both sides of the aisle, the careful preparation by the local officials, and the diligent work of the local and regional economic developers that contributed to Vulcan Elements’ decision to establish its $1 billion factory in Benson.”

In addition to the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, other key partners in this project include the North Carolina General Assembly, Commerce’s Division of Workforce Solutions, Commerce’s Office of Science, Technology & Innovation, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the University of North Carolina System, the North Carolina Community College System, Johnston Community College, the Golden LEAF Foundation, South River Electric Membership Corporation, I-95/I-40 Crossroads of America Economic Development Alliance, Johnston County, the Johnston County Economic Development Corporation, and the Town of Benson.

The growth underscores its role as a core component of the global renewable energy transition.
Despite the positive outlook, the report identifies the intermittency of solar power as a primary restraint on market growth.
Authorities are also implementing Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanisms to monetize clean energy generation and ensure compliance with renewable purchase obligations (RPOs).
The global solar energy market is on a trajectory for substantial growth, fueled by both technological and regulatory support.","The global solar energy market, driven by a push for carbon reduction and sustainable power generation, is projected to quadruple its valuation over the next decade, despite persistent challenges related to power generation variability, according to a new report from Allied Market Research.

The report estimates the market was valued at $0.4 trillion in 2024 and is forecast to reach $1.6 trillion by 2034. This growth trajectory reflects a compound annual growth rate of 15.2% from 2025 to 2034, fueled by technological advancements in photovoltaic (PV) systems, declining installation costs, and supportive government policies globally.

Solar energy, which accounts for approximately 8% of global electricity supply as of July 2025, is seen as a cost-effective and abundant alternative to fossil fuels. The growth underscores its role as a core component of the global renewable energy transition. The analysis attributes market expansion to ongoing technological integration with smart technologies and the overall push for energy independence among nations.

Despite the positive outlook, the report identifies the intermittency of solar power as a primary restraint on market growth. The variable and non-continuous nature of generation, caused by weather changes, seasons, and the day-night cycle, complicates the task for grid operators who must continuously balance supply and demand.

Regions with high solar penetration have seen the effects of this variability. The report notes that unexpected surpluses in areas like California and Australia have at times driven wholesale power prices into negative territory. Conversely, sudden drops in output strain grid stability, increasing the risk of power outages, such as those observed in Spain and Portugal earlier in 2025. Energy systems designed for predictable sources must adapt to manage these fluctuations, which are exacerbated by prediction errors from abrupt cloud cover or storms.

Governments worldwide are implementing a comprehensive regulatory landscape to manage and accelerate solar adoption. These frameworks include Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and feed-in tariff (FiT) schemes that mandate or incentivize utilities to source power from solar energy. Financial measures like investment tax credits (ITC) and production tax credits (PTC) are also utilized to lower initial investment barriers and attract both domestic and foreign capital, according to the report.

Further regulatory oversight includes establishing strict grid interconnection codes to ensure reliable integration and prevent instability. Authorities are also implementing Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanisms to monetize clean energy generation and ensure compliance with renewable purchase obligations (RPOs).

A significant growth opportunity highlighted in the research is Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). BIPV involves seamlessly incorporating PV panels into a building’s elements, such as windows, roofs, and façades, allowing the material to serve both as a structural component and a power-generating system. This approach is particularly relevant for commercial and high-rise buildings where traditional rooftop space is limited.

Illustrating this emerging technology, Microquanta launched a perovskite panel BIPV project in Shanxi, China, in February 2025. The installation, located at the University Student Entrepreneurship Center, has a capacity of 17.92 kilowatts peak (kWp) and uses double-glass perovskite modules engineered for approximately 40% light transmittance.

The global solar energy market is on a trajectory for substantial growth, fueled by both technological and regulatory support. Its long-term expansion hinges on the successful implementation of effective solutions, such as advanced energy storage and grid management systems, to counteract the operational complexities posed by the inherent variability of solar power generation, according to the market research.

The Texas Energy Buyers Alliance Club previously reported that blocking future renewable energy and storage deployment would result in an estimated $115 billion in higher wholesale prices for Texans over the next 15 years.","Federal policies targeting renewable energy are causing catastrophic damage to development in Texas, the nation’s leading solar and energy storage state, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

SEIA has released an analysis indicating that new federal policies targeting renewable energy are placing a significant majority of planned solar and battery storage capacity in Texas at severe risk. The data suggests that up to two-thirds of the state’s future clean energy portfolio could be indefinitely stalled due to a combination of regulatory and financial headwinds.

The primary factors cited for this development risk include the administrative slowdown of federal permitting processes, the rollback of critical investment tax credits, and the cancellation of the $7 billion Solar for All grant program. Solar has taken a hit from political attacks, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and executive and agency actions aimed at curbing solar development. After years of growth, Wood Mackenzie forecast that solar installations may decline 1% annually through 2035.

This policy environment is creating profound uncertainty for developers and investors operating within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) jurisdiction.

The consequences are quantified for both the near and intermediate term. SEIA’s analysis projects that over 13,000 MW of planned solar and co-located battery capacity will likely fail to come online in 2026, representing half of all scheduled clean energy projects in the state for that period.

The capacity at risk escalates significantly for projects scheduled for 2027, where the share jumps to over 22,500 MW out of the 26,000 MW planned. In total, 165 individual projects in Texas have been identified as facing significant development risk.

The challenge is systemic and national. According to SEIA’s findings, more than 70 GW of solar and 40 GW of battery projects across the entire U.S. pipeline have not secured all necessary federal, state, and local permits. This substantial capacity is at risk of slowdown due to the new administrative priority on fossil fuels.

The report from SEIA tracks planned capacity and what is at risk state-by-state on a dashboard here.

The potential loss of this grid-strengthening capacity in Texas is projected to incur direct costs for consumers. The Texas Energy Buyers Alliance Club previously reported that blocking future renewable energy and storage deployment would result in an estimated $115 billion in higher wholesale prices for Texans over the next 15 years.

SEIA president stated that these “political attacks on solar and storage are putting half of all power planned to come onto the grid this decade at risk,” directly impacting grid resilience and economic competitiveness as electricity demand, particularly from data centers, continues to rapidly increase.

Solar and storage projects developed on federal lands now face “final review” from Trump-appointed Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum’s office, leaving many to be “trapped in limbo,” said SEIA.

“And this extends well beyond projects on public lands,” said SEIA. “Many solar and storage projects located partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in a myriad of federal reviews.”

SEIA said federal obstruction erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host. It poses a risk to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if your project complies with regulations the federal government can still pull the plug, said SEIA.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/michael-pointner-9XNbOxsSIrw-unsplash1-2048x1365-1-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 15:01:46.705774

Gulf of America: Record Production with New Deepwater Projects

In the Gulf of America, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has overseen several important projects brought online in 2025. Besides Salamanca, Shell’s Whale platform achieved first oil in January and is designed to produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at peak. Joining Whale in this year’s lineup is Beacon Offshore Energy’s Shenandoah, a high-pressure deepwater development in the Walker Ridge area off Louisiana, which began oil and natural gas production in July. Shenandoah is designed for 120,000 barrels per day of production capacity, making it one of the most significant new oil producers in the Gulf. In April, Chevron’s Ballymore field came online as a subsea tie-back to an existing facility and added up to 75,000 barrels per day.

Noticeably, LLOG Exploration’s Salamanca hub in Keathley Canyon marks the first-ever refurbishment and reuse of a decommissioned floating production unit in the Gulf. Rather than build a platform from scratch, the Salamanca project transformed a previously retired facility into a modern oil hub—significantly reducing the time, cost, and emissions required to bring a facility online. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement Floating Production Unit has an output capacity of about 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The bureau oversaw rigorous safety reviews of the refurbished platform and new equipment, ensuring that this pioneering project meets all standards as it contributes new barrels to US oil production.

“We’re seeing the payoff of a bold offshore energy blueprint,” said Beyer. “From cutting-edge deepwater platforms to creative reuse of existing units, industry is answering the call to maximize domestic oil production. Under President Trump’s leadership, the Gulf is again proving itself as a cornerstone of American energy security, ensuring a stable and reliable energy supply.”

Pacific Offshore: A Comeback After a Decade

For the first time in ten years, offshore oil production has resumed in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf from the Santa Ynez Unit. Platform Harmony restarted operations in 2025 following thorough inspections, infrastructure checks, and pipeline safety reviews by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. This restart restores an important source of domestic energy supply while ensuring that safeguards are in place to protect workers and the coastal environment.

Arctic Oversight: Safeguarding Frontier Resources

In the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf, the bureau continues to oversee oil production from the Northstar Unit in the Beaufort Sea.

The Arctic represents both opportunity and responsibility, and the bureau’s oversight ensures that any new development in the region proceeds with careful attention to worker safety, environmental protection, and community concerns.

Policy Success and Safe Oversight

These gains in offshore oil output are the direct result of policy decisions and regulatory reforms put in place since President Trump took office. Early in the Administration, the President and Secretary of the Interior outlined a blueprint aimed at maximizing the nation’s untapped oil and gas potential on federal lands and waters. In offshore regions, this translated into actively encouraging new projects, streamlining permitting processes, and removing unnecessary obstacles—all while enforcing stringent safety and environmental standards.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has implemented initiatives like “Dominance by Design,” a collaborative program with industry to modernize offshore oversight and improve the efficiency of approvals for important projects. By collaborating with operators, the bureau ensured that innovations such as high-pressure deepwater wells and technology-driven production techniques (e.g., downhole commingling) could be deployed quickly under effective supervision.

Safety and environmental protection have remained paramount even as development accelerates. Each new production facility underwent comprehensive engineering reviews, and bureau inspectors were on-site for critical milestones—from pre-commissioning tests on the refurbished Salamanca platform to pipeline integrity checks and spill response readiness in California.

“BSEE’s role is to make sure offshore energy projects advance safely and responsibly,” said BSEE Principal Deputy Director Kenneth Stevens. “The start-up of Salamanca, the resumption of Pacific production, and ongoing oversight in the Arctic show that we can and will expand domestic resources while protecting workers, communities, and the environment.”

“What piqued my interest was service members with repeated drug use or absence offenses,” Brooker says.
One day, while reading the on-base newspaper, Brooker learned about the Funded Legal Education Program, which pays for law school for service members who want to join the JAG Corps.
“When I got offered the clinic, I decided to take cases to help some of the people I was defending when I was in service,” Brooker says.
This includes reviewing military records, interviewing fellow service members, and understanding the culture of the unit at the time.","When Eve Richardson began working with the Military and Veterans Law Clinic at the UNC School of Law in 2019, clinic director and law professor John Brooker asked her a simple but powerful question: “What do you want to get out of this?”

Like many of Brooker’s clients, Richardson had endured traumatic experiences during her time in the U.S. military. But when she enlisted in the Army in the early 1980s, she was filled with hope.

After completing basic training, she served as a cook in the mess hall and quickly proved her talent, winning several cooking competitions. Her dedication and skill propelled her through the ranks, rising from private to sergeant in just three years. She was even stationed in Germany for a time.

“It was fabulous — until it wasn’t,” she recalls.

Richardson became trapped in an unhealthy relationship with another service member that led to severe depression and anxiety. It took time to recognize the toll it was taking on her, and when she finally decided to end the relationship, she found little support from the military.

“To be a victim you have to know you’re a victim,” Richardson says. “When people tell you it’s your fault, you begin to believe it.”

Then came a crisis: Her young son was hospitalized with kidney problems. Richardson stayed by his side for nearly a month. For that, she was arrested for absence without leave. Her options? Face time in a military prison or accept an other than honorable discharge.

She chose the latter — despite having served her country faithfully for nearly eight years.

Richardson’s story is not unique. Brooker, who spent 15 of his 20 years in the U.S. Army working as a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer, has heard many like it.

“What piqued my interest was service members with repeated drug use or absence offenses,” Brooker says. “Those are the two big reasons for other than honorable discharges, and I’ve seen this situation over and over again — especially with people who have trauma from war that impacts their judgement.”

Historically, the military has struggled to fully understand how conditions like major depressive disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, racism, and assault trauma affect mental health.

These conditions often contribute to other than honorable (OTH) discharges, which are issued for misconduct such as security violations, assault, abuse of authority, or drug use. As a result, service members with OTH discharges can lose access to critical veteran’s benefits, like health care and disability pay, and face long-term barriers to employment, as the discharge remains on their permanent record much like a criminal conviction.

“In the civilian world, being late to your job can’t get you sent to jail and likely won’t leave a permanent mark on your character,” says Jillian Foye, a third-year law student who works in the clinic. “But if you’re in the military, that’s exactly what happens.”

Today, an estimated 400,000 service members are at risk of being denied access to benefits they’ve earned, according to the Legal Services Center at Harvard Law School. The UNC Military and Veterans Law Clinic is working to change that, one case at a time, by helping veterans upgrade their discharge status. It’s a vital service in North Carolina, where nearly 10% of adults are active duty or former military personnel, or work as civilians for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Understanding the roots of these injustices — and how to fight them — became a personal mission for Brooker, shaped by his own journey through the military ranks and legal system.

From ROTC to JAG

Growing up in Durham, Brooker learned about the Army ROTC scholarship, which offers free tuition in exchange for military service after graduation, from a recruiter. He earned a nearly full ride to Wake Forest University, where he studied politics and history, and was commissioned as an Army officer in 1998.

He began his military career in the Transportation Corps — a logistics branch responsible for moving personnel and supplies via trucks, trains, planes, and boats — at Fort Eustis, Virginia. There, he oversaw watercraft operations on the Atlantic Ocean.

“I loved every minute of it,” Brooker says, grinning.

One day, while reading the on-base newspaper, Brooker learned about the Funded Legal Education Program, which pays for law school for service members who want to join the JAG Corps.

“It seemed too good to be true,” he says. “It meant I’d owe two years in the Army for every year I was in law school. But I really loved the Army and what I was doing at that point.”

Members of the JAG Corps serve as prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in military trials. They also work in the Army Legal Assistance Office, which provides free legal representation to soldiers, family members, and retirees.

Brooker enrolled at the UNC School of Law in 2000. Just one year later, he witnessed a dramatic shift in the military — from peacetime on September 10, 2001, to wartime on September 11. After graduating in 2003, he joined the JAG Corps and went on to complete two combat tours in Iraq.

“I had to learn how to do legal work overseas,” Brooker says. “Like, how do you have a trial when you don’t have a courtroom? In one instance, we actually built one in Baghdad at a small operating base because our witnesses were there. The war changed the daily nature of what we did all day, every day.”

Returning to his roots

During his time in the Army, Brooker handled many cases involving minor offenses that would be overlooked in civilian life but were punished harshly in the military, such as one-time drug use or absence from duty. These offenses often led to OTH discharges, which could severely impact a service member’s benefits.

“I was very cognizant that an other than honorable discharge could take away someone’s benefits forever,” Brooker shares. “So I’d try to be on the side of the soldier.”

Toward the end of his military career, Brooker was stationed in Charlottesville, Virginia, home to the U.S. Army’s Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School. He received his Master of Laws degree and worked on the faculty there, where he collaborated with two colleagues to write a book-length guide for the Military Law Review on benefit eligibility for OTH discharges.

“In a way, we’d like to think we cracked the code,” he says.

This work caught the attention of former UNC School of Law Dean Martin Brinkley, who called Brooker in 2018 to offer him a job running the Military and Veterans Law Clinic. It was too good to turn down, according to Brooker.

“When I got offered the clinic, I decided to take cases to help some of the people I was defending when I was in service,” Brooker says. “At that time, there was a lack of understanding of how mental health conditions impacted behavior. And now, we can go back, explain what happened, and ask the military to upgrade their discharge statuses.”

Building cases, changing lives

Research in the clinic involves working closely with clients to help them build a case for discharge status upgrades. This includes reviewing military records, interviewing fellow service members, and understanding the culture of the unit at the time.

“Sometimes you’re searching through thousands of pages of service and treatment records,” says Mya Fernandez, a third-year law student who works in the clinic. “You need to understand the Department of Defense language and the code of regulations for the Veterans Benefits Administration.”

“It’s similar to historical research,” Brooker adds. “You’re looking back at facts from the past to construct a narrative of what happened.”

For veterans who served in the 1960s, for example, the team must research the military’s stance on civil rights, the state of mental health care, and other factors that could have influenced discharge — such as exposure to Agent Orange, a toxic herbicide used during the Vietnam War.

To strengthen their cases, clinic students and staff collaborate with a network of interdisciplinary experts. Kimberly Tran, a licensed clinical psychologist and adjunct professor in the clinic, guides students to develop mental health arguments. They also consult with providers from Carolina’s Transforming Health and Resilience in Veterans Program on traumatic brain injuries and work with addiction specialists to address substance use issues.

“Professor Brooker not only helps us learn the unique ways this study of law works, but gives us the agency to represent our clients,” Jillian Foye, another student in the clinic, says. “There’s this phrase in law we hear often: Be a zealous advocate for your client. Professor Brooker truly embodies this. He cares so deeply about all clients within the clinic. And he makes it a point to help us have that same kind of energy.”

As energy and tech sectors accelerate, organizations and employers are racing to prepare Detroit’s workforce for jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago. Workforce researchers note that tech-enabled roles across industries are growing faster than traditional pathways, raising the stakes for cities working to ensure residents have equitable access to these opportunities.

How does Detroit build a workforce that is both future-ready and deeply rooted in community—one that reflects the city’s diversity, grit, and entrepreneurial spirit?

In this episode of DisruptEd, host Ron Stefanski sits down with Per Scholas’ Executive Vice President, Ken Walker, and Detroit Managing Director, Laura Chavez, during the PowerUp Detroit workforce conference. Together, they explore the innovations, partnerships, cultural dynamics, and opportunities reshaping tech education and career access in Detroit.

Highlights from the Conversation

Detroit’s workforce momentum is real: From human-centered workforce strategies to deeper employer collaboration, leaders across the region are co-designing solutions that meet community needs—especially in the energy and tech sectors.

Community movements like Black Tech Saturdays are rewriting the narrative: Grassroots innovation proves that when there’s no seat at the table, Detroiters build their own—and create pathways for underrepresented talent to enter and lead in tech.

Per Scholas is reimagining tech training for the modern learner: With more than 25 career tracks and flexible delivery models, the organization is expanding training access while customizing programs to Detroit’s culture, employers, and industry needs.

Ken Walker is the Executive Vice President at Per Scholas, where he has been a driving force in the organization’s national growth since joining in 2005.

Expanded transformer factory

Hitachi Energy is carrying out a comprehensive expansion of the transformer factory in Ludvika, which represents one of the largest investments ever at the site. The expanded factory will have an area of 20,000 m² and is designed to significantly increase capacity and enable the production of more large power transformers (AC and DC) worldwide.

The expanded factory will significantly increase the production capacity for large power transformers by approximately 40%. The factory will receive new, state-of-the-art equipment and improved production flows, including separate unloading areas for trains and trucks to streamline logistics. This expansion will create approximately 300 new jobs, and recruitment and training of personnel has already started. A dedicated Training Center has also been established to ensure structured and safe training for new employees. The project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027.

“Electric co-ops use RUS loans to help finance infrastructure that provides reliable, affordable service to more than 42 million consumer-members in rural communities throughout America,” Thomas said.
The RUS Electric Loan Program dates back to 1936, when Congress passed the Rural Electrification Act that created electric co-ops.

The $500 million boost was approved as part of the deal that Congress reached to reopen the federal government after a record 45-day shutdown. Lawmakers passed fiscal 2026 spending bills for three federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its RUS programs. President Donald Trump signed the package into law Nov. 12.

NRECA and electric co-ops pushed for the funding increase and will continue to advocate for more money for the program after the current spending bill ends on Sept. 30, said Hill Thomas, NRECA vice president for legislative affairs.

“Electric co-ops use RUS loans to help finance infrastructure that provides reliable, affordable service to more than 42 million consumer-members in rural communities throughout America,” Thomas said. “The funding increase approved by Congress will help co-ops expand their systems to keep up with rising demand for electricity.”

Co-ops also help reduce the federal deficit by paying interest on those loans to the U.S. Treasury, Thomas said. In 2024, they paid nearly $200 million in interest.

The RUS Electric Loan Program dates back to 1936, when Congress passed the Rural Electrification Act that created electric co-ops. RUS offers loans to not-for-profit co-ops at low interest rates.

“Many co-ops rely on these loans to modernize their systems without having to raise rates dramatically to pay for the improvements,” Thomas said.

As part of the deal to reopen the government, Congress also extended the existing Farm Bill for another year, through Sept. 30, 2026. Lawmakers last passed a five-year Farm Bill in 2018. They have been unable to agree on a new one, opting instead to extend the 2018 legislation each year for the past three years.

Losing those protections could affect drinking water for millions of Americans.
Those are the ones that sit dry for most of the year but fill up after rainfall or snowmelt, providing more than half of the water flowing through most river systems used in our drinking water.
“Wetlands are sort of the unsung heroes of the planet because they store carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change,” Maxine told me.
The proposal could affect up to 55 million acres of wetlands — roughly the area of Utah.","In a new proposal, the Trump administration wants to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, making it easier to pollute them. Losing those protections could affect drinking water for millions of Americans.

The proposal, should it be finalized in the coming months, would deliver a victory to businesses and industries that want to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, which Congress passed to protect all “waters of the United States.” The beneficiaries could be real estate developers eager to build on shorelines, farmers with fields that run along waterways and manufacturers who make petrochemicals in vast factories set on tidal marshes.

“Today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief” from those businesses and landowners, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator said. But what about the rest of the country?

My colleague Maxine Joselow, a climate policy reporter, covered the announcement of the proposal, which could exclude from federal protection wetlands that sit beside what are known as “intermittent” or “ephemeral” streams. Those are the ones that sit dry for most of the year but fill up after rainfall or snowmelt, providing more than half of the water flowing through most river systems used in our drinking water.

“Wetlands are sort of the unsung heroes of the planet because they store carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change,” Maxine told me. “They also provide food, shelter and breeding grounds for a variety of species, including endangered species like the Florida panther and the whooping crane.” They not only provide drinking water, but they also protect against flooding by absorbing tidal surges during storms.

The environmentalist response

Environmentalists are ripping mad. The proposal could affect up to 55 million acres of wetlands — roughly the area of Utah.

The disagreement comes down to a debate over what constitutes “waters of the United States,” which Maxine told me is known by water policy nerds as WOTUS. The Obama administration widened the scope of the Clean Water Act to protect the headwaters of rivers and smaller streams that aren’t always full of water. (A farmers’ advocacy group ran an ad campaign featuring rubber ducks to protest the E.P.A.’s definition: “If you can’t #FloatUS, it’s not a WOTUS,” the ads declared.) In Trump’s first term, the E.P.A. repealed that rule. Then, a Supreme Court ruling in 2023 made it hard again for Democratic administrations to strengthen the protections.

And now many more acres of waterways may not be either. The National Association of Home Builders cheered the possibility, Maxine said. The group’s chairman told her the administration’s proposal would help in “reducing regulatory red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country.”

Beyond wetlands

Trump has repeatedly said he wants “clean air and clean water.” But several decisions are expected to have the opposite effect, Maxine said.

Last month, the government said it would open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling. And just last week the administration announced that drilling would also be allowed in a pristine, remote stretch of tundra and wetlands in the northern part of the state that is among the Arctic’s most important wildlife habitats.

Why? Officials say that environmental concerns should not necessarily supersede the needs of the nation’s economy. The decision to drill in Alaska, for instance, would “unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” according to Doug Burgum, the secretary of the interior.

For the first time, researchers have devised a technique to track the world’s most famous insect migration. They’re outfitting monarch butterflies with featherweight radio tags, powered by the sun, to track their journeys to winter colonies in Mexico. The tags weigh just 60 milligrams (about as much as a grain of cooked rice).

The tech could shed light on the poorly understood life cycles of hundreds of butterfly species, plus bees and other insects, at a time when many are declining. “There’s nothing that’s not amazing about this,” said Cheryl Schultz, a butterfly scientist at Washington State University.

It’s good news for insect enthusiasts, too: A free app lets you follow the progress of individual butterflies. Many are coasting over cities and suburbs; they’re finding pollinator gardens and stopping in winter hideaways.

Today’s $912 million is the first concrete allocation from that commitment, and it’s going exactly where market demand exists—hybrid production capacity.
The real question now is how long Detroit’s Big Three can sustain their EV losses while Toyota expands profitable hybrid production.","Toyota announced a $912 million investment across five U.S. manufacturing plants to expand hybrid vehicle production capacity, creating 252 new jobs and marking the first U.S. production of hybrid-electric Corollas. The investment, revealed Tuesday, comes just six weeks after the federal EV tax credit expiration sent competitors’ pure-electric strategies into freefall.

The timing couldn’t be more strategic. While General Motors lays off thousands and idles battery plants, Ford discusses canceling the F-150 Lightning, and Stellantis indefinitely delays facilities, Toyota is expanding manufacturing capacity for the hybrid technology it never abandoned—even when critics mocked the approach as backward-looking.

Investment Spreads Across Five Southern Plants

Toyota’s manufacturing expansion allocates funding to facilities in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Missouri, with production beginning in 2027 and 2028.

West Virginia’s Buffalo plant receives the largest allocation at $453 million, adding 80 jobs to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles, and rear motor stators. The facility currently produces over one million engines, transmissions, and hybrid transaxles annually.

Kentucky’s Georgetown plant—Toyota’s largest facility globally—gets $204.4 million and 82 jobs for an all-new machining line producing four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines. The plant can assemble up to 700,000 powertrain units annually and employs nearly 10,000 team members.

Mississippi’s Blue Springs plant will receive $125 million to begin producing hybrid-electric Corollas, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled in the United States. The plant currently employs 2,400 workers.

Tennessee’s Jackson casting plant receives $71.4 million and 33 jobs to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases, housings, and engine blocks. Three new production lines will increase capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually.

Missouri’s Troy casting plant gets $57.1 million and 57 jobs for a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles, increasing plant capacity by more than 200,000 cylinder heads annually.

Part Of Broader $10 Billion U.S. Commitment

The $912 million represents the first concrete allocation from Toyota’s $10 billion additional investment plan announced November 13, when the automaker opened its $13.9 billion North Carolina battery plant. That facility produces batteries primarily for hybrid vehicles—not pure EVs—positioning Toyota perfectly for the post-subsidy market.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations at Toyota Motor North America.

Electrified vehicles, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and all-electric models, now account for nearly 50% of Toyota’s U.S. sales. The company currently assembles about half the vehicles it sells in the U.S., with North American facilities producing more than three-quarters of vehicles sold domestically.

Strategic Timing Amid Competitor Retreat

The investment arrives as the American automotive landscape undergoes a dramatic transformation following the September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. Congress eliminated the incentive through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” fundamentally altering EV economics overnight.

October EV sales collapsed 24% compared to September as buyers confronted the full cost of electric vehicles without subsidies. General Motors announced it would lay off more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities, with CFO Paul Jacobson stating the company expects “EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly.”

Ford’s F-150 Lightning faces potential cancellation with production halted indefinitely. The company’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025, contributing to $13 billion in cumulative EV losses since 2023.

Ram parent Stellantis canceled plans for a fully electric Ram 1500 earlier this year, pivoting instead to an extended-range EV that includes a gas engine.

Validating Multi-Pathway Strategy Critics Dismissed

Toyota’s investment validates a strategy the company maintained despite criticism from EV advocates who argued the automaker was moving too slowly on electrification. Chairman Akio Toyoda has long advocated for diversifying investments across multiple powertrain technologies rather than betting exclusively on battery-electric vehicles.

“There are many ways to climb the mountain that is achieving carbon neutrality,” Toyoda said at the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, defending the company’s approach as competitors rushed toward pure-EV futures.

The company has been methodically converting models to hybrid-only versions since at least 2024. The 2025 Camry is available exclusively as a hybrid, while the Land Cruiser and Sienna minivan already offer only hybrid powertrains. Toyota’s hybrid sales skyrocketed from 9% of total sales in 2018 to 37% by mid-2023.

Hybrid technology typically adds less than $2,000 to a vehicle’s retail price while offering more power than gasoline-only counterparts and avoiding the range anxiety and charging infrastructure dependency that has deterred mainstream EV buyers.

EVXL’s Take

Toyota’s $912 million hybrid investment isn’t just another manufacturing announcement—it’s a vindication tour. This is the automaker that was mocked for being “behind” on EVs, criticized for its cautious approach, and accused of climate obstruction for not abandoning internal combustion engines fast enough. Turns out Toyota was reading the market while competitors were reading government policy documents.

We’ve been tracking this exact trajectory since the tax credit expiration was first proposed in June 2025. When the $28 billion Battery Belt started collapsing into ghost towns of stalled construction sites and mass layoffs, Toyota’s North Carolina battery plant was opening at full capacity—for hybrids. While GM idled $2 billion in battery facilities and Ford stopped Lightning production with no restart timeline, Toyota announced actual expansion with real jobs making vehicles people actually buy without needing $7,500 in taxpayer subsidies.

The contrast is staggering. Just five days ago, we covered Toyota’s $14 billion North Carolina battery plant opening and its $10 billion five-year commitment. Today’s $912 million is the first concrete allocation from that commitment, and it’s going exactly where market demand exists—hybrid production capacity.

This connects to something Toyota’s chairman said back in October 2023 that seemed controversial at the time: there are many paths up the mountain of carbon neutrality. While American automakers chose the steepest, rockiest path because government subsidies promised to carry them up it, Toyota took the longer but more sustainable route that didn’t require perpetual taxpayer life support.

The real question now is how long Detroit’s Big Three can sustain their EV losses while Toyota expands profitable hybrid production. Ford’s Model E division hemorrhaging $1.4 billion per quarter isn’t sustainable. GM’s 3,400 layoffs and idled plants aren’t a short-term adjustment—they’re a strategic retreat. The American auto industry bet everything on a subsidy-dependent market that evaporated on September 30, 2025, and now they’re paying the price while Toyota quietly builds the vehicles customers actually want.

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroads data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

He blamed opaque processes and bad information for fostering massive backlash among residents — prompting local officials to pull their support and tank projects years into development.

That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”

Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.

Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.

“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.

Soliday, who chairs the Indiana House’s energy committee, said no clapping, booing or signage is allowed during his meetings — and critiqued chaotic local gatherings.

“What we’ve got to do is, (if) somebody goes after an elected official’s wife at the beauty parlor, put them in jail,” he said. “Because we are becoming, quickly devolving into, mob rule.”

Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of energy and natural resources, said data centers and other big energy users could help pay for needed electricity infrastructure.

“Why would we not have them build that?” Jaworowski asked. “Because we need that generation in the state and having a third party pay for it, rather than having our ratepayers pay for it, is just a great opportunity.”

The task force also heard from representatives of other big users, like Steel Dynamics, a member of Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers.

Indiana Manufacturers Association also presented, maintaining that its members are “ready to invest, hire and build” — but only with guaranteed access to reliable and affordable power.

Soliday rebuffed energy supply fears throughout the meeting, calling such comments “disingenuous” and himself “really weary of this.”

Some industrial groups praised the proposal, while environmental groups said it would threaten clean water and worsen flood risk.

Kentucky has already lost huge swaths of its wetlands, which are ""among the most productive ecosystems in the world, comparable to rain forests and coral reefs,"" according to the EPA.

The Trump administration is moving to narrow federal definitions of the nation's waters, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Nov. 17 — a change that would likely exclude many waterways and a vast majority of Kentucky's vital, dwindling wetlands from protections.

The proposed changes come after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a broader interpretation of the Clean Water Act in 2023, in Sackett v. EPA. Kentucky waterway advocates at the time called the ruling ""calamitous,"" and feared it would presage a broader erosion of environmental protections.

The EPA, under President Donald Trump, is now looking to set a new definition of ""waters of the U.S.,"" known colloquially as WOTUS. These rules are meant to delineate which water bodies receive protections under the Clean Water Act and which do not.

The newly proposed definition would leave tens of millions of acres of U.S. wetlands, and likely most of Kentucky's, without Clean Water Act protections by requiring waters to be ""standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.""

Countless smaller waterways could also be cut out of protections, even if they ultimately drain to larger, protected bodies of water.

The proposed changes were praised by the American Farm Bureau, the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry groups as regulatory relief, and quickly denounced by environmental groups as a threat to clean water and healthy ecosystems.

""When finalized, the rule will cut red tape,"" the EPA said in a statement, ""and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.""

Nick Hart, policy director for the Kentucky Waterways Alliance, said the new rules create ""a right to pollute"" for industry to take advantage of, and go further in eroding protections than was needed to comply with the Supreme Court's 2023 decision.

""Based on this rule,"" Hart said, ""it is going to be harder for Kentucky to reach what we would think of as drinkable, swimmable, fishable water.""

Why wetlands matter

Kentucky has more than 320,000 acres of wetlands, according to federal inventories. Under the proposed changes, only about 44,000 acres of those, less than 15%, would meet the standards for Clean Water Act protections, according to an analysis published by the administration.

Kentucky wetlands left without protections under the proposed definitions make up a total acreage larger than the entirety of Jefferson County, based on the federal analysis. By the turn of this century, Kentucky had already lost more than 80% of its historical wetlands, by some estimates.

""Kentucky can't afford to lose many more wetlands,"" Hart said.

Wetlands are crucial for flood control, acting as a sponge during periods of heavy rainfall, and improve water quality by filtering pollutants and trapping sediment. These services save Kentucky millions of dollars annually, according to the state.

More than one-third of threatened and endangered species in the U.S. live exclusively in wetlands, according to the EPA, which extolls wetlands as ""among the most productive ecosystems in the world, comparable to rain forests and coral reefs.""

State and federal agencies, along with The Nature Conservancy and other organizations, have spent considerable resources to protect and restore Kentucky's wetlands, especially in the western half of the state. By curbing protections for these ecosystems, Hart said the EPA is privatizing benefits for developers and other industries, while shifting costs and the burden of environmental harm to the public.

""We're subsidizing entities to go in and fill in wetlands,"" he said, ""and then we use taxpayer dollars or private philanthropy dollars to go and make wetlands in other places to make up for the damage that we have done.""

The new EPA rule ""doesn’t encompass and protect enough of our waters,"" The Nature Conservancy said in a statement, adding, ""permitting efficiencies should not come at the expense of water quality or the many benefits clean water provides.""

Kentucky waterways and communities at risk

In addition to wetlands, countless Kentucky waterways could lose protections under the EPA's narrowed definitions, although it could take time to fully establish the scope of the rules, which are not finalized and will first undergo a public comment process.

For example, ""there are very strong arguments"" that sections of Louisville's beleaguered Beargrass Creek could lose protections under the proposal, according to Hart's interpretation. Many stretches of the creek are funneled through manmade concrete channels, rather than taking the meandering path of a natural waterway.

Ephemeral streams, which only flow during especially wet periods, such as after a heavy rain, may also be cut out of the new definitions. Recent research indicates these streams have an important role in drainage systems and the transport of water and pollutants into larger rivers and water bodies.

The Trump administration's plans to rollback Clean Water Act protections come less than a year after Republicans in the Kentucky General Assembly opted to cede water protection definitions to the federal level. Before the passage of Senate Bill 89 earlier this year, Kentucky maintained its own definition of ""waters of the commonwealth,"" but now mostly defers to the federal definitions, which the EPA is seeking to roll back.

The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet vocally opposed the bill, arguing it would open up groundwater and other resources to pollution and degradation. Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed the legislation, which he said failed to protect water used by more than 1.5 million Kentuckians and would result in more dangerous flooding. The legislature overrode the veto.

The state has long wrestled with water quality issues, and a 2024 state assessment of thousands of miles of Kentucky's rivers found a majority to be impaired, in addition to dozens of lakes and reservoirs. And failing to protect wetlands or keep new development away from waterways could reap disaster as Kentucky sees more extreme rainfall events and historic floods.

""There are a lot of unknowns already about how this is going to play out,"" Hart said. ""What was nice about the prior rules is that they were based on hydrology, and they were based on science, and they were based on how water operates in the real world, as opposed to creating a fiction about how we want water to operate.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PLOU/73786778007-20240422-farmwater-cg-42.jpg?crop=8639,4861,x0,y449&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-18 18:01:21.945203

“Batteries are essential to the clean energy transition, both for energy storage and transport. That’s why it’s critical we keep advancing innovations that improve performance, increase energy density and drive down costs,”

Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to deliver up to twice the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries, enabling longer range and lighter weight for electric vehicles, drones, wearables and other applications. This aligns with the Australian Government’s energy storage strategy, which prioritises technologies that support renewable integration and reduce reliance on imported battery systems.

Li-S Energy CEO and MD Dr Lee Finniear said the funding is a major step towards commercial readiness.

Dr Finniear said,

This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production.

”It will help meet growing demand for lightweight batteries in drones, defence, aerospace and other relevant high-value commercial markets,”

As more renewable energy generation enters the grid, the need for energy storage is increasing. This funding reflects ARENA’s strategic priority to reduce the cost and increase the diversity of technologies available to support the deployment of energy storage in Australia.

This funding has been administered under ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, which is continuously open for applications that address our investment focus areas and involve a renewable energy technology or technologies that increase the supply of, or improve the competitiveness of, renewable energy in Australia.

FCC has been intentional about establishing hauling contracts first to feed into the recycling facilities — and now incinerators — it’s looking to build or add to its portfolio.

This year, the company has made two moves to bring its European waste-to-energy expertise to the U.S. for the first time, with plans to broaden its portfolio.

Ashley Corke is the company’s regional vice president of waste-to-energy in North America. Until September, he served as the general manager for the company’s Eastcroft Energy-from-Waste facility in the United Kingdom. He said the company has learned plenty of lessons from its international facilities that it can apply to the U.S.

“Obviously the business is more mature in Europe compared to the U.S. We’re now just introducing the strategy we’ve had in the rest of the world, in Europe, into the U.S. business,” Corke said.

FCC Group has operated waste-to-energy facilities for about 20 years, and today it has about 13 sites — predominantly in the UK, Spain and Austria, according to Corke. Its North American subsidiary earned its first municipal solid waste collection contract in 2015 in Orange County, Florida. It has since established a presence in seven states, including North Carolina and Texas, with a fleet of roughly 1,200 vehicles.

Corke said the company’s hauling business, which handles waste and recycling for commercial and municipal clients, forms the backbone of its presence. FCC has been intentional about establishing hauling contracts first to feed into the recycling facilities — and now incinerators — it’s looking to build or add to its portfolio.

“Municipalities can get the best value out of a consistent company that can provide all solutions that they may need for waste,” Corke said.

So far, FCC has followed that strategy in two Florida markets. The company acquired in July the South Broward Waste-to-Energy Facility in Fort Lauderdale from Win Waste Innovations. The mass burn combustion facility was built in 1991 and can handle about 824,000 tons of waste annually.

FCC also won a $320.9 million contract in October to operate Pinellas County’s mass burn combustion facility, taking over the contract from Reworld. That facility opened in 1983 and handles about 830,000 to 880,000 tons of waste annually, according to The St. Pete Catalyst.

Corke said FCC’s experience with following strict emissions guidelines in Europe makes the company well equipped to handle pending U.S. regulatory updates and the potential for needed facility upgrades.

The EU last updated its expectations for incinerators in 2019. Those regulations are stricter than U.S. federal rules, which have not been updated for large municipal waste combustors since 2006. But the U.S. EPA circulated a proposal in 2024 with limits more in line with EU rules for pollutants like mercury, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

Given the age of FCC’s Florida facilities, upgrades may be needed. The company has successfully upgraded its European facilities in the past, including one in the U.K. that’s 53 years old, Corke said. He sees no reason the company can’t accomplish the same in the U.S. — as long as it has the support of local governments.

“We’re very aware these are mechanical systems. With the right engineering and the right science, we can make these last 100 years if we need,” he said.

The company has also looked to build new incinerators in the U.S. It’s leading a consortium proposing to build an “EcoPark” in Miami-Dade County, which would include an incinerator plus composting and recycling.

Corke said the company would also look at other regions interested in incineration capacity, including in the Northeast U.S. and in Canada. While FCC so far has followed its European strategy in Florida, the company would be open to bidding on an incinerator contract in markets where it hasn’t yet built out a hauling footprint.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tllYI3Hu-RHBfAPJi0r1gB44alMEPUbTGmVgKXHYUwY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Tb3V0aF9Ccm93YXJkX3Jzei5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-18 15:01:50.926684

TotalEnergies acquires 50% in Czech energy company EPH’s power business

French company aims to grow power business while also increasing oil and gas

Strategy contrasts with Shell and BP that scrapped most renewables plans

LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) – France’s TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) is betting big on power and renewables, positioning itself to ride the global electricity demand wave and offer investors a clear alternative to rivals doubling down on oil and gas.

European oil companies’ strategies have seesawed since 2022, when Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the related sanctions created an energy shock that made governments focus more on near-term energy security than the long-term energy transition.

The changing landscape led Shell (SHEL.L) and BP (BP.L) to ditch plans to plough billions of dollars into renewables and instead refocus on their legacy operations, aligning with U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N).

At the same time, TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne defied investor pressure and largely stuck to a strategy first outlined in 2020 that strikes a balance between growth in core oil and gas operations and diversification into power and renewables.

That strategy was on full display on Monday when TotalEnergies announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in Czech energy company EPH’s Western European power generation platform in a 5.1 billion euro ($5.92 billion) all-stock transaction.

EPH, majority-owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, has more than 14 gigawatts of flexible capacity in operation or under construction, including gas-fired and biomass power plants and battery systems in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Britain.

The deal more than doubles TotalEnergies’ gas and biomass generation capacity to 13.5 GW, making it one of the largest producers in Europe.

The company expects the deal to boost cashflow by $750 million per year over the next five years while also reducing annual capital expenditures by $1 billion to between $14 billion and $16 billion, as the French energy major will not need to invest in building new power capacity.

Renewable power generation

POWER PLAY

TotalEnergies aims to generate 100 to 120 terawatt hours of electricity globally by 2030, compared with 41 TWh in 2024, mainly by expanding solar and wind power. That equates to over 4% of the European Union’s annual consumption.

To be sure, TotalEnergies has slowed investments in renewables and power in recent years in the face of soaring oil and gas prices and weakening returns on solar and wind. The company in September said it will cut annual spending on its integrated power business by 20-40% to between $3 billion and $4 billion.

And TotalEnergies’ power business is still far smaller than its core oil and gas businesses, which accounted for around 88% of adjusted net income of $4.7 billion in the third quarter.

But when it comes to growth rates, power takes the prize. While oil and gas production is expected to increase by 3% per year by 2030, TotalEnergies aims to grow its gross installed renewables power generation three-fold from current levels to 100 GW by the end of the decade.

In Europe alone, following the EPH deal, TotalEnergies aims to grow gas and biomass generation by 40% between now and 2030 to 35 TWh and more than triple current renewables and batteries capacity over the same period to 20 GW and 7 GW, respectively.

By comparison, Shell and BP have sold or spun off most of their renewable power generation assets in recent years. Shell had a mere 4 GW of net renewable generation by the end of September, compared with 19 GW for TotalEnergies. Exxon and Chevron have modest plans to invest in gas-fired power generation in the United States.

Italian energy group Eni (ENI.MI), like its French rival, has stuck to its energy transition strategy, though it took a unique path by spinning off its renewables and retail arm into a standalone business to attract external investment. The business, Plenitude, aims to almost triple its renewables generation capacity to 15 GW by 2030.

Oil majors’ share performance

‘IT TAKES TIME’

Investors have so far responded coolly to TotalEnergies’ strategy. Its shares have risen some 14% since 2020, compared with gains of 67% for Exxon, 29% for Chevron and 27% for Shell, while BP’s shares lost 3% over the period.

Pouyanne recently said he aims to increase TotalEnergies’ power business “step by step” in order to keep pace with the expected growth in electricity consumption from electric vehicles and data centres.

“The transition will happen, but it takes time,” Pouyanne told the Energy Intelligence Forum in October.

TotalEnergies has never had the flashiest clean energy strategy – as it has always sought to continue growing its legacy oil and gas business even as it pivots to power and renewables. But that steady realism may be just what the energy transition needs.

Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, an energy-dedicated software-as-a-service company that leverages generative artificial intelligence (AI) across its solutions, released its latest U.S. power capacity expansion outlook on November 18. The report is based on the group’s proprietary load forecasts, interconnection queue analytics, and technology cost curves.

EIR projects a 57% increase in installed U.S. power capacity by 2050. The group said it expects rapid solar energy growth through 2028, despite a more difficult regulatory environment. EIR said it expects remaining coal-fired generation will be replaced by natural gas, and also nuclear power, with what the group said would be “steady long-term growth led by the ramp-up of the U.S. nuclear industry.” EIR said renewable energy installations are expected to peak in 2028, but will remain competitive into the future, “supported by ongoing demand for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and low costs.”

“Our analysis shows the U.S. grid is entering a transformative period, with solar installations surging in the near term and nuclear power taking a leading role in the decades ahead. The retirement of coal and the rise of new technologies will reshape regional generation mixes and drive innovation in grid reliability and energy sustainability,” said Juan Arteaga, PhD, a principal analyst at EIR.

Key Takeaways

EIR said installed U.S. power capacity is forecast to grow 57% by 2050 (Figure 1 above), with the next quarter-century defined by three eras: rapid solar energy growth (2025–2035), coal replacement (2035–2040), and steady nuclear expansion (2040–2050). The group said it expects U.S. coal-fired power will be fully retired by 2040, even with current federal government policies propping up the sector despite continued poor economics for coal-burning power plants. The researchers said they expect coal-fired capacity will be evenly replaced by natural gas and nuclear power generation.

The group noted that the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which oversees the power grid in 15 states from the Upper Midwest to the Gulf Coast, will experience more than 25 GW of fuel switching. EIR said wind energy, natural gas, and nuclear power “are the most load-sensitive technologies, with capacity buildout remaining relatively inelastic to changes in demand. Battery storage and gas peaker plants will play a crucial role in grid reliability, while combined-cycle natural gas and nuclear plants provide essential baseload support.”

Analysts Agree With Findings

Energy industry analysts who have spoken with POWER generally agree with EIR’s analysis, based on their own forecasts for U.S. power generation for 2026 and beyond. Jim Dawe, vice president and general manager of Generac, in an email said, “Hybrid systems will go mainstream. Solar, storage, generators, and smart controls will converge into seamless home-energy ecosystems as outages and rising rates make resilience the top priority.”

Rex Liu, vice president of product management for Generic, told POWER: “Installers will become full-stack energy advisors. Solar companies will expand into HVAC, storage, smart home tech, and backup power, evolving from single-product sellers to comprehensive home-energy providers.”

EIR’s findings in part are similar to those in a recent report from Bloomberg NEF (BNEF), which noted in its latest New Energy Outlook that renewable energy resources (and electric vehicles)—despite “points of resistance,” including higher interest rates, volatile costs, and rising trade barriers—”continue to show advantageous and improving economics, which ultimately drive their adoption to unprecedented levels.” The group said generation from renewables globally rises 84% between now and 2030, “and then doubles again by 2050.” The group forecasts that the “share of coal, gas and oil in the [global] power system drops to 25% in 2050, from 58% in 2024,” which “results in a 21% reduction in absolute fossil-fired generation levels. Between now and 2035, some 6.9 TW of solar is constructed globally, alongside 2.6 TW of wind.”

BNEF said coal-fired generation will continue to decline, and noted that “most of the incremental coal capacity and one-third of the gas capacity associated with data-center demand is from existing plants that avoid or delay retirement.” The group said global coal consumption falls 25% over the next decade.

A coalition of more than 60 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, and South Korea, are part of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA). The group in an announcement Monday at the COP30 climate talks in Belém, Brazil, reaffirmed commitments to phase out coal-fired generation over the next several years.

Kim Sung-hwan, minister of Climate, Energy and Environment for South Korea—which joined the coalition on Monday—said: “By joining the PPCA, we are demonstrating the Republic of Korea’s commitment to accelerating a just and clean energy transition. Through the Alliance, we will kickstart our coal phase-out, as well as help the Alliance advance the coal transition worldwide. The shift from coal to clean power is not only essential for the climate. It will also help both the Republic of Korea, and all other countries increase our energy security, boost the competitiveness of our businesses, and create thousands of jobs in the industries of the future.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3-1024x576.png,N,,2025-11-18 14:00:19.110286

The new Energy Saver North Carolina program is designed to make it more affordable for low- to moderate-income households to install energy- and cost-saving measures such as heat pumps, electrical panels and insulation.

In January, the N. C. Dept. Environmental Quality (DEQ) launched Energy Saver NC, which includes more than $208 million for federally funded rebates.

Energy Saver NC includes two programs: Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR). As part of HOMES, eligible households can receive up to $16,000 for home efficiency improvements, such as air sealing or energy-efficient HVAC units. The HEAR program covers up to $14,000 for high-efficiency electrical appliances like heat pump water heaters and electric stoves.

“Energy Saver NC will help Columbus County families who need it most save money on utility bills, make their homes healthier and more comfortable, reduce emissions and improve our air quality,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “This vital program will help improve the lives of North Carolinians on a daily basis, from efficient new electric appliances to installation of new heating and cooling systems.”

North Carolina is the first state in the nation to fully launch both rebate programs at the same time, and the 12th nationwide to implement a rebate program.

Rebate amounts depend on household income and projects’ modeled energy savings. Initially, Energy Saver NC is focusing on single-family, owner-occupied or rented housing, particularly those in high energy-burdened, disadvantaged regions and in areas with storm impacts.

The program is currently open to 39 counties. Residents from across the state may start their application before the program opens in their county. The program will continue to open to more counties across North Carolina in the future.

Single-family homeowners making less than 80 percent of their area median income (AMI) may be eligible for full rebates. Rebates at lower amounts will be available for moderate-income homeowners earning between 80 percent and 150 percent of their AMI.

Four-person households in Columbus County earning up to $61,100 could be eligible for a full rebate. Single-family homeowners and tenants, with their owners’ permission, may apply.

Once income eligibility is confirmed, households that selected the HOMES program will need to schedule a free home energy assessment. Assessors will help households understand how their homes use energy and provide a list of qualified energy efficiency improvements.

Households must use an Energy Saver NC contractor to complete the work. The program’s partners are registered, licensed and trained. These partnerships are directly creating new business, jobs, and boosting Columbus County’s local economy.

After reviewing quotes, households will approve the projects and their prices with the rebate applied. Contractors will then submit the project to the Energy Saver NC program for approval. Once approved, the contractor will complete the work.

Households may apply online, by email, phone or mail. Energy Saver NC also has a customer care team available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 866.998.8555.

The new name reflects the company’s evolution from the world’s leading solar-tracking manufacturer into a broader platform offering an integrated portfolio of advanced technologies and services for utility-scale solar power plants.

Nextpower now provides a connected ecosystem that spans structural, electrical and digital solutions across the full lifecycle of advanced power plants—from design and construction to operation and maintenance. As part of its expanding technology platform, the company also revealed the development of a new line of large-scale power conversion systems (PCS), with first shipments expected in 2026.

“Our customers are looking for coherent, integrated solutions that install faster, deliver stronger performance, and operate more reliably throughout their lifetime,” said Dan Shugar, Founder and CEO of Nextpower.

“In recent years, we have implemented a consistent strategy to broaden our portfolio and build a comprehensive technology platform that delivers significant benefits across the solar value chain,” he added.

“Our new name reflects this transformation,” Shugar continued. “Nextpower builds on decades of leadership in solar tracking to create a market-leading integrated technology platform that supports the world’s most advanced clean-energy systems. We are now in a global electricity super-cycle, with solar power adding more capacity than any other energy source, at the lowest cost. As we expand into PCS, robotics and artificial intelligence, we are enabling solutions that meet the scale, reliability and complexity requirements of today’s utility-scale solar plants.”

As part of its Capital Markets Day, held today, Nextpower reaffirmed its outlook for fiscal year 2026 and presented its guidance for fiscal year 2027, along with long-term financial targets. These include projected revenues of USD 4.8–5.6 billion for FY2030, with around one-third expected to come from products and services outside the solar-tracking segment.

“Our multi-year financial objectives reflect our confidence in Nextpower’s growth trajectory and the strength of our business model,” noted Chuck Boynton, Chief Financial Officer. “We anticipate sustained revenue growth, stronger cash generation and continued investment in expansion, while maintaining healthy margins and a robust balance sheet through disciplined execution and operational efficiency.”

The rebrand comes at a critical moment for the global energy sector. Electricity demand is accelerating, driven by the rapid rise of AI and data-centre loads, electric transport and building electrification. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), US data centres will consume more electricity than the country’s entire energy-intensive manufacturing sector combined by 2030. At the same time, solar energy has become the world’s lowest-cost and fastest-growing source of new electricity generation.

Governments worldwide are therefore emphasising the importance of local supply chains, an area where Nextpower has invested for more than a decade through domestic manufacturing of steel, electronics and components.

,EPA,2025-11-18 17:26:38+00:00,RVBusiness - Breaking RV Industry News - Delivering RV Industry News,RVIA: EPA Proposes New Exemptions From PFAS Reporting - RV Business,RV Business,,,,,https://rvbusiness.com/rvia-epa-proposes-new-exemptions-from-pfas-reporting/,"Currently, under the Toxic Substances Control Act’s section 8(a)(7), manufacturers (including importers) are required to report certain PFAS data in any year from 2011 to 2022.
The RV Industry Association and its members have consistently advocated for common-sense changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act 8(a)(7) look-back reporting rule.
The proposed rule includes several exemptions and modifications that would maintain important reporting requirements on PFAS while exempting certain low-value activities impacting the RV industry.
The proposed rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as December for a 45-day public comment period.
The RV Industry Association will keep members updated on the progress of the rule.","On Monday, Nov. 10, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule to improve the utility and reduce the regulatory burden of its PFAS reporting regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), according to a News & Insights report from the RV Industry Association (RVIA).

Currently, under the Toxic Substances Control Act’s section 8(a)(7), manufacturers (including importers) are required to report certain PFAS data in any year from 2011 to 2022. The 11-year look-back rule has been criticized for imposing a significant compliance burden on the industry without demonstrating how it advances environmental protection goals.

The RV Industry Association and its members have consistently advocated for common-sense changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act 8(a)(7) look-back reporting rule. This summer, the RV Industry Association participated in multiple in-person meetings with EPA leadership to outline the challenges of collecting chemical composition data on products sourced across a diverse and multi-tiered global supply chain.

The proposed rule includes several exemptions and modifications that would maintain important reporting requirements on PFAS while exempting certain low-value activities impacting the RV industry.

The proposed exemptions include:

Imported articles;

PFAS manufactured (including imported) in mixtures or products at concentrations 0.1% or lower;

Certain byproducts;

Impurities;

Research and development chemicals; and

Non-isolated intermediates.

Under the imported articles exemption, RV Industry Association members and suppliers who import finished products from overseas sources would not be required to collect and report PFAS information on those products to the EPA.

Further, products that contain de minimis levels of PFAS (less than 0.1%) would be excluded from reporting. These two exemptions alone would exempt much of the RV industry’s reporting obligations under the Toxic Substances Control Act, eliminating significant costs and regulatory burden on RV manufacturers and suppliers.

The proposed rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as December for a 45-day public comment period. If finalized, the data submission period will begin 60 days after the rule’s effective date and will be open for a 90-day period. The RV Industry Association will keep members updated on the progress of the rule.

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez.
The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).
Solutions from labs big and small Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects.
The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups.","“We’re here to talk about really substantive changes, and we want you to be a participant in that,” said Desirée Plata, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor of Climate and Energy in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, at Energizing@MIT: the MIT Energy Initiative’s (MITEI) Annual Research Conference that was held on Sept. 9-10.

Plata’s words resonated with the 150-plus participants from academia, industry, and government meeting in Cambridge for the conference, whose theme was “tackling emerging energy challenges.” Meeting such challenges and ultimately altering the trajectory of global climate outcomes requires partnerships, speakers agreed.

“We have to be humble and open,” said Giacomo Silvestri, chair of Eniverse Ventures at Eni, in a shared keynote address. “We cannot develop innovation just focusing on ourselves and our competencies … so we need to partner with startups, venture funds, universities like MIT and other public and private institutions.”

Added his Eni colleague, Annalisa Muccioli, head of research and technology, “The energy transition is a race we can win only by combining mature solutions ready to deploy, together with emerging technologies that still require acceleration and risk management.”

Research targets

In a conference that showcased a suite of research priorities MITEI has identified as central to ensuring a low-carbon energy future, participants shared both promising discoveries and strategies for advancing proven technologies in the face of shifting political winds and policy uncertainties.

One panel focused on grid resiliency — a topic that has moved from the periphery to the center of energy discourse as climate-driven disruptions, cyber threats, and the integration of renewables challenge legacy systems. A dramatic case in point: the April 2025 outage in Spain and Portugal that left millions without power for eight to 15 hours.

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez. While he pinpointed technical problems with reactive power and voltage control behind the system collapse, Duenas-Martinez also called out a lack of transmission capacity with Central Europe and out-of-date operating procedures, and recommended better preparation and communication among transmission systems and utility operators.

“You can’t plan for every single eventuality, which means we need to broaden the portfolio of extreme events we prepare for,” noted Jennifer Pearce, vice president at energy company Avangrid. “We are making the system smarter, stronger, and more resilient to better protect from a wide range of threats such as storms, flooding, and extreme heat events.” Pearce noted that Avangrid’s commitment to deliver safe, reliable power to its customers necessitates “meticulous emergency planning procedures.”

The resiliency of the electric grid under greatly increased demand is an important motivation behind MITEI’s September 2025 launch of the Data Center Power Forum, which was also announced during the annual research conference. The forum will include research projects, webinars, and other content focused on energy supply and storage, grid design and management, infrastructure, and public and economic policy related to data centers. The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).

Storage and transportation: Staggering challenges

Meeting climate goals to decarbonize the world by 2050 requires building around 300 terawatt-hours of storage, according to Asegun Henry, a professor in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering. “It’s an unbelievably enormous problem people have to wrap their minds around,” he said. Henry has been developing a high-temperature thermal energy storage system he has nicknamed “sun in a box.” His system uses liquid metal and graphite to hold electricity as heat and then convert it back to electricity, enabling storage anywhere from five to 500 hours.

“At the end of the day, storage provides a service, and the type of technology that you need is a function of the service that you value the most,” said Nestor Sepulveda, commercial lead for advanced energy investments and partnerships at Google. “I don't think there is one winner-takes-all type of market here.”

Another panel explored sustainable fuels that could help decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking. Randall Field, MITEI’s director of research, noted that sustainably produced drop-in fuels — fuels that are largely compatible with existing engines — “could eliminate potentially trillions of dollars of cost for fleet replacement and for infrastructure build-out, while also helping us to accelerate the rate of decarbonization of the transportation sectors.""

Erik G. Birkerts is the chief growth officer of LanzaJet, which produces a drop-in, high-energy-density aviation fuel derived from agricultural residue and other waste carbon sources. “The key to driving broad sustainable aviation fuel adoption is solving both the supply-side challenge through more production and the demand-side hurdle by reducing costs,” he said.

“We think a good policy framework [for sustainable fuels] would be something that is technology-neutral, does not exclude any pathways to produce, is based on life cycle accounting practices, and on market mechanisms,” said Veronica L. Robertson, energy products technology portfolio manager at ExxonMobil.

MITEI plans a major expansion of its research on sustainable fuels, announcing a two-year study, “The future of fuels: Pathways to sustainable transportation,” starting in early 2026. According to Field, the study will analyze and assess biofuels and e-fuels.

Solutions from labs big and small

Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects. A panel on carbon capture in power generation featured three takes on the topic: Devin Shaw, commercial director of decarbonization technologies at Shell, described post-combustion carbon capture in power plants using steam for heat recovery; Jan Marsh, a global program lead at Siemens Energy, discussed deploying novel materials to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air; and Jeffrey Goldmeer, senior director of technology strategy at GE Vernova, explained integrating carbon capture into gas-powered turbine systems.

During a panel on vehicle electrification, Brian Storey, vice president of energy and materials at the Toyota Research Institute, provided an overview of Toyota’s portfolio of projects for decarbonization, including solid-state batteries, flexible manufacturing lines, and grid-forming inverters to support EV charging infrastructure.

A session on MITEI seed fund projects revealed promising early-stage research inside MIT’s own labs. A new process for decarbonizing the production of ethylene was presented by Yogesh Surendranath, Donner Professor of Science in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Materials Science and Engineering assistant professor Aristide Gumyusenge also discussed the development of polymers essential for a new kind of sodium-ion battery.

Shepherding bold, new technologies like these from academic labs into the real world cannot succeed without ample support and deft management. A panel on paths to commercialization featured the work of Iwnetim Abate, Chipman Career Development Professor and assistant professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who has spun out a company, Addis Energy, based on a novel geothermal process for harvesting clean hydrogen and ammonia from subsurface, iron-rich rocks. Among his funders: ARPA-E and MIT’s own The Engine Ventures.

The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups. “A mere 4.2 percent of all the patents that are actually prosecuted in the world are ever commercialized, which seems like a shocking number,” said Andrew Inglis, an entrepreneur working with Proto Ventures to translate geothermal discoveries into businesses. “Can’t we do this better? Let’s do this better!”

Geopolitical hazards

Throughout the conference, participants often voiced concern about the impacts of competition between the United States and China. Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and an expert on China’s energy landscape, delivered the sobering news in her keynote address: “U.S. competitiveness in low-carbon technologies has eroded in nearly every category,” she said. “The Chinese are winning the clean tech race.”

China enjoys a 51 percent share in global wind turbine manufacture and 75 percent in solar modules. It also controls low-carbon supply chains that much of the world depends on. “China is getting so dominant that nobody can carve out a comparative advantage in anything,” said Gallagher. “China is just so big, and the scale is so huge that the Chinese can truly conquer markets and make it very hard for potential competitors to find a way in.”

And for the United States, the problem is “the seesaw of energy policy,” she says. “It’s incredibly difficult for the private sector to plan and to operate, given the lack of predictability and policy here.”

Nevertheless, Gallagher believes the United States still has a chance of at least regaining competitiveness, by setting up a stable, bipartisan energy policy, rebuilding domestic manufacturing and supply chains; providing consistent fiscal incentives; attracting and retaining global talent; and fostering international collaboration.

The conference shone a light on one such collaboration: a China-U.S. joint venture to manufacture lithium iron phosphate batteries for commercial vehicles in the United States. The venture brings together Eve Energy, a Chinese battery technology and manufacturing company; Daimler, a global commercial vehicle manufacturer; PACCAR Inc., a U.S.-based truck manufacturer; and Accelera, the zero-emissions business of Cummins Inc. “Manufacturing batteries in the U.S. makes the supply chain more robust and reduces geopolitical risks,” said Mike Gerty, of PACCAR.

While she acknowledged the obstacles confronting her colleagues in the room, Plata nevertheless concluded her remarks as a panel moderator with some optimism: “I hope you all leave this conference and look back on it in the future, saying I was in the room when they actually solved some of the challenges standing between now and the future that we all wish to manifest.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202510/mitei-annual-conference.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 13:04:03.179410

This sizable investment, the initial stage of a planned $10 billion USD investment by the Japanese marque into its US base before 2030, will also lead to a number of new jobs being created at Toyota, although, bizarrely, not as many of you might think.

$912 Million Investment To Be Split Across Five US Plants

Earlier this month, and after the call was made to “go out and buy a Toyota,” the Japanese marque confirmed that “up to $10 billion” USD would be invested into its US infrastructure over the next four years. This, incidentally, is on top of a new, $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina, production of which has now begun. The $912 million total marks the first step in that plan, with the investment set to be spread across five states in southern America.

Of the five, Toyota West Virginia gets the bulk of that expenditure – $453 million – which will be used to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. Toyota Kentucky is next up, with $204.4 million dedicated to the installation of a new machining line for four-cylinder hybrid powerplants, while Toyota Mississippi ($125 million) will oversee production of the hybrid-electric Corolla, marking the first time an electrified version of the staple model will be assembled in the US.

Toyota Tennessee ($71.4 million) and Toyota Missouri ($57.1 million) will look to increase production of new hybrid transaxle cases/engine blocks and cylinder heads by “nearly 500,000” and “more than 200,000” units, respectively. Most of the above investments are expected to be completed by 2027. This near $1 billion investment is set to create a very specific 252 new jobs, the majority of these, 82, will open in Kentucky, with 80 set to be available in West Virginia.

Why General Motors Should Be Worried

Encouraging as this news is for hybrid Toyota fans in North America, this news will probably lead to a few mopped foreheads in Detroit as well. The Japanese marque, after all, is the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the US behind only General Motors, and, while demand for electric vehicles has dropped significantly – not aided by the US government’s U-turn on EV subsidies and customer rebates – Toyota’s hybrid models continue to sell strongly. Independent research by Motor Intelligence claims that, as of Q3 this year, the Japanese marque leads the US hybrid market with at least a 51% market share. All signs point strongly towards Toyota chipping away at GM’s US monopoly.

Ironically though, despite this massive new investment, and given the fallout from the US government’s unpredictable tariff roll-out, Toyota is planning to take a very conservative approach to its model line-up, with vehicle life-cycles set to be extended from seven to nine years. A Toyota spokesman even confirmed recently to HotCars’ sister publication CarBuzz that the brand’s older platforms are still “working well for us,” a potentially significant cost-saving measure.",https://static0.hotcarsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/toyota-hybrid-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-18 13:04:39.917590

Climate change is also a health crisis — these 3 graphics explain why Indeed, what world is Gates living in?
Human-caused climate change will exacerbate pandemics, as it did for COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria.","Fifteen years ago, my friend and mentor, climate scientist Stephen Schneider, said something that has stuck with me. When it comes to climate change, the “end of the world” and “good for you” are “the two lowest-probability outcomes”.

Extreme heat harms health — what is the human body’s limit?

Steve’s aphorism feels especially prescient today. As the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) plays out in Belém, Brazil, this month, misleading climate messaging in the media espouses both these extremes.

At one end, take the actions of billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. On 28 October, he astounded climate advocates by publishing a manifesto arguing that the climate crisis is less urgent than other major problems that humanity faces (see go.nature.com/23xed). Jarringly, its publication coincided with the devastating Jamaican landfall of potentially the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, an event that human-caused warming made more likely to happen.

Gates wasn’t implying that global warming is “good for you”, but his arguments are adjacent to that sentiment: there has already been enough progress on climate, and we should instead prioritize addressing what he feels are more pressing issues, such as poverty and disease.

Despite substantial criticism from me and other climate specialists that this presented a false trade-off between climate action and public health, Gates dug in his heels. “What world do they live in?” he said in an interview with the news outlet Axios, telling reporters that he would “let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria”.

Climate change is also a health crisis — these 3 graphics explain why

Indeed, what world is Gates living in? The idea that climate action must come at the expense of efforts to address human health is a provable fallacy. In our book Science Under Siege (2025), public-health scientist Peter Hotez at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and I detail how these challenges are, in fact, inseparable. Human-caused climate change will exacerbate pandemics, as it did for COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. How Gates or anyone else proposes to “get rid of malaria” in a rapidly warming world is anyone’s guess. This is a strawman argument.

Gates’ pivot has been celebrated by climate-change downplayers and fossil-fuel proponents in politics, including US President Donald Trump, and in segments of the media, including the newspapers The Wall Street Journal and New York Post — even if Gates has disavowed their characterizations of his position.

Meanwhile, those at the opposite ‘end of the world’ extreme are hardly any more helpful. “It may be too late” announced Robert Hunziker, a freelance writer in Los Angeles, California, just one month ago on the news site Counterpunch.

LENEXA, KAN. (NOV. 18, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the State of Kansas’ request to redesignate the Salina Area from nonattainment to attainment for the 2008 Lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) worked collaboratively with stakeholders to develop strategies to reduce Pb emissions at an industrial facility and bring the Salina Area into attainment with the 2008 Lead (Pb) standard. Today’s approval, following the work by the State and local businesses, reflects the EPA’s commitment to cooperative federalism, pillar three of the Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.

“This achievement represents years of hard work and dedication by KDHE, including collaborating with a local business, to improve air quality in Salina,” said EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy. “We commend KDHE’s efforts to meet their goals to deliver clean air for the community of Salina.”

“We’re proud to share that Saline County is in attainment with the air quality standard for lead,” said KDHE Deputy Secretary of Environment Kate Gleeson. “This important milestone means that the entire State of Kansas now meets all national air quality standards and reflects the dedication and hard work of our staff.”

To redesignate a nonattainment area to attainment, the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to determine the State has met all applicable requirements for the NAAQS. EPA’s final rule details how the Salina Area meets the CAA requirements for redesignation, including a maintenance plan ensuring continued compliance through 2035.

Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages.
With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.","Last week, President Donald Trump caused a media frenzy after he floated the idea that the government should back the creation of a 50-year fixed mortgage.

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes.

""It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,"" posted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). ""In debt forever, in debt for life!""

President Trump ""is creating generational debt,"" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. ""They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'"" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.)

The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to reporting from Politico.

Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea?

""It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,"" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University.

""Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,"" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ""It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.""

The 50 vs The 30

First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move.

In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages.

The typical American homeowner spends less than 12 years in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses.

"" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,"" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. ""I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.""

In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.

""I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,"" Zwick says. ""And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.""

And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree.

And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than 90% of American mortgage holders have one!

The American mortgage market is weird

The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries.

We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a Planet Money episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates.

Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks.

A long time ago, Planet Money interviewed financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as ""a financial Frankenstein's monster"" from the perspective of lenders.

Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, ""I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,"" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University.

"" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,"" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.

It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world.

The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages

There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them.

Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent).

Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation!

The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages

That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much.

But there's more.

If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth.

"" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,"" Gyourko says. "" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.""

Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks.

If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, ""your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,"" says Berger, the economist at Duke. ""No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,"" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house.

""And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,"" Gyourko says. ""So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.""

Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession.

"" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,"" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says.

Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, ""you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,"" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage.

"" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,"" Fairweather says. ""But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.""

Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy

But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates.

One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s.

""The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,"" Gyourko says.

Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy).

That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy.

In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair.

Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality.

""A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,"" Campbell says. ""And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers."" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates.

There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move.

Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been stubbornly high over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years.

"" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,"" Fairweather says. ""So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market. In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.""

Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move.

The real fix for housing affordability

So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage.

The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.

The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem.

""Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,"" Campbell says. ""Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.""

So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64b8ee1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5075x2664+0+359/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F20%2F493e0faf4250a698c0b0da4101c9%2Fgettyimages-2246614323.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 14:00:23.417485

Final Thought The cuts to rooftop solar funding are more than just a budget decision — they are a deeply personal issue for many families.","U.S. Families ‘Mind-Blown’ as Federal Solar Rooftop Funding Is Cut

Many American families are shocked after a major federal program funding rooftop solar was canceled. The cuts come at a time when people are already struggling with high energy bills. Once-promising solar projects are now stranded, leaving homeowners — especially low- and middle-income families — uncertain about their clean energy futures.

What Happened

The “Solar for All” program, originally backed by the U.S. federal government, was canceled, leaving many rooftop solar projects in limbo.

This program had promised up to $7 billion in funding to support more than 7,500 low- and middle-income households installing rooftop solar.

The funding cut has hit families hard. Brandon Praileau, a pastor in Norfolk, Virginia, told Al Jazeera he was “mind blown” by the sudden cancellation, after he had helped explain the program’s benefits in his community.

Alongside that, the government is ending a 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar starting December.

Why Families Are Worried

Rising Power Bills

In some places like Florida, electricity costs have gone up by as much as 60% since 2019.

One woman in Miami-Dade told volunteers she’s afraid to use air conditioning because her power costs are so high — she doesn’t think she can afford to run it.

Without the solar installations, she and others worry they could be trapped paying expensive electric bills for years.

Projects Left Unfinished

Many solar projects were already underway when the funding was pulled. These mid-installation projects are now stranded, putting homeowners and installers in a difficult spot.

Some community groups and solar nonprofits had lined up installations and support for hundreds of homes, but now must pause or abandon what they had planned.

Fewer Solar Jobs

The end of tax credits and grant programs could put thousands of solar workers out of work. Experts say job losses are likely in the solar installation sector, especially among low-income installers.

With less incentive to build rooftop solar, fewer people may choose to work in the industry — slowing down the clean energy transition.

What the Government Says

The U.S. Department of Energy has already pulled $13 billion of funding from other renewable energy programs. This includes projects to upgrade power grids, produce cleaner cement, and expand battery storage.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the cuts, saying the previous grants were part of a “wasteful Green New Scam agenda.”

Wright said ending the programs is about “returning these funds to the American taxpayer,” and promised to focus on “affordable, reliable, and secure American energy.”

Expert Views

Bernadette Del Chiaro, of the Environmental Working Group, warned that ending these incentives leaves consumers “at the mercy of utilities” and rising energy rates.

Barry Cinnamon, CEO of a San Francisco-based solar installer, called it a “big plunge on the solar coaster” — meaning the rooftop solar industry may suffer dramatically next year.

Ed Murray, president of the California Solar & Storage Association, said expected payback times for solar systems could double, from a few years to as much as 12 years, if the credits disappear.

He also warned that states may fail to hit their climate goals, and that air quality could worsen as a result of fewer solar installations.

What It Means Going Forward

Families who had already planned or started installing solar now feel betrayed. Many are asking whether they can finish installations without the promised financial support.

Without federal incentives, rooftop solar may become a far less attractive option — especially for lower-income households that can’t afford the upfront costs.

The industry fears a broader slowdown. If installers don’t have demand, some companies may reduce hiring, or even close, reducing clean energy jobs and innovation.

From a climate perspective, this move could slow the U.S.’s progress on reducing carbon emissions, especially in residential energy.

Final Thought

The cuts to rooftop solar funding are more than just a budget decision — they are a deeply personal issue for many families. For people counting on solar to reduce their power bills and help the environment, the policy changes feel like a sudden reversal of hope.

For many low- and middle-income Americans, rooftop solar wasn’t just about going green — it was a lifeline. Now, some worry that without support, they may never get off the grid’s cycle of rising costs.

Toyota's manufacturing investments follow consumer behaviour rather than aspirational projections, prioritising market reality over technological idealism.","The strategy behind Toyota's latest manufacturing decision reveals a company responding to market forces. On 18 November 2025, the automaker announced it would deploy $912 million across five American plants, creating 252 jobs whilst expanding capacity for hybrid components and vehicles. The pivot represents a calculated response to a fundamental shift in consumer purchasing patterns quickly reshaping production infrastructure.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) now account for nearly 50% of Toyota's US sales, a threshold the carmaker has reached through methodical portfolio expansion rather than dramatic pivots. Where rivals committed billions to battery electric infrastructure only to confront tepid consumer enthusiasm, Toyota maintained its hybrid focus. The payoff appears in the figures. Third quarter 2025 electrified vehicle sales reached 282,794 units, representing 44.9% of total sales volume, positioning the manufacturer to capitalise on demand patterns competitors failed to anticipate.

As global manufacturing confronts a looming skills crisis, Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK, with help of Rockwell, has created a training model that could reshape how the industry develops its workforce

The investment is distributed unevenly across Toyota's American footprint, reflecting operational priorities rather than political considerations. West Virginia receives the largest allocation at $453 million (£344m), funding expansion of hybrid engine, transaxle and motor stator production at the Buffalo facility. The plant currently produces more than one million powertrain units annually. The new capacity, scheduled to begin production in 2027, will increase assembly of fourth-generation hybrid transaxles alongside hybrid-compatible engines.

Kentucky's Georgetown facility, the manufacturer's largest global production site, secures $204 million (£155m) to install machining capacity for hybrid engines. The investment adds 82 positions to a workforce approaching 10,000, with the new line targeting 2027 startup. The powertrain facility operates at capacity of 700,000 units, positioning it as a critical node in Toyota's North American hybrid supply network.

Mississippi plant to become first US location for electrified Corolla assembly

The Mississippi allocation carries particular strategic significance. Blue Springs receives $125 million (£95m) to add hybrid electric Corolla production, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled domestically. The facility, which has produced conventional Corollas since 2011, employs 2,400 and maintains annual capacity approaching 180,000 units. The hybrid addition provides production flexibility across powertrains, insulating the single-model plant against demand fluctuations.

Casting operations in Tennessee and Missouri receive investments targeting hybrid component production. Jackson's facility secures $71.4 million (£54m) and 33 positions to expand transaxle case, housing and engine block production. Three new lines will increase annual capacity by nearly 500,000 units, with startup phased between 2027 and 2028. Troy's plant receives $57.1 million (£43m) and 57 jobs for cylinder head production lines, adding capacity exceeding 200,000 units annually beginning 2027.

The investments emerge against broader industry turbulence. Battery electric vehicle average transaction prices increased from $55,500 in December 2024 to $59,200 in March 2025, compared with average prices of all new vehicles which decreased from $49,700 to $47,500. The pricing gulf underscores hybrid appeal to cost-conscious buyers seeking electrification benefits without premium outlays.

Toyota's manufacturing commitment extends beyond the current announcement. The carmaker recently inaugurated a $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, creating 5,100 positions whilst producing 30 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion capacity annually. The facility will produce batteries for hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, including the Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4 hybrid variants. The North Carolina plant represents Toyota's first battery facility outside Japan, signalling long-term commitment to American electrified vehicle production.

The manufacturer's cautious approach to full electrification appears vindicated by market dynamics. Hybrid sales increased 36% in the second quarter of 2025, with hybrids accounting for 22% of new light-duty vehicle sales. Consumer enthusiasm for range-flexible electrification contrasts sharply with battery electric adoption rates, which have plateaued despite infrastructure improvements and incentive programmes.

Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations at Toyota, positioned the investment within the company's localisation philosophy. ""Customers are embracing Toyota's hybrid vehicles, and our US manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand. Toyota's philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our US footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy"".

Political reception proved predictably enthusiastic. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey described the Buffalo investment as demonstrating confidence in the state's workforce and business climate. ""This investment, which creates 80 new jobs for hard working West Virginians, reflects a strong confidence in our people and in the strength of our economy"". Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear cited decades of successful partnership between the state and manufacturer, whilst Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves highlighted the commitment to the state's manufacturing capability.

The investments arrive as Toyota navigates complex regulatory landscapes. California and five additional states maintain Advanced Clean Cars II mandates requiring 35% zero-emission vehicle thresholds, standards Toyota dealers actively oppose. The manufacturer argues such requirements demand unrealistic battery electric penetration rates, displacing emphasis on its hybrid portfolio. The regulatory tension illuminates divergent paths toward decarbonisation, with Toyota backing incremental progress over transformative leaps.

Competitive dynamics reinforce Toyota's strategic positioning. The manufacturer commands more than half the American hybrid market, insulating it from battery electric volatility whilst generating capital for future electrification investments. The Toyota division sold 537,528 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, with electrified models comprising 46.9% of total sales. The penetration rate demonstrates mainstream hybrid acceptance without premium pricing barriers.

Manufacturing efficiency underpins Toyota's approach. The OEM currently assembles approximately half the vehicles it sells domestically, with North American facilities producing more than three quarters of US-bound vehicles. The localisation strategy reduces logistics costs whilst insulating operations from tariff uncertainties and supply chain disruptions.

The flexible assembly line: How vehicle production learned to hedge its bets

Market uncertainty has forced manufacturers to abandon fixed production lines. Honda, BMW and Volkswagen are investing billions in systems that can switch between combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles by the hour.

Investment forms part of broader $10bn US manufacturing commitment through 2030

The $912 million commitment forms part of a broader $10 billion American investment pledge spanning five years. Total US investment since Toyota's entry nearly 70 years ago approaches $60 billion, positioning the manufacturer as a significant industrial employer with nearly 48,000 direct employees across 11 facilities. The accumulated capital reflects patient deployment rather than reactive spending, building manufacturing capabilities aligned with demand patterns rather than aspirational forecasts.

Production timelines indicate measured capacity expansion. Most new lines target 2027 startup, with Tennessee operations extending into 2028. The phased approach allows workforce development, equipment commissioning and production system refinement without compression risks. Toyota's manufacturing methodology prioritises stability over velocity, minimising disruption whilst ensuring quality standards.

The hybrid investment strategy carries implications beyond Toyota's operations. As battery electric adoption moderates and consumers demonstrate sustained hybrid enthusiasm, manufacturers face renewed questions about electrification pathways. Toyota's multi-pathway approach, long criticised as insufficiently aggressive, appears increasingly pragmatic. The company avoided overexposure to battery electric segments experiencing demand headwinds whilst building profitable hybrid operations generating capital for future technology investments.

Component manufacturing emphasis within the investment breakdown merits attention. Casting facilities in Tennessee and Missouri receive substantial allocations for transaxle cases, cylinder heads and engine blocks. The focus on upstream capacity signals confidence in sustained hybrid demand through the decade, justifying capital-intensive tooling investments with extended payback periods.

The Mississippi Corolla hybrid addition addresses product portfolio gaps. Domestic electrified Corolla production provides supply chain resilience whilst meeting demand for affordable hybrid options. The model targets mainstream buyers seeking fuel efficiency without luxury pricing, expanding addressable markets beyond premium segments.

Toyota's manufacturing footprint expansion coincides with workforce development initiatives. The Toyota USA Foundation recently launched Driving Possibilities, a $110 million programme supporting pre-kindergarten through secondary education with emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning. The long-term programme addresses educational gaps whilst preparing future manufacturing workforces, reflecting recognition that advanced production requires sustained investment in human capital alongside physical infrastructure.

The hybrid production expansion occurs as automotive manufacturing confronts structural transformation. Traditional internal combustion expertise loses relevance as electrification accelerates, yet full battery electric transition timelines remain uncertain. Hybrid systems occupy intermediate technological space, requiring both conventional and electric powertrain knowledge. Toyota's investment in hybrid capacity positions the company to navigate transitional decades without premature obsolescence of manufacturing capabilities.

The industry's largest hybrid production base

Global production dynamics inform American investment decisions. Toyota maintains the industry's largest hybrid manufacturing base, with operations spanning Japan, Europe and North America. American capacity expansion reflects both domestic demand growth and strategic hedging against geopolitical disruption. Localised production insulates the company from tariff fluctuations whilst demonstrating commitment to regional manufacturing employment.

The announcement timing proves notable. Following the North Carolina battery plant inauguration six days earlier, the hybrid investment signals a balanced electrification strategy encompassing both range-flexible hybrids and pure electric platforms. The dual approach acknowledges market uncertainty whilst maintaining optionality across technology pathways.

Investment returns depend on sustained hybrid demand through production timelines extending into 2028. Market dynamics could shift as battery costs decline, charging infrastructure expands and battery electric vehicles achieve price parity with conventional alternatives. Toyota's phased capacity additions provide flexibility to modulate investment velocity based on evolving demand signals.

Smart Factories: From 2025 to 2026 — Advancing People, Process and Technology

In this AMS livestream, our editorial team and industry experts reflect on the year’s most significant developments and discuss what they mean for the future.

The manufacturing commitment underscores a central paradox in automotive electrification. Whilst industry rhetoric emphasises battery electric futures, consumer purchasing patterns reveal preference for incremental technology adoption. Hybrids deliver fuel efficiency improvements and emissions reductions without range anxiety or charging infrastructure dependence, attributes resonating with mainstream buyers. Toyota's manufacturing investments follow consumer behaviour rather than aspirational projections, prioritising market reality over technological idealism.

Component capacity emphasis within the investment portfolio reflects supply chain strategy. Rather than relying on external suppliers for critical hybrid systems, Toyota maintains vertical integration across engines, transaxles and electric motor components. The approach provides quality control whilst retaining technological expertise within the company's manufacturing network.

The five-plant investment demonstrates manufacturing network optimisation. Rather than concentrating capacity in single mega-facilities, Toyota distributes production across geographical footprint, reducing logistics costs whilst maintaining operational flexibility. The distributed model provides resilience against facility-specific disruptions whilst supporting regional employment across multiple states.

As Toyota deploys capital across American hybrid manufacturing, the broader industry confronts questions about electrification velocity and pathway diversity.

Authors: Florian Hock, Senior Director, Energy Origination Europe at NORD/LB Pablo Cervo, Structured Finance Associate Director at NORD/LB Brandon Faber, Director at NORD/LB","BESS has quickly evolved from an emerging technology into a cornerstone of the green transition. Deployment is accelerating across Europe and North America as grids integrate more renewables, and recognition of the need for flexibility grows.

At NORD/LB, we’ve witnessed this shift firsthand. In just a few years, BESS has matured from a relatively niche asset class into a mainstream component of the clean energy system, attracting investors, policy frameworks, and a growing pool of lenders. As an example, we have financed over 6 GW of storage in the United States to date, ranking among the top five lenders, and closed eight BESS deals across Europe in 2025 alone.

Despite this progress, deployment remains uneven. Contracting, grid connections, and policy frameworks continue to shape which projects succeed and where. Future growth hinges not only on deployment rates, but on how effectively developers, grid operators, and financiers collaborate to balance the risk and reward of projects.

Diverging journeys across the pond

The US market has matured faster than Europe’s, thanks largely to clarity around revenue models and strong state-level incentives. In California and Texas, for example, batteries have become critical to grid stability, helping balance the peaks and troughs of renewable electricity generation. More recently, states such as Massachusetts and New York have joined the expansion by introducing targeted incentive programmes designed specifically for BESS assets.

Policy consistency, combined with falling lithium prices and tax credits introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, means BESS has become mainstream infrastructure in many areas.

Progress in Europe has taken longer. Early projects encountered long lead times and faced uncertain offtake structures. Before closing its first European BESS deal, NORD/LB spent several years deliberately building market knowledge and relationships — a foundation that has positioned us to capitalise as the landscape matures. New models have recently emerged to address the question of revenue certainty, providing examples that can be replicated across other European markets.

The UK has led with the introduction of floor agreements, which guarantee a minimum income level to the asset owner and provide partial protection against market volatility. Meanwhile, our financing of Germany’s first tolling agreement deal, Project Stendal, helped set a precedent for how such structures can attract long-term debt in Europe.

From bottlenecks to bankability

Despite growing sophistication in contracting, deployment across Europe remains stunted by regulatory bottlenecks, particularly grid connection delays. Closer collaboration between lenders, developers, and floor/tolling providers is critical. Unlike renewable energy projects, where power purchase agreements are standardised, each BESS contract differs. The more tolling providers, banks, and developers build common frameworks, the faster BESS can scale. Successful BESS financing relies on balancing revenue certainty for lenders (ensuring bankability) and upside for sponsors.

Lessons from the US and opportunities for Europe

The US market offers valuable insights into the opportunities that project hybridisation provides. Solar-plus-storage projects are increasingly common and often operate under long-term tolling agreements with grid operators. These models are highly bankable — providing fixed lease payments, requiring only basic performance guarantees, and eliminating a large amount of operational risk for developers.

Europe is beginning to follow similar pathways for hybridisation and long-duration storage. Countries such as Romania – still early in their renewables journey – are embedding storage from the outset, showing that newer markets are learning from those that didn’t roll out batteries in conjunction with their renewable projects. In markets with very high renewable penetration, like Spain, managing load shifts has become a daily challenge. These systems urgently need flexible assets like batteries to stabilise supply and balance the grid.

To unlock the next wave of European projects, policy frameworks must evolve. Long-term capacity markets could provide stable revenue, while pan-European ancillary service markets would increase liquidity and efficiency.

Grid fees also play a crucial role. In some countries they account for a large portion of operating costs, while in others they are completely waived. Developers need clarity and consistency on when batteries are rewarded for supporting flexibility and when they will be charged for using the grid. The US market shows when policy is correctly administered, BESS is deployed efficiently.

Looking ahead: scale, duration and innovation

As equipment costs fall and regulation matures, the question is no longer whether to deploy storage, but how to do so efficiently and at scale. Developers will need to match storage duration to varying market conditions and build in flexibility so systems can evolve as technology improves.

Technological innovation will continue reshaping the sector. We expect new chemistries beyond lithium, such as zinc-bromine, to become commercially viable within five years, opening new possibilities for lenders and developers.

Battery storage is undoubtedly entering a rapid phase of expansion. As Europe’s renewable capacity grows, flexible systems are essential to stabilise the grid and protect consumers. Policy clarity, strong contracting, and effective grid planning can unlock the next wave of investment. At NORD/LB we remain committed to leveraging our market experience to turn technological progress into bankable financial structures that make the energy transition investable.

Uruguay has become a focal point of South America’s EV boom, from a bevy of China’s BYD models crisscrossing the capital, Montevideo, to dozens of Teslas cruising along the famed coastline of Punta del Este where the region’s rich and famous mingle every summer.

Battery-powered electric vehicles made up about a quarter of all new car and SUV sales through October this year, more than doubling their market share from a year ago, according to data compiled by the country’s auto trade group Acau. That’s well ahead of the single-digit adoption rates observed in many other South American markets such as Colombia, Chile and even Brazil, where BYD assembles its cars.

Known for its posh beaches and predictable politics, Uruguay exempts EVs from a 23% import duty and a double-digit excise tax on passenger vehicles. Gasoline costing about $7.40 per gallon and a growing network of charging stations nationwide have also aided EV adoption in this country of 3.5 million people wedged between Brazil and Argentina.

It’s a big change in a region where US, European and Japanese brands - such as Ford, Fiat and Toyota - have manufactured for decades and defined the streetscape. They still make up a much greater overall market share, but EV competition from China in particular is growing rapidly.

Uruguay’s use of tax incentives to boost adoption could serve as a template for other small countries that don’t have ambitions to build a domestic EV manufacturing industry, Bloomberg NEF head of Latin America research Rafael Rabioglio said.

Bloomberg NEF forecasts battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will top 8% of new passenger auto sales in Latin America at more than 400,000 units this year, up from about 2% in 2023. The arrival of affordable Chinese models in a region of price sensitive consumers was a “game changer” for EV adoption, Rabioglio said.

“If it wasn’t for the Chinese, I’m not sure we would have seen this transition happening recently in Latin America,” Rabioglio said.

Chinese brands like BYD, JAC and Omoda accounted for about 90% of the approximately 11,000 battery electric cars and SUVs sold in Uruguay this year. BYD’s popular Seagull model, at just under $20,000, is similarly priced to four-door hatchbacks with gas-powered engines.

Maria Clara Sole, 36, drives as much as 60 kilometers a day commuting to work in the capital Montevideo and shuttling her children around in the BYD Yuan Pro she and her husband purchased for about $31,000 last year after consulting with other BYD owners in their community. Sole estimates she saves up to $400 per month by charging her SUV at home versus filling the tank of a conventional car at a gas station.

Sole and her husband also own an SUV with a gasoline motor, which they use among other things for longer road trips.

“We aren’t ready to go fully electric with both cars. There’s still some uncertainty - especially if I want to drive to Argentina or Brazil. That possibility is limited if it’s not a gasoline-powered car,” she said.

Uruguay’s wealthier enclaves are also home to Tesla enthusiasts even though Elon Musk’s iconic EV maker doesn’t have an official presence in a country that is home to the billionaire founders of some of Latin America’s biggest tech companies.

Car dealers have sold 152 Teslas since 2020, according to trade group Ascoma. That’s small on a global level but towering over Argentina with more than 10 times the population: Tesla doesn’t even factor into the top 40 brands ranked by car sales there, according to Argentina auto industry group Acara.

One dealership, AutoImport near Punta del Este, has sold about 40 Teslas this year and expects to sell at least 60 next year even as premium Chinese brands compete for customers willing to pay $60,000 for a Model 3, operations manager Ramiro Duer said.

“We continue to bet on Tesla because the brand and vehicles continue to surprise day after day with their software updates and occasional vehicle restyling,” he said.

Dozens of Teslas are also thought to have been imported by private individuals or entered the country under rules that allow Uruguayans who return home after living at least two years abroad to bring a vehicle with them duty free.

That’s how mechanical engineer and entrepreneur Martin Canabal brought the Tesla he purchased in 2019 to Uruguay after living almost seven years in San Francisco. Canabal and his wife took their Model 3 on an epic road trip from Alaska to the southern tip of Argentina and finally to their new home in Punta del Este in early 2023.

Canabal, 48, now belongs to an informal club of local Tesla owners that exchange tips on maintenance and upkeep over social media. Several repair shops import spare parts and employ mechanics trained to fix Tesla cars, he said.

Nicolas Jodal, who sold the software company he co-founded to Latin American tech giant Globant three years ago, purchased his second Model X from a local car importer in 2023.

Tesla’s software and autopilot are still a cut above the competition including the BYD vehicles in his household, Jodal said. The 65-year-old software engineer said he would consider buying another EV brand if it offers superior features and performance.

“They are extremely cheap to operate. I don’t think I manage to spend 500 pesos ($12) a month” on electricity, said Jodal. He sees internal combustion engine as “an outdated technology that has no future, at least for passenger transport vehicles.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/PDTN/87335671007-uruguayelectricbg-tif-56-q-33-r-5-allnioq-2-lmd-7-w-5-km.jpg?crop=2748,1546,x418,y554&width=2748&height=1546&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-18 12:08:36.443654

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hamm Institute for American Energy's American Energy + AI Initiative, along with the National Center of Energy Analytics and the CGCN Group's American Energy + AI Coalition, today announced the outcomes of the American Energy + AI DC Summit.

The working session brought together U.S. cabinet officials, senior industry executives, investors and policy experts to examine how the United States can add enough firm power, on near-term timelines, to meet rapidly rising AI-driven demand. The event was held at GE Vernova's Washington, D.C. office.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Kate MacGregor provided a briefing on current efforts and remaining gaps.

They participated in the discussion as part of the administration's focus on modernizing federal tools at the Department of Energy and Department of the Interior to support increased power production, transmission buildout, and smarter use of federal lands and emergency authorities.

Through its American Energy + AI Initiative, the Hamm Institute has spent the past year commissioning new research on how to power AI with firm energy, translating that work into policy-ready insights, and hosting working sessions from Oklahoma City to Palo Alto to bring industry, policymakers and investors into alignment around near-term solutions.

""America's ability to lead in AI will depend on whether we can build enough firm power, fast. The Hamm Institute's American Energy + AI Initiative exists to turn convenings like the Summit into steel in the ground, projects underway, and a clear research-backed roadmap that industry and policymakers can use,"" said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, PhD, executive director of the Hamm Institute for American Energy.

As the non-political partner, the Hamm Institute is leading the convening. In contrast, the American Energy + AI Coalition, led by CGCN, is focused on the policy, legislative and regulatory roadmap required to translate those findings.

""This was yet another productive session by the leaders of the Hamm Institute. Through extensive outreach and dialogue, they are developing concrete, meaningful policy reforms to help advance the power and AI goals shared by the electricity and technology sectors, as well as the Trump administration,"" said Mike Catanzaro, CEO of CGCN Group and executive director of the American Energy + AI Coalition. ""Many thanks to Secretary Wright and Deputy Secretary MacGregor for their participation today and their effective leadership on this critically important issue for the nation.""

The Hamm Institute for American Energy commissioned a new study from Mark P. Mills, executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and distinguished fellow at the Hamm Institute, titled The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts. The report analyzes how surging AI deployment is reshaping U.S. electricity demand and the broader economy and outlines the scale of new firm power required for America to stay competitive. Mills, who testified on AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025, shared key implications for policymakers during the Summit.

""Forecasters, pundits, and policymakers have all been surprised, even shocked, by the magnitude and speed of electricity demand emerging to power AI and the hundreds of billions of dollars of data centers under construction and planned,"" said Mills. ""The economic and strategic importance of the AI race sidelines the idea of an energy transition and highlights the old 'all-of-the-above' approach, especially the immediate needs for more natural gas.""

The Rise of AI is the first paper in a series of reports and forecasts to be produced between the two organizations.

GE Vernova hosted the Summit as part of its work to support customers across power generation, grid, and nuclear as they respond to surging demand from AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

""AI has tremendous opportunity to drive economic growth, and it all starts with energy,"" said GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. ""Behind every data center is critical demand for reliable and affordable power. The countries that build resilient, modern energy systems will define the next wave of global competitiveness. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers and appreciate the Hamm Institute leading this work with research and convenings along with the partnership of Secretaries Burgum and Wright as the Administration works to develop smart energy and innovation policies to shape the future.""

World leaders have gathered in Brazil for the U.N. Climate Conference. The U.S. is not there, but China is. When it comes to energy transition, the U.S. and China couldn't be on more different paths. China is moving away from fossil fuels while the U.S. is doubling down. Experts say this will have consequences for the climate and these countries' economies. NPR sent two correspondents to opposite sides of the Pacific to learn more. We begin with NPR's Julia Simon in Eureka, California.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In far northern California, Chris Mikkelsen drives an old police cruiser past little wooden houses.

Pine trees with moss just, like, hanging off of them.

CHRIS MIKKELSEN: It's just an old seaside town.

SIMON: Mikkelsen is the executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which plans to assemble wind turbines for a massive new offshore wind project. About 20 miles off this misty coast, two companies - American Vineyard Offshore and German RWE - plan to build turbines to power more than 2 million homes. Mikkelsen says the project aims to make about 270 long-term local jobs.

MIKKELSEN: It's going to, you know, change the economic viability of our community. And I get a little - my voice gets a little shaky 'cause it's going to make a better opportunity for our kids.

SIMON: Yeah.

MIKKELSEN: That's pretty important.

SIMON: The new terminal was supposed to be shovel-ready as soon as 2026, Mikkelsen says. That's no longer realistic, in part because the Trump administration recently canceled more than $426 million in federal grants for the project. Mikkelsen says it's been pencils down since then as they try to find new sources of money. This is one of dozens of actions this administration has taken to starve the renewable energy industry of federal support from canceling tax credits years early to issuing stop-work orders.

Amanda Levin at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council says the U.S. renewable industry had been growing.

AMANDA LEVIN: For the first time last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal. Things were headed in the right direction, but this really just takes the wind out of their sails.

SIMON: The Trump administration is reversing support for renewables, which it incorrectly labels as risky and unreliable. But across the Pacific Ocean, America's biggest competitor - China - thinks otherwise. Let's throw the mic 5,000 miles to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's there.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: You are right, Julia. Here in China, renewable isn't a dirty word. China's leadership has made strategic choices to include renewables in its energy mix. We're in China's Zhangbei region, which is in between the capital Beijing and the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The area is rich in wind resources, and it's where a lot of China's wind and solar capacity is being installed.

(SOUNDBITE OF TURBINE BLADES SPINNING)

KUHN: Turbine blades swoosh past in huge circles. The electricity goes from here to a grid outside Beijing and on to the rest of China. China now dominates the global renewable sector. In the first half of this year, China built more solar than the rest of the world combined. Seventy-four percent of all large-scale wind and solar projects are being built in China. Compare that to the U.S. that's building 6%. China now has more installed generation capacity from solar and wind than from gas and coal.

It wasn't always this way. Until recently, China's economic growth came at the cost of air pollution from burning fossil fuels. But in the last few decades, authorities in Beijing began to consider a sustainable economic growth model, and renewables have been a key part of that, according to Qin Haiyan, director of the parent company of the wind farm we visited and vice president of the World Wind Energy Association.

QIN HAIYAN: (Through interpreter) Developing the economy and reducing carbon emissions to address climate change are now no longer contradictory.

KUHN: And this, according to the Asia Society's Li Shuo, is the biggest difference between the U.S. and China in climate policy today.

LI SHUO: It couldn't be a stronger contrast between the two countries.

KUHN: In China, solar and wind are now cheaper than coal and gas. Li Shuo says one of the most dramatic aspects of China's climate story is not just that they seem to be cutting their climate emissions...

LI: But also, to what extent other parts of the world can also benefit from China's low-carbon products.

SIMON: So China is now exporting turbines and solar panels and batteries around the world, from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan.

KUHN: That's right, Julia. All the renewables growth, both local and exports, is a bright spot amid China's slowing economy, especially its slumping real estate sector. David Fishman is a principal at the Lantau Group in Shanghai.

DAVID FISHMAN: People who used to be swinging hammers building commercial real estate are now swinging hammers installing solar panels. And that - well, yes, of course. You double - triple down on that.

(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)

SIMON: Back in Eureka, Mikkelsen walks along a creaky dock, an abandoned pulp mill looming behind us. He says he doesn't understand why the Trump administration would cancel the grants for the terminal supporting the wind project. He says this community has been suffering since 2008 when the pulp mill closed.

MIKKELSEN: Our administration that was recently elected, not only at the presidential level but even some of our Congress and senators, really ran on a platform that we're going to build back America, that we're going to create jobs in rural America - good, skilled, trained, you know, high-paying jobs. And there's no better place. You're looking around, you're seeing the remnants of what once was.

SIMON: It is still unclear what the nationwide cuts to renewable energy mean for U.S. climate emissions.

KUHN: But in China, the climate story is more clear, and it's a rare, encouraging indicator in the global warming story. The growth of renewable energy means that China's emissions seem to be on track to peak or are nearing their peak, Li Shuo says. And China's renewable exports mean the country is helping other countries reduce their emissions too.

SIMON: Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins University, says now, at the end of the day...

JEREMY WALLACE: What America does is part of a story, and it is not the main part of the story. It's a cute side character.

KUHN: China, he says, is now the main character in the story of fighting climate change. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, China.

About 20 percent of planned solar capacity reported a delay, down from 25 percent in the same period in 2024.
Developers brought 31 gigawatts of solar capacity online, increasing the nation’s utility-scale total by 34 percent, EIA reported.
In EIA’s latest monthly inventory, developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online from October 2025 through September 2026.
The law includes a provision that allows wind and solar projects to keep their eligibility if they begin construction before July 4 of next year.","Fewer U.S. solar projects are pushing back their expected online dates, according to third-quarter 2025 data from the the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory. About 20 percent of planned solar capacity reported a delay, down from 25 percent in the same period in 2024.

Solar remains the country’s fastest-growing source of new generating capacity, largely from utility-scale photovoltaic projects developed by electric utilities and independent power producers. Although delays remain common, they have been trending lower, and most are short.

Even with elevated delays in 2024, the year set a record for utility-scale solar additions. Developers brought 31 gigawatts of solar capacity online, increasing the nation’s utility-scale total by 34 percent, EIA reported. Cancellations continue to be rare, with less than 1 percent of planned capacity typically withdrawn in any given month.

Project developers initially report planned online dates in the Annual Electric Generator Report. Beginning 12 months before those dates, they provide monthly updates on project status and schedule. Because many developers cannot predict the timing or length of delays, total annual additions often fall short of early-year expectations. In January 2024, developers anticipated more than 36 GW of additions, about 5 GW more than the final total.

Most reported delays occur in late construction or testing stages, often only one to two months before a project is ready to start operation. These short setbacks account for much of the slippage in reported timelines.

In EIA’s latest monthly inventory, developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online from October 2025 through September 2026. About 5 GW of that total comes from projects that have already pushed back their expected startup dates.

Developers are reportedly moving quickly to start new solar projects after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) shortened the window to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits. The law includes a provision that allows wind and solar projects to keep their eligibility if they begin construction before July 4 of next year.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-Untitled-23-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:05:28.286887

Greenpeace International, were it to defy such an order, might face a contempt ruling by a North Dakota court.
But if Greenpeace International has no presence in North Dakota, it could be difficult for the court to collect, he said.
According to Greenpeace, the judge cut Greenpeace USA’s share to some $280 million, with Greenpeace International, based in Amsterdam and also named in the suit, owing about $65 million.
Greenpeace International said its only connection to the protests was signing a letter calling on financiers to withhold support for the pipeline.","The yearslong court battle over a controversial pipeline — a fight so aggressive, it’s threatening to bankrupt Greenpeace USA — has taken a strange legal twist.

Energy Transfer, the company that won a nearly $670 million judgment against Greenpeace earlier this year over protests against its Dakota Access Pipeline, is mounting a full-court press with its latest strategy. The pipeline company and its allies are exhorting North Dakota’s Supreme Court to block a countersuit from an international branch of Greenpeace in the Netherlands.

In other words, Energy Transfer is asking judges in North Dakota to stop a lawsuit filed under the laws of a different country. The details of its efforts at the state’s Supreme Court haven’t been previously reported.

The strategy is unusual, but not unheard-of.

George A. Bermann, a professor at Columbia Law School and expert on transnational litigation, said that courts generally issue international injunctions like this only sparingly because they are seen as interfering with foreign courts.

If the North Dakota court did issue one, enforcing it would be another matter, he said, because of the messy questions about jurisdiction.

Greenpeace International, were it to defy such an order, might face a contempt ruling by a North Dakota court. But if Greenpeace International has no presence in North Dakota, it could be difficult for the court to collect, he said.

“What Greenpeace would have to worry about is whether any jurisdiction in which it has assets would be willing to enforce that order,” Professor Bermann said.

Earlier this year, a jury in Mandan, N.D., ordered Greenpeace entities to pay nearly $670 million to Energy Transfer after a three-week trial over allegations of trespassing, defamation and conspiracy. Greenpeace maintained that it had played only a supporting role in peaceful protests.

Last month, Judge James Gion, who oversaw the trial, reduced the award by nearly half, citing legal technicalities. According to Greenpeace, the judge cut Greenpeace USA’s share to some $280 million, with Greenpeace International, based in Amsterdam and also named in the suit, owing about $65 million.

Energy Transfer’s new legal strategy is focused on a separate and novel countersuit, filed against it in the Netherlands. There, Greenpeace International is suing Energy Transfer based on a new European Union directive aimed at reining in what are known as SLAPP lawsuits, or those aimed at stifling free speech. (SLAPP stands for Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation.)

Many U.S. states also have laws against SLAPP suits, but not North Dakota.

In a brief in the Dutch court, Greenpeace International said the powerful and politically connected company had brought the case, and an earlier lawsuit in federal court, precisely to bury its critics in costly litigation. Energy Transfer is led by Kelcy Warren, a Trump donor and billionaire who has spoken bluntly about the case.

The filing referenced comments that Mr. Warren made in a 2017 television interview in which he accused environmentalists of torching equipment and causing millions of dollars in damage. “Everybody’s afraid of these environmental groups and the fear that it may look wrong if you fight back with these people, but what they did to us is wrong, and they’re going to pay for it,” he said.

Vicki Granado, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer, said the company was “pleased that Greenpeace has been held accountable for its actions and that a jury recognized these were not law-abiding, peaceful protests as Greenpeace tries to claim.” She declined to comment further on the appeal.

Greenpeace International said its only connection to the protests was signing a letter calling on financiers to withhold support for the pipeline. It asked the court to block efforts to enforce the verdict and to force Energy Transfer to pay the expenses it had accrued over years of litigation.

Ashkhen Kazaryan, a senior legal fellow at The Future of Free Speech, a think tank at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said that the European Union directive takes a different approach than U.S. states with anti-SLAPP laws. In those states, the laws allow judges to dismiss cases early in the legal process if they are deemed to be abusive and involve an imbalance of power between the parties.

But the E.U.’s directive allows parties to sue in European courts for damages caused by litigation. If the Dutch court ruled in Greenpeace’s favor, financial penalties could hypothetically be extracted from Energy Transfer assets in Europe, Ms. Kazaryan said.

Greenpeace International’s lawsuit is “an affront to North Dakota’s sovereignty,” lawyers for the company wrote in a petition filed in September.

In recent days, a host of business groups have filed amicus briefs in support of Energy Transfer’s petition. Among them was the American Energy Association, whose members include Liberty Energy, the fracking company founded by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Its brief called the suit “a clearly vexatious collateral attack filed for the express purpose of evading domestic liability.”

Daniel Simons, senior legal counsel for strategic defense for Greenpeace International, said the framing of the Dutch lawsuit as an attack on North Dakota’s courts was “mere propaganda.”

The solicitor general of North Dakota, Philip Axt, submitted a brief that did not explicitly support either side, but argued that a state court does have the power to issue international injunctions against lawsuits filed abroad. Mr. Axt pointed to decisions in other federal appellate courts that differed from the Eighth Circuit’s approach.

Heated protests against construction of the pipeline in 2016 and 2017 attracted thousands of supporters from around the world. The pipeline runs close to the border of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s reservation, and under Lake Oahe, which supplies its drinking water.

The tribe has tried for years to shut down the pipeline in court. In March, Chief Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington dismissed the tribe’s most recent lawsuit, which was filed against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last year.

This month the tribe reopened its fight, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to reverse that ruling. It said the pipeline is operating without a crucial easement and without a final environmental impact statement, in violation of federal laws.

“We will not allow our water, sacred sites, or future generations be compromised,” said Steve Sitting Bear, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

The pipeline, which carries crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois, is a threat to Native sovereignty and encroaches on lands that the tribe never gave up rights to, the tribe said. The appeal, filed Nov. 5, focused on the risk of oil spills and what it said was a lack of adequate planning for such dangers. The Army Corps of Engineers did not respond to a request for comment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/14/multimedia/00cli-greenpeace-01-ptzb/00cli-greenpeace-01-ptzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:09:55.790640

With support from the Whitmer Administration and our partners in the Legislature, EGLE is proud to help communities transform environmental challenges into economic opportunities.”

To make brownfield funding even more accessible, Rep. Alabas Farhat (D–Dearborn) has introduced House Bills 5286 and 5287, which would double the cap on brownfield grant and loan awards from $1 million to $2 million per project—recognizing that the cost of redeveloping contaminated sites has increased significantly in recent years. The bill would also remove the limit of one project per community per year, making funding more accessible for both large urban areas and smaller communities.

“Protecting our environment while creating high paying jobs is smart economic development,” said Rep. Farhat. “By raising the cap on projects and expanding the possibilities of the brownfield redevelopment fund, this legislation makes it easier to clean up contaminated sights and attracts new investment. I am glad to have partnered with EGLE on the expansion of this program and am excited for the opportunities this will provide for our local communities.”

Since 2019, EGLE’s Brownfield Redevelopment Program has provided $184 million in incentives supporting 474 projects in more than 50 communities. These projects have leveraged $8.3 billion in private investment and created over 20,000 jobs, transforming long-abandoned sites into valuable assets that strengthen local economies and improve quality of life.

EGLE Director Phil Roos joined Rep. Alabas Farhat, Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud and local leaders in Dearborn for a tour and roundtable discussion highlighting how state investments in brownfield redevelopment are driving local impact. The City of Dearborn led a tour of Midtown Luxury Townhomes, an example of the type of housing made possible through brownfield redevelopment. Following the tour, Roos, Rep. Farhat, Mayor Hammoud and community partners gathered for a roundtable discussion on how strategic state funding and legislative support can help communities continue to transform contaminated sites into new opportunities for growth.

Dearborn’s redevelopment success is already evident in projects like the McCollough-Unis School, a former contaminated industrial site that was remediated with EGLE brownfield funding and transformed into a state-of-the-art public school.

“We are grateful for the efforts of both EGLE and our state Representative Alabas Farhat for making this vital redevelopment tool more accessible to communities like Dearborn,” said Mayor Abdullah H. Hammoud. “We’ve already spearheaded several efforts to revitalize and repurpose underutilized properties to meet our development goals while maintaining public health and environmental standards. We’re confident Dearborn possesses the tools to see brownfields come to life once more, and with the greatest public benefit, and welcome this opportunity for increased brownfield investments in our city.”

Through continued investment, collaboration and legislative leadership, Michigan is proving that environmental renewal and economic growth go hand in hand—creating cleaner, stronger and more sustainable communities for generations to come.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/Staff/EXEC/Phil-Roos-at-Dearborn-brownfield-event.jpg?rev=b81304c8b68643d4895fd4ba0a04fe6c,N,,2025-11-18 12:08:27.380591

Even so, accelerating transportation electrification is expected to fuel substantial near-term growth in the U.S. electric vehicle market, providing a meaningful boost to clean energy stocks. The forerunners in the U.S. alternative energy industry are Bloom Energy BE, OPAL Fuels OPAL and FuelCell Energy FCEL.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources. The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels. Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever. Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market. According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027. To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

Why it matters: Rare-earth magnets have become a prominent friction point in U.S.-China trade talks, as China currently dominates the supply of rare-earth materials.

The magnets are a critical component of most electronics, including drones and missiles, as well as electric vehicles and smartphones.

Between the lines: Earlier this month, the Trump administration approved a $620 million loan from the U.S. Department of War (formerly the Department of Defense) to Vulcan and took an equity stake in the company to help kick-start its production.

Driving the news: On Tuesday, Vulcan and North Carolina agreed to an incentive package worth around $17.5 million to build the factory in Benson, near the intersection of Interstate 40 and Interstate 95, if the company meets hiring and investment goals.

Johnston County and the town of Benson will also add incentives worth more than $94 million.

Vulcan had also been considering expanding in Ohio, according to state officials.

Zoom in: Vulcan will invest approximately $1 billion in the factory and hire 1,000 workers, with roles ranging from engineering and production to administrative management.

The minimum average wage at the plant will be around $82,000.

The jobs are expected to be created by 2029.

State of play: Vulcan, founded in 2023, has a small-scale demonstration facility in Durham that has already hit key milestones in production, Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin previously told Axios.

The company was founded in Boston, but ultimately chose North Carolina after its executives performed an analysis of American markets with high-level talent, proximity to military installations, and a decent cost of living.

""The entire reason we built [that] facility was to go and make sure that we understood every nut and bolt of the commercial equipment that we're going to be using and understanding who our suppliers are,"" Maslin says.

Dive Brief:

Peak Energy will supply up to 4.75 GWh of sodium-ion batteries to independent power producer Jupiter Power over the next five years, the company said Nov. 12.

The first phase of the agreement sees Peak supply 720 MWh of its energy storage modules to Jupiter for deployment in 2027. The deal includes a capacity reservation for as much as 4 GWh more between 2028 and 2030, Peak said.

Peak said the total contract value could exceed $500 million, making it the largest U.S. deal for sodium-ion batteries to date. The news comes a few months after Peak energized the United States’ first grid-scale sodium-ion battery facility, a 3.5-MWh project near Denver.

Dive Insight:

A spokesperson for Peak Energy said the first 720-MWh delivery would serve a single Jupiter Power project but declined to say where in the United States it would be. The remaining 4 GWh would be spread across multiple projects whose locations have yet to be determined, they added.

“This is a four-hour system, and we could deploy it in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Southwest Power Pool and other markets with market opportunity for four-hour plus duration,” Mike Geier, Jupiter Power’s chief technology officer, said in an email.

Jupiter Power’s website shows most of its active or under-construction installations are in West Texas, within ERCOT territory. Its “development footprint” encompasses broad swathes of the southwestern, south-central, north-central and northeastern United States, including the entirety of the PJM Interconnection, New York Independent System Operator and Independent System Operator-New England regions.

Jupiter says it has more than 12 GW in development.

Peak batteries use a fully passive design that the company says eliminates the need for active cooling and slashes auxiliary power use by up to 97% compared with lithium-ion systems. They cost less to operate and degrade nearly 30% slower over 20 years, according to Peak.

“We see sodium-ion as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion, and Peak’s approach offers lower degradation, lower lifetime O&M needs and a fully passive cooling system that simplifies operations and supports safer performance,” Geier said.

Despite their apparent advantages, grid-connected sodium-ion battery capacity remains a tiny part of the global energy storage mix amid a long-term decline in lithium-ion module pricing and corresponding improvements in safety and energy density.

But sodium-ion deployments have ticked up in China over the past few years as energy storage developers look to diversify away from lithium. Industry experts believe the technology could make a dent in lithium’s U.S. dominance by 2030 as well.

Ravi Manghani, senior director of strategic sourcing at the energy intelligence firm Anza, said in an email that his company is beginning to track sodium-ion storage more closely amid a challenging trade and regulatory environment for lithium batteries and their inputs.

“With new [foreign entity of concern] rules reshaping eligibility for tax credits starting in 2026 as well as a volatile tariff environment, interest in alternative chemistries like sodium-ion is growing quickly,” Manghani said.

Geier said Jupiter’s deal with Peak “supports our broader domestic supply strategy.”

Factories in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri will see 252 new jobs as a result of the initiative, the world’s biggest carmaker said in a statement.

The move underscores Toyota’s bet that hybrids will dominate US sales in the near term as consumers balk at high EV prices following the end of tax credits. The investment may also strengthen the Japanese carmaker’s foothold in the market as Ford Motor, General Motors and other US carmakers scale back EV ambitions and revisit hybrid strategies to meet shifting demand and emissions targets.

“The cause is still unknown and is currently under investigation,” Rocky Mountain Power Senior Communications Specialist Jona Whitesides said Friday afternoon.
But it’s unclear what it might require of Rocky Mountain Power, the state’s largest regulated electric utility, in terms of a report or accountability.
“They haven’t told us anything.” The lack of communication from Rocky Mountain Power to local responders is nothing new, Dalgarn added.
The power outage began around 12:45 p.m. Thursday.","The massive, multi-utility power outage that left more than 100,000 customers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana without electricity Thursday resulted from a failure in Rocky Mountain Power’s system in Wyoming, the company says. But the utility, so far, isn’t offering specific details.

“The cause is still unknown and is currently under investigation,” Rocky Mountain Power Senior Communications Specialist Jona Whitesides said Friday afternoon. “Given the complexity of this event, the investigation to determine the root cause and precise order of events on the system will take time.”

The company is investigating the incident internally, Whitesides added. It’s unclear how much detail it will offer to the public or when.

“The exact duration [to determine the cause] is not known at this time,” Whitesides said.

The Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydroelectric power and transmission lines across several western states and was impacted by the interruption, initially described the cause as “triggered by two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.”

The term “tripped,” in the industry, typically refers to an automatic shutoff in response to a power disruption.

The event resulted in “abnormal voltage,” the power administration added on Friday, which shut down power transmission lines in the region, where multiple utilities and rural electric co-ops share an interconnected grid.

“What we do know,” Rocky Mountain Power’s Whitesides said, “is that it impacted PacifiCorp [Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company], WAPA and Black Hills Energy, which include customers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana.”

The “bulk power system” outage darkened homes and businesses throughout central and northeast Wyoming for varying lengths of time, including coal mines in the Powder River Basin, oil and natural gas refineries, and led to a fire at Rocky Mountain Power’s Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant near Glenrock.

The fire “was quickly extinguished,” Whitesides said. “Safety systems operated as designed, protecting employees and equipment. No injuries occurred and some equipment damage was reported.”

The unusual, far-reaching scale of the outage is a significant grid reliability issue, according to one industry official who spoke with WyoFile. The event could spur a federal investigation, perhaps by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which develops and enforces grid reliability standards.

Inquiries to those agencies were not returned by press time.

“Certainly, it isn’t just going to be a blip on the radar,” Powder River Energy Corporation Vice President of Member Service Joe Roth told WyoFile. “There’s definitely going to be accountability held at one of those federal levels.”

The Wyoming Public Service Commission also requires reliability standards, according to the agency. But it’s unclear what it might require of Rocky Mountain Power, the state’s largest regulated electric utility, in terms of a report or accountability. “It appears that there may be a federal investigation into the matter,” Commission Chief Counsel John Burbridge told WyoFile.

“While state and federal agencies may choose to conduct their own reviews, at this time we have not been notified of any [outside] investigations,” Rocky Mountain Power’s Whitesides said. “PacifiCorp has submitted reports about the event to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Wyoming Public Service Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.”

At least one local emergency management coordinator expressed frustration with Rocky Mountain Power for not being responsive to questions during and immediately following the power outage and the resulting fire at the Dave Johnston power plant, which is owned and operated by the utility.

“I wish I could tell you exactly what happened there, and I honestly cannot,” Converse County Emergency Management Coordinator Russ Dalgarn told WyoFile on Friday regarding the Dave Johnston fire. “They haven’t told us anything.”

The lack of communication from Rocky Mountain Power to local responders is nothing new, Dalgarn added. The utility is “notorious” for not sharing information with local emergency responders, Dalgarn said.

Asked to respond, Whitesides said, “I am surprised by that because our relationships with state and local first responders and emergency managers have been very collaborative, and we value those relationships very much.”

Utilities affected by the Rocky Mountain Power disruption reported that their systems automatically shut down — a built-in safety response.

“Although the sudden loss of electricity across an entire region came as a jolt to residents and businesses who operate here, the [Powder River Energy Corporation] systems that protect infrastructure and consumers performed as designed as it responded to the high and low voltage scenarios,” the company said.

The power outage began around 12:45 p.m. Thursday.

The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club asked an appeals court on Monday to overturn the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the Southwest Power Pool’s capacity accreditation methodology, which the groups say favors fossil-fueled power plants.

The lawsuit comes as grid operators such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, PJM Interconnection and ISO New England have been making changes to how they measure capacity to ensure they have adequate resources to maintain grid reliability.

Under SPP’s plan approved by FERC in mid-July, the grid operator will set an Effective Load Carrying Capability accreditation methodology for wind, solar and energy storage resources and a performance-based accreditation methodology for conventional resources, according to the suit filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by Earthjustice.

“Fair and accurate resource evaluation should be the minimum expectation for any grid operator,” Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier said in a statement.

SPP’s plan artificially props up the value of coal- and gas-fired generation, according to Wannier. “This double standard will force customers to pay more money for less reliable electric service, and increases the risk of life-threatening power outages during the next heat wave or winter storm,” he said.

SPP contends the new accreditation methodologies will give it a better understanding of which resources will be available when needed, based on their past performance. SPP operates the electric system and wholesale power markets in 14 states from eastern New Mexico to Montana.

In joint comments on SPP’s proposal in March, the NRDC, the Sierra Club and the Sustainable FERC Project said the grid operator’s proposed methodology for thermal power plants failed to evaluate resources based on their performance during high-risk hours.

“The over-accreditation of thermal resources in SPP’s proposed thermal methodology, if not corrected by the Commission, will impose undue costs on ratepayers, and presents a long-term risk to the reliability of the [regional transmission organization’s] grid,” the groups said.

New large-load customers

In the third quarter, the electric utility that accounts for the lion’s share of CMS Energy’s revenue reported a 16% year-over-year increase in operating revenue, though electricity deliveries were largely flat since last year, the company said Oct. 30.

The Michigan-based company attributed the revenue increase — and corresponding growth in the parent company’s earnings per share — primarily to favorable weather and constructive regulatory developments in its home state.

But it has also interconnected 450 MW of new industrial loads in recent quarters, about half the 900 MW of large-load growth it expects through 2029. Additions include semiconductor and solar cell factories near Saginaw, a Ford battery plant near Marshall and an expanded Switch data center south of Grand Rapids.

CMS Energy operates electric and gas utilities in Michigan under the Consumers Energy banner. Its third business line is NorthStar Clean Energy, an independent power producer and energy project developer. The two utilities each serve about 1.8 million customers across Lower Michigan, with the electric business accounting for well over 75% of combined revenues.

The recent large-load additions represent the first wave of an expected 9 GW pipeline over the next decade-plus. CMS has 1 GW to 2 GW of industrial load in the “final stages” of contracting, according to the company’s third-quarter investor presentation.

That includes a yet-unnamed data center that could draw up to 1 GW beginning in 2030 and two other data centers “a bit behind” in contracting, CMS Energy President and CEO Garrick Rochow said in an earnings call on Oct. 30.

Rochow said the Michigan Public Service Commission’s approval of a special tariff for loads greater than 100 MW would enable those and future data center deals. Consumers Energy’s largest customer today draws 28 MW, the commission says.

Campbell coal plant emergency orders expected to continue

Rochow and CMS Energy Chief Financial Officer Rejji Hayes said they expect the Trump administration to repeatedly renew its order that Consumers keep running the 1.5-GW J.H. Campbell power plant.

Hayes stressed that the costs associated with Campbell’s continued operation would be socialized across the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s North and Central regions, sparing Michigan ratepayers the full brunt. He noted that the plant “is being operated for the benefit of the region,” per the Energy Department order — a condition that has raised alarms among ratepayer advocates and spurred environmental groups and large electricity consumers to sue.

“I think it’s important to note that we’re trying our best to make sure that Michigan customers are held harmless,” Hayes said.

It cost Consumers Energy $164 million to run the Campbell plant from May 23 through Sept. 30, CMS said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In that period, the utility received $94 million in revenue selling power from the plant into MISO’s market, leaving the utility with $80 million in net costs, the company said.

Support from Michigan regulators, clean energy law

Consumers Energy benefits from a “constructive” regulatory environment and strong state support for the utility’s clean energy goals, CMS Energy said in the third-quarter presentation.

In a June filing in the electric utility’s pending rate case, PSC staff supported about 75% of its 10.25% return on equity request and about 90% of its revised capital request. That followed a March order in a prior rate case granting the electric utility a $154 million revenue increase to support grid reliability and resilience investments.

Additionally, the commission approved 8 GW of solar capacity and 2.8 GW of wind for inclusion in the electric utility’s next renewable energy plan, which will map out Consumers’ clean energy investments through 2035. Both Michigan and Consumers aim to retire coal and reach net-zero emissions in the power sector by 2040.

On Oct. 30, Rochow said the integrated resource plan Consumers expects to file in mid-2026 will have more on near- and mid-term investments to replace retired plants and support expected load growth. He said the plan would likely include “more battery storage and gas capacity,” with the mix of simple-cycle and possible combined-cycle gas plant investments dependent on the utility’s data center pipeline. Consumers will reveal more about those plans on its next investor call, he said.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources. The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels. Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever. Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market. According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027. To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s bottom-line estimate for the current fiscal year has moved down 15.4% to $2.04 since June 30.

The groups have asked the PSC to create a separate customer class, which would force new data center customers to pay the costs associated with their electricity supply rather than shifting the cost to residential ratepayers.
The groups have also asked the PSC to require NorthWestern to comply with ratepayer-protective rules, in the form of a mandatory tariff, when meeting data center demand.

Community, conservation, and Indigenous-led organizations yesterday filed a complaint before the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) challenging NorthWestern Energy’s intent to provide electricity supply service to large load data centers without first proving that it will not adversely impact existing ratepayers. The groups, represented by Earthjustice, warn that NorthWestern’s data center agreements could increase costs for residential ratepayers and deepen the state’s reliance on expensive fossil fuels.

Quotes from Petitioners.

The complaint targets NorthWestern’s efforts to provide electricity to data centers without the opportunity for public input or the required approval from the PSC. Montana law requires NorthWestern to first demonstrate that providing service to new large load customers will not adversely impact existing ratepayers over the long term. In September, NorthWestern informed the PSC that it does not intend to disclose information on impacts to existing customers before it begins providing service to data centers as early as January 2026.

The groups have asked the PSC to create a separate customer class, which would force new data center customers to pay the costs associated with their electricity supply rather than shifting the cost to residential ratepayers. The groups have also asked the PSC to require NorthWestern to comply with ratepayer-protective rules, in the form of a mandatory tariff, when meeting data center demand. The groups argue that granting both of these requests is necessary to protect NorthWestern’s residential customers because of the extremely large loads contemplated by data centers.

NorthWestern has entered into letters of intent to provide as much as 1,400 megawatts of electricity supply to three data center developers in Montana, approximately double the utility’s current average retail daily load. To serve this extreme demand, NorthWestern would need to make transmission upgrades and likely obtain new sources of electricity generation, which would likely lead to further increases in utility bills for NorthWestern’s other customers.

NorthWestern has filed a motion for a protective order for its letters of intent with data centers after the commission requested additional information on the customers mentioned in the utility company’s press releases. In October, the plaintiffs sent a letter to the PSC noting the lack of transparency around NorthWestern’s data center plans and urging a denial of the protective order.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines.","Two new data centers in Silicon Valley have been built but can’t begin processing information: The equipment that would supply them with electricity isn’t available.

It’s just one example of a crisis facing the U.S. power grid that can’t be solved simply by building more power lines, approving new power generation, or changing out grid software. The equipment needed to keep the grid running—transformers that regulate voltage, circuit breakers that protect against faults, high-voltage cables that carry power across regions, and steel poles that hold the network together—is hard to make, and materials are limited. Supply-chain bottlenecks are taking years to clear, delaying projects, inflating costs, and threatening reliability.

Meanwhile, U.S. electricity demand is surging from several sources—electrification of home and business appliances and equipment, increased domestic manufacturing, and growth in AI data centers. Without the right equipment, these efforts may take years longer and cost vast sums more than planners expect.

Not enough transformers to replace aging units

Transformers are key to the electricity grid: They regulate voltage as power travels across the wires, increasing voltage for more efficient long-distance transmission, and decreasing it for medium-distance travel and again for delivery to buildings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. has about 60 million to 80 million high-voltage distribution transformers in service. More than half of them are 33-plus years old—approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.

Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost four to six times what they cost before 2022, in addition to the multiyear wait times.

To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them—perhaps twice as many as already exist.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp. says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks (more than two years) in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks (up to four years). Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are back-ordered as much as two years. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.

Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use grain-oriented electrical steel, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by Cleveland-Cliffs at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly 80% of large transformers have historically been imported from Mexico, China, and Thailand. But global demand has also surged, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.

In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.

Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be designed, tested, and certified individually.

Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport—sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable super-heavy-load railcars in the country. Those logistics alone can add months to a replacement project, according to the Department of Energy.

Other key equipment

Transformers are not the only grid machinery facing delays. A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times reached about 151 weeks (nearly three years) by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.

Facing similar delays are a range of equipment types, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear—a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers, and fuses—and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.

For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can take more than a decade to fill. And fewer than 50 cable-laying vessels operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers, including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova, have multiyear backlogs as new data centers, industrial electrification, and peaking-capacity projects flood the order books. Siemens recently reported a record $158 billion backlog, with some turbine frames sold out for as long as seven years.

Alternate approaches

As a result of these delays, utility companies are finding other ways to meet demand, such as battery storage, actively managing electricity demand, upgrading existing equipment to produce more power, or even reviving decommissioned generation sites.

Some utilities are stockpiling materials for their own use or to sell to other companies, which can shrink delays from years to weeks.

There have been various other efforts, too. In addition to delaying transformer efficiency requirements, the Biden administration awarded Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million to upgrade its electrical-steel plants—but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration.

Utilities and industry groups are exploring standardized designs and modular substations to cut lead times—but acknowledge that those are medium-term fixes, not quick solutions.

Large government incentives, including grants, loans, and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers, and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing. Until the underlying supply-chain choke points—steel, copper, insulation materials, and heavy transport—expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction but through choreography.

Developing a skilled workforce for AI infrastructure Google frames its workforce development plan as a critical component of the construction schedule.","Google is set to deepen its presence in Texas, confirming a US$40bn investment in the state through to 2027.

The large-scale programme is focused on developing new cloud and AI infrastructure, with a clear strategic link to increasing energy capacity and investing in workforce training.

This includes proposals for three new data centres on campuses in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and the expansion of its existing data centre facilities in Ellis County.

Having maintained a presence in Texas for over 15 years, Google confirms this new commitment supports a data centre plan across multiple sites.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, says the move is “a major expansion of our commitment to the Lone Star State”.

In a social media post, he explained that the investment is designed to support technological progress, saying: “AI is poised to accelerate a new golden age of American innovation and Texas – with its optimism and talent – is leading the way.

""To power this progress, we must invest in world-leading infrastructure and the people who build it. That's why we are investing more than US$40bn in Texas through 2027 to expand our cloud and AI infrastructure.”

Strategic infrastructure and AI investment

Google says the plan for Armstrong and Haskell Counties will proceed alongside an expanded buildout in Ellis County.

All sites are being positioned to handle the next generation of Search, Maps and AI workloads.

Each location is part of a broader cloud region design that combines capacity, connectivity and energy planning within a single programme.

“We've proudly called Texas home for over 15 years, from our offices and existing data centres, to Waymo in Austin, to Wing deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,” Sundar says.

“Thank you to Governor Greg Abbott for your partnership to drive economic development and innovation – we look forward to Texas being a vital engine that powers the opportunities AI will create for years to come.""

Texas Governor Greg Abbott adds: “This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state. Texas is the epicentre of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.”

Integrating energy solutions with data centre expansion

A core principle of Google's Texas expansion is that new energy is brought to the grid as new data centre capacity becomes available.

The company intends to cover the full costs associated with its operations, while also supporting energy efficiency programmes in local communities.

To this end, Google has confirmed a new US$30m Energy Impact Fund, created to scale and accelerate community energy projects.

This is combined with over 6,200MW of new energy generation and capacity through power purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new data centres in Haskell County is situated next to a solar and battery storage plant.

The colocation is designed to support both day-to-day operations and power stability for the facility. According to Google, energy abundance, grid stability and cost discipline are integral to the planning model for all its Texas campuses.

Developing a skilled workforce for AI infrastructure

Google frames its workforce development plan as a critical component of the construction schedule.

The electrical training ALLIANCE will partner with the company to train existing electrical workers and over 1,700 apprentices in Texas by 2030. Google claims this initiative will more than double the projected pipeline of new electricians in the state.

The company outlines that extensive electrical training is fundamental to its Texas infrastructure strategy, as data centre construction relies on specialist skills in high voltage systems, plant installation and on-site commissioning.

Funding from Google will support the programme, helping to ensure the state’s workforce can grow in parallel with the region’s cloud and AI footprint.

Google states its investment is structured to support the Texas workforce, the statewide infrastructure and the national AI capability that relies on secure, high-capacity data centre regions.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1bf04c82536fe3741602e8c312e9291c:0e73081154844f7cbdfd2c1c5ae94cc4/sundar-pichai-ceo-google-and-alphabet.webp.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:09:11.419137

The facility will help meet growing demand for Google's AI-powered services like Google Cloud, Workspace, Search and Maps that people, businesses and public sector organisations around the world use every day. It will also strengthen the Google Cloud region in The Netherlands, part of the company’s global network of 42 regions that delivers the high-performance and low-latency services that businesses and organizations use to build and scale their own AI-powered solutions. The opening of this new data center is yet another example of Google’s deep commitment to Europe's long-term success, building on 25 years of investment and partnership.

“Digital infrastructure is the backbone of the digital economy, needed to fulfill the country’s AI ambitions. Our continued investments in technical infrastructure, clean energy capacity and job-ready AI skills are directly ensuring that everyone in Winschoten and in The Netherlands remain at the cutting-edge of global tech opportunities,” said Marco Ynema, Google’s data center lead in The Netherlands.

Energy efficiency

Google’s data centres are among the most energy-efficient in the world. The company is committed to responsibly growing its infrastructure in line with its 24/7 carbon-free energy ambition, while applying AI to increase energy availability and resilience in the communities where it operates.

The site in Winschoten is equipped to support off-site heat recovery, meaning the waste heat it produces is available for any future district heating networks to help warm local homes, schools or businesses. The facility has solar panels on the roof and uses advanced air-cooling technology to limit water usage to domestic use.

To date, Google has supported more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy generation capacity in The Netherlands. For example, this year the company announced a first of its kind power purchase agreement (PPA) with Shell, making it the first time a corporate PPA will extend the lifespan of an offshore wind farm. Since Google began purchasing renewable energy in 2010, the company has signed carbon free energy agreements in Europe supporting more than 4.5 gigawatts of new clean energy generation capacity.

Beyond its operations, the company is improving local watershed health near its offices and data centers, with a goal to replenish 120% of the water it consumes, on average, by 2030. In 2021, Google invested €45 million in the construction of a water treatment plant that processes water from the Eemskanaal and supplies it to companies in the Groningen port areas for cooling, including Google's data center in the Eemshaven.

Boosting the digital economy in The Netherlands and Europe

The Netherlands has an incredible opportunity with AI. An Implement Consulting study, commissioned in 2024 by Google, found that generative AI alone could boost The Netherland’s gross domestic product (GDP) by €80-85 billion, amounting to +9% GDP over ten years with widespread adoption. Another study by Implement Consulting, commissioned by Google in 2025, found that public administration in the Netherlands can unlock a €6 billion opportunity solely by adopting generative AI for administrative processes. Digital infrastructure is the engine behind this growing AI economy. Google has invested more than €3.7 billion in The Netherlands in digital infrastructure. According to a study by Deloitte, Google’s historical data center investments in The Netherlands are estimated to have generated an average annual GDP contribution of €1,96 billion in GDP from 2022 to 2024, having supported an average of 12,600 jobs per year during that period.

“The opening of Google's new data center is a critical development for our operations and for the entire Dutch digital ecosystem. As a Google Cloud customer, this increased capacity, especially for AI-powered services, means we can innovate faster, maintain high performance, and scale our business with greater confidence. Moreover, Google's ongoing investment in digital infrastructure and clean energy directly supports the country’s AI ambitions, making a tangible contribution to the growth and competitiveness of the Dutch economy overall.” said Jan Baan, CEO, Omoda.

Google broke ground on the site in December 2023. Already today, Google works with nearly 160 Dutch suppliers, including 77 from the province of Groningen, for its data center operations in the country. Google’s data center facilities in The Netherlands, including the site in Winschoten, currently create jobs for approximately 700 people in full-time and contractor roles — from computer technicians to electrical and mechanical engineers, to security, catering and facilities management.

Alderman Erich Wünker, Alderman for Economic Affairs and Land Development & Services for the municipality of Oldambt, is proud of Google's location in Oldambt on behalf of the Municipal Executive. ""It's a company with international appeal. Ultramodern, progressive in areas like sustainability, technology, and data centers. Not just for now, but also for the future."" International, but also clearly linked to the region and Oldambt itself, according to Wünker, especially when it comes to employment. ""It involves several dozen structural jobs, in various roles; from technology to security."" Wünker praises the contact and collaboration between the municipality of Oldambt and Google, such as the future Circular Center. ""Google is clearly demonstrating that the company also cares about the local economy and takes responsibility for it.""

Circular Center in Winschoten

Google wants to be a good neighbour and support its data center communities, and has contributed over 2.5 million euros to the communities surrounding its Dutch facilities since 2018, supporting over 80 community initiatives across education, digital skilling and more.

Google is also announcing a partnership with the municipality of Oldambt, WerkPro, Afeer and Cosis, to develop a Circular Centre right across the data center site. This initiative aims to foster a circular economy by collecting, sorting, and reusing materials, while also serving as a social and educational hub. Key operations include repair services and the dismantling of electrical goods, both promoting social inclusion and employment. The project also integrates educational opportunities, guiding 12 students annually in practical, circular economy-focused learning. The modular shed, approximately 196 m² across two floors, will employ approximately 10 full-time workers and process 10 to 12 tons of material annually once fully operational..

Google’s investments enable the advancement of AI and digital technologies creating significant opportunities for Europe to enhance economic competitiveness, productivity, and scientific progress in service of thriving and sustainable societies. Google is dedicated to playing a vital role in this journey by providing essential products and services, investing in critical infrastructure, supporting workforce upskilling, enhancing cybersecurity and safety, and collaborating throughout Europe to develop and deploy AI responsibly for the benefit of all.",https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/image/GC_socialsharing.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:06:06.145339

News Release

Thanks to solar and nuclear, U.S. power generation to grow 57% by 2050

EIR report details coal’s exit, renewable energy trends, and the future of U.S. electricity supply

CALGARY, Alberta (Nov. 18, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the most trusted energy-dedicated SaaS company that leverages generative AI across its solutions, is releasing its long-term U.S. power capacity expansion outlook, based on proprietary load forecasts, interconnection queue analytics and technology cost curves.

EIR projects a 57% increase in installed U.S. power capacity by 2050, driven by three distinct eras: rapid solar energy growth through 2028, a mid-term shift as coal-fired power is fully retired and replaced by natural gas and nuclear power, and steady long-term growth led by the ramp-up of the U.S. nuclear industry. Renewable energy installations are expected to peak in 2028 but remain competitive, supported by ongoing demand for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and low costs.

“Our analysis shows the U.S. grid is entering a transformative period, with solar installations surging in the near term and nuclear power taking a leading role in the decades ahead. The retirement of coal and the rise of new technologies will reshape regional generation mixes and drive innovation in grid reliability and energy sustainability,” said Juan Arteaga, PhD, principal analyst at EIR.

Key takeaways:

Installed U.S. power capacity is forecast to grow 57% by 2050, with three eras: rapid solar energy growth (2025–2035), coal replacement (2035–2040) and steady nuclear expansion (2040–2050).

Renewable energy installations will peak in 2028 but remain competitive as tax credits phase out, thanks to strong PPA demand and low costs.

Coal-fired power is projected to be fully retired by 2040, replaced evenly by natural gas and nuclear power. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region will see over 25 GW of fuel switching.

Wind energy, natural gas and nuclear power are the most load-sensitive technologies, with capacity buildout remaining relatively inelastic to changes in demand.

Battery storage and gas peaker plants will play a crucial role in grid reliability, while combined-cycle natural gas and nuclear plants provide essential baseload support.

EIR’s analysis pulls from a variety of products including Enverus PRISM, Enverus FOUNDATIONS® – Power & Renewables and Enverus Instant Analyst™.

Johanna ESS: 20MW/80MWh facility in Santa Ana, CA

Desert-Carris: 20MW/40MWh facility in Palm Springs, CA

Ortega: 20MW/40MWh facility in Lake Elsinore, CA

This portfolio spans multiple locations across Southern California, reducing risk and improving reliability. All four facilities participate in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market, providing critical grid services including energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, and resource adequacy capacity.

BDO USA, one of the nation's leading accounting and advisory firms, served as the tax credit transfer advisor on this transaction. BDO's Business Incentives & Tax Credits practice assists clients in the generation, compliance, and monetization of tax credits.

""Tax credit transfers have become a strategic lever for accelerating clean energy deployment,"" said Gabe Rubio, a Principal of BDO. ""By connecting investors and developers with aligned goals, these transactions streamline capital flow and strengthen confidence in the energy storage market's long-term growth potential.""

Fullmark Energy secured nearly $100 million in financing for the Redwood Projects in January 2023 through a consolidated term loan and letter of credit facility. The portfolio financing structure optimized capital efficiency and reduced transaction costs compared to individual project financing.

Fullmark Energy's develop-build-own-operate business model differentiates the company from more transactional developers. By maintaining long-term ownership, Fullmark Energy prioritizes operational performance and community relationships throughout each project's lifecycle.

Belém, Brazil (November 18, 2025) – The ocean is increasingly being recognized in national climate plans – but most countries are still overlooking the most powerful actions to cut emissions and build resilience, according to a new report led by World Resources Institute (WRI), with Ocean Conservancy and Ocean & Climate Platform, released today at COP30 in Belém.

Of 66 newly submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from coastal and island countries, 61 include at least one ocean-related measure*. That marks an increase from 62% in 2015, to 73% in 2022, and now 92% of NDCs submitted so far for the 2025 NDC cycle.

Yet the most transformative measures – such as phasing out offshore oil and gas, decarbonizing shipping, expanding offshore renewables, and scaling sustainable seafood – remain rare, making up just 12% of ocean actions. Countries are still only scratching the surface of the ocean’s climate potential.

Research from the Ocean Panel shows that ocean-based climate solutions can deliver up to 35% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2050 – a major missed opportunity if left untapped.

“With the window to cut emissions rapidly closing, coastal and island countries yet to submit their NDCs must recognize the ocean as a powerful, underused ally in meeting global climate goals.” said Tom Pickerell, Global Director for WRI's Ocean Program. “Despite growing momentum, ocean-based climate solutions remain underfunded and overlooked. What’s needed at this COP is bold recognition of the ocean’s potential – and action to deploy proven solutions at scale.""

Some countries are already showing how integrating ocean action across sectors can advance both climate and development goals.

Republic of the Marshall Islands: Its NDC includes cutting domestic shipping emissions by 40% by 2030, testing innovative Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion technology to generate clean energy, and managing fisheries to safeguard cultural heritage and livelihoods. The country has also designated nearly 48,000 km² of ocean as protected sanctuaries.

Brazil: Its NDC aims to generate 16 GW of offshore wind energy by 2050 and establish the regulatory framework to make this expansion possible – creating jobs, strengthening energy independence and advancing a clean energy future for the country.

Separate research by the Ocean Panel suggests that every $1 invested in ocean solutions could yield at least $5 in global benefits by 2050. Conversely, continuing harmful and unsustainable ocean practices could result in more than $8 trillion in losses by 2050.

“There's a huge gap between the promise of ocean-climate solutions and the pace at which we are adopting them,” said Anna-Maria Laura, Senior Director of Climate Policy at Ocean Conservancy. “The gap isn’t in science or technology – it’s in funding and implementation. The ocean is sounding the alarm through stronger storms, dying coral reefs, and rising seas. But the ocean can also help us fight back through solutions like offshore wind. It’s time to fund and implement these solutions as if the future of our ocean and our planet depend on them – because they do.”

The report also highlights the urgent need for countries to rapidly step up measures to adapt to the effects of a changing climate. Island and coastal countries face especially high stakes, with over 680 million people currently living in low-lying coastal zones at risk from rising seas and coastal erosion – a figure expected to surpass 1 billion by 2050.

The latest NDCs show some progress on adaptation: in fact, over 90% of ocean actions focus on adaptation, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and Oceania. Yet the pace and scale of action remain far too low to protect vulnerable communities and livelihoods, and gaps in technology and knowledge transfer hold back effective action. Alarmingly, just 13% of ocean-based actions explicitly address equity, even though women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, and local coastal communities are often hit hardest by climate impacts.

To help close these gaps, the Blue NDC Challenge, launched earlier this year by France and Brazil, helps countries in strengthen and implement ocean-climate actions in their national commitments. Coordinated by WRI, the Ocean & Climate Platform and Ocean Conservancy, the Challenge welcomes six new members today at COP30 – Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal and Singapore. Together, these countries will form the Blue NDC Taskforce to drive implementation of ocean commitments in the 2025 NDC cycle, by mobilizing political leadership, technical expertise and investment.

“Meeting global climate goals won’t happen in isolation,” said Melanie Robinson, said WRI’s Global Climate, Economics and Finance Program Director. “Countries, communities, and organizations must work together – sharing knowledge, aligning policies and scaling solutions. Initiatives like the Blue NDC Challenge show how collaboration can transform promises into action, shielding coastal communities from rising seas, creating green jobs, and charting the world toward a cleaner, more resilient future.”

“As countries move from promises to action, this round of climate plans must serve as clear roadmaps for guiding every step of the journey,"" said Loreley Picourt, Executive Director of the Ocean & Climate Platform. ""By directing investment, building capacity and scaling solutions, we can secure a resilient ocean – but if we fail, we risk undermining the foundation of life on our planet.”

EVs are still nowhere near as profitable or as popular as gas cars, yet they’re a necessity from a regulatory standpoint.","Porsche has come to grips with the reality that EV uptake isn’t progressing as rapidly as anticipated a few years ago. In early 2022, outgoing CEO Oliver Blume projected that as many as 80 percent of new car sales would be fully electric. That ambitious target is no longer in place, and the new plan is simple yet effective: giving people what they want.

Australia’s Drive magazine spoke with Porsche’s local Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, who revealed the updated strategy is to cater to both sides. Daniel Schmollinger said the intent is to provide “freedom of choice for the customer depending on where they stand in terms of being ready for electric or still loving petrol [models].”

As a member of the Volkswagen Group, Porsche is in a fortunate position to remain flexible and respond to varying customer tastes. For example, it’s fast-tracking the development of a new gas crossover related to the Audi Q5 to replace the original Macan. Originally not part of the plan, the confirmed successor, which won't be called Macan, is expected to ride on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) already used by several Audi models.

Speaking of gas engines, the Cayenne and Panamera will keep their big ol’ V-8 well into the next decade. The next Boxster and Cayman will be mostly electric, but the top versions will retain a combustion engine, possibly a hybrid flat-six adapted from the 911 GTS. Whatever the future holds for the 718, it will be outlived by the 911. Zuffenhausen has repeatedly said it wants the iconic 911 to go down in history as the brand’s final combustion-engine car.

For those ready to switch to electric, the second-generation Macan and Taycan will be joined later this week by an electric Cayenne. Codenamed “K1,” a future three-row SUV will offer both ICE and EV derivatives, despite earlier plans to sell the luxobarge exclusively with electric drivetrains.

Schmollinger argued Porsche can align its product portfolio to satisfy demand:

'We don’t judge, whatever you feel like is fine for us, and we are in a position from a production point of view to react to what the market wants.'

But a notable void in the portfolio is looming. The first-generation Macan will be discontinued in mid-2026, and a replacement isn’t due until 2028. The gap will put a serious dent in volume, considering the smaller of Porsche’s two crossovers has always been near the top of the sales rankings. The ICE Macan’s absence is already being felt in Europe, where the model had to be discontinued last year for failing to meet new cybersecurity regulations.

With the VW Group’s backing, Porsche is strong enough to bounce back after grossly overestimating the rise of EVs. But the bigger picture matters, especially with the European Union dead set on abolishing sales of new combustion-engine cars from 2035. That mandate is one of the main reasons so many legacy automakers are aggressively pushing EVs. Additionally, stricter EU regulations are forcing companies to sell more electric cars to lower their fleet emissions and avoid hefty fines.

All told, automakers are caught between a rock and a hard place. EVs are still nowhere near as profitable or as popular as gas cars, yet they’re a necessity from a regulatory standpoint.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/BXYgzR/s1/2025-porsche-panamera-4s-e-hybrid-review.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:05:44.521071

Back in late 2023, Grid Strategies offered an early warning about how data centers were causing power demand to spike.
For another, the gold-rush quality of the data center boom is leading developers to make speculative proposals for projects that may never materialize.
This is particularly important for the rising number of data centers being planned that will use a gigawatt or more of power — the equivalent of a small city’s total power demand.
Meanwhile, in Georgia, major utility Georgia Power is seeking regulator permission to build gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity to meet load forecasts swollen by proposed data centers.","Surging power demand from new data centers is reaching unprecedented — and potentially unrealizable — heights.

Over the next five years, U.S. utilities expect to see new electricity demand equal to 15 times New York City’s peak load, the majority of which will come from data centers.

So finds a report released Tuesday by Grid Strategies tracking the growth in power demand for data centers being built and planned to feed tech giants’ artificial intelligence ambitions. The consultancy’s tally of utility load forecasts indicates that peak grid demand will boom to 166 gigawatts by 2030, a sixfold increase from what was forecast three years ago.

“These are just phenomenal numbers for an industry that was built over the past couple of decades to handle much lower load growth,” said John Wilson, Grid Strategies’ vice president and the report’s lead author.

Data centers make up roughly 90 gigawatts of that forecasted load growth, a reflection of the hundreds of billions of dollars that tech giants are pouring into AI, as well as smaller but still substantial investments in crypto-mining operations, enterprise cloud computing, telecommunications, and other IT services.

Back in late 2023, Grid Strategies offered an early warning about how data centers were causing power demand to spike. It has also cautioned that outsize plans for growth in key U.S. data center hot spots are threatening to exceed the physical capacity of power plants and power grids. These factors could result in higher costs for consumers and more carbon emissions as utilities plan to ramp up fossil-fuel use to serve new demand.

But Grid Strategies and others have also counseled that utilities might be exaggerating things.

For one, there’s lots of double-counting going on; data center developers often pitch the same project in multiple utility jurisdictions while searching for the best deal. For another, the gold-rush quality of the data center boom is leading developers to make speculative proposals for projects that may never materialize.

For its new report, Grid Strategies compared utility forecasts with alternative methods of projecting data center load growth, such as industry analysis of technological bottlenecks, and found that utilities may be overstating data center demand by as much as 40%.

That discrepancy indicates how utility forecasts need to better reflect underlying uncertainties, Wilson said. This is particularly important for the rising number of data centers being planned that will use a gigawatt or more of power — the equivalent of a small city’s total power demand.

“The fact that these facilities are city-sized is a huge deal,” Wilson said. ​“That has huge implications if these facilities get canceled, or they get built and don’t have long service lives.”

The rising costs of the data center boom

Utilities are using their sky-high forecasts to justify massive investments in power plants and grid infrastructure around the United States.

Those forecasts, in turn, have already driven up utility bills in some regions, including those for many of the more than 67 million people served by PJM Interconnection, the country’s biggest energy market. For PJM, future data center forecasts have driven capacity costs — the prices paid to power plants and other grid resources to meet peak grid demand — from $2.2 billion in 2023 to $14.7 billion in 2024 and to $16.1 billion in this summer’s capacity auction.

PJM customers in heavily impacted states like New Jersey are taking notice. Popular anger at rising bills helped propel Democratic gubernatorial candidates who pledged to combat increasing power costs to outsize wins in New Jersey and Virginia elections earlier this month.

Many utilities aim to meet this surging demand by building new fossil-gas-fired power plants, which could not only increase costs for customers but also slow down the transition to clean energy. Across much of the Southeast and the Midwest, in particular, utilities aim to build gigawatts’ worth of these power plants, which emit carbon dioxide as well as toxic air pollution.

In Virginia, home of the world’s largest data center hub, Dominion Energy is proposing gigawatts of new gas-fired power that, critics warn, could make it impossible for the utility to meet a state-mandated phaseout of fossil fuel use by 2045. The utility argues that the plants are needed to maintain reliability in the face of data center growth.

Meanwhile, in Georgia, major utility Georgia Power is seeking regulator permission to build gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity to meet load forecasts swollen by proposed data centers. Opponents fear that the plants will balloon already fast-rising utility bills, and this month voters overwhelmingly elected to the state’s Public Service Commission two Democratic challengers who ran on a platform of constraining unchecked utility spending.

Elsewhere, state lawmakers, regulators, and data center developers are seeking ways to accommodate growth without overwhelming the grid and utility customers.

In Texas, the country’s second-hottest data center market outside of Virginia, ​“large load” forecasts within the territory served by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) have nearly quadrupled over the past year, representing a potential doubling of its peak demand. The state legislature passed a law this spring that requires new data centers to disconnect at moments of peak grid stress, although the rules for how that will happen are still being worked out by ERCOT and state regulators.

Other states are also passing laws and instituting regulations aimed at forcing data center developers to bear the cost of new power plants and grid infrastructure. And some data center companies are promising to shift when they use power in order to relieve peak grid strains that drive much of the costs that utilities face. PJM, for its part, is considering new rules aimed at requiring new data centers to reduce their impact on the region’s capacity costs, although consumer and environmental advocates say the grid operator’s proposed plans don’t go far enough.

The Grid Strategies report also highlights that U.S. utilities and grid operators haven’t yet committed to expanding the transmission grid at the scale needed to support the growing electrification of vehicles, buildings, and industries — however the data center demand plays out. ​“Even conservative growth trajectories outpace recent years and would require substantial grid expansion to accommodate,” it notes.

Ultimately, Wilson suggested that utilities, lawmakers, and regulators will need to make sure the cost of meeting whatever demand does materialize is not shifted to everyday customers.

“We’ve got a gigantic amount of additional load over the next five years to manage from a supply-chain, planning, and construction standpoint,” he said. ​“These are questions that regulators and intervenors should be asking, and not just trusting the utilities, who say, ​‘This is the way we’ve always done it.’”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2153309243.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a5cfd88c1a0fca44b17f315b93191843,N,,2025-11-18 12:07:13.224742

Blair said the White House will look “as hard as possible” to see if they can issue dividend checks without Capitol Hill approval, but also expressed skepticism.

“We will look as hard as possible to see if there’s a way to do it without Congress because we’re circumspect about Congress wanting to stop [them],” Blair said at a Bloomberg Government event on Tuesday. “The law is the law. I think that the most likely outcome is, it requires an act of Congress.”

Blair also added that the checks could be a factor in another reconciliation bill. The top official acknowledged the Supreme Court’s odds of striking down President Donald Trump‘s tariffs are “50-50,” but said the president can reissue them through a different means.

Blair’s comments follow Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remarks that the checks would “need legislation” and require congressional input.

The administration has made the argument that tariff revenue will likely outweigh any short-term pain Americans may face for increased costs.

Trump has eased some tariffs for Latin American nations for everyday household items such as coffee and bananas.

With this harmful plan, the Biden Administration put their “Green New Scam” agenda before the Alaskan people and the wellbeing of our country, ignoring the views of Alaska Native leaders in the region and imposing federal red-tape that blocks some of the state’s best resource development opportunities. The economic impacts from crushing development will only harm Alaska and hardworking Americans, cutting down on the good paying jobs and economic benefits that come with domestic production.

Today, House Republicans are bringing legislation to reverse this burdensome and damaging Biden-era plan to lock up NPR-A. It’s past time we unlock Alaska’s full potential and unleash its extensive energy resources, safeguarding jobs, shoring up energy security, and lowering costs for Americans.

Sen. Dan Sullivan’s legislation, S.J. Res. 80, reverses the Biden Bureau of Land Management's 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska that blocks oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve, hurting energy production and crushing job creation.

House Republicans continue working to undo the damage the Biden Administration did to our energy sector and, in turn, our national security.

Reversing a Biden-Era RMP Amendment Crushing the Buffalo Coal Industry

Last November, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) Amendment for the Buffalo Field Office located in Buffalo, Wyoming, which guides the management of BLM lands, including land use allocations of areas available for further coal leasing consideration and those that are not.

Staying consistent with their radical ‘Green New Scam’ policies and anti-American energy agenda, the Biden Administration’s RMP Amendment locked up all 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate administered by the Buffalo Field Office, allocating ZERO acres of BLM administered coal as available and making 48.12 billion short tons of coal unavailable for leasing consideration.

Wyoming produces around 40 percent of the nation’s coal, and the industry supports over 4,000 jobs in rural Wyoming, $1.9 billion in labor output through 2048, and millions of dollars in state revenue used to fund public education. This radical RMP Amendment essentially ended coal leasing in the area with the BLM accepting no new coal lease applications – crushing domestic energy production, endangering access to affordable, reliable American energy, killing jobs, and harming the economy in Wyoming.

Today, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to overturn the Biden BLM’s disastrous RMP Amendment that crushes domestic production in Wyoming, unleashing American energy development, keeping energy prices affordable and reliable, and protecting Wyoming jobs and economy.

H.J. Res. 130, introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, reverses the rule submitted by Biden’s Bureau of Land Management relating to “Buffalo Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment” that threatens Americans’ access to affordable and reliable energy by locking up 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate, preventing future coal leasing, and blocking access to 48 billion short-tons of coal in Wyoming.

Energy security is national security. House Republicans won’t stop fighting to unleash American energy and keep the U.S. energy dominant by cutting Biden-era energy-crushing and job-killing regulations.

Unleashing Energy in Alaska’s Coastal Plain

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required the Secretary of the Interior to ‘‘establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain’’ and mandated energy leasing in the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) with the support of local North Slope communities.

However, when President Biden took office, his administration halted or cancelled all the lease sales relating to the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program, and in December 2024, the Biden Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued their “Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision (ROD)” – which manages the leasing program – to replace the 2020 ROD issued during President Trump’s first term.

The Coastal Plain consists of 1.5 million acres within ANWR on Alaska’s North Slope. The Biden BLM’s harmful ROD blocks energy production on 1.16 million acres of the area and makes the remaining acreage subject to strict and burdensome federal red tape, threatening Alaska’s economy, our energy security, and in turn, our national security.

We should be encouraging domestic energy production, not blocking it, so we can stop relying on foreign nations for our energy – especially since we produce energy much cleaner and safer than anywhere else in the world. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to undo this disastrous Biden-era ROD and unleash Alaska’s natural resources to support the state’s economic interests as well as our national energy security.

Rep. Nick Begich’s legislation, H.J. Res. 131, nullifies the Biden Bureau of Land Management’s “Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision (ROD)” rule that unduly restricts oil and gas leasing in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska, violating federal law and threatening U.S. energy independence.

The November 7 ruling, expected to be published in the Federal Register in the coming weeks, positions Texas as the third state this year—after Arizona and West Virginia—to gain permitting authority under the Trump administration’s accelerated primacy review approach.

The decision marks a significant shift for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) developers across the state. Until now, companies seeking to build Class VI wells were required to navigate a dual permitting structure with both EPA and the RRC. Primacy consolidates those functions under a single agency, with EPA oversight remaining in place for wells on tribal lands and final concurrence required on each permit decision.

Streamlining CCS Permitting in the Nation’s Largest Energy State

Texas submitted its Class VI program revision in February 2025. EPA’s evaluation, outlined in the pre-publication rule, found that Texas’ regulatory framework, enforcement authority, and technical program met federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The RRC’s long history regulating Class II CO₂ injection wells for enhanced oil recovery—numbering more than any other state—was a central factor in that determination.

The RRC expects to issue up to 25 Class VI permits within the first two years of primacy. This could significantly reduce the current backlog of CCS applications, many of which stalled during EPA’s historically long federal review timelines. For developers, faster permits mean timely access to federal 45Q tax credits, which remain a key incentive for large-scale carbon storage projects.

New Market Pathways for CO₂ Storage

Primacy also opens the door to CCS projects that have been unable to pursue Class VI wells due to delays. To date, most Texas carbon storage activity has occurred through Class II wells tied to oilfield operations, limiting the ability to inject CO₂ from industrial or power-sector sources at higher volumes.

With primacy in place, developers are expected to pursue larger geologic storage hubs capable of accepting CO₂ from refineries, LNG facilities, cement production, and petrochemical complexes along the Gulf Coast. Texas’ existing CO₂ pipeline network—already one of the most extensive in the country—strengthens the state’s competitive position for emerging storage markets.

Project developers will still need a “Letter of Determination” from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality verifying no conflicts with Class I wells, though EPA notes the requirement should not pose significant obstacles given the remote locations of Texas’ most suitable geologic formations.

Legal and Environmental Challenges Remain Possible

EPA received more than 7,500 public comments on the Texas proposal, including concerns from environmental organizations questioning the RRC’s enforcement track record. Similar challenges have been filed in Louisiana and West Virginia following their primacy approvals, though the Fifth Circuit dismissed the Louisiana case earlier this year for lack of standing.

Despite potential legal pushback, financial drivers continue to favor rapid CCS deployment.

But sometimes renewable energy producers have to curtail output during oversupply periods, for economic and non-economic reasons.
Economic curtailment is a growing reality for renewable energy generators, according to the Commonwealth Bank's markets research team.
CommBank also pointed out there were non-financial reasons for renewable generators to curtail output.
Mr Nugent said long-term revenue certainty for renewable energy projects had been a challenge in the back end.","When the sun is blazing and the wind is blowing, it is supposed to be the Australian electricity generators' most fruitful time of day.

But sometimes renewable energy producers have to curtail output during oversupply periods, for economic and non-economic reasons.

To incentivise households to use that abundant energy, the federal government has instituted schemes such as the three-hour free electricity period in some states and a national battery subsidy.

So what does it mean, and how is it going to affect you?

Here's what we know.

What is curtailment?

Curtailment is when energy generators put out less electricity than they have the capacity to — that is, curtailing or reining in their generation.

This can be due to economic constraints (when there is oversupply, so generators decide producing power would be uneconomic), or capacity constraints (when the transmission networks are at their limits).

Why is curtailment necessary?

Economic curtailment is a growing reality for renewable energy generators, according to the Commonwealth Bank's markets research team.

The occurrence of zero, or even negative, spot wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM) meant power generation during some periods — mainly the middle of the day — was uneconomic, it said.

In the second quarter of 2025, 10.6 per cent of ""price intervals"" — the individual blocks of time in which prices are set — recorded negative or zero prices, up from 7 per cent in the same period a year earlier, CommBank found.

Utility-scale wind and solar generators curtailed about 10 per cent and 7 per cent of generation, respectively, in 2024-25, according to the research.

Dan Nugent, a trading and transition executive from Energy Australia, said that the curtailment itself did not directly increase bills, but the broader system costs of managing renewable intermittency could.

""Economic curtailment of renewable generation is an inevitable feature of transitioning to a high-renewables grid,"" he told the ABC.

""Our approach is to build flexible, long-duration storage projects like [the] Wooreen BESS (battery energy storage system) that can charge during high renewable output and dispatch when needed most, reducing both curtailment and the need for expensive peaking generation.

CommBank also pointed out there were non-financial reasons for renewable generators to curtail output.

These reasons were typically ""tied to network constraints and system strength requirements"", the bank's researchers said.

How is this linked to your electricity bill?

To prevent large amounts of solar power from going to waste, the federal government is offering up to three hours of free electricity each day to households in New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland.

According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), on average, a residential electricity bill for 2023-24 comprised:

Wholesale electricity costs — 38 per cent

Retail and other costs — 10 per cent

Retail margin — 6 per cent

Network costs — 39 per cent

Environmental costs — 7 per cent

Mr Nugent said the transmission network was one of the biggest cost contributors to Australians' energy bills, but ""behind-the-meter"" batteries could help.

Behind-the-meter refers to storage that is owned by customers, for example, households.

When such batteries were operated as a virtual power plant (VPP) — a network of distributed energy resources such as home solar panels — they could be ""treated like almost another power station in the NEM"", Mr Nugent said.

If you're enrolled in a VPP, your solar battery could help support the electricity grid by releasing stored energy during high-demand periods.

What support is available for businesses and homeowners?

The Commonwealth government has introduced the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) and the Cheaper Home Batteries Program (CHBP), aiming to help store more solar power.

The CIS essentially provides a long-term revenue safety net for power generators, while the CHBP helps lower costs for Australians to install more batteries.

Mr Nugent said long-term revenue certainty for renewable energy projects had been a challenge in the back end.

""Basically, you bid a revenue floor for what you require, and you also bid a ceiling.

""And so you get revenue protection up to 90 per cent of the floor up to a cap … if you outperform that year and you go above the ceiling, then you share back at 50 per cent [of the revenue] with the Commonwealth government.""

Apart from greater revenue certainty, Mr Nugent said the CIS also helped support storage projects to shift energy from oversupply periods into the evening peak.

""All the battery projects we have had CIS funding support for are all four-hour batteries … [which] will cover that peak period between say 5pm and 9pm on a daily basis,"" he said.

""The major role for the first batteries was around network support and … to help stabilise the grid.

""However, as we're getting deeper into the energy transition, longer-duration batteries will need to play a greater role in moving energy on a daily basis.""

Do we see battery uptake?

Yes.

Rooftop solar contributed 12.8 per cent of Australia's total energy generation from January to June this year, according to a Clean Energy Council (CEC) half-yearly report.

There were now 4.2 million rooftop solar installations across Australian homes and businesses, representing 26.8 gigawatts of generation capacity, the council said.

The report also noted a 191 per cent increase in battery sales compared to the same period in 2024.

""A record-breaking 85,000 battery units were sold in the first half of 2025, with a spike in the second quarter in the lead-up to the federal and WA residential home battery programs going live,"" it said.

The CEC described this as ""a significant result"", which increased nearly fivefold since 2022, when the battery sales reached 7,091.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1140131d8817fade28c64e8c6542f02d?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2250&cropW=4000&xPos=0&yPos=207&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-18 12:06:26.410702

(Reuters) — Venture Global said on Nov. 17 it had asked the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to more than double the capacity of its Plaquemines liquefied natural gas export facility under development in Louisiana.

The company wants to add 30 million metric tons per year (MMtpy) of additional LNG capacity to the previously approved 28 MMtpy. Plaquemines is already the second-largest LNG facility in the U.S. and last month was responsible for 22% of total exports from the country, according to data from financial firm LSEG.

""Our decision to significantly increase the project’s permitted capacity reflects the strong market demand we continue to see and this expansion will play a vital role in meeting that demand,"" Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said in a statement.

The proposed expansion would allow the company to produce over 100 million MMtpy of the liquid fuel and challenge QatarEnergy and Cheniere as the world's top exporter of LNG.

A mere startup three years ago, Venture Global quickly became the second-largest U.S. LNG exporter with a business model that lets it export cargoes while construction and commissioning phases are still underway.

The strategy has allowed the company to profit from higher spot market prices before it begins supplying longer-term customers, but the practice has also resulted in arbitration cases and lawsuits from customers that include several of the world's largest energy companies.

The Plaquemines expansion will be built incrementally in three phases and consist of 32 modular liquefaction trains, the company said.

Venture Global has also filed an application with the U.S. Department of Energy for the export authorizations associated with the additional planned capacity, the company said.",https://pgjonline.com/media/9909/venture-global-lng-cropped.png?v=1dc1b2422c7e310,N,,2025-11-18 13:05:08.328764

On completion of this work, Li-S Energy said it expects to engage with strategic and joint-venture partners to collaborate on delivery of the facility.
“This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production,” he said.
“By supporting Li-S Energy’s plans to scale up lithium-sulfur battery production, we are helping to fast-track the commercialisation of breakthrough battery technologies,” he said.
“Batteries are essential to the clean energy transition, both for energy storage and transport.","Li-S Energy has been awarded a $7.86 million (USD 5.1 million) grant by the federal government to support its plans to build a giga-scale lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cell production facility as it moves towards commercialisation of its next-generation energy storage solutions.

Brisbane-headquartered Li-S Energy is aiming to build a manufacturing plant targeting an eventual output of up to 1 GWh per year of battery cell capacity – 500 times the capacity of the company’s existing 2 MWh automated production line at Geelong in Victoria.

The company said the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funding will enable it to undertake a manufacturing optimisation program, a feasibility study and front-end engineering design (FEED) for the proposed manufacturing plant. On completion of this work, Li-S Energy said it expects to engage with strategic and joint-venture partners to collaborate on delivery of the facility.

Li-S Energy Chief Executive Officer Lee Finniear said the new funding is a major step towards commercialising the company’s tech as it targets the rapidly growing drone, defence and electric aviation markets where weight is critical.

“This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production,” he said.

“It will help meet growing demand for lightweight batteries in drones, defence, aerospace and other relevant high-value commercial markets. In particular, it strengthens domestic supply chains and backs Australian innovation to deliver commercial production right here in Australia.”

Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to deliver up to twice the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries with Li-S Energy having already manufactured full size 10Ah semi-solid-state cells at its existing Geelong production facility that deliver an energy density of 498 Wh/kg on first discharge and 456 Wh/kg after formation cycling, with the cells continuing to cycle in ongoing testing.

The company said momentum is now accelerating across its operations and technology with its proprietary lithium-sulfur chemistry and manufacturing processes generating strong commercial interest.

“Over the last year we have signed commercial partnerships with a number of businesses across the drone and defence sectors,” Li-S Energy said, adding that “demonstrating the ability to scale production is a key enabler for customer adoption and offtake agreements.”

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project reflects the federal agency’s commitment to build sovereign domestic manufacturing capability and accelerate innovation in energy storage.

“By supporting Li-S Energy’s plans to scale up lithium-sulfur battery production, we are helping to fast-track the commercialisation of breakthrough battery technologies,” he said.

“Batteries are essential to the clean energy transition, both for energy storage and transport. That’s why it’s critical we keep advancing innovations that improve performance, increase energy density and drive down costs.”

Our live pricing pilots have been successful so far, reducing congestion while increasing utilization.
We see improved load balancing, especially when there are multiple Supercharger sites nearby.” However, as Tesla expands live pricing, it also faces some threats.
Just in case, they display a higher expected price than forecasted: “A lot of focus is on getting the forecast as accurate as possible, so customers get the bracket they expected.","Tesla is now expanding its live pricing pilot, initially launched in May 2025 at about 10 Supercharging stations in California. Prices now change in real-time, depending on utilization at an additional 550 Supercharging stations in California, New Jersey, New York, Florida, and Illinois.

The new approach enables the company to change pricing depending on how many EVs are actively charging at a particular station (how many stalls are occupied) and how many EVs head to that station (info from the navigation system), as well as how many EVs are forecasted to visit it soon (historical data).

It seems like a better solution compared to fixed on-peak and off-peak rates for specific periods. It’s dynamic and will function like a supply-and-demand model. The real value of DC fast charging should be reflected in pricing more accurately.

The manufacturer notes that the average price and peak prices remain unchanged. Interestingly, the highest rates are expected to be paid by fewer sessions:

“Currently the average price remains the same, peak prices are unchanged and will be paid by fewer sessions.”

Max de Zegher, Tesla’s Director of Charging North America (@MdeZegher / X), wrote that the live pricing pilot has been successful so far, delivering the desired results: a reduction in congestion during peak periods and an increase in utilization.

“A live feedback loop is better than a static one. Our live pricing pilots have been successful so far, reducing congestion while increasing utilization. We see improved load balancing, especially when there are multiple Supercharger sites nearby.”

However, as Tesla expands live pricing, it also faces some threats. Because the pricing is dynamic now, and a significant component of calculating the “right” price is the forecasted utilization in the next period, Tesla must ensure that it has a very accurate forecast. Just in case, they display a higher expected price than forecasted:

“A lot of focus is on getting the forecast as accurate as possible, so customers get the bracket they expected. We’re slightly biasing forecasts to get a cheaper price than expected, as it’s better to have a positive than negative surprise.”

The user sees the price before starting a charging session. Once accepted, the price remains fixed until the end of the session — it does not change mid-session.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251117-V4Supercharger_96-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 09:59:54.646821

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroads data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

He blamed opaque processes and bad information for fostering massive backlash among residents — prompting local officials to pull their support and tank projects years into development.

Shell Spotlights Louisiana-Built Coastal Technology

“Natrx is the company it is today, thanks in large part to Shell,” said co-founder Tyler Ortego. “Shortly after our founding, Shell selected Natrx for its energy start-up accelerator, which equipped us with the tools to scale our product and develop the business relationships we needed to succeed. We are thankful to continue partnering with Shell in driving high-tech solutions to protect South Louisiana and preserve our Sportsman’s Paradise.”

Natrx’s early relationship with Shell began in 2019, when the company won the Shell GameChanger program, gaining access to mentorship and resources that helped it refine its technology and expand its commercial capabilities. The company has since grown from its initial research and development at LSU to full-scale manufacturing at its ExoForms production facility in Amelia, which now serves projects across the United States and abroad.

Statewide Recognition at Louisiana Innovation Day

That momentum was highlighted again at Louisiana Innovation Day, an LED-hosted symposium showcasing the state’s business climate and emerging innovation sector. LED unveiled a new video campaign featuring Natrx and three other Louisiana-grown companies as examples of how startups can launch, scale, and manufacture in the state. The Natrx film spotlights the company’s “Cajun Coral” adaptive reef and shoreline technology and follows the deployment of ExoForms across coastal Louisiana and international project sites.

Ortego said the company’s deep Louisiana roots have shaped its approach to addressing habitat loss and land erosion. “Our experience here helped us build solutions tailored to coastal environments while finding the partners and resources needed to scale,” he said.

Coastal Projects Across the Gulf South

Natrx and Shell have since partnered on multiple resilience and habitat-building projects throughout the Gulf South, ranging from artificial reefs that increase marine life to living shorelines that protect vulnerable coasts.

The company uses proprietary flow, wave, and wind modeling to design site-specific infrastructure solutions and measures biological performance through indicators such as species presence and changes in marsh health. Recent case studies have shown that Natrx ExoForms outperformed traditional rock breakwaters during hurricane conditions.

Expanding Impact Through Local Partnerships

The partnership expanded further in 2021 when Natrx, working with Danos Corporation, completed four shoreline-protection projects for Shell Pipeline Company LP in Louisiana marshes threatened by erosion. Danos served as the implementing contractor, manufacturing, transporting, and installing Cajun Coral units while the project team used satellite monitoring to track vegetation growth and biodiversity around the sites.

Natrx and Danos also joined Lafourche Parish Government and AIMS Group, Inc. in 2023 to celebrate the installation of a living shoreline at Lockport Bayouside Park, part of a growing number of Louisiana-based resilience projects using ExoForms.

Electric utilities that power America have different plans.

Despite forecasts for spiking electricity use and pledges from the Department of Energy to bolster nuclear power, utilities aren’t inking contracts to build new plants with the large-scale, light-water reactors that have fueled American homes and businesses for decades.

“I wouldn’t build a nuclear plant,” Exelon CEO Calvin Butler told CNBC last week. “What I could do is lean in on combined-cycle gas turbines. What I could do is build community solar. What I could do is own battery storage.”

Duke Energy, a major utility in the Southeast, is now hedging after laying out loose plans in October to produce more than a gigawatt of new nuclear power by 2037.

“We still need to figure out what we’re going to do with cost overrun protection and how we’re going to protect our investors and our customers from overruns,” Duke CEO Harry Sideris said on an earnings call earlier this month. “Nothing going forward until we have those other items resolved.”

That hesitation is throttling Trump administration plans to reassert U.S. nuclear leadership globally — and to ensure there is enough power in the U.S. to win the artificial intelligence race with China. Experts say new builds are important drivers of industry advancement that will cut costs and boost innovation. They’re also needed to keep powering America with nuclear energy, as many of the 94 reactors in the U.S. near retirement.

“There’s not a single company out there talking about a brand new light water reactor, and that’s where the administration gets frustrated,” an energy lobbyist, who has close ties to administration and was granted anonymity to speak freely, told POLITICO’s E&E News. “The administration is a little tone deaf in understanding the trepidations from a Wall Street standpoint.”

The utility sector is grappling with a laundry list of nuclear concerns. It’s worried about high costs, hits to balance sheets and the availability of enriched uranium in the U.S. following a cut-off from Russian imports in 2028. Utility CEOs are also skeptical that the capital-intensive power will be needed if demand forecasts contract.

Nuclear construction is one of many areas of discord between the White House and utility sector.

Meanwhile, nuclear power is taking off elsewhere around the globe. China is building dozens of new large-scale reactors and dramatically cutting costs to build plants, according to recent academic research out of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University and other institutions.

Federal support

Late last month, the Trump administration and reactor developer Westinghouse announced a “strategic partnership” to build large nuclear plants. The agreement gives the government the option to invest $80 billion into building new U.S. Westinghouse reactors in exchange for profit sharing,

While critical details remain unclear, like which utilities will purchase the power, the investment pledge is the culmination of months of rhetorical boosts for nuclear power.

“I’ve heard about the nuclear renaissance for 20 years,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told the Foundation for American Innovation’s gala last week, according to POLITICO. “We are all in to make it happen, and with all of your help, we will make it happen.”

Meanwhile, DOE is looking for ways to help finance domestic uranium enrichment. And the administration has called forreform and expedited approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is tasked with ensuring nuclear safety.

In a statement, DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said the administration has “taken historic action to accelerate next-generation nuclear deployment,” pointing in part to a DOE loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. That financing was initially approved by the Biden administration.

Some other new nuclear activity is afoot in the U.S. utility world. In September, the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned utility, signed an agreementwith ENTRA1 Energy, a developer of small modular reactors. Meanwhile, other companies are signaling interest in restarting shuttered plants and completing work on partially-constructed ones. Last month, Santee Cooper approved a nonbinding letter of intent to finish construction at the VC Summer nuclear station in South Carolina.

High cost, high risk

The sector remains traumatized and skittish after sky-high cost overruns tied to construction of the Vogtle nuclear expansion in Georgia, completed in 2024 at roughly double the anticipated price tag. In 2017, South Carolina’s Santee Cooper and a project partner also abandoned two Westinghouse reactors at VC Summer after sinking $9 billion into the project.

“They don’t want to get caught the way that the Vogtle utilities and developers were,” said Advait Arun, senior associate for capital markets at the Center for Public Enterprise. “They’re weighing the odds.”

The Vogtle cost overruns sent Westinghouse into bankruptcy and created a public relations nightmare for Southern Co., the parent company of Georgia Power, which purchases power from Vogtle.

Dale Klein, a former NRC chair, said that utilities remain cautious.

“Utilities, by nature, are gonna be conservative, and they’ll do what’s cheap, reliable, and quick,” Klein said. “There are a lot of memoranda of understanding that are being signed today, and MOUs are only worth the paper they’re written on. It just means they’re gonna agree to work and think about things.”

He said the decision to contract a new nuclear plant could deliver a blow to the stock price of the company.

“If a publicly traded utility was to announce that they’re going to build a new large, conventional nuclear reactor, it’s very likely that their stock price would drop because Wall Street would be worried about the risk,” Klein said.

A nuclear fiasco akin to Vogtle could upend the balance sheet for a small or moderate-sized utility, experts said.

Overruns didn’t upend Southern Co.’s balance sheet because the utility was able to pass upfront costs onto ratepayers. Now, other states are aiming to get laws on the books, known as construction work-in-progress rules, that allow their utilities to do the same. A bill in North Carolina attempts to do that. A recently passed bill in Missouri allows utilities to pass on costs, but only for new gas projects.

“[Utilities] have to consider what’s right for the ratepayers, and that’s going to be the first big question,” said Rowen Price, a policy adviser at the center-left think tank Third Way.

But with electricity prices rising nationwide, the public utility commissioners that regulate the utility sector could thwart plans for rate hikes.

“If a utility wants to build nuclear, they have to be very careful in how they approach PUCs,” Arun said. “In light of broader concerns about affordability, we shouldn’t assume approval of rate hikes as granted, at least not to the degree that they could finance nuclear.”

Critics of nuclear power are relishing the inaction among utilities.

“We’ve seen these so-called nuclear renaissance efforts declared in the past,” said Kevin Kamps, radioactive waste watchdog at the nonprofit Beyond Nuclear. “It’s such a horrendous recent experience, no wonder the utilities aren’t gung-ho to jump in if any of their own skin is in the game.”

Demand spike uncertainty

The United States faces an electricity demand surge unseen in a generation. But some experts think the forecasts may be overblown. Data center developers are logging potential projects in multiple locations across the country, and that’s added uncertainty to the infrastructure build-out. Moreover, data centers could become more efficient and the pace of the tech industry could slow.

Experts compare the current demand scenario with the dot-com era, when dramatic electricity demand spikes were projected but never materialized.

“If there is a sharp contraction in demand, the projects that will go first are the largest capital investments with the least flexibility value in the future,” Arun said. “You’re going to see a lot more investment in cheaper gas, solar and storage and batteries, and wind — these kinds of technologies.”

Moreover, the highest confidence for skyrocketing power demand forecasts is in the next few years.

“When you look at that demand that you have to meet right now, that means natural gas is about your only choice for 24/7 operation,” Klein said. “They’re building these data centers now. They need electricity now. Nuclear takes longer.”

Still, Klein was hopeful that utilities will invest in nuclear projects today to meet long-term forecasts, which still predict continued growth. That could help provide investment confidence.

“If the data centers come in with money up front and say, ‘I will guarantee I’m gonna buy this electricity for the long term, and I’m willing to be risk-sharing,’ then I think you’ll see some plants being built,” Klein continued.

Edison Electric Institute, the main lobbying group for for-profit utilities, says it supports nuclear.

“Nuclear energy is essential to delivering as many electrons to the grid and providing more reliable energy to the American people as affordability as possible,” EEI CEO Drew Maloney said in a statement. “We welcome the Trump administration’s focus on revitalizing this sector and look forward to working together to power America’s future.”

But to boost nuclear energy, utilities will need to move beyond rhetoric. Experts say the Trump administration’s $80 billion pledge is merely pomp until utilities get involved.

“It’s all kind of holographic until someone actually buys a reactor,” said the energy lobbyist granted anonymity to speak freely. “Who’s going to buy the reactor? Until your acme utility actually signs a contract, it’s irrelevant.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/65/bc/98b95b094bf5a3450963c85e1a52/nuclear-plant-georgia-76660.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 07:58:56.704187

Data center power shortage solutions: behind-the-meter long-duration

Hyperscale and AI campuses face power capacity constraints, interconnection delays, and price spikes. As one practical and safe solution, behind-the-meter long-duration energy storage (LDES) using vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) adds 8–12+ hour on-site discharge, improving price capture and resiliency with no thermal-runaway risk. Deployed as temporary power, VRFBs can support phased commissioning before the point of interconnection - subject to local permitting - keeping schedules on track while grid upgrades catch up.

On the grid side, according to PJM’s 2025 Long-Term Load Forecast Report, long-term load outlooks point to higher peaks and a wide dispersion in zone growth rates about 0.1–6.0% 10-year CAGR (median of 1.6%), which complicates planning and interconnection, raising schedule and cost risk.

Regulatory posture is also evolving. For example, Texas Senate Bill 6 (SB6) (2025) formalizes planning/interconnection/operations frameworks for large electrical loads and co-located generation while characterizing Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) curtailment/disconnection authority as limited and conditional. In practice, operators should track state-level rules and utility guidance, and design on-campus, long-duration flexibility using behind-the-meter (BTM) storage to hedge outages, price shocks, and interconnection delays across development and ramp-up.

◇ BTM long-duration storage that rides through outages and shapes imports

Placing storage behind the meter creates a practical resilience layer on campus:

1. Ride through grid events to keep critical loads online.

2. Shape imported power to mitigate peaks and price volatility.

3. Smooth on-site PV/wind and respond more flexibly to utility requests.

NREL defines BTM storage as assets connected on the customer side of the meter, and it increasingly sits at the center of reliability and cost control for buildings and campuses.

Why VRFB for BTM? A VRFB stores energy in electrolyte tanks and provides power via cell stacks, so you can extend energy hours by adding tanks as rack density and AI clusters grow—pushing required discharge from 4 hours toward 8–12+ hours. With a non-flammable, water-based electrolyte and no thermal-runaway mechanism, VRFBs align well with urban campus Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) requirements and permitting standards. In effect, one on-site system reduces price, reliability, and schedule risk at the same time.

◇ Safety & compliance: non-flammable VRFB, UL 1973 / UL 9540A ready

In San Diego, Sumitomo Electric’s SDG&E project achieved the first U.S. UL 1973 certification for a flow-battery cell stack (2017), entered CAISO market operations (2018), and later demonstrated a zero-emissions microgrid with black-start and seamless islanding. These field results translate directly to hyperscale campuses: non-flammable chemistry that eases siting and insurance reviews, daily full-cycle durability for high-duty operation, and scalable energy hours via tank expansion to meet 8–12+ hour windows (evening peaks, outage coverage). Continuous U.S. operation, CAISO participation, and microgrid experience together help lower operational risk after deployment.

If Mikie Sherrill can figure out how to get generation online quickly in New Jersey, she’ll have accomplished something more impressive than a rate freeze.
That wouldn’t solve the problem forever, though, Silverman told me.
“I think that will be a really significant piece.” Then there’s the hard way — slashing utilities’ regulated rates of return.
But you establish a very contentious relationship with the utilities,” Silverman told me.","So how do you freeze electricity rates, exactly? That’s the question soon to be facing New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who achieved a resounding victory in this November’s gubernatorial election in part due to her promise to declare a state of emergency and stop New Jersey’s high and rising electricity rates from going up any further.

The answer is that it can be done the easy way, or it can be done the hard way.

What will most likely happen, Abraham Silverman, a Johns Hopkins University scholar who previously served as the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ general counsel, told me, is that New Jersey’s four major electric utilities will work with the governor to deliver on her promise, finding ways to shave off spending and show some forbearance.

Indeed, “We stand ready to work with the incoming administration to do our part to keep rates as low as possible in the short term and work on longer-term solutions to add supply,” Ralph LaRossa, the chief executive of PSE&G, one of the major utilities in New Jersey, told analysts on an earnings call held the day before the election.

PSE&G’s retail bills rose 36% this past summer, according to the investment bank Jefferies. As for what working with the administration might look like, “We expect management to offer rate concessions,” Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbrado wrote in a note to clients in the days following the election, meaning essentially that the utility would choose to eat some higher costs. PSE&G might also get “creative,” which could mean things like “extensions of asset recoverable lives, regulatory item amortization acceleration, and other approaches to deliver customer bill savings in the near-term,” i.e. deferring or spreading out costs to minimize their immediate impact. “These would be cash flow negative but [PSE&G] has the cushion to absorb it,” Zimbrado wrote.

In return, Silverman told me that the New Jersey utilities “have a wish list of things they want from the administration and from the legislature,” including new nuclear plants, owning generation, and investing in energy storage. “I think that they are probably incented to work with the new administration to come up with that list of items that they think they can accomplish again without sacrificing reliability.”

Well before the election, in a statement issued in August responding to Sherrill’s energy platform, PSE&G hinted toward a path forward in its dealings with the state, noting that it isn’t allowed to build or own power generation and arguing that this deregulatory step “precluded all New Jersey electric companies from developing or offering new sources of power supply to meet rising demand and reduce prices.” Of course, the failure to get new supply online has bedeviled regulators and policymakers throughout the PJM Interconnection, of which New Jersey is a part. If Mikie Sherrill can figure out how to get generation online quickly in New Jersey, she’ll have accomplished something more impressive than a rate freeze.

As for ways to accomplish the governor-elect’s explicit goal of keeping price increases at zero, Silverman suggested that large-scale investments could be paid off on a longer timeline, which would reduce returns for utilities. Other investments could be deferred for at least a few years in order to push out beyond the current “bubble” of high costs due to inflation. That wouldn’t solve the problem forever, though, Silverman told me. It could simply mean “seeing lower costs today, but higher costs in the future,” he said.

New Jersey will also likely have to play a role in deliberations happening in front of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about interconnecting large loads — i.e. data centers — a major driver of costs throughout PJM and within New Jersey specifically. Rules that force data centers to “pay their own way” for transmission costs associated with getting on the grid could relieve some of the New Jersey price crunch, Silverman told me. “I think that will be a really significant piece.”

Then there’s the hard way — slashing utilities’ regulated rates of return.

In a report prepared for the Natural Resources Defence Council and Evergreen Collective and released after the election, Synapse Economics considered reducing utilities’ regulated return on equity, the income they’re allowed to generate on their investments in the grid, from its current level of 9.6% as one of four major levers to bring down prices. A two percentage point reduction in the return on equity, the group found, would reduce annual bills by $40 in 2026.

Going after the return on equity would be a more difficult, more contentious path than working cooperatively on deferring costs and increasing generation, Silverman told me. If voluntary and cooperative solutions aren’t enough to stop rate increases, however, Sherrill might choose to take it anyway. “You could come in and immediately cut that rate of return, and that would absolutely put downward pressure on rates in the short run. But you establish a very contentious relationship with the utilities,” Silverman told me.

Silverman pointed to Connecticut, where regulators and utilities developed a hostile relationship in recent years, resulting in the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority chair, Marissa Gillett, stepping down last month. Gillett had served on PURA since 2019, and had tried to adopt “performance-based ratemaking,” where utility payouts wouldn’t be solely determined by their investment level, but also by trying to meet public policy goals like energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Connecticut utilities said these rules would make attracting capital to invest in the grid more difficult. Gillett’s tenure was also marred by lawsuits from the state’s utilities over accusations of “bias” against them in the ratemaking process. At the same time, environmental and consumer groups hailed her approach.

While Sherrill and her energy officials may not want to completely overhaul how they approach ratemaking, some conflict with the state’s utilities may be necessary to deliver on her signature campaign promise.

Going directly after the utilities’ regulated return “is kind of like making your kid eat their broccoli,” Silverman said. “You can probably make them eat it. You can have a very contentious evening for the rest of the night.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIwMjE3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMzQzNDk0Mn0.dGGQ_tiu30IVVtf-oxuluK9Yk_EY2I6g5ar6H5JKC_0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-18 12:07:26.140171

Playing to Win

Jordan Schneider: Jake Sullivan, Biden’s former National Security Advisor, currently a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, and my near peer in podcasting. Jake, welcome to ChinaTalk.

Jake Sullivan: Thank you for having me. Now I have a whole different vantage point on being a guest on a podcast, so I’ll spend my time silently judging you.

Jordan Schneider: Great, we’ll have an impromptu masterclass.

You’re calling your new show The Long Game. What are your reflections on how crises interact with the goal of maximizing national power, or however you want to define the long game?

Jake Sullivan: Part of the reason we’re calling it The Long Game is that it’s incredibly important for us to lift our heads up and out of the smoke of immediate crises and ask, how do we put the US on the strongest strategic footing going forward? That really is the ultimate essence of the long game — how do we marshal and husband the sources of American power in service of our national security, our prosperity, and our values? That’s the ethos behind The Long Game.

Now, to your question about the interaction between crises and the long game — it takes an enormous amount of discipline, especially in my time in the seat when we were dealing with a lot of crises and a lot of different types of incoming, to say we’re going to set aside the time, the effort, the resources, and the top-level attention to actually focus on the long game. I’m actually quite proud that through Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Chinese balloons, and lots of other stuff, we set aside the time to really invest in our alliances, invest in our industrial base, and invest in a set of technology policies that advanced America’s capabilities and helped protect those capabilities from being used against us.

That requires discipline — a huge amount of discipline — and I tried to bring that discipline with me to work every day. I was also lucky to have a lot of people who were assigned to the long-game things and not just the crises, who had no trouble banging on my door and saying, “Jake, don’t forget we have to be working on this issue,” whether it was chip controls or infrastructure projects in Africa or what have you. Having that kind of team around you — people who keep you honest and say we’re not going to let you just get swallowed by the inbox — that was very important as well.

Jordan Schneider: Is there a design fix around this? Should there be two NSAs — the firefighter and the long-term person? Why does this need to be one job?

Jake Sullivan: That’s a great question. Maybe it’s right that if you think about the close advisors to the President, there shouldn’t be any reason you couldn’t have two people essentially dividing the job. My overall reaction is that it’s probably a process fix better done with other senior people who are devoted to specific crises, not just someone who’s like, “I come in and handle all crises.”

A National Security Advisor should actually have both the dispensation and the instinct to say, “I’m just not going to spend a lot of time on this particular set of issues. I’m going to have the Principal Deputy do that, or an envoy do that, or someone else in government do that, because I need to be allocating more of my time to the longer-term things.” That’s probably a better way to do it than formally dividing the role into two.

One thing I reflect on from my time in government is, should I have just more consciously and systematically said, “This is something I’m putting on someone else’s plate, and I will check in on it every now and again, but it’s not going to be something I’m responsible for”?

Jordan Schneider: What were the things that you decided you needed to own and drive personally very aggressively, and why did you make those calls?

Jake Sullivan: First, I felt I was unusual as a National Security Advisor in that I thought I had to be at the table as an advocate, a designer, and to a certain extent an implementer of domestic industrial policy. I thought it was important that we have the national security perspective on that and that we’d be pushing that forward on chips, on clean energy, on infrastructure. That was one thing that I put a lot of effort into, particularly in the first two years.

Second, I thought the intersection of technology and national security was going to be defining. We created from whole cloth a new directorate on Technology and National Security, and I saw it as my responsibility to stay on top of that set of issues — yes, semiconductor export controls, but also other areas, such as biotech, quantum, and as I mentioned before, the clean energy transition.

Third, I believed from the beginning that a defining feature of modern geopolitics is the competition between the US and China. I thought it was my responsibility to play a central role in the design and execution of our China strategy and in the management of the US-China relationship.

Those were areas that I felt, regardless of what else was going on anywhere else in the world, I had to be focused on. Tied to all of those — industrial policy, technology policy, US-China — were allies. That meant husbanding and stewarding our relationships with core allies: the G7 plus India, Korea, and Australia. I put a lot of thought, energy, and effort into trying to elevate those relationships so that they were in the strongest possible state.

Jordan Schneider: That is a lot of stuff.

Jake Sullivan: Yes. I didn’t even mention the war in Ukraine. Or the multiple overlapping crises in the Middle East, or the drawdown from Afghanistan. There’s a lot going on. But the things I just named — they’re also interconnected. They’re not just different piles of work. At our best moments, they were a coherent strategy that we were trying to drive.

Jordan Schneider: You were one person both pushing the long-term stuff and being the crisis manager — what are the upsides to having that all be on your shoulders?

Jake Sullivan: First of all, if you just take it from the top, the President of the United States has to do everything. There is no division of that job into multiple different units. At some point as you go up any institution, any organization, you get to a CEO or a cabinet secretary or a President or a National Security Advisor. The question is, can you have a multi-headed monster at the top of the National Security Council enterprise? That’s difficult because you’re trying to execute and run a process that allocates time, energy, resources, priority, and then unity of vision and coherence of execution across everything. At the end of the day, you need a single point of accountability for that. That’s why it has to be basically in the job of the National Security Advisor.

But I also believe that theories of delegation and relative levels of personal engagement on different issues have to be an important part of how someone in that role thinks about what they’re doing day to day.

On Age, Experience, and Getting Ground Down

Jordan Schneider: What do you think the pluses and minuses were of being the second-youngest National Security Advisor when you started the job?

Jake Sullivan: It’s interesting — I’ve thought a fair amount about this, and it may strike some of your listeners as surprising. I was 44 years old when I took the job. That’s only a couple years younger than Kissinger was when he took the job.

Jordan Schneider: He was 45 and a half. ChatGPT made us a chart. Not sponsored, by the way. McGeorge Bundy was 41, which is insane. Condi was 46. You’re not an outlier on the young side. The mean is 53.

Jake Sullivan: There are a number of National Security Advisors around my age. When I took the job, I felt very young in a way because you tend to think of the black-and-white photographs of people with gray hair. But that’s a solid list of folks in their mid-to-late 40s entering this job — in some cases not with a lot of government experience at all coming before them, in other cases, like Condi, with quite a substantial amount of government experience.

Pluses of being on the younger side include energy, stamina, the capacity to really dig in and do the job full bore, full scale, 24/7. Being willing to push the envelope and be creative and dynamic and say we’re going to do things a different way, we’re going to have a theory of the case and try to execute against it — that youthful vision, energy, and creativity matters. That’s not just the single person acting as National Security Advisor — it’s also the team they build and the dynamic they build.

In my case, I felt I was able to build a very flat structure where everyone could come in, challenge, question, raise ideas, and feel like they had a voice. There wasn’t some oracle up top with hierarchy. That made for a much better — well, first of all, it was a better working environment, just more fun to work in that way. But I also think it allowed us to develop more interesting, more creative, more dynamic strategies in critical areas.

As for downsides… having done this job for four years. I understand deeply, to my bones, the value of experience — both positive experience and hard-won experience. There’s no substitute for it. There’s actually no substitute for experience as National Security Advisor. It is a truly unique type of seat to sit in that in some ways nothing can really actually prepare you for.

Jordan Schneider: More on that then. What was year-four Jake Sullivan able to do that year-one Jake Sullivan couldn’t?

Jake Sullivan: Actually, the most interesting part about experience is that to essentially metabolize experience, you need distance. Ask me in a year and I’ll give you an answer to the question. I’m being a bit glib, but what I mean is it’s less that in year two I was suddenly able to do things I couldn’t do in year one. It’s more the accumulation of that experience and then stepping away and being able to say, “Okay, I now have lessons learned — things that worked well, things that didn’t work well.” As this conversation goes on, I’ll point out some of those, I assume.

Sometimes I think that actually the right way for someone to do a job like this is to come in for two years, leave for six months, and then come back for 18 months — or in for 18, out for a year, back. I don’t know, whatever it adds up to. Leaving even for a little while just gives you an angle on what you were doing in the trenches that you just don’t have when you’re sitting in those trenches. That’s an interesting model for how to think about this going forward: you serve for a while, then you step away for a little while, then you come back and say, “Okay, now I’ve actually had the chance to metabolize that experience.” But anyway, that’s an idle thought for others to consider down the road.

Jordan Schneider: On what dimensions do you feel like experience gets accrued?

Jake Sullivan: The first dimension is living through a crisis, and actually having to stare square in the face the hard trade-offs and the imperfect choices, the lack of clear information, the need to form assumptions in the shadow of uncertainty. You can read all about that, but until you actually have to live through it, you’re not going to fully understand what both the opportunities and limitations are. That’s one.

Second is converting vision into action. How do you actually turn the idea of an industrial strategy into results? You’ve got to go through the thick and thin of that and make progress, but also come up short, to really be able to expose and understand what the obstacles are, what the modes of operating are, and how we could have done things differently — faster, more ambitiously, more creatively. Those are a couple of examples of where having to actually do something is what teaches you what works, what doesn’t, and how to be most effective.

Jordan Schneider: What about on the management side?

Jake Sullivan: On the management side, it comes down to a combination of how do you get the best out of people. Experience can come both ways, to be honest with you. One thing that I observed over the course of my time in government is that you get ground down. Your kindness, your patience, your sense of joie de vivre just get ground down. You become more impatient. Government is hard, so you become harder. I had to constantly fight against that. That’s an asterisk, a proviso — set that aside. That’s how too much experience, too much time in the trenches can actually degrade you rather than enhance you.

But how you actually get the most out of a team, how you run a process, what works and doesn’t work with respect to trying to surface and crystallize options for the President, how to make the government as a whole all pull in the same direction — these are things that require trial and error. It’s a very human exercise. Any particular group of people is going to have its own psychology, its own operating capacity. You can take experience from one administration and it won’t map neatly onto another. But there are some broader lessons that you can learn from it.

Jordan Schneider: In 20th-century American history, we have a bit of a pendulum. On one side, we have FDR and Trump — presidents just winging it. On the other side, we have the reactions to that — Truman being like, “Man, this FDR guy was crazy, we need to create the NSC,” or the Biden administration saying, “This Trump guy was crazy, we need to bring in a Yale Law School person to organize things.” After doing this job, how do you see the trade-offs of both models?

Jake Sullivan: This is going to maybe be true to brand, but I actually think that the right answer is to try to land in the middle of that pendulum. What I mean by that is — rigorous, fair, honest process is really important to the long-term strength of the United States and to the discipline of strategy on the big picture. But I also believe that a President and a National Security Advisor need a theory of what’s really important, and they need to get after it.

I had two people that I really looked at to try to approximate — not emulate, because I couldn’t live up to these two guys — but approximate. They were Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Scowcroft for process and for being an honest broker and for not coming in and just calling the shots, but rather teeing up the debates of principles to the President. Brzezinski, because he had a theory of geopolitics and a worldview that helped shape and drive decision-making, even as he dealt with a bunch of crises on the edges and margins of that. A blend of those two strategies is the best way to pursue statecraft.

Breakneck Industrial Policy

Jordan Schneider: Are there dimensions on which you wish you’d had more freedom of maneuver? What felt the most constraining?

Jake Sullivan: You’ve had Dan Wang on your podcast — I thought his book Breakneck was just incredibly thought-provoking and interesting. His overall thesis is that America is run by lawyers — of which I am one — while China is run by engineers. There’s a truth to that. Democratic administrations are even more run by lawyers.

It would have been great to have more freedom of maneuver to actually just build at speed and scale than we were able to accomplish, because we had every conceivable obstacle to being able to do that — from the defense industrial base to infrastructure to building a semiconductor fab in Arizona. That would be one area where more freedom of maneuver, more capacity to move fast, would have helped.

Two: The US is funny. We’re the richest country on the planet, with deep and liquid capital markets and a massive federal budget, and yet our ability to mobilize capital in an intentional way to serve national security ends, both domestically and globally, is wanting.

I would have loved more freedom of maneuver to be able to offer a value proposition to the countries of the Global South for building infrastructure and competing with the Belt and Road Initiative. It was hard to even get nickels and dimes to be able to do that.

That was maddening because for pennies on the dollar, we could have competed more effectively and can to this day compete more effectively. We’re not doing it because we can’t get that money.

Jordan Schneider: In that vein, what homework would you give researchers, future administrations, and anyone listening?

Jake Sullivan: We really need a deep and rigorous study of what the objectives of industrial policy are, what the limits of industrial policy should be, what tools work and don’t work, and then once it’s being applied, what are the obstacles to actually executing in a way that delivers results on a reasonable timeframe. To the extent those obstacles need to be adjusted, how do we adjust them?

That entire chain of questions — people are looking at some of it. Some of my former colleagues, like

and , who were central to the CHIPS Act effort, are really doing a deep study of some of this today [now on substack at ]. But there is not a body of work on this, in part because industrial policy was basically considered unacceptable to work on. We’ve got to bring it front and center, and not just with the core economics profession — that’s got to be a dialogue between national security professionals and economists coming up with a range of answers to those questions that are rooted in empirics and evidence and rigorous study.

I would ask anyone out there who’s thinking about contributing to the national security literature of the future — this, to me, is a set of questions for which we need better answers than we have. Those answers will be in large measure defining of whether we’re able to pursue an effective strategy.

What If’s on Rare Earths and US-China Escalation

Jordan Schneider: The CHIPS Act is a long-game play, but there is a world in which you implemented the October 7th controls and China decided to play the rare earths card early. If you had woken up in that world, what would you have done?

Jake Sullivan: First of all, we wouldn’t wake up the next day and think about what to do, because we thought about that before we did the controls. We thought about retaliation risk. We thought about how to structure a strategy to protect our most advanced technology without getting on an escalation ladder that could end in harm to us or a downward spiral, or as we’ve just seen recently, the need for us to basically blink and back down.

We executed the controls in a way consistent with this theory of “small yard, high fence,” precisely to avoid the massive counterreaction that we have seen once President Trump decided to slap on 145% tariffs. That was a credible and sensible strategy.

Now, it’s totally fair to ask — and this gets to the point of hard-won experience — we knew that rare earths were a supply chain vulnerability for the United States. We knew that China was weaponizing it. We were explicit about that, open about that. We took steps on it. I could send you a note with a whole list of things that would all look like perfectly credible steps one would take to try to reduce that supply chain vulnerability. And yet it obviously didn’t end that vulnerability or even really, truly dramatically reduce it. Why?

I’ve reflected on this question, and there are a few reasons. One reason is that it is a new set of muscles for the government to intervene in markets where the markets have failed or where a competitor like China has taken advantage of those markets to dominate supply. We were trying to build that muscle.

Second, it’s a dynamic game. We made investments in US firms, we also made investments in allies, and China was counterreacting by cratering the price or driving a particular processing plant out of business. We hadn’t yet fully gotten up to speed in terms of that reaction-counterreaction.

The thing that concerns me right now is the Trump administration is taking good steps on this and they’re obviously motivated, but it’s still linear from where we were. We need to go really nonlinear. We need a much more aggressive strategy, in my view.

If I’d woken up the next day after the imposition of the semiconductor export controls and they’d played the massive rare earth card, I would have said drop everything — we need to solve this within the shortest possible span of time and essentially have Operation Warp Speed to get it done.

That is what the Trump administration should do. They’re moving in that direction, but now is the moment for more alacrity. I say that as someone recognizing — not enough alacrity in our administration, in the end, not enough alacrity. I’m worried that that remains the case today.

Jordan Schneider: Zooming back, we have two countries that are competing, which are deeply economically intertwined. Say you solve rare earths — it seems to me that insofar as the two countries have an enormous amount of economic interaction with each other, there will still be ways for either country to squeeze and cause the other one pain, even if it’s not commercial. We saw Volt Typhoon — “What the hell are you doing in our water treatment plants?” I’m sure you told them to knock it off and they didn’t.

It’s a game worth playing, but what does the incremental resiliency-building help the US when it comes to these negotiations? To use a wrestling metaphor — if you’re winning points in the round, but your opponent could still pin you if they really felt like they needed to.

Jake Sullivan: As far as homework — let’s fully map the vulnerabilities as far as we can see them. Let’s ask where they are. Let’s test this hypothesis you put forward that there is simply no end to interdependence and that there will be some fundamental vulnerability that can be exploited by China or, for that matter, by the United States. That is worth a deep dive, not just all of us talking back and forth about it.

I have three answers to this question.

There are different forms of vulnerability. Some act very fast, and the pain can be applied asymmetrically, powerfully, and swiftly. Some act much more slowly and give you time to adjust, or they act in a way that harms the country imposing that action, so there’s some degree of deterrence. That’s one answer — let’s not just have a list of all the interdependencies, but we need to isolate the examples that are like rare earths. How many of those are there actually?

I would prefer to have fewer vulnerabilities rather than more. If I can take some bullets out of your gun, could I still end up dead? Maybe. But if you gave me the choice between you having a full magazine and less than a full magazine, I would say let’s make investments to do that.

This is really important — the more a country shows it has the muscle to be able to adapt and adjust if another country tries to weaponize interdependence, the more of a broader-based deterrent effect it ends up having. Having the wherewithal to relatively rapidly identify and then close a gap, even if you know there are other gaps out there, has a knock-on effect on those other gaps too. For all those reasons, we should still have a resilience strategy, though I do acknowledge that this is a very legitimate question.

Part of the answer to it has to come down to a cost-benefit analysis of trying to deal with this resilience. In the rare earths case, the cost-benefit analysis seems to be pretty straightforward. This is not a massive market. It doesn’t require us to move heaven and earth to resolve the vulnerability. It requires some determined, concerted action, and we should take it.

On Yards and Fences 固若金汤

Jordan Schneider: The closest thing we got to a Sullivan Doctrine was given in September 2022 — “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.” There’s the maximalist version of that, where everything gets cut off, you’re Stuxnet-ing private companies. Then there’s the “small yard, high fence” version of Biden vintage, where every day you put out new export controls, and the next day we’re recording an emergency podcast talking about all the loopholes. I’m curious about your reflections on what the calculus was and what was constraining it. Was it domestic stuff? Was it political economy? Was it worries about retaliation? How did the level end up getting set?

Jake Sullivan: One element is retaliation risk. We talked that through, right? If you just say to China, “We’re essentially cutting you off altogether,” then you’re going to induce a really dramatic reaction. That’s what happened when we fired a bazooka of 145% tariffs — they fired a bazooka back.

A second element is trying to actually have some discipline about a threshold above which you have national security concerns and below which you’re just talking about broad-based commercial or consumer applications. We wanted to have the American idea that we’re not in favor of a total technology blockade. We are just in favor of focusing on those elements of technology that have genuine national security and strategic implications for us.

A third aspect is what you said about political economy — you’re trying to bring allies along, you’re trying to bring your private sector along, you’re trying to organize a government that has very different views on this.

If you and I sat down for an hour and went through ‘22, ‘23, and ‘24 — do I think we got all the calibrations right, all the levels? Of course not. First of all, in ‘22, they knocked out the interconnect and had the H100, and we had to update the controls in part because that interconnect speed criteria didn’t make sense. We were learning as we went — the stockpiling of some of the manufacturing equipment, those timelines we could walk through. But we were executing a novel strategy, trying to make sure that we were nurturing and sustaining our advantages, protecting our most advanced technologies, while at the same time dealing with this other set of considerations.

I had breakfast with a guy I respect a huge amount in the technology field who was basically like, “My only objection to ‘small yard, high fence’ is that it should be ‘big yard, high fence.’” He had an argument — we should control legacy chips, control it all. I actually think the experience of this year and how things have played out compared with the experience of the last three years is a good argument for “small yard, high fence” — for a particular style and strategy of a pretty aggressive policy that is conducted with a degree of care and precision. That was a more sustainable policy for the United States over the longer term than just letting it rip. Now, it’s hard to say for sure that that’s right. There’s no algorithm for this, but that was the judgment that we reached, and that’s why we proceeded the way that we did.

The last thing I would raise on this is, having watched President Trump do what he has done with our allies, was the right answer just FDPR — the Foreign Direct Product Rule — from the start? Basically, don’t negotiate with our allies over coordinated semiconductor manufacturing equipment controls. Just tell them they’ve got American content, you’re not selling, done. I think about that sometimes. That comes down to a question of what are the longer-term costs of treating your friends that way? I believe that there are genuine longer-term costs for that that are real and strategic and meaningful. But I can’t prove that. That’s something we’re going to have to watch over time because now we’re running a real lab experiment.

Jordan Schneider: All right, let’s talk about China. There was kind of a big yard with FDPR. Should we have been more aggressive with FDPR, for example, to really put maximal pressure on Huawei? Do you think China would have freaked out?

Jake Sullivan: The yard could have been smaller than it is, I guess. Here’s what I would say about some of these arguments — like, if only you do this extra thing on Huawei, then that happens. It reminds me of the “real socialism has never been tried” argument. Look, it’s possible you’re right — just one more crushing sanction or export control.

By the way, I’m being glib because you may be right. But the question that one has to grapple with is some of the assumptions that underpinned the Huawei controls that were put in place in the Trump administration and the statements about what would happen as a result of those controls — not the next, better version later down the line — didn’t quite bear out. We have to grapple with that, too. You may be right that just taking more steps in the Biden administration could have made all the difference.

Jordan Schneider: I identified the biggest “what if” is FDPR on equipment earlier, because the big chart is the one where SME exports double and double again and double again. It’s going to keep doubling. That seems to me to be the big fork in the road.

Jake Sullivan: It’s a big question, and I’m not sure what the right answer is. We had a thesis with respect to our allies — you work with them rather than coerce them. That obviously meant China got access to more manufacturing equipment than if we had just coerced them. But in a net assessment of the overall health, vitality, and strength of those relationships and how they would play out in — to coin a phrase — the long game, that’s a big question.

President Trump is testing that question because he’s basically saying, “I don’t buy it. I can go punish all these people as much as I like, and they’re just going to have to keep being friends because they have no other choice.” He seems to think that’ll just be how it is. I happen to think what’s more likely is you get a group of countries that were coming along with us to de-risk from China, who now are sitting there thinking, “I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do today, but over time, I need to de-risk from the United States.” In the end, that is not going to be a winning strategy.

These are the kinds of calls that you have to make in the shadow of uncertainty. I will say we didn’t have knockdown, drag-out fights about FDPR. There was a general sense that we should try to negotiate this with our allies rather than just club them over the head. There are also other ways to get at this challenge than FDPR — like timelines on implementation and how companies went about allowing the stockpiling despite government agreements and so forth. That’s for another time, maybe over a drink.

Taiwan, Pelosi and the Risk of Accidental War

Jordan Schneider: You were present at the beginning of the Xi era. What do you believe about him that’s not the consensus?

Jake Sullivan: He is more improvisational than the theory that he’s just set out a coherent strategy that they are just going to execute. He’s basically like any other leader of any other big, unruly country, and he’s got to make a lot of stuff up as he goes along.

Jordan Schneider: Accidental conflict is something Americans worry about. I’m personally skeptical that if two countries really don’t want to fight, they can trip into a war neither side really wants. Am I wrong here? Is this something I should be more scared of?

Jake Sullivan: It’s such a fair question. It’s almost like a shibboleth — the risk of mistake, miscalculation, escalation. Ships bumping into each other in the South China Sea, and all of a sudden, you’re in World War III. I share a degree of your skepticism. There are restraining factors that can allow disengagement and de-escalation.

But let me give you a hypothetical scenario, and you tell me if it worries you. As you know, the PRC is pressing closer and closer to the island of Taiwan in the air and on the sea, bumping up against fewer and fewer nautical miles offshore, right? They’re doing that with manned aircraft, they’re doing it with ships, they’re doing it with drones. At some point, let’s just say Taiwan says, “We can’t tolerate this anymore. We’ve got to fire a warning shot, or we’ve got to do a fake dogfight with one of these planes to show them that we’re not tolerating the continued encroachment.” Then one thing leads to another and those two planes splash down. You think the next day it’s cool? Does that bother you? Does that worry you?

Because that scenario does worry me. Do I think automatically we’re off to the races? No. But that kind of scenario, in an already unstable operational environment — I don’t know that the risk of a tactical mistake leading to a change in the strategic situation — I’m not at one end of the spectrum on this that you’re pushing against, but I’m not quite where you are either.

Jordan Schneider: It wouldn’t be a nice thing. You’d lose some sleep over it.

Jake Sullivan: That’s the thought experiment to me. Why would you lose sleep over it? Because you’d be like, well, there is a possibility — maybe not that immediately the invasion force comes flowing over the horizon, but rather that it leads to a change in the national conversation on the mainland. It leads to arguments that we just can’t tolerate this, there has to be punishment and so on. Can that contribute to a shift in a negative direction that raises the risk of outright conflict? It can. I don’t want to overstate the case because I take your point, but that kind of scenario worries me more in a way than the US and China bumping up against each other.

India-Pakistan is another example where I think a mistake can lead to very rapid escalation. To me, it’s a little bit more condition-specific than just in the abstract.

Jordan Schneider: But isn’t the lesson of the most recent India-Pakistan crisis almost the other thing? It’s like, okay, we have a game now and we just play it every five years.

Actually, it probably doesn’t feel like that if you’re getting woken up at 4 o’clock in the morning.

Jake Sullivan: You know what? I’ll take that point. That’s fair because I basically agree with you that at the end of the day, the two sides don’t want to go to all-out war, so there are reasons for them to end up not doing so. I withdraw the India-Pakistan example.

Jordan Schneider: Was it a mistake for Pelosi to go to Taiwan?

Jake Sullivan: Look, I want to be fair to the Speaker. I’m going to answer your question, but I want to do it in a fair way. I spoke with her about going to Taipei, and she basically said to me, “All you White House Democrats and Republicans — you’re all too restrained. I should be able to do what I want to do, and nobody should tell us whether we can go to a city.” She was pretty clear and direct in her view.

I believe that the cost to Taiwan of that visit far exceeded the benefit to Taiwan of that visit. For me, it’s pretty simple calculus.

Jordan Schneider: How so?

Jake Sullivan: Well, it led to not just an immediate reaction by China that put a huge amount of pressure on Taiwan, but it led to a change in the operational environment around Taiwan that has not gone back to the way it was before — substantive, negative changes in Taiwan’s immediate environment. On the positive side, some symbolism, I guess.

Managing the Stress of Putin’s Nuke Threats

Jordan Schneider: On the accidental risk stuff, speaking of you getting stressed out — the Putin nuclear scenario is probably the scariest thing you had a 5-10% chance of seeing, I assume. You’ve already given some reflections on this, but maybe from — we had all these NSC management questions — this is the big one. What sticks with you?

Jake Sullivan: This is fall of ‘22. The Ukrainians are on this counteroffensive in Kherson and Kharkiv, and the intelligence community at the most senior levels comes to the President and says, “If there’s a catastrophic collapse of Russian lines and Putin feels that he’s in danger of potentially losing the war, there’s a 50% chance — a coin toss — that he will use tactical nuclear weapons to avert that defeat and shore up his lines.”

By the way, this is not just people guessing out of thin air. These are people who have studied this issue, are watching everything going on, who have amassed a fairly broad-based view across the intelligence community of this judgment. You’re the President of the United States, and you’re like, “All right, we’ve got to deal with that. Can’t be paralyzed by it. You’ve got to keep supporting Ukraine, but we’ve got to deal with that.”

We gathered in the Situation Room. We ran tabletop exercises. What would happen? What would we do in response? What would they do in response to our response? Not very pleasant scenarios, all told. We communicated directly with the Russians about the consequences of taking such an action. Of course, we reached out to, among others, China to get them to weigh in as well.

But this is the kind of thing where the difference between a commentator saying, “I don’t think it’s a very serious risk,” and actually being in the seat, having the responsibility to the American people of taking very seriously what sober, senior intelligence professionals are telling you while also continuing to support Ukraine — that was very real and very challenging.

I do not believe that this was all just BS. This was a risk. If it had happened — the first nuclear use since Hiroshima and Nagasaki — the United States would have had to take meaningful action in response. That action could easily have led to a totally different form of escalation between us and Russia. It’s good it did not happen. A lot of people look at the fact that it didn’t happen and say this was all overblown. I think we had some influence over it, and events on the battlefield had some influence over it as well.

Share

Jordan Schneider: We’ve talked about a few different escalatory ladders — the econ-tech fights, planes hitting each other in the sky. But this is different than what they were theorizing in the ’50s and ’60s. Thoughts? What’s my question here?

Jake Sullivan: I think your question is, how the hell do you deal with that?

It raises a question about risk tolerance, right? You’re walking on a narrow mountain path and there’s a steep cliff off to one side — one side’s the mountain, the other side’s a steep cliff. The path is, call it five feet wide. Do you walk right on the edge, saying, “I don’t think I’ll slip”? Or do you walk up against the mountain?

A lot of the debates over the nuclear escalation thing is, why weren’t you closer to the edge? Why were you closer to the mountain? The right answer on this is you have to keep moving forward. You’ve got to go from point A to point B. You can’t stop providing weapons to Ukraine, intelligence to Ukraine, capacity to Ukraine. But you also have a responsibility to the American people not to fall off the cliff.

Jordan Schneider: Can you talk about psychologically, yourself and your team? It’s one thing to be in the CIA for 30 years and be thinking about Russian nuclear posture. It’s another thing when it’s the week when it’s more risky than any time since the ’80s or even the ’60s.

Jake Sullivan: One thing that I’m playing around with in my head — I don’t want to say it wrong because it’s going to sound somehow like I didn’t take my job seriously enough, and I took my job deadly seriously — is that stress and stakes and consequences normalize. What I mean by that is the human capacity to just adjust to your circumstances.

I was an associate at a law firm in Minneapolis working on commercial litigation. We had these cases that kept me up at night. I stressed out over whether we got something right or wrong. I second-guessed and recriminated, the whole thing. Then I end up in this nuclear scenario. These are night and day. But somehow human beings don’t just have an infinite level of calibrating stress. They just have their bands, and then they’re presented with things. Some of them are life-or-death situations, and some of them are life-or-death decision-making situations. You get up in the morning and you go to work and you do your job and then you go home at night and you execute your responsibility to the best of your ability to do so.

I don’t have a better answer than that, but I don’t feel like, “Oh, I was some special person.” I was just a guy who had a job. This was the problem presented in that job, and I had to deal with it. A lot of it is just about being able to inhabit that mindset and say, “I’ve got to go to work. This is my job today.” But that didn’t mean I didn’t sweat through a lot of shirts.

Jordan Schneider: It’s a good point. The Marines fought on Peleliu and Iwo Jima. You’re going to an office.

Jake Sullivan: Exactly. This is such a good way of putting it. Somebody is walking into the teeth of gunfire at Omaha Beach who, a year before, was a schoolteacher in my hometown of Minneapolis.

The ability to normalize just your situation — this is my job today. That’s so much more real than anything I had to deal with. Yet we all have really stressful and complicated situations in our lives. Even when something is objectively not that high stakes, I don’t begrudge people that they feel super stressed in that situation because they’re just operating within the range we all operate of stress and stakes based on their lived experience.

Jordan Schneider: But there have been very few humans in human history who have stared down a non-zero risk of nuclear war and managed through it. Even then, it still is a unique experience.

Jake Sullivan: It’s a lot. It is a lot. It’s heavy. The other important thing is we’re all just human beings leading three-dimensional lives while dealing with all of this — dealing with family stuff or health stuff or whatever the case may be. I talked before about how you can get ground down in these jobs and lose a certain sense of who you are. There is a way in which the stress and the stakes harden you. You don’t even quite realize it at the time.

Being vigilant for that, to try to remember at the end of the day that it’s your job to be a good and decent person, is a really important thing. That requires more discipline than often in a given day you can bring to bear.

Jordan Schneider: You said on a podcast you still don’t sleep well. Did you sleep well before?

Jake Sullivan: In Trump one, there was a period where I had a really hard time sleeping post-2016. But yeah, I would say I slept pretty well. I don’t now, because in many ways, a lot of the things that we dealt with had no perfect outcomes achievable. The outcome was going to be painful in one way or another. There were some painful outcomes, and then they happen and you’re like, “Well, what if I’d done this? Or what if I’d done that? Or what if we had done this? What could we learn from that?” You turn it over in your head, and then you do all of that with perfect hindsight, which is a super problematic thing to do because you could only make those decisions in the moment.

But I don’t know — that’s just going to be what it is for me for a while. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. In a way, the completion of discharging your responsibility in a job like I had is not to walk out the day you’re done and just go, “All right, someone else’s problem.” It’s to continue to wrestle with it indefinitely. That’s part of the service.

Jordan Schneider: You mentioned earlier that you think the thinking around AI and national policy is really poor. What are the hottest questions you wish there was better thought on?

Jake Sullivan: Let me be absolutely clear. If I said that, I don’t mean to say it’s really poor. I mean to say that we’re in the early innings. There are brilliant people thinking about this, and they’re thinking thoughts way beyond in complexity and sophistication that I could think. My concern is that we are designing strategy — and who’s the “we”? Because it’s a combination of this government plus these big private companies that are driving the frontier, without really fully unearthing the assumptions underlying those strategies.

A world in which we are rapidly approaching AGI and ASI versus a world in which it’s a boundary and jagged pathway towards greater capability — what you would do across a range of different inputs is different in those two worlds. Yet I don’t think we sit and work out what our relative confidence is in one world as opposed to the other. What are the can’t-fail or the must-dos, the no-regrets moves? Then what are the things we have to be able to adjust as we gain more information?

That’s just one example of many where getting technologists and strategists together to really go through the underlying assumptions of where all this is going is important. Most of this conversation floats above at a plane of abstraction. As a result, we pursue a policy with a lot of hidden assumptions that we haven’t fully validated or unearthed. That’s my main concern and something I’m turning over in my head and thinking about how to articulate better than I just did.

Jordan Schneider: Maybe more broadly, the process of gathering information, even though it’s under uncertainty and you’ll never get to much less 80% confidence with some of these things — how did you think about it and the sources, and how did that evolve over time for you?

Jake Sullivan: First of all, when you’re in government, access to information is amazing. My friend Kurt Campbell likes to say, “When you’re in government, the shit comes to you. When you’re out of government, you have to go find the shit.” There’s a simple, crude elegance to that. We could have senior people from the AI labs come in and actually present to us where they were and their capabilities and where they were going and what concerned them — literally in the flesh, just do it. We could also get all of the industry data and analysis synthesized by a team of people at any agency in the US government and supply it to you as well.

The biggest weakness on the US government side in terms of the consumption of information is that we tend to over-prioritize classified information over unclassified information because we somehow think it’s more special. Particularly in technology, it’s the unclassified information where you really find out what the hell is going on. But basically, all you can do is try to bring in as much as you can.

Then I believe in the debate method — basically having people on opposite sides or at different ends of the spectrum on a given question of what’s likely to happen actually debate it out, unearth it, and figure out where they agree and where they disagree and isolate the points of disagreement. That method gives you the best confidence that you’ve actually kicked the tires on all the potential perspectives. Then you just have to decide where you land, where you fall.

Jordan Schneider: Trump two does not seem to see China as the threat that you guys and Trump one seemed to characterize it as. Two questions fall out of that — to what extent do you think, if he really tries, he can change the tenor of this relationship? How structural is the competition, basically? Second, given that this is what they’re seeing, if you had foresight into this, would the bias have been to push harder or push less hard?

Jake Sullivan: The second’s a good question. Increasingly, it’s going to be a salient question because we are going to see more swings in US foreign policy in the years ahead. Future National Security Advisors will have to contemplate dramatic departures one way or the other. We’re seeing that play out right now.

On the first question, here’s what I think — It’s structural. The United States and China are two big, ambitious, dynamic countries with proud people who want to succeed and frankly don’t want someone else calling the shots or having undue influence or having greater capacity than they have. We have two different political systems, two different value systems. Therefore, competition is a feature of the relationship.

What I don’t think is structural is that it has to be conflict. Where we have the ability to influence things is to manage that competition effectively. But the idea that you can just wish the competition away and go with win-win, peaceful coexistence and all these kinds of phrases — I don’t really buy that. Frankly, I don’t think China buys it deep down either.

President Trump can talk about the G2, and I completely agree he looks at this through an economic lens, a mercantilist lens, and not a lens of strategic competition. But at the end of the day, these structural factors will shine through. I have to think about whether it would have made us do something different. That’s a bit of a mind-bender, projecting back and then forward, but it’s a totally reasonable question.

Jordan Schneider: You talked earlier about the personal weight of all this, and you said somewhere that you almost envy the people who can have more confidence in their calls. The irony, of course, is this new book about McNamara at war. He’s the one who projected the most confidence out of any of these folks, and he had panic attacks. It was actually all a cover for all his insecurity.

Jake Sullivan: I was being a little wry when I said that. That’s understated Minnesota wryness. What I meant was I just find it so interesting that people can assert things like, “Yes, it’s this.” You’re like, “Congratulations, I’m so glad that you just know that.”

Going back to the point about hard-won experience — most of these issues do not have easy calls. They have trade-offs and they have puts and takes. I really admire the self-confidence because I could sleep at night super easily then. It’s just a hell of a lot less pain and suffering, but I don’t think it’s right.

Jordan Schneider: I have three book recommendations for you.

Feeding Ghosts — this one is best suited for midnight reading. It’s actually a graphic memoir. It just won the Pulitzer. It’s a personal history with the US-China arc in it that I can’t wait for you to read.

The Social History of the Machine Gun — it is probably the most stylishly written military history I’ve ever come across. It goes through the technology, the companies, the acquisition side, and then the human and strategic implications. Fantastic. Someone’s going to have to write the social history of the drone. We didn’t get to drones today. We’ll have you back maybe. But that book’s a real treat.

High taxes, burdensome regulations, and an anti-business climate are pushing the wealthiest and high-earners to sunnier, lower-tax havens such as Nevada, Texas, and Florida.

Far from the progressive narrative of a booming millionaire class, recent data reveals a selective exodus among the ultra-wealthy, threatening the state's economic vitality.

Consider the numbers. A 2024 SmartAsset study, analyzing IRS migration data, found Washington lost a net 222 high-earning millennial households (incomes over $200,000) between 2021 and 2022, the eighth-highest loss nationwide. By mid-2025, a follow-up report showed wealthy Gen Z-ers fleeing even faster, with Washington second only to Illinois in net outflows of affluent young professionals. These aren't isolated cases; they're symptomatic of a broader flight fueled by policies like the 2022 capital gains tax and looming wealth tax and income tax proposals.

Prime examples are easy to find. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos relocated to Miami in 2023, citing Florida's no-income-tax environment as a draw for his fortune. Elon Musk followed suit, shifting Tesla's headquarters (from California) and his own residence to Texas in 2021, escaping a similar regulatory environment to Washington. More quietly, tech executives from Microsoft and Amazon are bolting to Las Vegas. A March 2025 Bloomberg report detailed how Nevada relators are closing deals on $8 million-plus homes for Seattle transplants (one exiting resident this author knows), drawn by zero state income or capital gains taxes. Microsoft President Brad Smith warned at a GeekWire event that such moves could inflict ""lasting damage"" on Washington's tech sector, raising consumer prices and slashing jobs.

Progressive think tanks, like the Institute for Policy Studies, tout a 46.9% growth in Washington's ""millionaire class"" from 2022 to 2024, from 463,000 to 681,000 individuals. But this masks the truth. Aggregate growth stems from stock market gains and new entrants, not retention of top talent. Ultra-high-net-worth residents, those with $50 million-plus, saw only a 42.6% rise, yet anecdotal evidence and migration stats show the biggest fish swimming away. The capital gains tax raised $1.2 billion, but at what cost? For every dollar collected, the state risks losing billions in economic activity from departing innovators.

The wealthy among us remodel homes, buy cars, invest in start-ups and give money to philanthropic endeavors. All of this economic activity creates jobs for those lower on the income ladder.

This exodus isn't inevitable. Repeal the capital gains tax, scrap the wealth tax proposals, and ease regulations to make Washington more competitive. Otherwise, we'll hollow out the engine of our prosperity, leaving behind a tax base too thin to sustain our ambitions. It's time for policymakers to prioritize growth.",https://www.washingtonpolicy.org/Library/imglib/iStock-1021333836.jpg?v=3785073596,N,,2025-11-18 08:58:36.099801

Japanese group Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. has completed the sale of its US subsidiary TVL LLC to Grayrock Energy for $255mn. TVL LLC owns upstream gas exploration and production assets in the Haynesville and Cotton Valley formations, located in Louisiana within the Ark-La-Tex region. This transaction marks a targeted divestment rather than a general withdrawal from the US gas market, reinforcing Tokyo Gas’s dynamic management of its upstream portfolio.

Strategic reorganisation in US upstream gas

TVL LLC is part of a broader structure built by Tokyo Gas in the US through TG Natural Resources LLC (TGNR), formed following the 2020 acquisition of Castleton Resources. The divested assets span approximately 315,400 net acres in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley. By selling TVL LLC, Tokyo Gas reduces its exposure to a specific asset pocket while reinforcing its positions in core production hubs.

Tokyo Gas’s “Compass Transformation” strategy for 2023–2025 and 2026–2028 emphasises capital reallocation to high-value segments, particularly the liquefied natural gas (LNG) chain. This strategic focus is supported by enhanced positions in American shale gas assets.

Major investments maintained in shale gas

The sale of TVL follows two major acquisitions by TGNR: Rockcliff Energy II for approximately $2.7bn in 2023 and 70% of Chevron’s East Texas gas assets for $525mn in 2025. With over 400,000 net acres and a production rate of 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, TGNR is now a central pillar in Tokyo Gas’s US gas strategy.

Grayrock Energy, a private operator active in Texas and Oklahoma, is strengthening its position in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley through this deal. TVL’s producing assets offer potential synergies with existing Grayrock holdings, paving the way for refinancing or future divestment.

Capital discipline and growing shareholder pressure

The TVL LLC divestment comes as Tokyo Gas faces increasing pressure to improve capital efficiency. In spring, the group announced a net income target of ¥131bn for FY2026, alongside plans for share buybacks and dividend increases. It also revealed plans to divest approximately ¥100bn in assets, including real estate.

The entry of US fund Elliott Management into the capital structure has accelerated this portfolio reshaping. The transaction with Grayrock Energy demonstrates Tokyo Gas’s willingness to monetise non-core assets while maintaining its ambitions in the US gas market, particularly through synergies between shale production and LNG value chains.

During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.","WASHINGTON (AP) — More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data — a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.

Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank, and the advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.

Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.

“There’s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they’re falling behind,” Margetta Morgan said.

Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.

These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living. The president spoke about the economy and affordability issues Monday at an event hosted by the McDonald’s fast food company.

“We have it almost at the sweet spot and prices are coming down on different things,” Trump said at the event, adding that inflation has been “normalized” at a “low level.”

Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year’s midterm elections.

Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills — meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.

The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration’s reputation.

“In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems.”

Nearly 6 million households have utility debt “so severe” that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation’s analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel.

During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.

“Voters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it’s causing their power bills to go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that’s its choice.”

Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.

The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.

“Electricity prices are a state problem,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. “There are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.”

The new analysis of utility bills by the groups counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs “by impeding renewable energy generation” including solar and wind power.

While that analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures.

The New York Federal Reserve has said delinquency rates of 90 days or more for mortgages, auto loans and student debt have each increased over the past 12 months, though it said mortgage delinquencies are “relatively low.” An analysis of debit and credit card spending by the Bank of America Institute showed that consumers’ “overall financial health looks sound.”

First Solar announced it will invest $330 million in a US module manufacturing facility in Gaffney, South Carolina.

The new facility will span over one million square feet and is designed for the production of First Solar’s Series 7 thin-film solar modules. The plant is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026.

This expansion will add an estimated 600 new jobs to the region. It is projected to increase First Solar’s total US annual production capacity to 17.7 gigawatts (GW), adding 3.7 GW of new capacity.

The investment is part of a broader strategy to solidify First Solar’s U.S. manufacturing base. The company currently operates facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio. This South Carolina announcement follows a separate $1.1 billion investment in new capacity, which includes a new factory in Louisiana and expansion of its existing Ohio footprint, both expected to be operational in 2025.

First Solar utilizes a thin-film technology platform that differs from traditional silicon-based solar panels. The company states its modules have a carbon footprint that is up to 30% lower than that of typical crystalline silicon PV panels manufactured in China.

The company’s expansion is occurring in a market influenced by U.S. industrial policy. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes advanced manufacturing production credits designed to incentivize domestic production of solar components. And this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, barring solar projects from tax credits if they source products from Chinese businesses or businesses with substantial investment from Chinese entities.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The move into South Carolina follows recent challenges for other manufacturers in the US solar market. Qcells, another major producer, recently faced customs delays on components and furloughed workers in Georgia.

President Trump has been sending the National Guard throughout the US, with the latest deployment being to Portland, Oregon, before it was blocked by a judge.

But in Louisiana, Gov. Jeff Landry is welcoming the idea of federal troops. Roughly one week ago, he announced that he'd asked President Trump to send the National Guard to New Orleans, Shreveport and Baton Rouge.

Capital Access reporter Brooke Thorington spoke with East Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sid Edwards about his view of troops coming to the capital city, and how he hopes they would help address problems of crime, traffic and blight.

As electric vehicles make their way into the marketplace, consumers are asking questions about the practicality of these cars for all of our needs. Especially when it comes to hauling, towing and long-distance road trips.

Travis Pittman, private EV charging consultant and a contributor to Louisiana Clean Fuels, tells us about a recent case study he did comparing EVs to standard gasoline cars.

The Plan brings together more than 30 international partners and over 50 coordinated actions to advance national, subnational, and sectoral strategies for doubling energy efficiency by 2030. It will deliver roadmaps, policy frameworks, training programmes, and investment pipelines to scale efficient technologies and transform commitments into measurable results across countries.

The Plan is supported by a broad coalition of leading institutions including UNIDO, UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre, WRI, CLASP, RMI, WWF, AEEE, OECD-CEFIM, Solar Impulse Foundation, Energy Transitions Commission, Consumers International, C2ES, PEEB, AEE, the Department of Energy of the Philippines, and the Energy Efficiency Movement, among others.

Recognizing that financing remains one of the biggest barriers to scaling action, Mission Efficiency has launched the Energy Efficiency De-Risking Platform, a key component of the Plan designed to connect investors with efficiency projects and standardize tools that reduce risk and unlock capital flows.

The Mission Efficiency Plan elevates energy efficiency as both a powerful climate solution and a major investment opportunity – as communities require upgrades to a broad swathe of infrastructure, appliances and services, plus strengthened energy grids to meet growing energy demand and increased resilience against the worst impacts of climate change.

As COP30 — the “Implementation COP” — focuses on translating global pledges into real progress, Mission Efficiency is contributing through its active role in the COP30 Activation Groups, which convene leading initiatives to advance practical, high-impact solutions. Under the Transitioning Energy, Industry, and Transport axis of the COP30 Action Agenda, Mission Efficiency is working with governments, financiers, and technical partners to ensure that energy efficiency becomes central to implementation—linking policy ambition with investment and delivery on the ground.

RELATED: El Paso residents react as utility rate hikes add up","The El Paso City Council has unanimously voted against a proposed 27% price increase by Texas Gas, reflecting strong opposition from local residents.

The council's 9-0 decision sends a clear message to the Texas Railroad Commission in Austin, which will ultimately decide on the proposal.

Residents expressed concerns about the financial burden the hike would impose, with Mary Woodruff-Herman highlighting potential hardships such as cutting back on medications and travel.

Harrison Parker reports on City Council rejecting gas rate hike

Angel Ulloa criticized the utility's justification, saying, ""Their explanation felt extremely incomplete.""

State Rep. Vince Perez and other El Paso representatives echoed these concerns, noting the timing amid rising inflation and costs.

In a joint letter, they stated, ""Our people can’t afford an increase."" City Council member Deanna Maldonado-Rocha emphasized the devastating impact on residents forced to choose between essential needs. The Texas Railroad Commission is expected to vote on the proposal in early 2026.

City officials said the decision follows months of review, analysis by the City’s financial and legal experts, and extensive community engagement, including eight public meetings across all districts earlier this month.

City Council has been clear from the start: any increase must be justified, data-driven, and equitable,” said City Attorney Karla Nieman. “This Council is standing up for working families by rejecting a proposal that would have unfairly shifted costs from other regions of Texas onto our community. We remain committed to advocating before the Railroad Commission to ensure that El Paso residents are treated fairly.

The case now proceeds to the Railroad Commission of Texas, which will make the final determination in early 2026.

Residents made their voices heard throughout this process, and I want to thank every El Pasoan who spoke up,” said Mayor Renard U. Johnson. “Today’s decision reflects that input and reinforces our duty to protect fairness, transparency, and accountability for every household and business in our city. We will not allow El Paso families to be overcharged to subsidize other regions. We will continue to stand up, push back when necessary, and defend what is right for El Paso.

El Paso's delegation to the Texas House of Representatives has urged the City of El Paso to reject Texas Gas Service's proposal to increase rates for local customers.

In a letter sent ahead of the city's hearing on the matter, Speaker Pro Tempore Joe Moody and Representatives Dr. Mary E. González, Eddie Morales Jr., Claudia Ordaz, and Vincent M. Perez emphasized the financial strain such an increase would impose on residents.

""We’re writing to say very clearly that our people can’t afford an increase,"" they stated.

El Paso residents could soon be paying more for utilities as several companies move forward with rate changes that combined, could add up to about $40 more a month — though the final amount will depend on pending decisions.

According to Texas Gas Service, the utility is proposing a 27% rate increase for El Paso customers. A change that would raise the average residential bill by about $10 to $14 per month. The company says the increase is needed to cover service costs and maintain reliable service.

Impact of WOTUS Proposal on Agriculture For producers, the proposal could simplify compliance by narrowing which water features fall under federal oversight and confirming exclusions that many farm groups have long advocated.
Zeldin says the aim is “protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution” while preventing unnecessary burdens on farmers and ranchers.
Due to litigation that followed the January 2023 WOTUS rule, which was considered in the Sackett decision, different states are following different rules.
Based on these potential timelines, a new — potentially final — WOTUS rule could take effect as early as late February.","Farmers and ranchers could soon face fewer regulatory hurdles when working near waterways, as EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers released a new proposal on Nov. 17 to redefine “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS). The agencies say the proposed rule is designed to bring long-requested clarity to what features fall under federal jurisdiction potentially reducing permitting uncertainty for agriculture, landowners and rural businesses.

The proposed rule will soon be published in the Federal Register, according to EPA. Once posted, the public will have the opportunity to comment through the Federal Register or via Regulations.gov.

The definition of WOTUS determines when producers must secure permits for projects that could affect surface water quality, including common activities such as building terraces, installing drainage or expanding livestock operations. EPA officials say the new proposal aims to align fully with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and prevent farmers from needing lawyers or consultants simply to determine whether a water feature on their land is federally regulated.

The proposal follows EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s promise in March to launch the biggest deregulatory action in history and a series of listening sessions in April and May that asked states, tribes, industry and agriculture to weigh in on WOTUS needs.

Clearer Definition After Years of Confusion

Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle emphasize the rule is designed to be clear, durable and commonsense.

Key elements include:

Defined terms such as relatively permanent, continuous surface connection, and tributary to outline which waters qualify under the Clean Water Act.

A requirement that jurisdictional tributaries must have predictable, consistent flow to traditional navigable waters.

Wetlands protections are limited to wetlands that physically touch and are indistinguishable from regulated waters for a consistent duration each year.

Reaffirmed exclusions important to agriculture, including prior converted cropland, certain ditches and waste treatment systems.

A new exclusion for groundwater.

Locally-familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether water features meet regulatory thresholds.

EPA says these changes are intended to reduce uncertainty that has stemmed from years of shifting definitions across administrations.

Impact of WOTUS Proposal on Agriculture

For producers, the proposal could simplify compliance by narrowing which water features fall under federal oversight and confirming exclusions that many farm groups have long advocated.

Zeldin says the aim is “protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution” while preventing unnecessary burdens on farmers and ranchers. He criticizes past Democratic administrations for broad interpretations that, in his view, extended federal reach to features that did not warrant regulation.

Farm groups have argued for years that unclear or overly broad definitions can lead to significant costs, delays and legal risks when planning conservation work, drainage projects or infrastructure improvements. A more consistent rule could reduce project backlogs and limit case-by-case determinations that often slow progress during planting, construction or livestock expansion.

“We’ve seen WOTUS definitions, guidance and legal arguments change with each administration,” said Garrett Hawkins, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, during the May 1 EPA listening session for agriculture. He adds: “farmers, land owners and small businesses are the ones who suffer the most when we don’t have clear rules.”

Several of those who gave testimony and public comment during the ag listening session argued that farmers and ranchers, who already struggle with unpredictable markets and tight margins, shouldn’t have to hire experts to identify elements of their own land.

“A practical WOTUS definition will allow the average landowner — not an engineer, not an attorney, not a wetland specialist — to walk out on their property, see a water feature and make, at minimum, a preliminary determination about whether a feature is federally jurisdictional,” says Kim Brackett, vice president of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, who also gave testimony in May.

Alignment With the Sackett Decision

After the Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA ruling, which restricted federal authority over many wetlands, the agencies say the previous WOTUS definition no longer aligned with the law. EPA already issued a memo earlier this year clarifying limits on jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. The newly proposed rule is the next step in that process.

The proposed rule focuses on relatively permanent bodies of water — streams, rivers, lakes and oceans — and wetlands that are physically connected to those waters. Seasonal and regional variations are incorporated, including waters that flow consistently during the wetter months.

The current situation is a regulatory patchwork. Due to litigation that followed the January 2023 WOTUS rule, which was considered in the Sackett decision, different states are following different rules. Currently, 24 states, mostly the coastal and Great Lakes states, are operating on the 2023 rule, while the other 26 states, mostly those in center and in the Southeast, are operating on pre-2015 WOTUS rule.

Oversight Rests With State and Tribes

A major theme of the proposal is cooperative federalism, giving more authority to states and tribes to manage local land and water resources. EPA says the rule preserves necessary federal protections while recognizing states and tribal governments are best positioned to oversee many smaller or isolated water features.

Sections 101b and 510 of the CWA are key structural examples of the concept of cooperative federalism. The sections give states and tribes the right to set standards and issue permits for federal activities that could discharge pollutants into a water of the U.S. within the state or territory. The most common example of this are 404 dredge and fill permits.

This focus on cooperative federalism was the main chorus of the EPA’s listening session for states, held April 29, especially as it concerns wetlands.

“If more wetlands are excluded from WOTUS, then certain federal projects would not require a section 401 water quality certification by the states,” noted Jennifer Congdon, director of federal affairs for New York Department of Environmental Conservation, during the states’ listening session. She argues that such a situation could impair water quality within a state, thus violating states’ rights under the CWA.

What Happens Next

The proposed rule will soon be published in the Federal Register, kicking off a 45-day public comment period. EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers will hold two hybrid public meetings, and details for submitting comments or registering to speak will be available on EPA’s website.

After the comment period, the agencies plan to move quickly toward a final rule.

“Once the rule is finalized, it typically takes effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register pursuant to Congressional Review Act requirements,” the EPA press office told The Packer earlier this summer.

Based on these potential timelines, a new — potentially final — WOTUS rule could take effect as early as late February.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/f1eba75/2147483647/strip/true/crop/853x480+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffj-corp-pub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fs3fs-public%2Firrigration_ditch_feature.png,N,,2025-11-18 12:08:22.761749

Post-Tax Credit Market Reality Sets In The September 30, 2025 tax credit expiration fundamentally altered EV economics overnight.
But here’s the silver lining that mainstream coverage misses: this is exactly what the used EV market needed.","A record wave of electric vehicle lease returns is set to flood the used car market in 2026, creating what analysts are calling an “EV avalanche” that could dramatically reshape pricing dynamics and deliver unprecedented opportunities for budget-conscious buyers.

At least 243,000 EV leases will expire in 2026, with the figure potentially reaching 330,000 vehicles, according to J.D. Power data reported by Autoblog. This represents more than three times the volume of EV lease returns seen in 2025, setting up a supply surge at precisely the moment federal tax credits have vanished from the market.

The timing couldn’t be more significant. These returning vehicles represent the tail end of the “lease loophole” era when federal incentives made leasing EVs more attractive than purchasing, driving lease rates to historic highs. Now those same vehicles are returning to a market fundamentally transformed by the September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Used EV Prices Already Dropping Below Gas Vehicles

The used EV market is already showing signs of the coming shift. Edmunds data shows that used EVs currently average $29,922, approximately $1,100 below the average cost for a comparable gas-powered vehicle. This price advantage marks a significant reversal from just two years ago when used EVs commanded premium pricing due to limited supply.

More importantly, used EVs are moving faster than any other powertrain type. According to Edmunds’ Q3 2025 analysis, electric vehicles sold in an average of 34 days compared to 41 days for the overall used market. Eight of the 20 fastest-selling three-year-old vehicles were EVs, despite limited 2022 model availability.

The question now is what happens when supply triples in 2026. Dealerships already dealing with slower new EV sales following the tax credit expiration will face hundreds of thousands of lease returns requiring remarkably space and remarketing resources.

The Loyalty Gap: Sentiment Versus Reality

While 94% of current EV owners say they will “definitely” or “probably” consider an EV for their next vehicle, according to J.D. Power’s 2025 Electric Vehicle Experience Ownership Study, actual behavior tells a different story. In 2025, only 62% of returning franchise EV lessees actually chose to purchase or lease another EV.

That 32-percentage-point gap between stated intention and actual behavior becomes critical when applied to 243,000 returning leases. If the 2025 pattern holds, roughly 92,000 lessees who could have gone electric again will instead choose gas vehicles or hybrids—adding significantly to dealer used EV inventory challenges.

The disconnect reflects broader market uncertainty. With tax credits gone, EV tax credits expiring, and automakers continuing to prioritize hybrid powertrains, drivers may choose to wait rather than commit to electrification. Current EV market share has dropped to just 6% of new vehicle sales in November 2025, down sharply from 12.9% in September when buyers rushed to secure the expiring tax credit.

Post-Tax Credit Market Reality Sets In

The September 30, 2025 tax credit expiration fundamentally altered EV economics overnight. New EV sales plummeted 24% in October compared to September, exactly as industry analysts predicted. Without the $7,500 federal incentive effectively reducing purchase prices, EVs must now compete purely on operational economics and total cost of ownership.

This creates unusual market dynamics. A three-year-old Tesla Model Y or Chevrolet Bolt returning from lease in 2026 could be priced thousands below a comparable new model, even without factoring in the now-expired tax credit that would have applied to new purchases. For buyers focused purely on price, the value proposition of used EVs becomes increasingly compelling.

Automakers are already responding with aggressive tactics. Tesla eliminated down payment requirements on Model Y leases in mid-November, effectively absorbing roughly $3,000 in upfront costs to maintain competitive lease pricing against the rising tide of used inventory. The move signals recognition that new EV sales must compete not just against gas vehicles, but against their own lease returns.

Dealer Dilemma: Inventory Management in Uncertain Times

Dealerships face a complicated calculus. Vehicle leases written in 2022-2023 assumed EVs would retain roughly 50% of their value after three years. Currently, EVs are retaining only about 40% of their value, creating a gap between expected residual values and actual market prices.

Autoblog reports that leases written during the peak incentive era presumed value retention that no longer exists in today’s market. Every day a vehicle sits unsold on the lot represents depreciation, and with 243,000-330,000 units potentially flooding the market, dealers will face pressure to move inventory quickly.

This dynamic benefits buyers tremendously. Models like the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, and Tesla Model Y—which dominated lease sales in 2022-2023—are expected to be widely available at competitive prices. Battery health concerns, once a major barrier to used EV adoption, have largely been addressed by real-world data showing most EVs retain 80-90% of battery capacity after 36,000 miles.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking this exact scenario for six months, and watching it unfold feels like witnessing a slow-motion car crash that was entirely predictable. Back in July, we reported that nearly 1 million EVs leased between 2022 and early 2025 would be maturing, with 123,000 returning in 2025 alone and 329,000 in 2026. When Senate Republicans pushed to end the $7,500 tax credit in June 2025, we warned the industry was about to face its moment of truth.

Then came the predicted collapse. October EV sales cratered 24% in a single month after the September 30 tax credit expiration. Within weeks, GM announced layoffs and idled $2 billion in battery plants. The dominoes fell exactly as we said they would.

Now we’re watching the next phase: an artificially created lease return tsunami meeting a market stripped of the subsidies that created those leases in the first place. It’s market correction on a massive scale, and it’s going to be painful for dealers and automakers who bet on sustained government support.

But here’s the silver lining that mainstream coverage misses: this is exactly what the used EV market needed. For years, limited supply and inflated new EV prices kept electric vehicles out of reach for average buyers. The “lease loophole” that boosted new EV sales from 2022-2024 is now about to democratize EV access through a flood of three-year-old vehicles hitting the market at prices gas cars can’t match.

The irony is delicious. Federal subsidies artificially inflated new EV demand through generous lease incentives, creating a bubble that must now deflate without those same subsidies. The 2026 lease returns represent the chickens coming home to roost for an industry that became dependent on government support rather than building products that could compete on pure economics.

For buyers, 2026 could be the year EVs finally become genuinely affordable without requiring taxpayer subsidies to bridge the gap. Models with 250+ miles of range, modern tech features, and known battery health will be available for $20,000-$30,000—a price point that actually competes with used gas vehicles on total cost of ownership.

The EV revolution doesn’t need tax credits to succeed. It needs EVs that make economic sense without them. This market correction, painful as it may be for dealers and automakers, might be exactly what moves the industry from subsidy-dependent to genuinely competitive.

We tried a new tool that provides actual EV battery health data, and it worked so well that we think it could be a big game changer in terms of used EVs.","Whether you're a fan of them or not, electric vehicles do offer some advantages over traditional internal combustion engine automobiles. For instance, tests have shown that a high-mileage electric car is basically as efficient as a brand new one. However, lingering in the back of the mind of many EV owners is the ever-present concern of a failing battery. It's not hard to understand why, as a replacement could cost up to $36,000, and that doesn't include the cost of the install.

So no one batted an eye when older tests cautioned drivers to take it easy behind the wheel of an EV, as things like an aggressive lead foot could wear down the battery quicker. It wasn't just pedal-down acceleration that was vilified, either, as even sudden stops have been labeled as detrimental to the health of the battery. The problem, of course, is that any human trying to navigate modern roads day-to-day will regularly need to be aggressive or sudden. Don't you have to accelerate quickly to pass or to merge onto the highway? Haven't there been occasions (through no fault of your own) where you needed to forcefully apply the brakes?

Fortunately, some new research out of Stanford has come to a drastically different conclusion. In fact, quick acceleration, braking, and brief moments of rest could actually lengthen the life of cells inside the battery by as much as 38%. This turns conventional wisdom on its head, and it may provide many EV owners some peace of mind. But why is this new data so different from previous research findings?

The previous approach to this sort of research was to apply a consistent and continual load on the battery to measure its performance and lifespan. This, unfortunately, is completely counter to the unpredictable conditions of real-world driving. Such conditions can vary greatly, especially when considering the actions of other motorists.

So, the team at Stanford decided that rather than a static load, they would instead include tests that mimic realistic loads. These tests cover what happens when continually accelerating and braking as you would when navigating through the city. By applying several different discharge profiles across 92 lithium-ion batteries, the Stanford team proceeded with these for over two years. Not only did this approach reveal some surprising results in terms of battery lifespan, but it also uncovered some problems when exposing EV batteries to constant loads.

This new research discovered that the previous tests were placing strain on the batteries. The constant load facilitated lithium plating, which describes a gathering of metallic lithium on the anode, contributing to battery wear. If that wasn't bad enough, Stanford also discovered that a buildup of high temperatures shortens battery life. This is why electric vehicles like Tesla's, Ford's and GM's use cooling tech on the batteries, to help minimize heat.

While you might not need to be as concerned behind the wheel of your EV in terms of being gentle with the pedals, there are still ways you could hurt your batteries. For example, you should avoid draining the batteries completely or charging them fully. The sweet spot for longevity has been shown to be between 20% and 80% charge.

Just like with traditional gasoline-powered cars, leaving your EV stationary for lengthy periods of time isn't healthy for it. However, there are moments when this may be unavoidable. You should consider keeping a regular eye on your charge level during those times, as it can lower over time. This can drop to levels below 20%, forcing the battery to work harder and leading to a shortened lifespan.

Be sure to stay on top of scheduled battery tests and don't put off software updates, as they could pertain to battery management. For those who want to take it a step further, there are standalone diagnostic devices that can provide more information.

The planned federal incentives for Vulcan would fund equipment used for the domestic production of its magnets.","A Pentagon-backed Research Triangle Park startup could announce as soon as Tuesday plans for a major manufacturing plant in Johnston County — a deal that, if consummated, could make North Carolina a U.S. hub for rare-earth magnets.

RTP-based Vulcan Elements earlier this month announced a $1.4 billion deal with the federal government that would help the company meet its goal of producing up to 10,000 metric tons of Neodymium Iron Boron magnets over several years. The magnets are used in commercial products such as medical devices, electric vehicles, wind turbines, computer chips, and in defense applications such as fighter jets, nuclear submarines and satellites.

People familiar with the effort told WRAL that the company has been considering an expansion that could create upwards of 1,000 jobs and an investment approaching $1 billion. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the negotiations.

There is no guarantee North Carolina will land the plant, the people said. Vulcan Chief Executive John Maslin told WRAL News this month that the company was engaged in a monthslong, multi-state hunt for expansion sites and that the company expected to make an announcement by the end of November.

A Vulcan spokesman on Monday declined to comment on the company’s plans.

The Johnston County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday morning is holding a special public hearing, where it could approve a proposed economic development agreement for an undisclosed manufacturer considering an expansion in Banner Township. The hearing would follow a meeting of the state Commerce Department’s Economic Investment Committee, which approves state incentives for companies with plans to expand in North Carolina. After the meetings, Gov. Josh Stein is scheduled to make an economic development announcement at an industrial property near the Johnston County town of Benson.

County economic development officials declined to identify the company or describe the project, which was described in a public hearing notice that also didn’t identify the company. David Rhoades, a spokesman for the state Department of Commerce, also declined to discuss the nature of the state’s meeting, adding that the state’s corporate recruiters frequently have discussions with companies about expansion plans. “We don’t comment on those discussions until the companies make a public announcement of their decision,” he said.

Other people familiar with the negotiations told WRAL News that Vulcan would be the subject of those discussions and the announcement.

Economic development deals are often kept secret, protected from the state’s open records laws to enable state and local governments to negotiate with companies and to allow companies to explore options before finalizing major decisions.

It’s common for state and local officials to coordinate the timing of economic development meetings around corporate announcements. Officials often vote on incentives ahead of major economic development announcements, and often on the same day. Public meetings intended to discuss incentives are typically scheduled only after a company has committed to a location.

Stein’s announcement is at the Crosspoint Logistics Center. The project identified in the county notice is proposing its expansion at Crosspoint, which is south of the nexus of Interstate 95 and I-40.

The state’s performance-based incentives packages are often reserved for companies that plan to create lots of jobs that pay above the county average. Grants are typically paid out if the company meets annual hiring and investment targets.

The county is considering a proposal that includes economic incentives in the form of annual cash grants over a 15-year period — to be paid only after job-creation and investment targets have been met, according to the county notice.

“The county believes this project will help stimulate the local economy, result in new taxable capital investments in real and personal property increasing the tax base, and cause the creation by the company of a substantial number of new, permanent jobs,” the county’s hearing announcement said.

Federal funding boost

The federal government’s interest in Vulcan is centered on its efforts to strengthen the nation’s domestic supply of rare-earth magnets.

The U.S. Department of Commerce said Nov. 3 that it struck a preliminary agreement to receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan. The company’s expansion would be financed in part by a $620 million direct loan from the Pentagon’s Office of Strategic Capital, $50 million of federal incentives from the Department of Commerce under the CHIPS and Science Act, and $550 million in private capital, the company said. Indiana-based ReElement Technologies would also expand its recycling and processing capabilities under the deal, with help from an $80 million direct loan from the Pentagon, matched by private capital.

The planned federal incentives for Vulcan would fund equipment used for the domestic production of its magnets. ReElement Technologies processes end-of-life magnets, electronic waste, and mined concentrates into high-purity rare earth oxides.

“We know that here in the United States, we need resilient, secure supply chains, both for national security, but also for economic resilience,” Maslin, the Vulcan CEO, told WRAL News in an interview after the deal was struck with the federal government. “If we want to win the AI race, these go in data centers, if we want to build out drones for agriculture, consumer delivery, if we want to lead the robotics revolution, if we want to build cars in this country, we need to make sure that we have capacity of critical components here in the US.

Vulcan Elements’ magnets have already been delivered to customers in the defense and technology sectors. Vulcan and ReElement have worked together to help strengthen domestic supply of rare-earth magnets to build security around some of the nation’s most important sectors, executives said.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement after the federal financing deal was struck earlier this month. “We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”",https://images.wral.com/fa7ea18f-4add-4993-9de0-5f710d029032?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-11-18 00:58:54.876158

The resolution passed unanimously, with support from in-state environmental groups — a far greater success than Grove’s past attempts at legislation to curb California’s oil imports from the Amazon.
Against this backdrop, California oil producers also scored their first major win in years with this year’s SB 237, which paves the way for more drilling in Kern County.
Kevin Koenig of the environmental nonprofit Amazon Watch, which opposed SB 237, said the group was not seeking any partnership with California oil producers.
And Newsom, while in Brazil, dismissed Trump’s reported plans to open the waters off the coast of California to more oil as “dead on arrival.”","California’s refineries get roughly 30 percent of their oil supplies from the Amazon-region nations of Brazil, Ecuador and Guyana, some of which they go on to sell to neighboring states, according to the California Energy Commission. Brazil alone supplied about 20 percent of the state’s imported foreign crude last year, overtaking Saudi Arabia and trailing only Iraq, according to the data.

Most of Brazil’s production is offshore and Guyana’s is entirely offshore, not in the rainforest itself. But the optics have only sharpened as Brazil pushes to drill at the mouth of the Amazon at the same time as it hosts the climate talks and Ecuador, the main source of Amazonian oil, advances new oil auctions in its rainforest despite opposition from Indigenous groups.

In-state critics have seized on the contrast: Conservative commentator and GOP gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton urged U.N. climate conference organizers last week not to grant Newsom a speaking slot because of California’s oil imports from the region.

Hilton wrote in a letter that “to have Gavin Newsom lecture the world on climate justice while his administration promotes the decimation of the Amazon would be an insult to the conference and its members.” (Hilton didn’t get a response from the organizers, according to a spokesperson.)

California Democrats have long dismissed the argument that importing oil from the Amazon harms the environment as merely a justification to boost in-state drilling. But one of the people who’s made that argument most loudly, Bakersfield Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove, found new allies this year.

She partnered with Becker on a Senate resolution supporting Indigenous communities resisting crude extraction in the Amazon, SR 51, earlier this year. The resolution passed unanimously, with support from in-state environmental groups — a far greater success than Grove’s past attempts at legislation to curb California’s oil imports from the Amazon.

A few things contributed to that: activists from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon pressed their case, traveling to California this summer to meet lawmakers in Sacramento and protesting in kayaks near the Chevron refinery in Richmond. But also, in-state refineries announced they would close, raising fears of a spike in gas prices — and making lawmakers more sensitive to arguments about where the state’s remaining fuel supply comes from.

“We started this process of really looking holistically at the fuel transition, and part of that is, ‘Let’s get off of oil from the Amazon,’” said Becker.

Against this backdrop, California oil producers also scored their first major win in years with this year’s SB 237, which paves the way for more drilling in Kern County. It marked a major turnaround from just a few years ago, when lobbyists for California oil producers circulated an image of a sloth from the Ecuadorian jungle to urge lawmakers to vote against a state bill requiring a 3,200-foot buffer between new oil wells and neighborhoods, arguing it would increase the state’s reliance on out-of-state oil from environmentally sensitive areas. The pitch was met largely with ridicule from Democrats and in-state environmentalists, who not only passed the law but successfully batted back an oil industry attempt to overturn it at the ballot.

Kevin Koenig of the environmental nonprofit Amazon Watch, which opposed SB 237, said the group was not seeking any partnership with California oil producers. “There’s no sort of strategy of ours that involves a strange-bedfellow scenario where we’re looking to ally with industry,” he said. “We really try to have a united front on the need to get off fossil fuels, whether that’s the Amazon or California.”

What comes next: California oil producers are focused on the future of the state’s refineries, while Amazon Watch and its allies are pushing lawmakers to turn the resolution into a formal task force on Amazon-related extraction and California’s role in it.

In the Business of Energy Efficiency: The Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE) teamed up with Mission Efficiency for a press conference on Saturday. Steven Kukoda of the International Copper Association announced the launch of Mission Efficiency’s global action plan to double energy efficiency by 2030, noting that energy efficiency encompasses the greatest share of action in the Paris Agreement. The plan, which already has buy-in from over 30 global partners, supports a letter to the COP30 Presidency, co-led by BCSE and the Alliance to Save Energy, affirming the commitment of the U.S. private sector to partner with international governments on the 2030 energy efficiency target.

Yes, U.S. CAN: The U.S. Climate Action Network held a press conference to ask the question, “Is COP30 bending the arc towards justice?” Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists identified a week-one “bright spot” as the recognition of the ambition gap between emission reduction commitments and what the Paris Agreement calls for. Youth activist Gemma Gutierrez stressed that Indigenous- and Black-led conversations happening outside the COP proceedings represent the heartbeat of real change. Fellow youth activist Cheryl Kwapong advocated for the addition of a formally recognized constituency for Afrodescendants at the UN table.

High-Level Segment: The High-Level Segment is another opportunity for country leaders to provide comments during COP proceedings. President of the UN General Assembly Annalena Baerbock and Vice-President of Brazil Geraldo Alckmin were among the opening speakers. Baerbock said that the rise of renewable energy is unstoppable and that the challenge now is to make sure that innovation reaches all people, especially in Africa. She also emphasized that the money to invest in climate solutions exists, but it needs to be redirected. Alckmin spoke about Brazil’s leading role in the renewable energy transition, and highlighted its work in energy efficiency, sustainable fuels, and reducing illegal deforestation. He reintroduced the Tropical Forest Forever Facility “as a new way of aligning preservation, the green economy, and social justice,” emphasizing that countries can grow and conserve at the same time.

High-Level Segment Cont.: There are 79 speakers representing countries and country blocs on the list for today, with another 65 leaders scheduled for Tuesday. Today, leaders commented on progress at COP30 so far, their updated NDCs, and the state of the climate crisis. The EU, Norway, Palau (representing AOSIS), and Spain all called out the need to keep decisions tied closely to climate science. Spain additionally highlighted the damage of climate disinformation. Mauritius and Palau both discussed the ICJ’s July opinion on climate. Iraq, representing the G77 and China, discussed “a positive environment"" during the first week of COP, and highlighted the various places climate finance is appearing within the negotiations. Jamaica echoed the need for climate finance to be scaled up, and described the immense damage of Hurricane Melissa. Jamaica’s Minister of Economic Growth and Job Creation Matthew Samuda cited that the hurricane’s rapid intensification was made six times more likely by climate change. Written versions of high-level segment statements are expected to be available here as they are submitted.

Methane Status Update: The UN Environment Programme launched its first review of accomplishments under the Global Methane Pledge and next steps. The report, authored by over 90 experts from around the world, finds that the pledge’s goal—a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030 compared to 2020 levels—is still attainable. One panelist at the launch highlighted that about 72% of methane mitigation potential is in the oil and gas sector, and the vast majority of the steps that companies and countries can take are low cost. However, the report finds that action needs to be taken on the information being collected. Right now, about 90% of methane leaks detected by satellites are not being addressed.

Casting a Wider Net for Net Zero: A Saturday event hosted by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit and the University of North Carolina examined the 2025 Net Zero Stocktake. The report represents the most comprehensive review to date of net-zero targets put forth by countries, regions, cities, and companies. It found that the quantity of net-zero target-setting is on the rise, regardless of political hurdles, but that the quality of those targets is low. Globally, nearly one-third of companies with net-zero targets failed to release an accompanying roadmap or plan for implementation.

Eating the Cost: On Friday, the True Animal Protein Price (TAPP) Coalition discussed the Belém declaration on agri-food greenhouse gas pricing. According to TAPP, the meat and dairy industry is responsible for 60% of food-based greenhouse gas emissions. This declaration, signed by 28 African nations and small Pacific islands, asks 30 OECD countries and China to reduce animal agriculture emissions through “harmonized” greenhouse gas pricing, which could involve taxes on meat or dairy, tariffs on imports, or cap-and-trade emission schemes. The declaration also urges countries to channel 20% to 50% of revenues from animal agriculture-based greenhouse gas pricing into the UNFCCC fund for responding to loss and damage and requests a new framework to continue negotiations on agriculture at future COPs.

The first thing you notice about the electric school bus is what you don't hear: engine noise. A low humming noise is all you might hear as the bus goes down the road. It makes it easier for driver Luther Somerville to hear what's going on inside the bus, too: kids beware.

""I hear a lot more now, hear 'em better. Before with the engine going, you could hear but you couldn't understand,"" Somerville said.

District leaders started looking at electric buses three years ago. And when they realized the incentives made the vehicles less expensive than gas buses, the district went all in.

""We sort of felt like, if we're gonna do this and we believe in it, why wouldn't we do it all at once and not have multiple implementations? Just rip the BAND-AID. Do it once,"" Associate Superintendent Angie Smith said.

ComEd presented the district with a check for $930,000: a rebate for going electric. And the district got other incentives, including $5 million from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to put in charging stations. Electric buses typically cost twice as much as gas buses. But the incentives brought the price down by more than half.

""It's a big step forward, and I think that speaks to the school district to bring clean, quiet and cost effective technology to the students and community,"" said Joshua Williams, with Highland Electric Fleet.

Electric vehicles mean no emissions, and no gas stations. The batteries have a range of up to 100 miles before they need to be recharged. That's enough for some bus routes, but the district will still have plenty of gas buses for the longer runs.

Those on the electric buses will need to be on time in the morning.

America needs a National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy

This article builds on my previous article here, “Astroelectricity: America’s national energy security imperative”. In this article, I explain why the Trump Administration—specifically, the National Space(faring) Council under the leadership of Vice President JD Vance—should formulate a National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy to guide America in undertaking an orderly transition to space solar power-supplied astroelectricity. I also propose a presidential executive order that would task the National Space(faring) Council to prepare such a policy for presidential approval.

Addressing America’s hidden energy security crisis

When was the last time that a prominent national leader discussing energy mentioned that 80% of the energy Americans use comes from fossil carbon fuels while emphasizing that these were non-sustainable and questioning how long these would remain plentiful and affordable? Having been intently focused on America’s energy security for most of the last two decades, I cannot recall a single instance. Instead, the often-intense public rhetoric focuses on climate change, global warming, and the price of gasoline. This lack of forthrightness by our national leaders has deeply buried any public concerns about the consequences of the inevitability that America’s production of these vital fuels will peak and then begin to decline. Unless America aggressively undertakes an orderly transition to sustainable energy, America will economically falter, permanently. With history as a clear guide, warfare will follow just as happened when America first became oil insecure in the early 1970s.

Unless America aggressively undertakes an orderly transition to sustainable energy, America will economically falter, permanently.

I applaud President Trump prioritizing returning America to being energy secure as part of his administration’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. Yet, being built on a foundation of diminishing fossil carbon fuel resources, for MAGA to persist, America must become permanently energy secure using only sustainable energy. For this to happen, the starting point is to formalize a presidential policy firmly establishing how and by when America will undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy.

America’s remaining technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources

How much oil and natural gas remains in America’s “national gas tank”

The following maps illustrate where coal, oil, and natural gas can be found in the contiguous US. These fossil carbon fuel deposits were created hundreds of millions of years ago when the climate favored robust plant growth. By good fortune, America was established on a continent rich in these fuels that at the time of its founding were inconsequential for an agrarian economy but were vital for America’s transition, then unforeseen, over the next two centuries into an industrial powerhouse and global Great Power.

Figure 1: The upper map shows the locations of coal resources in the US. The different colors represent different qualities of coal in terms of pure carbon content. Generally, this indicates different, often overlapping, deeply buried geological formations. The lower map shows where oil and gas wells have been drilled in and around the US. Many of these wells were exploration wells.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) was established in 1879 to identify and locate natural resources, such as fossil carbon fuels, to enable the federal government to understand where and to what extent economically vital natural resources could be used. Periodically, the USGS publishes its estimate of the extent of the remaining in situ resources that are deemed “technically recoverable.” This means the amount that can be brought to market, regardless of cost, using available technological means and within permitted recovery parameters (e.g., legal restrictions.) For federal energy security planning purposes, this USGS estimate is the best available.

As of January 1, 2020, the USGS estimated that the US had nearly 896 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of “technically recoverable” crude oil and natural gas. The estimated values are shown in the following table.

Figure 2: Table showing the remaining US technically recoverable crude oil and dry natural gas resources as of January 1, 2020.

The total amounts for oil and natural gas are the sum of two values. The first is the “proved reserves” in clearly identified oil and gas fields with solid estimates of how much oil and gas can be recovered. These values come from the oil companies controlling the producing fields where they have used test wells, as well as producing wells, to estimate how much oil and natural gas will likely be recovered with high confidence—hence the name “proved”. These estimates are used to establish a valuation of the resources under their control and negotiate future delivery contracts.

Essentially, America’s gas tank would be empty around the year 2100!

As the name implies, the “unproved resources” are simply the best guesses by the USGS of how much additional oil and natural gas would be expected to be produced nationally, beyond the proved resources, based on geological similarity and proximity to proven fields. Of the 896 billion BOE total, 85% is unproved resources. Thus, while there is high confidence in 15% of the total, the majority of what underpins America’s current “on paper” energy security is just a USGS best guess.

The timeline for America’s needed transition to sustainable energy

As shown in the above figure, the US consumed 12 billion BOE of oil and natural gas in 2019. These two fuels supply about 70 percent of the total energy Americans now use. Thus, continued robust oil and natural gas, at affordable prices, is clearly vital to America’s energy security.

America’s economy was quite robust in 2019, prior to the start of the economic disruption beginning in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the further economic sluggishness that persisted since 2020 until very recently, the combined 12 billion BOE is a good planning estimate for how much oil and natural gas America’s economy needs annually, as a minimum, to remain prosperous.

Imagine that the entirety of the nearly 900 billion BOE of US oil and natural gas resources has been located and identified as proved reserves. This is what remains in the “national gas tank,” so to speak, to keep America energy secure and prosperous. At the annual drawdown rate of 12 billion BOE, the nearly 900 billion BOE would be exhausted in only about 75 years. Essentially, America’s gas tank would be empty around the year 2100!

While this is a crude way of estimating how long US domestic oil and natural gas resources will last—given that 85% of the total has yet to be proven—it is the best “formal” federal estimate available to establish a planning timeline for America’s unavoidable transition to sustainable energy. Therefore, around the end of this century, and likely earlier with substantial net exports of American oil and natural gas or increased energy demand from AI and/or population growth, the general use of fossil oil and natural gas will end in America. Since most children alive today—the inheritors of our energy security planning wisdom—will live to see that happen, we have a clear moral obligation to make this transition happen successfully.

Finally, it is important to recognize that the need to begin an orderly transition to sustainable energy is far sooner than 2100. In the decades ahead—no one now knows exactly when—the domestic production of oil and natural gas will peak and begin to decline below domestic needs just as first happened in the 1970s. Without new sustainable replacement energy sources coming online by that time, America will again become energy insecure and need to import oil and natural gas. To avoid a return to the dangers of energy insecurity, America urgently needs a formal sustainable energy transition policy.

Astroelectricity is America’s only practicable primary future source of sustainable energy

Narrowing America’s options to one—astroelectricity

My preceding article summarized the results of my recently released “Assessment of US sustainable energy needs and transition options”. In that assessment, I began by narrowing the potentially scalable transition options to four: wind power, ground solar power, nuclear fission power, and space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity.

Figure 3: Three of the four scalable options for supplying America with sustainable energy are not practicable options for America to pursue.

As discussed in my previous article, no combination of wind power and/or ground solar power provides a practicable solution. Wind power alone or in combination with ground solar power would require coast-to-coast wind farms while ground solar power alone or in combination with wind power would require a massive takeover of agricultural land to build the solar farms. Further, their unpredictable intermittency also prevents these options from being practicable solutions, “able to be put in practice successfully.”

Until there is a demonstrated breakthrough in a new form of clean terrestrial energy generation, this leaves astroelectricity as America’s only practicable path to become and remain permanently energy secure.

The nuclear fission power solution—once again the favored choice of the US Department of Energy—is also an unwise solution as a general energy option to replace fossil carbon fuels. This is due to issues that include the need for massive fissile fuel breeding; real concerns about enabling nuclear weapon proliferation; limited plant siting locations due to natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, floods); very real threats of terrorist, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), and hacking attacks; the lack of approved permanent nuclear waste storage; and, the impracticability of handling a steadily increasing number of decommissioned, highly-radioactive reactors.

Figure 4: Baseline five-gigawatt (GW) space solar power concept showing the SSP platform in geostationary Earth orbit transmitting power via radio waves to the ground astroelectric plant containing the receiving antennas (rectenna) that convert the transmitted power into useful baseload electrical power.

Until there is a demonstrated breakthrough in a new form of clean terrestrial energy generation (e.g., practicable nuclear fusion power), this leaves developing SSP-supplied astroelectricity as America’s only practicable path to become and remain permanently energy secure. Thus, a presidential National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy is needed now.

The scale of astroelectricity needed to remain energy secure

Figure 5: Wind and ground solar photovoltaic farms. (Commercial image, used as permitted.)

A key part of my assessment was estimating the scale of what it will take for America to “go clean.” While needing to know this is obviously required to map out an orderly transition, rarely, if ever, has the magnitude of needed new sustainable energy generation capacity been mentioned in public. Instead, political posturing and usually inaccurate reporting have profoundly misled the American public to believe that a random smattering of wind and ground solar farms will make America’s transition to clean energy practicable and quick.

Figure 6: History of US energy use from 1850 to 2023 with projection to 2100 incorporating an orderly transition to primarily astroelectricity.

The chart above shows America’s historical use of energy, by source, as a percentage of the total energy used as well as a future involving an orderly transition to using only non-fossil carbon fuels by 2100. For this sustainable energy transition planning discussion, the initial phase-in of the primary electrical power supplied by the astroelectric plants notionally begins in 2045, presumably around when domestic oil and natural gas production would peak. From 2045 onward, an increasing supply of clean primary electrical power from the astroelectric plants would make up for reductions in oil and natural gas supplies. (Of course, hydroelectricity, geothermal electricity, and some biomass would likely still be used. However, because these are limited in scalable generation capacity compared to the total need, they are ignored in this top-level discussion.)

The table below shows what I estimate to be the total primary continuous electrical power that America would have needed to have already transitioned entirely in 2019 to sustainable energy. America would have needed 5,424 gigawatts of continuous (GWc) baseload electrical power. Putting the magnitude of America’s needed new clean energy infrastructure into perspective, it is equal to the generating capacity of 2,712 two-gigawatt Hoover Dams operating continuously. (For comparison, America now has around 80 GWc of nuclear fission power and less than 30 GWc of hydroelectric power.)

Figure 7: Amount of equivalent continuous electrical power (GWc) and the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously that America would have needed in 2019 to have already transitioned to sustainable energy.

I assume that SSP platforms will supply 80% of the needed 5,424 GWc. This significantly minimizes the land area within the contiguous US that must be used. However, this will require that around 900 five-gigawatt SSP platforms be built in geostationary Earth orbit by 2100. From 2045 to 2100, an average of around 16 of the SSP platforms must become operational each year for America to remain energy secure. Given the immensity of this undertaking, certainly this is an energy security crisis warranting presidential action beginning with a well-developed National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy,

Figure 8: Comparison of the total land area needed for using only ground solar farms and using just the astroelectric plants to meet the total sustainable energy need of 5,424 GWc of primary electrical power.

Summarizing my concerns in a message to the president

Prior to the publication of my previous article, I sent the following to President Trump with copies to Vice President Vance and the Secretary of Energy, the Honorable Chris Wright:

Dear Mr. President,

As a Professional Engineer (PE) with a deep commitment to America’s energy security, I urge your administration to develop and implement a National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy that will keep America permanently energy secure and energy independent once America’s use of fossil carbon fuels ends.

Your January 20, 2025, Executive Order, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency”, was a needed first step to restore America’s energy security by increasing the domestic supply of energy. However, the underlying threat to America’s energy security remains: the fact that 80 percent of the energy we use still comes from non-sustainable fossil carbon fuels with oil and natural gas accounting for about 70 percent of the total we use. According to January 1, 2020, Government estimates, the US only has about a 75-year technically recoverable supply of these two fuels at the 2019 consumption rate. Hence, without a successful transition to sustainable energy—for which no plan now exists!—America will inevitably, once again, become dangerously energy insecure. It is vital that the Federal Government decisively act to prevent this from happening.

Since 2008, I have extensively studied America’s energy needs and the sustainable energy options America could use to replace fossil carbon fuels with clean electricity and clean carbon fuels. To permanently become sustainable energy secure, while keeping America economically prosperous and at peace, the US would need a new primary sustainable electrical energy supply equivalent to roughly 2,500 Hoover Dams operating continuously.

At this scale needed to replace fossil fuels, my research shows that NO terrestrial sustainable energy sources (including wind power, ground solar power, and nuclear fission power) are practicable replacements. This leaves only space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity as the primary means for America to become permanently energy secure.

To supply astroelectricity, the US needs nearly 900 Manhattan Island-size solar energy collection platforms in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Each of these will transmit 5 gigawatts (GW) of collected solar power via radio waves to its ground astroelectric plant. This astroelectricity will then be used by local utilities to dispatch power to their customers and used to synthesize clean carbon fuels (e.g., gasoline and synthetic methane) and industrial feedstocks (e.g., plastics) from captured CO2 and clean hydrogen to fully replace fossil carbon fuels. With this approach, the transition to sustainable energy will be seamless and orderly. Also, these clean carbon fuels will NOT add any net CO2 to the atmosphere.

It is imperative that the initial GEO SSP systems and ground astroelectric plants be constructed and operating before fracked oil and natural gas production peaks in the coming decades. Achieving this will require establishing a substantial new American human spacefaring enterprise stretching throughout the central solar system to construct and operate those systems. For this transition to be successful, the development of SSP must be prioritized as a national energy security imperative, serving as the cornerstone of a now needed National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy.

My proposed presidential executive order

To build the needed astroelectricity-based clean energy infrastructure and be ready to begin successful initial operations when domestic supplies of oil and natural gas begin to decline, decisive presidential action is needed now. America needs a wartime-equivalent spacefaring industrialization plan to create the substantial American commercial human spacefaring industrial enterprise that will build and operate the nearly 900 SSP systems needed. In parallel, America needs a terrestrial sustainable energy development plan that will build the equally substantial terrestrial sustainable energy infrastructure to convert the transmitted astroelectricity into robust supplies of clean dispatchable electricity, fuels, and industrial feedstocks keeping America’s economy “well fed” and Americans prosperous and energy secure throughout the transition and beyond.

Preceding these plans is the need for a presidential National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy identifying the specific objectives to be accomplished; delegating these to the implementing federal government departments, agencies, and non-governmental organizations; and, communicating these efforts to Congress as proposed legislative changes and authorized expenditures. Triggering the creation of this policy would be a detailed presidential executive order, such as the one I propose in the following:

EXECUTIVE ORDER DECLARING A NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SECURITY EMERGENCY AND DIRECTING THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL ASTROELECTRICITY ENERGY SECURITY TRANSITION POLICY TO INITIATE AND GUIDE AMERICA’S TRANSITION TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1. Purpose and Findings.

A. The energy security of the United States is critically threatened by an inadequate long-term sustainable energy supply. Despite the current abundance of domestic oil and natural gas, America's long-term energy security is uncertain because current attempts to replace fossil carbon fuels with sustainable energy are failing. Fossil carbon fuels are non-renewable, and it is only a matter of time before domestic supplies of oil and natural gas—vital to America’s economy—begin to become scarce, risking a return to America’s energy security-driven geopolitical turmoil that beleaguered America for much of the last half-century.

B. America must immediately begin to plan an orderly transition to practicable sources of abundant, all-year reliable sustainable energy. The complexity of America's energy use requires a substantially new sustainable energy infrastructure that supplies baseload and dispatchable electrical power, sustainable carbon fuels, and sustainable carbon-based industrial feedstocks. To prevent economic disruption and foster public acceptance, this transition must be seamless and non-burdensome to the end users of energy and energy-related products.

C. Current scalable terrestrial sustainable energy options are insufficient to enable America to permanently become energy secure with abundant sustainable energy. To replace fossil carbon fuels, the United States needs over 5,400 gigawatts (GW) of baseload primary electrical power generation capacity to supply needed dispatchable electrical power and synthesize sustainable fuels and industrial feedstocks. For perspective, this is equivalent to over 2,700 2-GW Hoover Dams operating continuously. The scope of the needed new American sustainable energy infrastructure is the first element justifying designating this as a national emergency.

D. Terrestrial intermittent sources, such as wind and ground solar power, are impracticable at the scale required. A coast-to-coast forest of immense wind turbines would still be insufficient to meet US energy needs. Ground solar photovoltaic farms alone would require dedicating over one million square kilometers (about 14% of the contiguous US) to solar farms. Further, neither can supply the baseload primary power needed throughout the year for a reliably functioning national energy infrastructure.

E. Nuclear fission power faces substantial scale-up hurdles. A substantial expansion sufficient to replace fossil carbon fuels raises scale-up concerns regarding fissile fuel breeding, waste disposal, and the necessity to build and decommission thousands of reactors. While the limited use of nuclear fission power could be continued as part of assuring energy redundancy during emergencies, its use shall be consistent with demonstrated nuclear power plant safety assurances, local environmental protection, protections against nuclear weapon proliferation, protections from natural and other security threats to the nuclear plants and American public, Congressional approval of permanent acceptable nuclear waste disposal capabilities and nuclear plant decommissioning regulations, and adequate sources of fissile fuels not enabling nuclear weapon proliferation.

F. The development of practicable commercial nuclear fusion power generation will continue with a goal of achieving a baseload electrical power generation capability to replace existing nuclear fission power plants and augment astroelectric plants. However, considerations noted earlier regarding safety, threats, nuclear weapon proliferation, waste disposal, et cetera, shall be fully addressed in these development efforts for nuclear fusion power to become a true sustainable energy source.

G. Research into nuclear fission power and nuclear fusion power for off-world use, including advanced space propulsion, will continue.

H. Space Solar Power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity will be presumed to become America’s primary source of baseload power feeding America’s clean energy infrastructure. Only SSP-supplied astroelectricity now provides America with an orderly path to transition this century to the abundant sustainable energy needed to replace fossil carbon fuels. Extensive studies undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, and industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s found that SSP is technologically feasible. On this basis, with good confidence and exploiting nearly a half-century of further aerospace technological advances, the United States can initiate the development of SSP-related extraterrestrial and terrestrial capabilities leading to the construction of prototype SSP systems as the first step to the operational deployment of SSP.

I. Despite now having immense remaining in situ technically recoverable fossil carbon fuels, for planning purposes, a complete transition from these vital but non-sustainable energy sources to primarily astroelectricity will be assumed to be needed by 2100.

J. To prevent America again becoming energy insecure, the initial supply of sustainable electrical power from the astroelectric plants must be available no later than when domestic production of oil and natural gas begins to decline in the coming decades. The clear national energy security need to avoid becoming energy insecure again is a second element justifying undertaking this transition as a national emergency.

K. To pursue the development of SSP, America must quickly and fully transition from the current era of limited human space exploration to that of a robust commercial human spacefaring nation operating routinely and safely throughout the central solar system. It is anticipated that thousands of Americans will be working off-world in the coming decades to bring SSP online. Of course, human space exploration (e.g., exploring Mars), led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), will continue, but this shall be an adjunct to the priority of commercializing America’s human spacefaring enterprise to develop SSP.

Section 2. Definitions and guidance.

A. The term “space solar power” (SSP) means sunlight converted into useful electrical power in space and transmitted via electromagnetic (EM) radiation (radio waves or lasers) to ground receiving stations or to other locations in space for use as a power source.

B. The term “SSP platform” means orbiting systems used to convert sunlight into useful electrical power and transmit this power to the ground receiving stations or to other locations in space for use as a power source.

C. The term “astroelectricity” is the name of the electrical power supplied by the SSP-transmitted EM radiation after having been converted into alternating or direct current electrical power.

D. The term ‘‘sustainable (clean) energy infrastructure’’ means the fully integrated system required to replace fossil carbon fuels with sustainable (clean) electrical power, fuels, and industrial feedstocks.

E. The term ‘‘astroelectric plant’’ means a ground receiving station (rectenna farm) used primarily to collect SSP-transmitted EM radiation, convert it into usable astroelectricity, and supply this to the nation’s power grid.

F. The term ‘‘energy supply’’ means the production, transportation, refining, and generation of electricity, fuels, and energy produced industrial feedstocks.

G. The term “spaceworthiness” defines a condition of acceptable operational safety of human space flight systems consistent with and comparable to airworthiness. Spaceworthiness shall be essential for all government and commercial human extraterrestrial transportation systems (e.g., spaceplanes and spaceships) and accommodations (e.g., space stations and space habitats) used by crew, passengers, workers, and guests.

H. The term “spaceworthiness certification” will be an independent means to establish spaceworthiness consistent with and comparable to that undertaken by commercial and military airworthiness certification. Spaceworthiness certification shall be required for all transatmospheric and exoplanetary systems and accommodations used by governmental personnel, commercial operators and crew, and the public, and where the safety of the non-involved public is at a non-remote risk. The imposition of spaceworthiness certification recognizes that for America to successfully become a true human spacefaring nation, the Government’s ethical “duty to care” obligation to ensure the safety of Americans must be met. Military and commercial airworthiness certification protocols have clearly demonstrated that this is the best available means of achieving and maintaining acceptable operational safety and correcting deficiencies that do occur. Logically, the extension and expansion of the airworthiness certification protocols into all aspects of America’s emerging human spacefaring enterprise is warranted. Consequently, federal military and commercial spaceworthiness certification shall replace all other human safety assurance methods and approvals and shall be used for future planning purposes other than those uniquely used only by NASA astronauts.

I. The term “astrologistics” refers to logistics undertaken to transport, deploy, house, sustain, maintain, and provide emergency services to enable Americans to undertake commercial and non-NASA governmental human operations in outer space.

Section 3. Presumptions.

A. For planning purposes, the presumption is that SSP-supplied astroelectricity will provide 80 percent of the total dispatched electrical power and synthetic fuels and industrial feedstocks needed by the US by 2100. The remaining 20 percent by 2100 will come from existing hydroelectric and geothermal-electric sources, biomass energy systems, nuclear fission power plants rebuilt using new modular reactors, and ground solar photovoltaic farms integrated into the rectenna arrays of the astroelectric plants.

B. For planning purposes, 900 5-GW SSP platforms and ground receiving stations (astroelectric plants) within the contiguous US will be needed by 2100.

C. By the year 2100, it will be assumed that existing wind farms, ground solar farms, and nuclear fission power plants not being updated will have been decommissioned due to age.

D. The use of passive solar energy and building roof-top solar power systems will be assumed to be incorporated into new national building codes focused on reducing per person energy use consistent with the objective of a seamless and non-burdensome national transition to sustainable energy.

Section 4. National Spacefaring Council tasking.

A. Under the direction of the Vice President, the National Space Council—hereby redesignated as the National Spacefaring Council—shall prepare a draft National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy for presidential approval. This policy shall identify and address all aspects of America’s transition to using SSP-supplied astroelectricity as the primary source of sustainable energy.

B. The National Spacefaring Council will coordinate its efforts with the National Security Council to ensure that all requirements related to America’s national security are fully addressed during, and subsequent to, America’s transition to sustainable energy.

C. Following presidential approval, the National Spacefaring Council will coordinate the preparation of proposed legislation authorizing, regulating, and funding efforts of the Federal Government and interstate (interplanetary) commerce required to implement the federal responsibilities and taskings identified by the policy.

Section 5. National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy development.

A. Due to the importance of energy use throughout America’s economy, the policy will be comprehensive in nature, essentially becoming an “all of America” roadmap for America’s sustainable energy transition.

B. The policy shall specifically incorporate the term “astroelectricity” in its name to retain its focus on utilizing SSP-supplied astroelectricity as the primary means for America to undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy.

C. The policy will be divided into an extraterrestrial segment, a terrestrial segment, a foreign affairs segment, and an interface segment. (1) The extraterrestrial segment shall address all national needs—governmental and commercial—related to human and robotic spacefaring operations enabling and supporting the off-planet commercial SSP industry. The extraterrestrial segment shall plan the formation of the American commercial and governmental spacefaring operations required to research, develop, resource explore, extract needed extraterrestrial resources, manufacture, construct, deploy, operate, maintain, defend, and protect America’s SSP energy supply. Annexes to the extraterrestrial segment shall:

(a) Identify the responsibilities of the Department of War to protect and defend its own and other governmental and commercial human spacefaring operations throughout the central solar system.

(b) Identify the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security for the operation of a “Space Guard” to undertake law enforcement and other Coast Guard-like responsibilities off-planet consistent with protecting America’s vital interests.

(c) Identify the responsibilities of the Departments of Commerce, Transportation, and War to establish a national astrologistical infrastructure to enable routine, robust, and operationally safe governmental and commercial human spacefaring operations throughout the central solar system.

(d) Include a coordinated strategy by the Departments of Transportation and War to establish military and commercial spaceworthiness certification.

(2) The terrestrial segment shall address all national needs—governmental and commercial—for developing, deploying, and operating the ground portion of the new sustainable energy infrastructure. This will include the astroelectric plants to receive and deliver the imported astroelectricity, the electrical power transmission infrastructure to deliver clean electrical power, and the synthetic fuels and industrial feedstock plants that will use this clean electrical power to supply carbon dioxide (CO2)-neutral carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks. Annexes to the terrestrial segment shall:

(a) Identify specific responsibilities of federal departments and agencies for planning and implementing the terrestrial segment.

(b) Include an idealized optimistic representation/visualization of what a 22nd century America, powered completely by sustainable energy, could look like to familiarize Americans with the full benefits of “going clean”.

(c) Include an economic analysis assessing the cost-effectiveness of reducing America’s current per person energy use by one-half by rebuilding most of America using new technology-enabled 22nd century energy efficiency technologies. The analysis should assess the benefits to be realized by replacing most non-historic 19th and 20th century housing, businesses, schools, and transportation infrastructure to improve America’s overall standard of living while also maintaining an individual’s lifestyle choices (e.g., urban, suburban, and rural).

(3) The foreign affairs segment shall address extending the clean energy security benefits of using SSP to America’s allies and other non-adversarial nations who wish to join with America in transitioning to SSP-supplied astroelectricity. An important facet of this effort is to enable the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals requiring clean and plentiful energy to be achieved worldwide, thereby fostering global peace, prosperity, and joint security.

(4) The interface segment shall identify, coordinate, and track the three separate segments to ensure a wholly coordinated/integrated effort. A product of the interface segment shall be a national report card tracking progress and reporting challenges remaining for America to “go clean” by the year 2100. An annex to the interface segment shall identify a roadmap for maximizing the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) to enable and minimize the cost of America transitioning to sustainable energy.

Conclusion

A century ago, the farsighted pioneering Russian space scientist and philosopher, Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky, wrote “Sixteen Stages of Space Exploration”. He wrote: “Mankind will not forever remain on Earth but, in the pursuit of light and space, will first timidly emerge from the bounds of the atmosphere and then advance until he has conquered the whole of circumsolar space.”

It is imperative that the initial GEO SSP systems and ground astroelectric plants be constructed and operating before fracked oil and natural gas production peaks in the coming decades.

We have now progressed through the first ten stages. Stage 11 is “Using sunlight to power human habitats, propel spacecraft, grow food, and meet humanity’s growing need for sustainable energy” per the modernized version of his writing. With the “Age of Fossil Fuels” ending, the time to undertake Stage 11 has arrived.

Returning America to being energy secure has proven to be a critical step in President Trump’s goal to “Make America Great Again” while also advancing world peace. Developing astroelectricity to make America permanently energy secure will “seal the deal” Trump made with the American people to ensure that America remains free, prosperous, and at peace.

The message at COP 30 this year is that countries in the global south are tired of all the platitudes and empty promises being shoveled their way every year at these international confabs. And so, they are making plans to chart their own course forward instead of waiting for others to act. “Africa is no longer the ‘terrain of aid’ but the front line of solutions” in areas like renewable energy, said Carlos Lopes, the special envoy for Africa for the president of COP30.

Give someone a fish and they will eat for a day. Teach them how to fish and they can feed themselves forever. That axiom is appropriate in the context of renewable energy in Africa. Chinese-made panels have jumpstarted the renewable energy revolution in Africa, according to a report in Japan Times. But African climate leaders say the continent, which holds more than 30 percent of the world’s critical minerals, should be an industrial actor — not an importer — in the clean energy transition.

Between June 2024 and June 2025, Nigeria imported about 1,721 MW of solar panels from China, making it the second largest importer in Africa after South Africa, according to data from the energy think tank Ember. China supplied about 60 percent of Africa’s solar imports during the same period, the report said.

Carlos Lopes said money spent on importing panels, turbines, and software could be used to fund African clean energy design labs and create regional research hubs where local engineers could adapt foreign technology.

The most recent example of how this works is automobile manufacturing in China. More than 20 years ago, US and European companies were mesmerized at the prospect of selling millions of cars to Chinese customers. The kicker was that China required those companies to form joint ventures with Chinese companies.

That led to a massive transfer of knowledge to those Chinese companies, who soon learned how to build cars, trucks, and buses, better, faster, and cheaper than the western companies they were allied with. As a result, Chinese workers are now building cars for local consumption and export domestically and keeping the profits in the country. Africa wants to do much the same thing with solar and and other renewables.

Africa Rising

Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has more than 70 percent of the world’s cobalt reserves, Zimbabwe, which has massive lithium supplies, and Gabon, with its manganese resources, should not only be exporting raw materials but building technologies locally. “When processing happens where the minerals lie, jobs stay, emissions drop, and dignity grows,” Lopes said.

Several African countries are making that transition, including Morocco, South Africa, and Egypt. All of them are ramping up production with solar assembly plants and manufacturing facilities. Egypt is developing three manufacturing plants in collaboration with several Asian cleantech companies, including a Singaporean manufacturer, EliTe Solar, which is set to start a 3-gigawatt facility this year. In October, Nigeria signed a deal with Chinese solar PV manufacturer LONGi to build a 500 to 1,000 megawatt solar panel production factory in that country.

Just as with western automakers in China, the wheel now has turned as African enterprises learn to lean into solar manufacturing. China’s dominance in solar manufacturing is not going away any time soon. After decades of investment that have led to low production costs and a skilled workforce, China is the big dog in renewable energy, and that is not about to change.

But there are opportunities for Africa to insert itself into the solar manufacturing space according to Dave Jones, energy analyst and co-founder of Ember Energy in the UK. By importing Chinese battery cells but assembling other components locally, manufacturers can keep 60 percent of the value chain within their economy. “The cells cost about 40 percent of a panel’s price. So if you’re able to manufacture and do the panel assembly, you’re saving over half and keeping half of that value within the country,” he said.

Salpha Energy Growing In Nigeria

One of the companies that is making that happen is Salpha Energy in Nigeria, which manufactures solar systems and electrically operated consumer products like fans and residential energy storage devices in a factory in the city of Calabar near the southern coast of the country. On its website, it says, “The clean energy era isn’t a distant dream; it’s happening now, and it’s our partners who are making it real. Distributors who take light to the edges of the map. Investors who don’t just fund, but believe. Together, we’re not just talking about a sustainable future — we’re building it.”

In its factory, dozens of young technicians swarm around a production line, picking out solar-powered batteries, fans, and lamps to test for quality. They package the tested products for shipment from Salpha Energy’s solar assembly plant to customers throughout the West African country.

“I can see the same pride I see on the faces of engineers in factories in Tokyo and the United States, where they build things,” said Salpha Energy’s founder, Sandra Chukwudozie. “Except now it’s happening here at home.” That’s a beautiful thing, when you think about it.

She said the assembly plant is a testament to Africa’s ability to produce its green technologies and even export them, as it did last year to Ghana. “We shipped out some batches of our products to Accra — by road,” says Chukwudozie. “For us, it was just to test this idea of Africa-led exports. It carries the Made in Nigeria stamp, and we can sell that across West Africa.”

Since starting up in 2017, Salpha Energy has made solar power systems for more than 2 million Nigerian homes and businesses, and it aims to assemble up to 300,000 units a year, she said. Salpha Energy is part of the green leadership in Nigeria, and the continent overall. African representatives attending COP30 in Brazil are keen to showcase and promote Nigeria’s manufacturing prowess on the global stage.

Renewables In Nigeria

Nigeria has a plan to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and generate 30 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 while developing local manufacturing capacity. Its national grid is now powered 75 percent by gas and 20 percent by hydropower. Other clean energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass account for less than 2 percent.

One intriguing possibility is that much of Nigeria could skip right over building out a national energy grid just as many African countries bypassed a telephone network composed of wires and went straight to cell phones.

That is not to say that energy grids will not be important in cities, but large portions of Nigeria are quite rural and are not serviced by an electrical grid at all. They are ideal candidates for distributed energy resources composed of microgrids and virtual power plants. In March, Nigeria signed a $200 million agreement with the World Bank and other partners to develop solar grids in rural areas as part of its efforts to meet its renewable energy targets.

Is Africa a renewable energy manufacturing powerhouse? Not yet, but it is moving in the right direction, due in part to the transfer of expertise to local companies by Chinese companies. That transfer of information and technology is an inevitable part of a global commerce system. To the extent that African countries can leverage that transfer, they will be better able to chart their own course to a sustainable future, rather than waiting on others to do it for them.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Salpha-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 00:58:28.006756

It is Toyota’s eleventh U.S. plant and the company’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 new American jobs.

Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts. This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA). “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

United States Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy expressed support for manufacturing investments in the U.S., noting that Toyota North Carolina’s investment of nearly $14 billion and the creation of more than 5,000 new jobs marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. The state-of-the-art plant will house 14 battery production lines supporting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), making it a historical investment for Toyota and a substantial economic impact on the Tarheel State.

“Today marks a historic milestone as Toyota begins battery production right here in North Carolina,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This groundbreaking investment will create more than 5,000 new jobs for North Carolinians and will strengthen our commitment to leading the way in both the automotive supply chain and the clean energy economy.”

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV—the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the U.S. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030. Once construction is complete, the new facility will not just be a place of work, but also a vibrant community, featuring a range of amenities for team members, including on-site childcare, a pharmacy, a medical clinic and a fitness center.

“We’re excited to see this innovative facility come to life and to provide cutting-edge careers for more than 5,000 North Carolinians,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina. “Today’s celebration would not be complete without thanking our team members. Their dedication, commitment, and resolve have truly led us to this historic moment. We also are grateful for the support shown to us by the State of North Carolina, Randolph County, and the greater Triad region, a place we are all proud to call home.”

The company remains steadfast in its commitment to being the best in town by supporting workforce development and educational initiatives. Through partnerships with schools and educators across the region, Toyota is developing the Triad’s future workforce with its time, talent and treasure.

During the ceremony, Toyota announced the second phase of Driving Possibilities in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District, with a Toyota USA Foundation grant of an additional $2.7 million. Driving Possibilities is a national STEM education initiative that brings together community, education leaders, local and national nonprofits, and industry partners to co-create programs that strengthen communities and prepare young people for future STEM careers.

“This incredible gift will provide our students and their families with life-changing opportunities,” said Wendy Poteat, president and CEO of shift_ed, a non-profit regional leader connecting education to workforce development, and coordinating partner for the NC Driving Possibilities program. “Toyota has become a generous supporter and dedicated stakeholder in enriching our school districts by inspiring innovation and nurturing curiosity and creativity in our learners from classroom to career.

The letter reiterates errors in EPA’s authorization and emphasizes the impracticality and negative consequences of the 2021 SORE Amendments.
TCIA will continue to monitor the status of California’s SORE Amendments, and update members when notable developments occur.","On October 29, 2025, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI), joined by several organizations including the Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA), sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin supporting OPEI’s petition for reconsideration of the EPA’s Final Rule, “California State Nonroad Engine Pollution Control Standards; Small Off-Road engines Regulations; Notice of Decision.” The letter urges the EPA to withdraw or reconsider the rule, arguing that the decision was based on several factual and procedural errors that could have major implications for manufacturers, dealers, and professional users of small-engine equipment nationwide.

Background

Under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), states are generally preempted from setting their own nonroad engine emission standards. However, Section 209 of the CAA allows California to apply to the EPA for a waiver of federal preemption, permitting the state to enforce its own standards for certain categories of nonroad engines.

In 2021, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted amendments to its Small Off-Road Engine (SORE) regulations, which govern engines under 25 horsepower. These engines power a wide range of commercial and residential equipment—including chainsaws, leaf blowers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, generators, and pressure washers—commonly used across the tree care, landscaping, construction, and maintenance industries. The 2021 SORE Amendments established a two-phase roadmap toward zero-emission standards, with a full phase-out of new gas-powered SORE engines by model year 2028.

On December 20, 2022, CARB submitted an authorization request to the EPA to allow California to enforce the 2021 SORE Amendments. On January 6, 2025, the EPA granted authorization in a Notice of Decision, allowing California to enforce the amendments.

Industry Pushback on EPA’s SORE Approval

On January 29, 2025, OPEI petitioned the EPA to reconsider its authorization, arguing that the decision rested on several key errors: disregarding manufacturer compliance-cost data, overstating the technical feasibility of zero-emission equipment, and allowing CARB to enforce portions of its program before obtaining EPA approval.

OPEI maintained that the EPA relied on retail product prices rather than manufacturer cost data, leading to an underestimation of compliance costs—industry data in the record estimated these costs upward of $1 billion. The petition also cited a December 2024 joint EPA–Department of Energy report that found commercial-grade SORE-powered equipment remains a “notable exception” to electrification trends because of limitations in battery cost, weight, and runtime—contradicting EPA’s own technical findings. Finally, OPEI noted that CARB adopted and began enforcing certain emission requirements as early as 2018, years before obtaining federal authorization, in violation of the Clean Air Act.

On February 10, 2025, OPEI filed a petition for judicial review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Additional petitions were later filed by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) and the Energy Marketers of America (EMA), and the cases were consolidated. In the spring of 2025, the court paused the litigation to allow the new administration time to review the rule.

On June 9, 2025, OPEI submitted a request for an administrative stay to the EPA, asking the Agency to postpone the rule’s implementation while the petitions for reconsideration and judicial review are pending.

Letter Supporting OPEI’s Petition

TCIA, along with seven other trade associations, signed on to a letter supporting OPEI’s petition for reconsideration of the EPA’s Final Rule. The letter reiterates errors in EPA’s authorization and emphasizes the impracticality and negative consequences of the 2021 SORE Amendments.

It also explains that CARB’s SORE Amendments extend beyond lawn and garden tools: other SORE-powered equipment—such as construction equipment, pressure washers, and portable generators—will face emission-reduction requirements in the near term, with zero-emission standards enforced in 2028. The letter argues this timeline creates unreasonable expectations for manufacturers, driving unrealistic demands for rapid redesign and investment.

The letter calls on the EPA to grant OPEI’s petition for reconsideration and withdraw its authorization for the 2021 SORE Amendments, or alternatively, to submit the decision to Congress for review under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The signatories noted that the Agency itself recently determined California waivers are subject to congressional review. Earlier in 2025, Congress used the CRA to overturn EPA’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Cars II waivers, which would have required an increasing share of zero-emission truck and passenger-vehicle sales in future model years.

TCIA will continue to monitor the status of California’s SORE Amendments, and update members when notable developments occur.",https://treecareindustryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/epa.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 20:59:12.361597

The road ahead sounds quieter and less bumpy for Medina, who trains school bus drivers at West Aurora School District 129. In her 20 years behind the wheel, she never expected to drive an electric bus.

The district officially launched 27 zero-emission electric school buses and 28 charging stations — not like the kind of buses adults used to ride.

""It's not that much different inside except that it's way quieter and it produces a lot less emissions,"" said Dr. Angie Smith, associate superintendent for operations for the school district.

""It's completely powered by the battery that sits underneath the bus and can drive over 100 miles fully charged,"" said Joshua Williams, senior Midwest regional manager of Highland Electric Fleets. ""They're already used for daily routes.""

Highland Electric Fleets helped the district transition a third of its buses to electric, making it the biggest electric school bus fleet in the Chicago area. All thanks to federal funding and a big rebate check from ComEd.

The district says each electric vehicle was about half the price of a traditional diesel bus. The EVs will stick to shorter routes – especially as temperatures drop.

""A little bit nervous for the winter,"" Medina said.

""We do plan for cold Chicago winters, so typically, maybe worst-case scenario, they might travel 65 to 70 miles,"" Williams said.

Through the Cumberland District Energy project, ACET is determining how the water trapped in those tunnels could be used to produce geothermal energy that would heat and cool buildings.

Smejkal notes that having a network of mine shafts underneath the village means the entire town could access this clean energy resource.
Using those same abandoned coal mines to produce clean energy doesn’t rewrite Cumberland’s history, Copeman says, but it does use that past to flip the script for its future.","Cumberland, B.C. was built on coal mining—both literally and practically. Thousands of workers were employed and millions of tonnes of coal were exported over 80 years before the mines were shuttered, leaving deep holes in the ground and a deeper void in the village’s economy.

Now, thanks to a partnership with the University of Victoria-led Accelerating Community Energy Transformation (ACET) initiative, Cumberland is planning for a future built on clean energy that comes from the maze of abandoned mine shafts and extraction tunnels that snake beneath its streets.

Through the Cumberland District Energy project, ACET is determining how the water trapped in those tunnels could be used to produce geothermal energy that would heat and cool buildings.

Cumberland Mayor Vickey Brown sees this project as a step toward the reimagining of Cumberland—already an attraction for nature lovers and mountain bikers—as a clean, green outdoor adventure destination. It also represents a potential shift in how longtime locals, relative newcomers and visitors alike view the village.

“This is a way to highlight the history of Cumberland and bring it into a sustainable-future, clean-energy ethos,” she says. “It’s something that old Cumberland can be proud of, because we’re using the waste of that old resource to transition to cleaner energy.”

An old asset, a new opportunity for clean energy

Here’s how it would work: water trapped underground in the abandoned mines is cooler in summer and warmer in winter than the temperature above ground, explains ACET community energy planner and project lead Zachary Gould. Taking advantage of that temperature difference, heat pumps could use the water from the abandoned mines to provide heating and cooling to buildings at a relatively low cost and with near-zero carbon output.

“[The Cumberland District Energy project] is technically a very large ground-source heat exchanger,” adds Emily Smejkal, a fellow with the Victoria-based Cascade Institute who specializes in geothermal energy.

Smejkal notes that having a network of mine shafts underneath the village means the entire town could access this clean energy resource.

To start, however, initial modelling of potential energy systems for Cumberland is focused on a proposed civic precinct redevelopment—a community centre, municipal offices, even affordable housing—and a large industrial zone closer to Comox Lake.

“It’s been a big motivation to think about this energy system in the context of how we can reduce the costs of critical infrastructure and provide critical amenities for community members,” says Gould.

“But it’s not just an energy system,” he notes. “It’s an opportunity to look at resource extraction in a new way in a village that was built on extractive principles. This project could turn those ruins of extraction, so to speak, into an opportunity and a shared community asset.”

Mining was historically the core of Cumberland community

From 1888, when the first mine opened in Cumberland, until the late 1960s, when the last one was closed, some 16 million tonnes of bituminous coal were excavated and shipped from the Comox Valley, says Dawn Copeman, a historian with Cumberland Museum and Archives. A wharf at nearby Union Bay loaded ships that were destined for international markets. Cumberland coal fueled steamships and heated homes. Coal coked in Union Bay was sold to smelters for lead and zinc production.

While the mines were the core of the local economy and community for decades, workers were exploited and their jobs were dangerous. Many miners died and many more were injured while companies sold a product whose burning contributed to climate change.

Using those same abandoned coal mines to produce clean energy doesn’t rewrite Cumberland’s history, Copeman says, but it does use that past to flip the script for its future.

Noting that a proposal in 2011 for a coal mine near Union Bay attracted “a lot of pushback,” she says. In contrast, Cumberland’s proposal to use its abandoned mines to produce geothermal heating and cooling provides a constructive opportunity.

“Being able to use something that’s already there for heating, I think it’s positive,” she says.

‘It’s about reimagining these old relics of industry’

The history of the Cumberland geothermal project started—more than 130 years after the first mine opened—as a discussion among geologists who live in the region and gather regularly.

As Cory MacNeill, a Cumberland local and geologist, recounts it, a conversation amongst peers about the common issue of methane produced by the former mines evolved into chats about other geothermal applications for abandoned coal shafts. While the widely known application of drilling deep into the Earth to access super-heated water wasn’t an option in Cumberland, accessing the water closer to the surface to offset the heat of summer and the cold of winter was.

And they had examples to follow. MacNeill notes similar projects have been established about an hour south in Nanaimo, B.C. and across the country in Springhill, N.S., another former mining town.

“It’s about reimagining these old resources and relics of industry,” he says. “It’s really powerful to look at all of this mining and look at ways that we can benefit from it from a more environmental standpoint.”

Highlighting the past while building a sustainable future

When Brown sat in on one of the geologists’ discussions, she was already aware of the Nanaimo geothermal project at Vancouver Island University and of conversations between a previous Cumberland mayor and officials in Nova Scotia about their geothermal project.

What put the pieces together for her was an ACET webinar for municipal politicians.

“They said, ‘We’re looking for projects to work with municipalities.’ And I thought, ‘I have a project.’”

She explains there are two blocks of municipal property occupied by the village office, council chambers, public works and a rec centre that sit on top of the former No. 6 mine.

“I thought we could use this project as a way to figure out whether or not we could use geothermal for heating and cooling of the buildings because we want to redevelop the block,” she says.

As a small municipality with apopulation of approximately 4,800, Cumberland doesn’t have an engineering department to study such a project. Brown saw that ACET had what the village needed.

“We need their academic expertise and their capacity to help us do those business cases, and also do the [geothermal] exploration side of it,” Brown says.

While the project was initially motivated by the desire to redevelop the municipal precinct, she says, if a pilot geothermal project proves to be successful and sustainable, there is additional potential in what Copeman calls the “vast labyrinth” of tunnels beneath the village.

Brown says providing cheap, clean heating and cooling to businesses could make Cumberland industrial land more attractive for development—especially to enterprises that produce or consume considerable amounts of heat, such as greenhouses and food processors. Drawing businesses, she says, would mean adding jobs and contributing to the tax base, all potentially making the village more livable and sustainable for its residents.

“We haven’t always worked very well with natural systems,” Brown says. “But I think this is a model of using the tools and resources you have in place to look after the needs of your community. And I think that’s far more resilient than the way we’ve done it in the past.”",https://news.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ACET_Cumberland_4_3600x1450.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 00:58:31.543713

,EPA,2025-11-18 00:26:12+00:00,Iowa Capital Dispatch,EPA proposes narrowed rules for Clean Water Act jurisdiction - Iowa Capital Dispatch,Cami Koons,,,,,https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/11/17/epa-proposes-narrowed-rules-for-clean-water-act-jurisdiction/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed Monday new rules to define the waters of the United States, or WOTUS, protected under the Clean Water Act.
Waters of the United States defines the scope of the Clean Water Act and which waters can be regulated with federal water quality standards.
The high court ruled in May 2023 that wetlands without a “continuous surface connection” to navigable waters did not qualify for Clean Water Act protections.
The proposed rules would further define terms like: relatively permanent, continuous surface connection and tributary.
“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters — Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,” Heinzen said.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed Monday new rules to define the waters of the United States, or WOTUS, protected under the Clean Water Act.

The move was celebrated by farm groups that oppose a broad interpretation of the law, while environmental groups said the rule change would end protections for millions of acres of wetlands and small streams.

Waters of the United States defines the scope of the Clean Water Act and which waters can be regulated with federal water quality standards. The WOTUS definition, which is not laid out in the Clean Water Act, has been the source of several U.S. Supreme Court cases in recent decades, most recently in Sackett v. EPA.

The high court ruled in May 2023 that wetlands without a “continuous surface connection” to navigable waters did not qualify for Clean Water Act protections. This was upheld by EPA final rules issued in August 2023, that not only applied to wetlands, but also removed the requirement that waters have a “significant nexus” to a navigable water.

Some conservative groups and lawmakers argued the 2023 EPA interpretation did not go far enough to adhere to the court’s decision in the Sackett case.

EPA’s new rules, made in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, would “fully implement” the Sackett decision, “accelerate economic prosperity” and support the role of states and tribes in regulating their land, according to the agency’s news release.

“When finalized, the rule will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act,” the EPA release said.

The proposed rules would further define terms like: relatively permanent, continuous surface connection and tributary. The rules also establish that tributaries must connect to navigable waters via features that have “consistent” and “predictable flow.”

The rules say wetlands must be “indistinguishable” from jurisdictional waters, with a “continuous surface connection.” The rules will also limit permafrost wetlands from the scope of the definition, include guidance on “wet season” water bodies, and offer exclusions on ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the proposed rules will protect navigable waters, advance cooperative federalism and result in economic growth.

“Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families,” Zeldin said in a statement. “We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

According to the release, the proposed rules were formed around feedback from states, tribal nations, local governments and listening sessions.

American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said, in the release with EPA, the farm organization was “pleased” with the new rules.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” Duvall said. “We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.”

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association similarly celebrated the draft rules Monday. The association’s president and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein said the previous interpretations of the rule have meant things like “prairie potholes or dry ditches” fall under federal regulation.

“Waters of the U.S. has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers,” he said in a statement. “Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed … We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.”

Environmental groups said the newly proposed rules put habitat, drinking water and structures at greater risk.

Environmental Defense Fund’s Vice President Will McDow said EPA’s proposed rules were “not based in science, difficult to implement in practice and will create a dangerous lack of clarity.”

“This rule brings tremendous uncertainty and risk to our nation’s drinking water, flood protections and critical habitats,” McDow said in a statement.

The environmental group Food & Water Watch said the draft rules eliminate “bedrock” protections for rivers, streams, and wetlands. The group said in a news release the rules would “compound the damage” of the Sackett decision that “eliminated protections for tens of millions of acres of sensitive wetlands and small streams.”

Food & Water Watch Legal Director Tarah Heinzen said the rule “flies in the face of science and commonsense” and will lead to more pollution downstream. Wetlands, Heinzen said, offer “critical functions” in providing habitat, protecting clean water and reducing flooding.

“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters — Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,” Heinzen said. “This proposed rule weakens the bedrock Clean Water Act, making it easier to fill, drain, and pollute sensitive waterways from coast to coast.”

The proposed rules will be published in the Federal Register and open for public comment for 45 days. EPA and the Army will hold two public meetings before developing final rules.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/little-walnut-creek-stock-creek-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:58:53.376796

A highly skilled battery manufacturing workforce provides industry stability and creates a foundation for the types of leapfrog innovations and process efficiencies that America needs.","The recent raid at Hyundai’s plant in Georgia grabbed headlines as an immigration story. This moment, however, is about more than visas or workforce enforcement: It was a destabilizing event for US clean manufacturing investment and a baffling signal to our global partners. South Korea, one of our closest allies, raised sharp concerns in response, with President Lee Jae Myung warning that “Korean companies will be very hesitant to make direct investments in the United States.”

In an apparent attempt at damage control during his trip to Asia, President Trump publicly claimed that the Hyundai raid was a “bad idea.” But rather than reassuring allies, the comment deepened confusion about who is steering US policy and reinforced the perception of chaos inside the administration—further shaking investor confidence at a critical moment for clean manufacturing.

According to the annual US Energy and Employment Report from the Department of Energy (DOE), at least 239,000 US jobs are tied to the electric vehicle (EV), battery, and charging economy—and that figure is conservative. Many more Americans, from electricians to engineers, split their work between EVs and other parts of the energy system. Yet these jobs are increasingly at risk, with General Motors recently announcing cutbacks on EV and battery production, resulting in the elimination of 1,200 jobs at a Detroit plant. By eliminating EV tax credits, slowing federal charging investments, and putting billions in promised funds in limbo, Washington is fueling uncertainty. Companies are reacting by delaying investments, scaling back production, or closing doors altogether. GM’s cutbacks in Tennessee and the collapse of battery maker Natron Energy are just two recent warning signs of a market losing confidence in America’s leadership in this space.

Every federal rollback weakens America’s foothold in the global EV marketplace. Every day of uncertainty means thousands fewer US jobs, instability for families who depend on these paychecks, and the fraying promise of the American dream for workers just entering the labor market.

Meanwhile, China is moving full speed ahead and is now responsible for more than 70 percent of global EV production. Every federal rollback weakens America’s foothold in the global EV marketplace. Every day of uncertainty means thousands fewer US jobs, instability for families who depend on these paychecks, and the fraying promise of the American dream for workers just entering the labor market. When we fall behind in the global economy, it is workers who bear the costs.

While Washington remains intent on creating chaos, states can provide stability. Forward-thinking, commonsense state policies can backstop the volatility of the current policy environment to reassure investors, attract manufacturers, relieve workers, and create family-sustaining jobs with long-term futures. State leadership can strengthen our vehicle manufacturing base. This is how America once became the country the world wanted to invest in and build in—and how we can reclaim that mantle today.

Red and blue states alike see what’s at stake. EVs and the batteries that power them are not just clean energy products—they’re an economic pillar, a job creator, and a path to lower costs for families. The competition to attract manufacturers and suppliers is fierce, but states don’t have to cut corners to win. They can draw investment without sacrificing health and safety standards, turning a blind eye to labor law enforcement, or promising rock-bottom wages.

With immigration under attack and visas increasingly out of reach, states must plug the workforce gap by growing their own talent. Foreign investors value a highly trained workforce because skilled workers deliver higher productivity, continuous innovation, and safer worksites. Investing in people is the surest way to secure the EV economy’s future—and to prove that America can lead without racing to the bottom.

To do this, states should create a dedicated system to ensure American workers can gain the specialized technical skills brought by foreign workers. European countries are doing this by bringing together employers, labor unions, and educators to set common job and training standards. When technical knowledge is spread throughout the industry’s domestic workforce and retained through collective bargaining agreements, good wages, and advancement opportunities, companies can compete on the strength of their products, technologies, and business models—not on their access to a finite pool of foreign talent. A highly skilled battery manufacturing workforce provides industry stability and creates a foundation for the types of leapfrog innovations and process efficiencies that America needs.

Investing in people is the surest way to secure the EV economy’s future—and to prove that America can lead without racing to the bottom.

States don’t even have to start from scratch. Initiatives like the EV Infrastructure Training Program already keep electricians up-to-date with changing charging technologies. With input from industry partners, labor unions, and educational institutions, DOE’s Battery Workforce Initiative established national training guidelines certified by the Department of Labor and grounded in real factory work rather than guesswork. States can build upon this work by creating sectoral workforce councils made up of industry, labor, and training experts, providing them with dedicated funding and research capacity, and adopting their recommendations for credentials, apprenticeships, and workforce grants. This ensures training aligns with real jobs, raises worker skills across the industry, and gives workers a seat at the table.

Second, states should lean into tax credits and other incentives to drive market expansion and grow demand for American-made EVs. Colorado’s consumer EV tax credits, Maryland’s Medium-Duty and Heavy-Duty Zero-Emission Vehicle Grant Program, and Washington State’s EV Charging Infrastructure Grants are just a few examples of how states are supporting the transition to cleaner cars and trucks. Domestic content and labor standards tied to incentives help support US manufacturing as well as ongoing technology innovation. States that support and scale these types of programs will drive adoption of clean, electric cars and trucks, and help workers build fulfilling careers that benefit from global growth.

When the federal government pulls back, states can push ahead. Workers deserve better than the Trump administration’s theatrics. Communities deserve cleaner air and more affordable transportation. And the US deserves to lead—not lag—in the global race for EV adoption.

If Washington refuses to model the way forward, states must step up.",https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1236626057.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 21:58:31.140671

Both lenders and governments have less experience with renewable energy projects.","You might not know it from the headlines, but there is some good news about the global fight against climate change.

A decade ago, the cheapest way to meet growing demand for electricity was to build more coal or natural gas power plants. Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also less expensive today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health.

Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I study energy and climate solutions and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy — but it will require international cooperation.

Falling clean energy prices

As their technologies have matured, solar power and wind power have become cheaper than coal and natural gas for utility-scale electricity generation in most areas, in large part because the fuel is free. The total global power generation from renewable sources saved $467 billion in avoided fuel costs in 2024 alone.

As a result of falling prices, over 90% of all electricity-generating capacity added worldwide in 2024 came from clean energy sources, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency.

At the end of 2024, renewable energy accounted for 46% of global installed electric power capacity, with a record 585 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity added that year — about three times the total generating capacity in Texas.

Health benefits of leaving fossil fuels

Beyond affordability, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is healthier.

Burning coal, oil and natural gas releases tiny particles into the air along with toxic gases; these pollutants can make people sick. A recent study found air pollution from fossil fuels causes an estimated 5 million deaths worldwide a year, based on 2019 data.

For example, using natural gas to fuel stoves and other appliances releases benzene, a known carcinogen. The health risks of this exposure in some homes have been found to be comparable to secondhand tobacco smoke. Natural gas combustion has also been linked to childhood asthma, with an estimated 12.7% of U.S. childhood asthma cases attributable to gas stoves, according to one study.

Fossil fuels are also the leading sources of climate-warming greenhouse gases. When they’re burned to generate electricity or run factories, vehicles and appliances, they release carbon dioxide and other gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat near the Earth’s surface. That accumulation has been raising global temperatures and causing more heat stress, respiratory illnesses and the spread of disease.

Electrifying buildings, cars and appliances, and powering them with renewable energy, reduces these air pollutants while slowing climate change.

So what’s the problem?

In spite of the demonstrated economic and health benefits of transitioning to renewable energy, regulatory inertia, political gridlock and a lack of investment are holding back renewable energy deployment in much of the world.

In the United States, for example, major energy projects take an average of 4.5 years to permit, and approval of new transmission lines can take a decade or longer. A large majority of planned new power projects in the U.S. use solar power, and these delays are slowing the deployment of renewable energy.

The 2024 Energy Permitting Reform Act introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, to speed approvals failed to pass. Manchin called it “just another example of politics getting in the way of doing what’s best for the country.”

An even bigger challenge faces developing countries whose economies are growing fast.

These countries need to meet soaring energy demand. The International Energy Agency expects emerging economies to account for 85% of added electricity demand from 2025 through 2027. Yet renewable energy development lags in most of them. The main reason is the high price of financing renewable energy construction.

In many developing countries, wind and solar projects cost more to finance than coal or gas. Fossil projects have a longer history, and financial and policy mechanisms have been developed over decades to lower lender risk for those projects. These include government payment guarantees, stable fuel contracts and long-term revenue deals that help guarantee the lender will be repaid.

Both lenders and governments have less experience with renewable energy projects. As a result, these projects often come with weaker government guarantees. This raises the risk to lenders, so they charge higher interest rates, making renewable projects more expensive upfront, even if the projects have lower lifetime costs.

To lower borrowing costs, governments and international development banks can take steps to make renewable projects a safer bet for investors. For example, they can keep energy policies stable and use public funds or insurance to cover part of the lenders’ investment risk.

When investors trust they’ll get paid, interest rates drop dramatically and renewable energy becomes the cheaper option.

Without international cooperation to lower finance costs, developing economies could miss out on the renewable-energy revolution and lock in decades of growing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, making climate change worse.

The path ahead

To avoid the worst effects of climate change, countries have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades.

Achieving this goal won’t be easy, but it is significantly less difficult now that renewable energy is more affordable over the long run than fossil fuels.

Switching the world’s power supply to renewable energy and electrifying buildings and local transportation would cut about half of today’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The other half comes from sectors where it is harder to cut emissions — steel, cement and chemical production, aviation and shipping, and agriculture and land use. Solutions are being developed but need time to mature. Good governance, political support and accessible finance will be critical for these sectors as well.

The transition to renewable energy offers big economic and health benefits alongside lower climate risks — if countries can overcome political obstacles at home and cooperate to expand financing for developing economies.

Battery Energy Storage Systems hold energy when it’s produced in excess, such as when wind farms see especially windy days, or when solar panels absorb more sun energy than what’s in demand.
But it’s too early to tell whether that’s the case for projects being proposed in North Dakota, according to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock.
On the other end of the state, in Burke County, NextEra is proposing a second battery storage site with 100 megawatts in capacity.
The nearly $129 million site would occupy 21 acres and also attach to existing wind energy infrastructure, according to application documents.","For the first time, North Dakota utility regulators are considering proposals for massive battery storage sites that would serve as backstops for renewable energy sources.

Battery Energy Storage Systems hold energy when it’s produced in excess, such as when wind farms see especially windy days, or when solar panels absorb more sun energy than what’s in demand. Energy harvested by the batteries is later used when those resources are in deficit.

Such technology has been materializing across the country in recent years, receiving generous production tax credits from the federal government.

In theory, the sites could help reduce congestion on the power grid and potentially alleviate cost fluctuations that can otherwise cause price spikes for customers. But it’s too early to tell whether that’s the case for projects being proposed in North Dakota, according to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock.

The first-ever project under consideration is being proposed by NextEra, a company with several wind farms across the state including a location in Emmons County. That wind farm is where the company is looking to put its $181 million battery storage site, according to its application to the Public Service Commission.

Chair Randy Christmann said he’s apprehensive of normalizing battery storage systems in the state: “I just don’t know how the benefit compares to what it’s costing.”

He said he’s concerned about the grid becoming “reliant” on energy stored in the lithium-ion batteries, especially since the materials typically come from “adversarial” countries.

China produces the majority of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

NextEra told the North Dakota Monitor in an emailed statement that the specific battery system has not been finalized for the Emmons County project, but the company has “secured arrangements to source a U.S.-made battery for a significant portion” of its portfolio.

The massive battery units would have the capacity to store 140 megawatts, the amount of electricity used by approximately 13 average homes in one year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Overall, the project would use 24 acres already housing an adjacent wind farm, with construction beginning May 2026 and, if the project is approved, operations starting as early as December that year. It would bring around 150 construction jobs and one to three permanent jobs, the company estimates.

Over the 25-year span of the operation, the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes in addition to the nearly $4 million county application fee.

Emmons County Commissioners and NextEra representatives discussed the permitting costs and taxation at length during a public hearing in August before they approved the project later that month.

During the nearly four-hour meeting, members of the public raised concerns primarily centered on transparency from the company and the safety of the facility.

Some residents said the company had previously been disingenuous in gathering easements for its wind farm; others mentioned how, if the battery storage system were to malfunction and catch on fire, the response would likely be delayed due to the remoteness of the site’s location.

In response, NextEra representatives told the residents they are working with local first responders and volunteers.

In an emailed statement, the company did not share specific data related to safety of battery storage systems but said its systems are extensively monitored and have physical safeguards to minimize any damages should any issues arise.

Commissioner Christmann said he is eager to learn more about the project during its hearing, which is open to the public and scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the Emmons County Courthouse Auditorium in Linton.

On the other end of the state, in Burke County, NextEra is proposing a second battery storage site with 100 megawatts in capacity. The nearly $129 million site would occupy 21 acres and also attach to existing wind energy infrastructure, according to application documents.

Construction is expected to last six months and yield around 100 jobs, with two permanent positions for operations.

On Thursday, 37 of the Michigan House of Representatives’ 52 Democratic members brought a resolution urging U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to stop issuing extensions for the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.

Wright first issued an extension on the plant’s operations in May, eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, citing the Trump administration’s executive order declaring an energy emergency and arguing the plant’s capacity was needed to meet peak energy demand across the Midwest over the summer and preventing blackouts.

The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.

Michigan’s energy regulator, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the company’s shut down plan after weighing input from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more, determining Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S., also signed off on the shutdown, after determining that it would not violate their reliability criteria.

In their resolution, Michigan Democrats pointed to the grid operator’s projections that it had plenty of energy supply to meet expected consumer demand over the summer, while noting the government order conflicts with Consumers’ decision to cease using coal as an energy source.

They also cited the continued costs to ratepayers for operating the plant, in addition to the toll the plant is taking on the environment as well as the health of residents living near the plant.

“The plant releases millions of pounds of air pollutants annually, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter. Nearly 9 million tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide are also released annually,” the resolution reads. “The air pollution generated by coal plants has been linked to several negative health impacts such as asthma, cancer, heart conditions, and lung conditions.”

The resolution is unlikely to move forward, as the Republican-led House is not scheduled to meet to vote on policy this week, and the resolution was referred to the Government Operations Committee – generally considered a graveyard for policy.

However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.

The Trump Administration is testing American institutions to the bone, Wooden said, arguing that in order to place the country on the right trajectory, Trump’s opponents need to leverage any and all available methods to push back, whether it’s supporting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s legal action against the administration’s orders or highlighting the impacts of Trump’s policies.

“Allowing [the plant] to shut down is in line with our own private industry, with our own utilities, and with the environmental community,” Wooden said. “And you know, even if this doesn’t pass, I think it’s important we can remain clear that this is a damaging decision and it is time for the Trump administration to listen to Michiganders who … don’t want to see more utility price hikes and don’t want dirty coal polluting our airways.”

Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, told the Michigan Advance that the Trump Administration’s decision to extend the Campbell plant’s operations cuts utilities and regulators’ planning process at the knees, while creating questions for what this means for the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

He also pointed to testimony presented by a host of separate environmental organizations in opposition to the second extension, which found that during the tightest energy margin of the summer, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator had an energy surplus equal to more than 10 times the amount of energy produced at the Campbell plant.

While Consumers Energy has reported $80 million in costs in keeping the plant open between May 23 and Sept. 30, Johnson noted that this number does not account for the $84 million in costs recovered by selling power to the grid operator.

“If we had to eat all those costs, that’s a lot. But instead, we’re raising the rates in these other states, you know. Rate payers in other states are helping us pay for this,” Johnson said.

Breaking down the cost of continuing to operate the plant during that period comes out to $615,384 per day, Johnson said.

“No one was asking for this, you know, no one wanted this,” Johnson said.

Affordability is the issue of the day, particularly with electric bills, Johnson said. The first step in addressing that issue?

“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.

However, if the extensions continue, Johnson argued Consumers Energy has a duty to their ratepayers to step in and say “this is not right.”

Brian Wheeler, a media relations specialist for Consumers Energy, said the company is ready to continue operating the plant if they receive another order.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxl_20250812_155552401-11763417781.jpg?h=9b96e8ba&itok=IRzPCS8f,N,,2025-11-17 18:01:18.218781

More funding for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act is needed to ensure utilities can make these essential improvements without sharply increasing water rates.","Cortlandt Manor, NY – New York State Senator Peter Harckham, Assemblymembers Steve Otis and Dana Levenberg, environmental advocates and labor leaders urged Governor Hochul today to “hold the line” and protect funding for state water infrastructure projects at last year’s budget levels.

Stressing the enormous need to upgrade water infrastructure in municipalities statewide, attendees at the press conference, including members of the New York Clean Water Coalition and the Construction Industry Council, called for a $500 million investment in the Clean Water Infrastructure Act in the upcoming Executive Budget proposal for FY2026-2027.

“Aging water mains, lead pipes, outdated sewage treatment plants and contaminants put public health and clean drinking water supplies at risk,” Harckham. “New York’s clean water infrastructure funding helps keep our communities safe and habitable, all while ensuring the costs do not get passed on to ratepayers. Governor Hochul has been a good partner on clean water infrastructure funding, and we urge her to maintain the current funding level at $500 million in next year’s budget.”

Harckham added, “Fixing our pipes and treatment plants also creates thousands of good-paying jobs for union plumbers, laborers, operating engineers, and more each year. This has positive impacts on our local economies and encourages businesses to set up shop in places where they can rely on the infrastructure to provide clean water.”

Town of Cortlandt Supervisor Dr. Richard Becker hosted the press conference at the Valeria Wastewater Treatment Plant, where it was announced that Cortlandt is receiving $603,533 in low-cost financing from the state for construction and improvements at the treatment plant, which serves the Dickerson Pond Sewer District.

“We have three water projects going on simultaneously, none of which the Town of Cortlandt could afford, none of which the residents could afford,” said Dr. Becker. “But they’re all going to be solved with the help of our partners in New York State government, and we need to ensure that this kind of support remains in place for municipalities.”

Since 2015, New York has invested over $6 billion in funding the state’s array of clean water programs to fund drinking water and wastewater infrastructure improvements. New York’s programs have been recognized as among the top state clean water programs in the country, with much of the funding delivered through the Environmental Facilities Corporation Inter-municipal Grants (IMG), NYS Green Innovation Grant Program (GIGP) and the NYS Water Infrastructure Improvement Act (WIIA) grant program.

Assemblymember Steve Otis, a longtime advocate for clean water funding, said, “New York’s clean water programs are the most robust in the nation. Our WIIA and IMG programs alone have provided over $3 billion in grant funding to over 1100 projects statewide since 2015. Given the increasing burdens placed on local governments to fund water infrastructure projects for water quality and system capacity, we must maintain our $500 million funding level to clean water programs next year. Storm intensity and flood mitigation challenges continue to increase. Maintaining the clean water budget allocation, the Environmental Protection Fund, and the Bond Act programs are vital to address the increasing needs.”

Assemblymember Dana Levenberg said, “Water is essential. It is imperative that we continue helping municipalities maintain and upgrade clean water infrastructure without increasing the strain on local property taxpayers. Furthermore, we cannot expect to see growth in housing development if we cannot provide this support, and we need to increase housing starts if we are to bring down housing costs. No matter how challenging the upcoming budget year may be, clean water is not the place to make cuts. The Governor must include at least $500 million in her executive budget to fund allocations from the Clean Water Infrastructure Act.”

State Senator Shelley B. Mayer said, “I stand with Senator Harckham, my colleagues, and environmental advocates to fight for New York to maintain the $500 million investment for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act in the 2026-2027 State Budget. As we face increasingly severe and unpredictable weather conditions, we must make the necessary investments to ensure all New Yorkers have safe and reliable drinking water, and it is critical to ensure New York has at least the same amount of funding as last year to keep moving forward.”

New York’s longstanding commitment to clean water programs has protected public health, created thousands of union jobs, reduced the burden on local property taxpayers, and kept water bills affordable. Over $150 million has been dedicated to over 55 projects across Westchester County alone from the WIIA and IMG programs.

In the FY2025-26 adopted state budget, the Governor and the Legislature maintained the statewide annual commitment at $500 million. The demands of local governments have increased to protect drinking water and to meet increasing standards for sanitary sewer system treatment. New challenges exist on issues including emerging contaminants and possible loss of federal dollars.

In addition, local governments need more resources to comply with new federal regulations to make drinking water cleaner. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently enacted landmark requirements for water utilities to remove toxic PFAS chemicals from drinking water and replace 100% of lead pipes nationwide. More funding for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act is needed to ensure utilities can make these essential improvements without sharply increasing water rates. The EPA estimates that over $80 billion is needed to repair New York’s aging and outdated water infrastructure.

Adrienne Esposito, Executive Director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said, “Clean water is a critical need in both good economic times and challenging economic times. It is a necessity not a luxury item. We’re calling on Governor Hochul to maintain the $500 million for clean water that will protect public health, our economy, and keep water affordable for all New Yorkers. Continued funding for clean water needs has already benefited New York but we have much more to do. We thank Senator Harkham for his leadership in continuing to address this urgent need.”

Jeremy Cherson, Associate Director of Government Affairs at Riverkeeper, said, “Maintaining $500 million in funding for clean water in the upcoming state budget is essential for keeping New Yorkers safe and our natural resources like the Hudson River and Furnace Brook healthy. This fall’s unprecedented harmful algal bloom on the Hudson demonstrates the continued need for these funds to help local governments clean up sewer overflows which help contribute to the conditions that make these blooms possible. Funding more infrastructure which helps keep human waste out of our waterways is non-negotiable. Riverkeeper thanks Senator Harckham for his steadfast commitment to clean water funding, and we look forward to standing with him and our allies to ensure these funds are top priority for Governor Hochul.”

Judith Hansen, Legislative Consultant for the New York Section American Water Works Association (NYSAWWA), said, “New Yorkers have the right to safe, clean water and a healthy environment at an affordable price. The water professionals throughout New York State are working each and every day toward that goal, but they need the state’s help to make it possible. At NYSAWWA, we not only thank the Senator and his colleagues for their efforts but also pledge to join them in this fight.”

John Cooney Jr., Executive Director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley, Inc., said, “The Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley, Inc., along with our partners in organized labor, thank State Senator Pete Harckham, Assemblymembers Dana Levenberg and Steve Otis, as well as Town of Cortlandt Supervisor Dr. Richard Becker for their efforts in bringing a project like this one at the Valerie Treatment Plant to fruition. The need for modernization of municipal sewer and water facilities exceeds the ability of municipalities to fund projects. It is crucial that Governor Hochul maintains in her Executive Budget the $500 million investment in the Clean Water Infrastructure Act.”

David Ansel, vice president of the Center for Water Protection at Save the Sound: “Clean, healthy water is a fundamental human right, and the Clean Water Infrastructure Act plays a critical part in protecting clean water in New York. This essential funding enables communities in the Long Island Sound region and across the state to upgrade insufficient clean water infrastructure, reduce wastewater and stormwater pollution, and protect public and environmental health. We thank Senator Harckham, Assemblymember Otis, and Assemblymember Levenberg for championing clean water in New York State and for urging the Governor to continue to invest in New York communities by committing at least $500 million to the Clean Water Infrastructure Act in the next State Budget.”",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/11/17/water-infrastructure-11-17.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:58:57.087667

But a bill currently under consideration in the House of Representatives on Beacon Hill threatens to undo that progress and would be a damaging mistake for our state.

This bill, proposed by Rep. Mark Cusack, the co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, is essentially a fossil fuel industry wish list. It rolls back the Commonwealth’s enforceable 2030 climate targets, weakens the Mass Save energy efficiency program, eliminates efforts designed to make energy efficiency more affordable for working families, and even resurrects the disastrous “pipeline tax” that would allow utilities to charge residents for unnecessary gas infrastructure. In short, it hands fossil fuel companies a gift while leaving Massachusetts households to foot the bill.

At a moment when President Trump is dismantling federal climate policy, this bill would do the work for him. It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis. It would cede our hard-earned reputation as a clean energy innovator and put our economy, our health, and our climate at risk.

Our lawmakers must be clear on what’s really driving high energy costs: it’s not clean energy. It’s fossil fuels, gas infrastructure, and aging transmission systems.

In 2023 alone, Massachusetts consumers spent $20 billion on energy in their homes and businesses. Programs like Mass Save delivered over $34 billion in savings between 2012 and 2023 and generated more than $3 for every $1 invested. The program is the only tool we have that actively reduces energy burden for all of us, including low- and moderate-income households that are hardest hit by rising energy costs.

Mass Save has weatherized 350,000 homes (including 70,000 low-income homes), created nearly 76,000 jobs, and saved the equivalent output of five power plants. Even if you’ve never used it directly, you’ve benefited from lower wholesale energy prices because your neighbors did. These are real savings in people’s wallets.

By rolling back these programs and weakening enforceable climate targets, House members would lock the state into an outdated, expensive fossil fuel system. Weakening the 2030 climate target removes enforceable benchmarks that ensure our government takes the action we demand.

Without those benchmarks, Massachusetts risks falling behind while other states, and the world, invest in the clean energy technologies of the future. Communities that are already most vulnerable to pollution and climate impacts—low-income and environmental justice communities—will feel the consequences first.

The House also risks undermining the thriving clean energy economy Massachusetts has built.

Our clean energy sector supports more than 115,000 workers, there are over 7,500 energy businesses statewide, and the clean energy industry has added more than $15.9 billion to the state’s economy since 2012. Clean energy is not just good for our planet; it’s good for our wallets. Weakening climate laws now would send a chilling signal to investors, slow innovation, and damage our long-term economic growth, not to mention dirty the clean air and water we deserve.

This bill tells the rest of the nation that when federal leadership falters, Massachusetts folds. It tells clean energy workers that their jobs don’t matter. It tells communities on the front lines of climate and pollution that their health is negotiable.

But that’s not who we are. Massachusetts became a clean energy and climate leader by setting ambitious goals. We still have five years to hit our 2030 targets. Our legislators must reject this fossil fuel gift and recommit to a future built on affordability, innovation, and climate responsibility. A vote for this bill is a vote to cede our leadership to the Trump administration and the fossil fuel lobby. A vote against it is a vote for Massachusetts – to protect our progress, our economy, and our environment.

The choice is simple: Massachusetts can lead, or we can go back. The people of Massachusetts deserve leadership.

The Arizona-based company plans to invest approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to begin commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is expected to create more than 600 new jobs with an average annual manufacturing salary of $74,000, which is approximately twice Cherokee County’s per capita income.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025, played a role in First Solar’s decision to expand in South Carolina. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” explained Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. First Solar, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the U.S. by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster. “First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

Having manufactured in the U.S. since 2002, First Solar is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the U.S. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

DartPoints’ $125M Investment Will Boost Data Center Capacity

DartPoints, a regional provider of colocation, cloud, and interconnection solutions, plans to invest $125 million to expand its Greenville County, SC data center. The project will create 10 jobs.

“This project builds on DartPoints’ collaboration with state and local partners to expand access to critical IT power in high-growth regions,” commented DartPoints President and CEO Scott Willis. “Greenville has been a part of our platform for nearly two decades. This investment reflects our confidence in the region’s talent and business environment. We’re building capacity for the kinds of workloads, including AI, research and data analytics, that are shaping how organizations operate today.”

The data center’s total capacity will increase from 2.5 megawatts to 12.5 megawatts, adding 88,000 square feet of high-density space engineered for artificial intelligence (AI), enterprise, and edge applications. This expansion will provide critical infrastructure for regional enterprises and universities that depend on high-performance computing, research, and analytics to power AI-driven innovation. By locating capacity closer to where data is created and consumed, DartPoints will be able to help organizations operate with greater speed, efficiency, and resilience.

DartPoints’ facilities are developed with a mix of air and liquid cooling options to meet performance needs while managing energy use responsibly. The company’s approach focuses on supporting communities that want to attract technology growth while maintaining reliable, energy-efficient operations.

Construction is underway, and operations are expected to begin in July 2027.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators.
In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.
The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August.
That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where","Louisiana and the federal government are pushing for more than $1 billion in fines and penalties against Smitty’s Supply Inc. for years of environmental violations and more recent damages from an explosion and petrochemical spill at its Tangipahoa Parish plant.

That dollar figure is eye-catching but also leads one to question: Why did it take an environmental disaster for officials to finally act against a business with an established track record of wiping its feet on regulations meant to curb pollution?

The answer: It’s in line with regulators’ kid-glove approach to environmental enforcement in Louisiana, where state and federal agencies go out of their way to provide a welcome mat for industry while placing the welfare of its residents on the backburner.

Examples of this practice are actually detailed in a lawsuit the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have filed against Smitty’s Supply. It accuses the company of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

Their complaint cites hundreds of infractions going back nearly five years, culminating with the Aug. 22 disaster at its Roseland facility. Millions of gallons of oil, lubricants and automotive fluids made their way into the nearby Tangipahoa River and flowed several miles downstream. A fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish created an oily soot that covered nearby homes, farms and businesses.

Before that, the company was cited for illegal wastewater discharges, failing to report pollution and seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that went beyond the facility’s property and contaminated public areas.

Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators. What’s gone unreported?

According to the lawsuit, the company failed to conduct “daily visual observations” of five outfall canals to check for possible pollutants on weekends and holidays from May 2022 through at least April 2025. A bit of quick math indicates that equals about 350 days without required surveillance. And because these inspections weren’t performed, they couldn’t be logged, which led to additional violations.

Then there are the infractions found when LDEQ inspectors made site visits. In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.

After the August explosion, regulators determined the company failed to develop a required Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan and didn’t adequately maintain a Facility Response Plan that lays out how it handles such incidents.

All this is to say there is an extensive history of the company failing to take significant steps to address its pattern of violations and minimal evidence of regulators taking meaningful enforcement action to bring about improvements.

The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August. The company paid $250,000 to settle a state complaint over an oil spill in 2021, and the EPA collected $194,772 in 2019 for infractions, WWL-TV reported.

It’s hard to determine what kind of dent these penalties have made in the private company’s bottom line; it doesn’t have to make its revenue and net income public. But on its website, Smitty’s describes itself as “one of the leading manufacturers in the world of lubricants and related products.” It leads you to believe that Smitty’s Supply has had the wherewithal to prevent its many regulatory fumbles over the years, acknowledged and otherwise.

Like Charles Dickens wrote (and Elvis Costello later sang), accidents will happen. But they’re more probable — and maybe less likely to be considered accidents — in a state where officials aren’t willing to take meaningful punitive action to prevent them.

That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Smittys-explosion-TPSO.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:01:41.853997

The goal is electrical architecture and software destined for a future generation of EV models from both companies.
The deal also connects Rivian with VW Group’s large network of suppliers for various parts.
“The joint venture is rapidly developing the architecture for our future software-defined vehicles,” VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said Wednesday in a statement.
Rivian’s Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid said the platform under development for both automakers could work for more companies, according to InsideEVs.","Can new automotive technology from an automotive giant with a troubled electric vehicle system and a startup struggling to fund its second act appeal to other companies? Rivian and Volkswagen want to find out.

Rivian and Volkswagen Group Technologies officially launched on November 13, the result of a $5.8 billion joint venture between the two companies that was first announced as a software deal in June. The goal is electrical architecture and software destined for a future generation of EV models from both companies. It paves the way for both small, less-expensive VWs and cheaper Rivian models. It also benefits VW’s off-road offshoot Scout Motors, which is expected to start selling a Rivian-like SUV and pickup truck with an EV-only version, and a gas-assisted range-extended EV by 2028.

The deal also connects Rivian with VW Group’s large network of suppliers for various parts. Rivian is aiming to lower the production costs of the existing R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck, build a plant in Georgia to complement its existing Illinois facility, and introduce the midsize R2 SUV next year as part of its plan to move into more mainstream vehicle segments and expand into Europe.

“The joint venture is rapidly developing the architecture for our future software-defined vehicles,” VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said Wednesday in a statement. “Every step toward achieving our ambitious goals is being executed with determination and clear focus. In close collaboration with our brands, a technological foundation has been created in just twelve months that will enable a new digital driving experience for our customers at accessible prices.”

To make the investment stretch further, however, the joint venture’s technology could be made available to other automakers. Rivian’s Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid said the platform under development for both automakers could work for more companies, according to InsideEVs.

While the electrical architecture will be powerful enough for the next-generation of EVs that are expected to make greater use of 800-volt systems that will charge more quickly, it will also be able to support more advanced driver assistant systems like Rivian’s Enhanced Driver Assist and future hands-free driving systems like General Motors’ SuperCruise. Licensing out the technology to other automakers planning more powerful gas-electric hybrids and faster-charging battery electric vehicles—both of which could make more extensive use of cameras, Lidar and other technologies—could be another revenue stream for Rivian and VW, according to the venture’s executives.

Rivian and CEO RJ Scaringe haven’t exactly been secretive about the company’s tenuous finances even before the cancellation of the federal EV tax credit became official at the end of September. It laid off 600 employees in October, the third round in 2025, and while deliveries in the third quarter of the year were up by more than 30%, the annual forecast was lowered to as little as 41,000 vehicles in 2025.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Scaringe wrote in a company email obtained by Reuters last month.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/rivian_volkswagen-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:02:06.534807

About ARENA ARENA has a unique role in the transition to a net zero economy.","The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced $7.86 million in funding to Li-S Energy Ltd (Li-S Energy) to support the next phase of Australia’s advanced battery manufacturing capability.

The funding will enable Li-S Energy to undertake manufacturing optimisation, a feasibility study and front-end engineering design (FEED) for a proposed lithium-sulfur battery cell manufacturing facility. The proposed facility aims to produce up to 1 GWh per year of battery cell capacity – 500 times the capacity of Li-S Energy’s current Geelong-based facility.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project reflects Australia’s commitment to building local manufacturing capability and accelerating innovation in energy storage.

“By supporting Li-S Energy’s plans to scale up lithium-sulfur battery production, we are helping to fast-track the commercialisation of breakthrough battery technologies.”

“Batteries are essential to the clean energy transition, both for energy storage and transport. That’s why it’s critical we keep advancing innovations that improve performance, increase energy density and drive down costs,” Mr Miller said.

Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to deliver up to twice the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries, enabling longer range and lighter weight for electric vehicles, drones, wearables and other applications. This aligns with the Australian Government’s energy storage strategy, which prioritises technologies that support renewable integration and reduce reliance on imported battery systems.

Li-S Energy CEO and MD Dr Lee Finniear said the funding is a major step towards commercial readiness.

“This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production. It will help meet growing demand for lightweight batteries in drones, defence, aerospace and other relevant high-value commercial markets,” Dr Finniear said.

As more renewable energy generation enters the grid, the need for energy storage is increasing. This funding reflects ARENA’s strategic priority to reduce the cost and increase the diversity of technologies available to support the deployment of energy storage in Australia.

This funding has been administered under ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, which is continuously open for applications that address our investment focus areas and involve a renewable energy technology or technologies that increase the supply of, or improve the competitiveness of, renewable energy in Australia.

About ARENA

Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.
The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.
However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.
“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.","As a West Michigan coal plant continues to produce power nearly 180 days after it was slated to cease operations, several Michigan Democrats are speaking out against President Donald Trump’s administration’s decision to keep the plant online, advising against another extension to its lifespan.

On Thursday, 37 of the Michigan House of Representatives’ 52 Democratic members brought a resolution urging U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to stop issuing extensions for the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.

Wright first issued an extension on the plant’s operations in May, eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, citing the Trump administration’s executive order declaring an energy emergency and arguing the plant’s capacity was needed to meet peak energy demand across the Midwest over the summer and preventing blackouts.

The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.

Michigan’s energy regulator, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the company’s shut down plan after weighing input from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more, determining Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S., also signed off on the shutdown, after determining that it would not violate their reliability criteria.

In their resolution, Michigan Democrats pointed to the grid operator’s projections that it had plenty of energy supply to meet expected consumer demand over the summer, while noting the government order conflicts with Consumers’ decision to cease using coal as an energy source.

They also cited the continued costs to ratepayers for operating the plant, in addition to the toll the plant is taking on the environment as well as the health of residents living near the plant.

“The plant releases millions of pounds of air pollutants annually, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter. Nearly 9 million tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide are also released annually,” the resolution reads. “The air pollution generated by coal plants has been linked to several negative health impacts such as asthma, cancer, heart conditions, and lung conditions.”

The resolution is unlikely to move forward, as the Republican-led House is not scheduled to meet to vote on policy this week, and the resolution was referred to the Government Operations Committee – generally considered a graveyard for policy.

However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.

The Trump Administration is testing American institutions to the bone, Wooden said, arguing that in order to place the country on the right trajectory, Trump’s opponents need to leverage any and all available methods to push back, whether it’s supporting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s legal action against the administration’s orders or highlighting the impacts of Trump’s policies.

“Allowing [the plant] to shut down is in line with our own private industry, with our own utilities, and with the environmental community,” Wooden said. “And you know, even if this doesn’t pass, I think it’s important we can remain clear that this is a damaging decision and it is time for the Trump administration to listen to Michiganders who … don’t want to see more utility price hikes and don’t want dirty coal polluting our airways.”

Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, told the Michigan Advance that the Trump Administration’s decision to extend the Campbell plant’s operations cuts utilities and regulators’ planning process at the knees, while creating questions for what this means for the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

He also pointed to testimony presented by a host of separate environmental organizations in opposition to the second extension, which found that during the tightest energy margin of the summer, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator had an energy surplus equal to more than 10 times the amount of energy produced at the Campbell plant.

While Consumers Energy has reported $80 million in costs in keeping the plant open between May 23 and Sept. 30, Johnson noted that this number does not account for the $84 million in costs recovered by selling power to the grid operator.

“If we had to eat all those costs, that’s a lot. But instead, we’re raising the rates in these other states, you know. Rate payers in other states are helping us pay for this,” Johnson said.

Breaking down the cost of continuing to operate the plant during that period comes out to $615,384 per day, Johnson said.

“No one was asking for this, you know, no one wanted this,” Johnson said.

Affordability is the issue of the day, particularly with electric bills, Johnson said. The first step in addressing that issue?

“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.

However, if the extensions continue, Johnson argued Consumers Energy has a duty to their ratepayers to step in and say “this is not right.”

Brian Wheeler, a media relations specialist for Consumers Energy, said the company is ready to continue operating the plant if they receive another order.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250812_155552401-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:00:45.328429

Our revenue performance reflects accelerating customer adoption and sets a solid foundation to meet our year-end goals as we continue driving the hydrogen economy forward.”

9 Month Performance

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Plug Power reported a net loss of $789 million compared to $769 million in the same period last year.

Financing activities contributed $313 million in cash inflows, compared to $779 million in the prior year period. Plug’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $849 million at the end of the nine-month period, compared to $1 billion as of September 2024.

Jose Luis Crespo, who also serves as President and Chief Revenue Officer, emphasized that the company is on track for a record year in electrolyzer sales, with $124 million in revenue recorded year-to-date—up 33% year-over-year—and an expected total of around $200 million by year-end.

“We continue to see big opportunities for green hydrogen, particularly in replacing gray hydrogen in refineries like Galp and BP and in producing e-fuels such as e-methanol, synthetic jet fuel, and ammonia,” Crespo said.

He added that with policy clarity improving in Europe and sustained government support in Australia, the company expects increased adoption of green hydrogen across industrial sectors.

He highlighted that Plug’s $8 billion electrolyzer project pipeline remains highly active, with strong prospects for final investment decisions across key markets, particularly Europe and Australia.

Business Highlights

For Q3, the company’s GenEco electrolyzer business generated approximately $65 million in revenue, representing a 46% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2025 and a 13% YoY growth.

Plug reported that the growth was driven by higher hydrogen fuel sales, stronger demand across its electrolyzer portfolio, and pricing enhancements. During the quarter, Plug advanced several large-scale electrolyzer projects, expanding its global footprint. The company reported that over 230 MW of GenEco electrolyzer projects are now being mobilized across Europe, Australia, and North America.

Plug also delivered the first 10 MW GenEco PEM electrolyzer to Galp Energia’s Sines project in Portugal, part of a planned 100 MW installation. The company said it is also advancing multiple multi-megawatt projects across its global markets, representing over 8 GW of opportunity.

In hydrogen fuel production, Plug’s Georgia Green Hydrogen Plant achieved a record output in August, producing 324 tons of liquid hydrogen, with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability.

Plug extended a multi-year hydrogen supply contract with a key domestic partner, securing supply reliability through 2030 and supporting improvements in cost and cash flow.

The company’s hydrogen production network includes 15 TPD live capacity each in Georgia and Louisiana, 10 TPD in Tennessee, and an additional 45 TPD expected from Texas. It had a record production at its Georgia green hydrogen plant in August, achieving 324 tons with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability.

That case is still being litigated, but the attorneys general allege the California law seeks to step in and do the same thing the states objected to at the federal level.
The brief alleges the California laws are illegal because they compel speech from these companies on a topic they may want to avoid speaking on.
Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.” “California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release.
The parties involved requested, Nov. 10, an emergency injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the California laws, which are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.","Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and attorneys general from 24 additional states are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay on California emissions reporting laws.

The states allege, in the amici curiae filed, the California laws would impose an “illegal greenhouse gas disclosure policy” and would cause “nightmarish compliance costs and liability on companies across the country.”

In 2023, California enacted laws that require businesses of a certain size to submit greenhouse gas emissions reports and reports on the measures the business planned to adopt to reduce their climate-related financial risk.

The brief from the states said California is “trying to be the national regulator of American greenhouse gas emissions—but for many reasons it may not do so.”

The State of Iowa and several other states that also signed onto Bird’s brief, have already sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a similar law that sought to impose emissions reporting standards. That case is still being litigated, but the attorneys general allege the California law seeks to step in and do the same thing the states objected to at the federal level.

The brief said the California law, which would impact businesses outside of the state with revenues above a certain level, requires businesses to express a “certain viewpoint on the highly controversial issue area of climate change.”

It said even if a business believes the climate-related “doomsday scenarios” are unlikely, it has to submit reports about how it plans to respond to the effects of a changing climate.

The brief alleges the California laws are illegal because they compel speech from these companies on a topic they may want to avoid speaking on.

It also alleges the laws would impose “irreparable economic harm on other states.” The brief estimates out-of-state businesses would incur “millions” in auditing and reporting costs for emissions that are outside of California’s borders.

Businesses with more than $1 billion in annual revenue that do business in California are required by the law to disclose “comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions” along their supply chains. Business with $500 million in annual revenue that do business in the state will have to supply biennial climate-related financial risk reports that are publicly available.

California’s enacted Senate Bill 261 says climate change is affecting California communities and economy with wildfires, sea level rise, extreme droughts and extreme weather events.

“Failure of economic actors to adequately plan for and adapt to climate-related risks to their businesses and to the economy will result in significant harm to California,” the law reads.

According to the California statute, mandatory disclosures set by law will help to “ensure a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future” for the state.

Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.”

“California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release. “Their attempt to continually tell other states and businesses how to do business outside California is radical overreach and needs to be stopped.”

Pam Mackey-Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s director, said in a statement that Iowa families are “suffering the real consequences of corporations burning fossil fuels for profit” and cited derechos, droughts and rising insurance costs as an example.

“Climate change is real, and consumers should be able to make informed decisions about whether they prefer supporting companies that are reducing greenhouse gas emissions versus those that are not,” Mackey-Taylor said. “Here in Iowa, we expect our attorney general to serve as the lawyer of the people and take up the everyday issues that affect Iowans, not fight the policies that help protect us.”

The attorneys’ brief is in support of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America’s suit against the chair of the California Air Resources Board. The parties involved requested, Nov. 10, an emergency injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the California laws, which are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.

It also alleges the laws would impose “irreparable economic harm on other states.” The brief estimates out-of-state businesses would incur “millions” in auditing and reporting costs for emissions that are outside of California’s borders.

Businesses with more than $1 billion in annual revenue that do business in California are required by the law to disclose “comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions” along their supply chains. Business with $500 million in annual revenue that do business in the state will have to supply biennial climate-related financial risk reports that are publicly available.

California’s enacted Senate Bill 261 says climate change is affecting California communities and economy with wildfires, sea level rise, extreme droughts and extreme weather events.

“Failure of economic actors to adequately plan for and adapt to climate-related risks to their businesses and to the economy will result in significant harm to California,” the law reads.

According to the California statute, mandatory disclosures set by law will help to “ensure a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future” for the state.

Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.”

“California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release. “Their attempt to continually tell other states and businesses how to do business outside California is radical overreach and needs to be stopped.”

Pam Mackey-Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s director, said in a statement that Iowa families are “suffering the real consequences of corporations burning fossil fuels for profit” and cited derechos, droughts and rising insurance costs as an example.

“Climate change is real, and consumers should be able to make informed decisions about whether they prefer supporting companies that are reducing greenhouse gas emissions versus those that are not,” Mackey-Taylor said. “Here in Iowa, we expect our attorney general to serve as the lawyer of the people and take up the everyday issues that affect Iowans, not fight the policies that help protect us.”

The attorneys’ brief is in support of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America’s suit against the chair of the California Air Resources Board. The parties involved requested, Nov. 10, an emergency injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the California laws, which are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.

A new proposed federal rule that oversees the rivers, streams and other bodies of water in the United States has been released. The rule is called the Waters of the United States.

In May 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court curtailed the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) enforcement of the Clean Water Act in the Sackett v. EPA case prompting the agency to come up with a new set of rules. The court ruled that federal jurisdiction over wetlands is limited to those with a “continuous surface connection” to a relatively permanent body of water.

This decision replaced the “significant nexus” test and limited the EPA’s authority, affecting how wetlands are regulated and leading the agency to revise its definition of “waters of the United States.” The case originated from a property dispute in Idaho where the Sacketts challenged an EPA order to stop filling in wetlands on their land.

“I’m hopeful that whatever happens with the body politic over the next 10 years that this could be a durable rule, because it’s common sense, and I know West Virginia will be weighing in to be supportive of this rule,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a news briefing at the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C.

Morrisey noted West Virginia led an Amicus (friend of the court) brief in the Sackett case when he was the state Attorney General. The new, proposed rule includes specific definitions of what is, and what isn’t, a protected body of water.

The EPA has begun a 45-day public comment period on the rule.

U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, applauded the EPA’s announcement of the proposed rule.

“I applaud the Trump EPA’s proposed rule to make the regulatory definition of waters of the United States consistent with the text of the Clean Water Act,” she said. “This proposal takes an important step toward providing a clear and legally-sound framework that aligns with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and right-sizes federal jurisdiction. I appreciate the Trump EPA’s effort to take public input in developing this proposal, including by holding a listening session in Charleston to allow West Virginians the opportunity to share their perspectives.”",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Elk-River-Fall-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:59:00.998533

The new heat pump is scheduled for installation by 2028.
Everllence will supply the heat pump, while DCO Energy will manage installation and plant upgrades.
The project delivers multiple benefits, including giving customers access to carbon-free thermal energy and the Charles River ecosystem seeing reduced thermal impact.
“Vicinity’s heat pump installation is a smart investment—it reduces emissions without compromising performance, and it’s built to operate efficiently over the long term.","In Greater Boston, demolition is underway to make room for the installation of a 35MW river-based industrial heat pump at Vicinity Energy’s Kendall Square facility. Vicinity has also formed a new agreement with DCO Energy to install the heat pump. This is a major step in Vicinity’s electrification strategy for Boston and Cambridge, which will enable carbon-free steam generation for more than 70 million square feet of building space. The new heat pump is scheduled for installation by 2028.

A significant portion of the heat pump’s capacity is already secured through long-term contracts with medical and educational institutions, reflecting strong market demand for decarbonized energy solutions. Everllence will supply the heat pump, while DCO Energy will manage installation and plant upgrades.

As the baseload generator for Vicinity’s electrification plans, the project will be the first to use the Charles River as a renewable resource for carbon-free steam. Vicinity also plans to add thermal storage technologies for on-demand eSteam™ production from renewable electricity. The project delivers multiple benefits, including giving customers access to carbon-free thermal energy and the Charles River ecosystem seeing reduced thermal impact.

“Execution of this project makes Vicinity’s vision of decarbonizing cities at scale a reality,” said Kevin Hagerty, CEO at Vicinity Energy. “Powered by renewable electricity to safely and efficiently harvest energy from the Charles River, this represents rapid advancement in electrification for U.S. district energy systems, demonstrating how proven heat pump technology can be deployed at scale to decarbonize cities. It enables immediate, scalable carbon reductions without the need for costly and time-intensive new electrical infrastructure in Greater Boston. We are establishing the blueprint of how to decarbonize a U.S. city and will be installing similar innovative electrification technologies at our district energy systems across 12 U.S. cities.”

The proposal to build a river-source heat pump complex at Vicinity’s Kendall facility relies on the Charles River’s thermal energy, an untapped renewable energy resource.

Previously, Vicinity installed a new 42MW electric boiler at its Kendall facility, which provides carbon-free thermal energy to its Boston partners through the established 29-miles of steam piping that runs underneath the city — the Boston and Cambridge district energy system. eSteam™ customers currently include IQHQ and Emerson College. By adopting eSteam™, these institutions are not only advancing their sustainability goals but also positioning themselves to comply with local requirements such as BERDO and BEUDO, while aligning with Massachusetts’ Stretch Energy Code.

“Our priority is delivering reliable, practical solutions that make economic sense,” said Gary Fromer, CEO at DCO Energy. “Vicinity’s heat pump installation is a smart investment—it reduces emissions without compromising performance, and it’s built to operate efficiently over the long term. It’s a real-world step toward sustainability that works for today and the future. This collaboration builds upon the recent success of our joint projects in Philadelphia, further strengthening our track record of delivering innovative, sustainable energy solutions together.”

Building on the blueprint established in Boston and Cambridge, Vicinity is applying lessons learned to guide decarbonization plans in other cities. Progress is already underway in Grand Rapids, where installation of a 9MW electric boiler has begun, marking the city’s first step toward electrification.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/adobestock_82066413.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:18.334356

The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was updated in 2016 to reduce exposures to harmful chemicals linked to chronic diseases like cancer. The law is working, and that’s why the chemical lobby wants to change it now and make it weaker.

The law puts health before corporate profits and has resulted in bans on chemicals like the deadly solvents trichloroethylene (TCE) and methylene chloride. This means less profit from dangerous chemicals.

It also works because states can protect the health of their communities by banning chemicals like PFAS. States are spending billions of taxpayer dollars to clean up PFAS once it’s in the environment—the only solution is prevention.

During the first week of the United Nation's 30th Climate Change Conference (COP30), Canada reinforced this commitment by working closely with international partners to promote a shared vision: building economies that are both sustainable and competitive. Canada advocated for smart policies and incentives that cut greenhouse gas emissions while supporting Canadian businesses, protecting jobs, and attracting investment.

Canada's recently announced Climate Competitiveness Strategy includes a renewed commitment to strengthening industrial carbon markets, one of the most effective tools we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At COP30, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, announced Canada's intention to join the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets—a partnership with states such as the United Kingdom, France, and Singapore that are supporting investments and creating jobs in the rapidly growing global clean economy. Aligned with this outcome, Canada also endorsed the establishment of the Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, a collaborative forum of like-minded nations to exchange views on carbon pricing mechanisms, carbon accounting methodologies, and best practices on the potential use of high-integrity offset credits.

At COP30, Minister Dabrusin continued to emphasize the importance of strong measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification systems to drive down methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for nearly a third of current global warming. At a ministerial meeting, she highlighted the critical role of the International Methane Emissions Observatory to move from emissions estimates to accurate measurement data.

Moderated by MS NOW’s Rosa Flores, Perryman spoke to an audience on a panel titled “A Democracy, If You Can Keep It.” The Texas Tribune Festival highlights ideas that shape the future of technology, safety and security, culture and the arts, education, the economy, energy, and healthcare, and more — with those driving decisions in Texas and across the nation.

Perryman’s remarks were centered on how the American people can respond to rising threats of autocracy. She highlighted the role of the courts enforcing compliance with their rulings, how to build broad coalitions in the face of rapid attempts to bring the nation into autocracy, and the way in which Democracy Forward and its partners are providing people and communities legal representation. During her remarks and in response to audience questions, Perryman issued a warning about the normalization of the government not complying with court orders and the importance of American people mobilizing into court:

“The ability of people to initiate litigation against their government is a critical tool, whether in state and local communities or at the federal level.”

“This administration’s ignoring court orders across this country should not be normalized. Court orders at the local level keep people safe. And we need to also be focused on that…We are litigating every day to enforce court orders… It is important that the vast majority of the American people, the vast majority, including, by the way, many conservatives and many who have been aligned in the past with the president, believe that the government should follow [court] orders.”

“The American people are showing that the emperor has no clothes…There is great opportunity in the president’s overreach and there is a way that this crisis can be a catalyst for true change. Not putting Humpty back together again on… a wall that was not built to hold us. But to rebuild and reimagine in this moment and to do it while fighting for people, because lives are on the line every day.”

“One branch of government cannot check another branch of government without broader mobilization. And so it is time for Congress to wake up. It is time for the American people to demand that Congress wake up… And that’s not just Congress, it’s us. It’s mass mobilizations. It’s learning again how to strike and how to boycott and how to say that the people in this country still get to be in charge. We are going to have to learn to build those muscles.”

“If you talk about the shutdown, at the beginning of the shutdown, the president was claiming that he really wanted to feed 42 million Americans, but that he couldn’t do it? That’s what he was claiming. He didn’t have a legal authority to do it…We went into federal court with the Rhode Island Council of Churches, with the Service Employees International Union, because workers need SNAP too, with grocery stores, with food providers, with food banks, with the largest coalition we’ve seen since inauguration on these cases. And through a range of court orders, every single court that looked at this said that not only did the president have the authority to pay SNAP benefits, he had the obligation… People did see it for what it was, which was the president that was weaponizing the federal government against the very people that it is intended to serve.”

Boulder, CO — November 17, 2025

With cooling demand set to grow 2.5-fold by 2050, Third Derivative, RMI’s global climate tech accelerator, today announced a call for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) solutions for several pilot opportunities designed to validate the technology across diverse climates and building types in the United States and India.

Cooling is no longer a luxury — it is a global necessity essential for health, productivity, and survival. Conventional air conditioning and refrigeration currently account for more than 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Third Derivative is working to scale breakthrough cooling technologies that can cut emissions, improve resilience, and expand access to affordable cooling in heat-vulnerable regions.

“We are at a tipping point for cooling. Conventional, business-as-usual solutions are not enough — not enough to mitigate cooling-related climate pollution, and not enough to protect vulnerable communities against extreme heat.” said Rushad Nanavatty, Third Derivative’s managing director. “Those who need breakthrough cooling solutions the most are the least able to afford them. By accelerating the deployment of solutions like passive daytime radiative cooling, we can radically expand access to affordable, zero-energy cooling that addresses both challenges.”

PDRC technologies — such as paints, films, and membranes — have the potential to lower indoor temperatures by up to 18°F (10°C) on hot days without using electricity. RMI and Third Derivative are inviting leading PDRC manufacturers to apply for participation in upcoming global pilots. Selected products will be evaluated for their cooling performance, affordability, scalability, durability, toxicity, and embodied carbon.

Through these pilots, Third Derivative and partners will collect critical data to assess performance, evaluate human and environmental benefits, and advance commercialization pathways for promising solutions. Third Derivative’s pilot projects are designed to generate open-source evidence that supports equitable, transparent deployment of sustainable cooling solutions.

In India, Third Derivative is collaborating with a research institution and local grassroots partner to pilot PDRC products in an informal housing community in Ahmedabad, improving indoor comfort and community well-being amid rising heat stress. In the United States, Third Derivative will work with technical partners to test PDRC products on commercial buildings. Together, these pilots will demonstrate the technology’s versatility and scalability.

These projects in India and the United States are made possible through seed funding from the Autodesk Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund, respectively, whose early support is catalyzing the testing and scaling of zero-energy cooling solutions. Additional partners and funders are being engaged to expand the pilots to more sites, products, and geographies, advancing equitable, data-driven pathways for global deployment.

“Access to cooling is a matter of both fairness and survival,” said RMI CEO Jon Creyts. “With support from RMI, Third Derivative, and our ambitious partners, innovators have the opportunity to jump-start novel technologies that will transform how the world stays cool, without heating the planet.”

These efforts are part of RMI’s broader Global Cooling Initiative, which leverages cutting-edge startups, partners, and financing to advance sustainable cooling solutions, from efficient appliances to eco-friendly refrigerants and better refrigerant management.

Next, we report on a bid to clean up the Ohio River. The river begins in Downtown Pittsburgh and flows past several states on its way to Cairo, Illinois. It's played a big role in American history and American industry. The Ohio was downriver of every Pittsburgh steel mill. It had other mills along its banks from Steubenville, Ohio, to Ashland, Kentucky. Anything along the Tennessee River or the Wabash flows into the Ohio, which leads to a question. How do you clean it up now? A plan to scrub it would take support from Congress. Morgan Watkins of Louisville Public Media went out on the water.

(SOUNDBITE OF WATER SPLASHING)

MORGAN WATKINS, BYLINE: A paddle along a small slice of the Ohio River in Louisville reveals the industrial history of this waterway. People call it a working river because it's an important pathway for barges, transporting millions of tons of cargo each year. One floats by carrying freight past a family-owned sand company on the shore, one of many riverside businesses. The booming of industry along the Ohio River has boosted the economies of many waterfront towns, but it also took an environmental toll.

Forest Clevenger is paddling the canoe. He leads a nonprofit called the Ohio River Way. He's excited about an idea to protect the wetlands, rivers and streams that make up the entire Ohio River Basin through investments in...

FOREST CLEVENGER: Clean water, habitat restoration, flooding mitigation and public recreational infrastructure.

WATKINS: It's a big vision, but he says it's not unique.

CLEVENGER: Like restoration initiatives that are in watersheds all around the country, just not here.

WATKINS: He's talking about restoration programs launched for historic American waters in recent decades, like the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and the Everglades. In all of them, the federal government has been providing substantial funding and coordinating partnerships with states and local communities. Now, after several years of work, people in this region have a blueprint to take to Congress. It's called the Ohio River Basin Restoration and Protection Plan.

(CROSSTALK)

WATKINS: Last month, the groups behind the plan co-hosted a special conference in Louisville. Chris Lorentz chairs one of them, the Ohio River Basin Alliance.

CHRIS LORENTZ: This is a game-changer - a once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-generation opportunity. We're asking for this now, and we're going to show that it's worth the investment.

WATKINS: What they're asking for is money from Congress, an initial investment of $350 million per year for five years. The funds could help do things like clean up contaminated sites and update public water systems along the river. The plan's supporters say repairing the region's environmental health will boost local tourism and economies. That's why Lorentz has high hopes Congress and President Trump will fund it.

LORENTZ: When you look at the priorities of any administration, including the current one, it's economic development. It's community enhancement.

WATKINS: While their plan focuses a lot on restoring the environment, he says it checks those economic boxes too. Democratic Congressman Morgan McGarvey of Louisville is working on bipartisan legislation to launch the Ohio River restoration initiative.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MORGAN MCGARVEY: The Ohio River is the largest body of water in the entire country that does not receive a single dollar in dedicated federal funding. Not one. That's something we got to change.

WATKINS: He acknowledges getting Congress' approval won't happen easily or quickly.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MCGARVEY: We will never stop fighting because I think this is the type of legacy generational product where I hope 50, 60, 70, a hundred years from now, nobody knows who did it, but they love and stand in awe and in wonder of the incredible Ohio River and the Ohio River Valley.

WATKINS: Supporters know it's an uphill battle. But after years of work building a coalition across 14 states and hundreds of communities that make up the Ohio River Basin, they finally have a detailed plan to show Congress what is possible with their support.

Now, satellites and aircraft have become key tools to spot methane super-polluters like oil and gas operations, landfills, and coal mines – which is an important step in slowing down pollution.

Why methane matters to the climate

Many people know that carbon dioxide is the largest contributor to climate change. But methane matters, too, because of how effectively it traps heat in the atmosphere – like an extra-thick down duvet. In its first 20 years in the atmosphere, methane has about 80 times the warming impact compared to carbon dioxide. The short-acting but powerful effect of methane makes cleaning it up a prime target for slowing climate warming as quickly as possible.

But so far, it’s been hard to unravel exactly how much methane is being emitted, and from where.

Scientists know that methane can bubble up from diffuse sources like cow burps or flooded rice fields. Or it can pour into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations. Sometimes it leaks from defective equipment; sometimes it’s released intentionally. Some methane releases go unreported, and some emissions estimates appear to be significantly undercounted.

No matter the source, as the amount of methane in the atmosphere climbs ever higher, the race to pinpoint these pollution sources is accelerating.

How eyes in the sky can help

Satellite and aircraft observations are now revealing the myriad locations where methane pollution is occurring. Measurements from above show how oil and gas extraction, landfills, coal mines, and large-scale livestock agriculture operations are causing substantial amounts of methane pollution.

Riley Duren is the CEO of Carbon Mapper, one of several organizations using satellites to measure climate-warming greenhouse gases such as methane.

“Our current focus at Carbon Mapper is on methane monitoring of super-emitters, because that’s the biggest potential for immediate emission reductions,” Duren said.

He explained that as methane-measuring satellites proliferate, they’re helping to bring our fuzzy understanding of methane emissions into sharper focus.

The quickest bang-for-buck to slow climate-warming pollution would be to pinpoint the large emitters and work toward cleaning them up. These large-scale, point-source emissions account for about 40% of total methane emissions from human activities.

The Carbon Mapper data portal combines observations from five different instruments, and one of the most powerful aspects of this data is that it doesn’t rely on corporate or government reporting. Anyone can see the results for themselves.

Read: Climate polluters may be allowed to stop reporting their emissions. That doesn’t mean they can hide them.

Read on for the breakdown of some of the largest methane polluters observed in the U.S. These results are based on methane plumes measured by the five instruments within the Carbon Mapper data portal as of Oct. 16, 2025. These findings aren’t a comprehensive accounting of all methane emissions in the U.S., but they’re a snapshot of some of the largest and most persistent sources of methane pollution measured so far.

1. Oil and gas industry, especially in Texas and New Mexico

4,800 individual sources of large methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry have been measured and mapped to date

1.2 million pounds of methane released per hour in the U.S.

The Permian Basin is a region of thick sedimentary rocks in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. It’s the largest source of crude oil in the U.S., as well as a major producer of natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane.

Satellite images show thousands of plumes of methane billowing from numerous types of infrastructure: wells, pipelines, compressor stations, and gas processing facilities.

Sharon Wilson and Justin Mikulka work for a small nonprofit named Oilfield Witness that documents methane released from oil and gas infrastructure.

“The Permian is a methane disaster,” Mikulka said.

Many of these methane plumes are not leaks: “Those are intentional releases to protect the equipment and maintain operation,” Wilson said.

One example is flaring, which is when methane is burned intentionally. A methane flare looks dramatic because it makes a large flame. But burning methane is better for the climate than releasing it directly to the atmosphere, because burning methane converts it to the less potent carbon dioxide.

One problem with flaring, Wilson explained, is that the flares often malfunction. Sometimes they burn inefficiently, releasing a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. Even worse, the pilot light on the flares can go out, and then methane is not burned at all – it just vents directly to the atmosphere.

“I have tracked flares being unlit for well over a year,” she said.

In theory, flaring is supposed to be used infrequently. But Oilfield Witness analyzed the applications used by oil and gas companies as they requested permission to burn or vent methane in Texas. State regulators approved these applications over 99% of the time. A collaborative story between Inside Climate News and ProPublica paints the picture behind these massive methane emissions in Texas.

Satellite data can shine a light on the large and frequent releases of methane from oil and gas operations. In some situations, Duren and the Carbon Mapper team reach out to oil and gas operators when they find large methane plumes.

“We have seen a number of cases – over 150 to date – where operators do take steps to close leaks when notified,” he said.

But Wilson and Mikulka aren’t optimistic.

“The industry has the tools to track what they’re doing in real time, and yet nothing changes,” Mikulka said.

“There’s just absolutely no evidence that the U.S. oil and gas industry can produce oil and gas without huge methane emissions,” Wilson said.

2. Landfills

336 individual super-emitter landfills have been detected to date

500,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Landfills produce many of the largest plumes of methane measured by Carbon Mapper in the U.S.

Methane releases from oil and gas extraction are numerous, but they’re often short-lived or intermittent. By contrast, landfills tend to give off methane over months or years, which adds up to a substantial amount of methane pollution.

Given the large scale of methane coming from landfills, it’s all the more important to have accurate measurements. But reporting methods currently used by the EPA are not in agreement with data coming from aircraft and satellites. Several recent studies using aircraft and satellite measurements have found considerably larger emissions than the estimates from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Landfill operators can use fairly simple measures to slow methane emissions, such as capturing and collecting the gas or using impermeable covers. Organic materials like food waste release large amounts of methane, and municipalities can divert food waste from landfills by using composting programs. As is often the case with cutting pollution, the economic benefits of implementing these actions are greater than the costs.

As of this writing, the U.S. landfills with the largest methane emissions based on Carbon Mapper observations are in Okeechobee, Florida, Orlando, Florida, and Melissa, Texas.

Note: The image from Orlando shows an optical effect over water. The dark surface of water makes it harder for instruments to “see” methane in the air. That’s why the methane plume is visible over the bridge but not over the water adjacent to the bridge.

3. Coal mines

192 super-emitter mines have been detected to date

220,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Coal formed when vegetation was buried in an oxygen-poor environment, compressed, and heated for millions of years. This same process also produced natural gas – which, again, is composed primarily of methane. The natural gas collects in coal seams and in the fractures and pores of the surrounding rock.

Underground mines are the largest source of concentrated methane emissions. In some cases, methane floats up from ventilation shafts, which are necessary to protect workers. Both active and abandoned coal mines can emit methane. Some methane emissions from coal mines can be captured, particularly where methane is coming from ventilation systems.

Individual mines can be the cause of disproportionately high amounts of methane pollution. For example, the Hail Creek mine in Queensland, Australia, accounts for 20% of all methane coming from coal mines in Australia, while producing only 1% of the country’s coal.

Worldwide, methane from coal mines is often underreported. In Australia, for example, data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite showed coal mines are emitting at least 40% more methane than previous estimates.

In the U.S., Carbon Mapper found the largest concentration of super-emitting coal mines in southwestern Pennsylvania and north-central West Virginia. The mines with the highest rates of methane emissions measured so far by Carbon Mapper are in Aleppo, Pennsylvania, Sycamore, Pennsylvania, and Burton, West Virginia.

4. Livestock

317 super-emitter livestock operations have been detected to date

47,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Livestock like cows and sheep produce methane as part of their digestive process. In most cases, methane emissions from livestock are too low in concentration to be detected by aerial measurements. These numerous but small sources of methane have a large impact on the atmosphere, especially when you consider the thousands of farms across the country. Nevertheless, satellites and aircraft can only spot the largest polluters, and they don’t see smaller, diffuse methane emissions that come from many farms.

Feedlots, large dairy farms, and animal processing facilities concentrate enough animals and their waste into small enough areas that their methane pollution can be detected with overhead measurements. These large methane plumes in the Carbon Mapper database are just a subset of the overall emissions from the livestock industry.

In the U.S., one of the most persistent sources of methane from livestock in the Carbon Mapper database so far is in Greeley, Colorado, which appears to be a cattle feedlot. Instruments have flown over this site more than 20 times, with methane detected 96% of the time, with maximum emissions measured at over 4,400 pounds per hour.

Boyle (PA-2) today introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Strengthening Essential Manufacturing and Industrial (SEMI) Investment Act, landmark legislation that closes the most significant remaining gap in U.S. semiconductor policy: the lack of support for the materials that make chip manufacturing possible.

For years, China has controlled the global market for substrates, thin films, lithography materials, process chemicals, and other inputs that American fabs depend on. The SEMI Investment Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators Bennet, Blackburn, Tillis, and Coons, directly counters that imbalance. By extending the CHIPS tax credit to upstream materials, the bill ensures these capabilities are built in the United States, not outsourced to strategic competitors.

This reform strengthens America’s economic resilience, reduces exposure to coercive supply-chain pressures, and reinforces the industrial base that supports our national defense.

This legislation is supported by the leading organizations across America’s semiconductor, advanced materials, chemical, and manufacturing sectors, including SEMI, Entegris, CoorsTek, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Qnity Electronics, Brewer Science, the American Chemistry Council, the Compressed Gas Association, and EFC Gases & Advanced Materials.

“Semiconductor leadership starts long before a chip ever reaches a fabrication line—it starts with the materials that make modern manufacturing possible. Our SEMI Investment Act ensures those materials are built here at home. By expanding the credit to upstream suppliers, we secure every link of the semiconductor ecosystem, strengthen our resilience, reduce dependence on China, and give American manufacturers the certainty they need to compete, innovate, and lead,” said Fitzpatrick. “This is a bipartisan, practical solution to a structural weakness in our supply chain, and positions the United States to stay ahead for decades to come.”

Fitzpatrick continued, “Pennsylvania is already a national hub for advanced manufacturing, research, and engineering talent — and this legislation builds directly on that strength. As colleagues and proud Pennsylvanians, Congressman Boyle and I are working to bring materials production home, drive new investment into our region, support high-quality jobs, and ensure that Pennsylvania’s workers and industries remain at the forefront of America’s semiconductor future.”

“Revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing is essential to our economic strength and our national security. I was proud to support the CHIPS and Science Act — and our new legislation builds on that work by strengthening our semiconductor supply chain for the long term,"" said Boyle.

Key Provisions of the Semi Investment Act

Expands the CHIPS Act tax credit to include upstream materials essential to semiconductor production.

Provides clear statutory definitions for direct and indirect production materials, reducing uncertainty for industry planning and investment.

Requires annual materials qualification lists from Treasury and Commerce, with an expedited review pathway for emerging technologies.

Extends the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit through 2031, aligning federal incentives with long-horizon capital investments.

Why This Legislation Is Urgently Needed

China controls up to 85% of global processing of rare earth elements and key semiconductor inputs.

These materials underpin America’s defense systems, AI computing, clean energy technologies, medical devices, and the broader innovation economy.

Without domestic materials production, CHIPS-funded fabs remain vulnerable to supply shocks, export controls, and strategic coercion from the Chinese Communist Party.

Background

Congressman Fitzpatrick has been a leading champion of strengthening America’s semiconductor competitiveness and rebuilding domestic manufacturing capacity. He was a champion of the original CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in 2022, which reestablished U.S. leadership in advanced chip production, created the 25% Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC), and helped drive more than $630 billion in announced semiconductor investments nationwide.

In 2023, Fitzpatrick also backed the Building Chips in America Act, which removed permitting barriers, accelerated project timelines, improved federal coordination, and ensured CHIPS investments could move from planning to construction more quickly.

Class of 2023

Environmental Studies, BA/Environmental Science and Policy, MS

You are the author of an environmental children’s book, Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew. What inspired you to write this book and what do you hope readers will glean from it?

During my time working as a naturalist for Westchester County Parks at Lenoir Preserve, I had the privilege of teaching children about the environment and the importance of protecting it. I quickly noticed that many existing children’s books with environmental themes focused on awareness, but not on action. As someone who believes deeply in empowering others to make a difference, I wanted to create a story that not only educated young readers but also inspired them to do something. To feel that they could be heroes for the planet, too.

That realization sparked Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew, designed to blend imagination, fun, and real-world impact. My hope is that children come away from the story feeling excited, capable, and ready to take small but meaningful actions to care for our Earth.

You graduated from Pace with a combined Environmental Studies, BA/Environmental Science and Policy, MS. How did your studies inspire and prepare you for authoring this book?

My studies were instrumental to the subject matter in the book. I’ve always loved spending time outdoors, but it wasn’t until I began my academic journey at Pace that I truly understood how the places I cherished and the wildlife I was passionate about protecting were being impacted by a changing climate. Through my coursework in environmental studies and environmental science and policy, I gained a deeper awareness of the challenges facing our planet and the interconnectedness between people, nature, and policy. My studies not only provided the scientific foundation for Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew but also strengthened my lifelong mission to protect the planet for current and future generations.

You also host a podcast called The Hopeful Environmentalist. Please tell us more about that.

I started The Hopeful Environmentalist (THE) podcast in my college apartment while pursuing my master’s degree at Pace. At the time, I was overwhelmed by the constant stream of bad news about our changing climate and its impacts on people, animals, and the planet. I craved a space that focused on hope, the kind that inspires action instead of despair. As I dove deeper, I realized that while science and policy are essential to solving the climate crisis, they’re often not translated in ways the public can easily understand. So, I created THE to bridge that gap.

Today, the podcast, rated top 11 best environmental podcast in 2023, has listeners in over 35 countries. You can listen to it anywhere you stream podcasts/music.

In addition to being an author, what has your career trajectory been like since graduation?

After finishing my degree, I moved to Washington, DC, to intern at the White House Council on Environmental Quality under the Biden-Harris Administration. I then relocated to North Dakota, where I worked as a contractor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on environmental policy, while also a social media assistant, podcast editor, and ultimately, communications coordinator for Our Climate. I soon realized how much I wanted to deepen my skills in storytelling and communication—so I began focusing on THE podcast. Through it, I’ve had the privilege of being invited to speak at the United Nations Conference on Biological Diversity and the UK Mission to the UN, as well as receiving media badges at EarthX’s Congress of Conferences and Climate Week NYC.

Next, I joined the Pace University Gale Epstein Center, where I currently work part-time on water policy initiatives, in addition to as a full-time social media coordinator at Vocal Media.

Through my coursework in environmental studies and environmental science and policy at Pace, I gained a deeper awareness of the challenges facing our planet and the interconnectedness between people, nature, and policy.

Why did you choose to attend Pace?

I was looking for a university that would not only provide a strong academic foundation but also offer opportunities to gain real-world experience and connect with organizations making a difference. The decision to attend Pace proved to be one of the best I’ve made. I gained practical experience in everything from field data collection to conducting informational interviews, and those experiences ultimately helped me earn an internship at the White House Council on Environmental Quality and has set my career in motion.

What activities and organizations were you involved with as a student?

I served as president of the NATURE Club, where I worked alongside a passionate group of students to create hands-on environmental experiences for the Pace community. We organized campus clean-up days, sustainability-focused events, and off-campus trips, including a memorable visit to the Wolf Conservation Center, to give students unique opportunities to connect with conservation organizations. Beyond the NATURE Club, I participated in the Environmental Studies and Science department’s Career Day, which introduced me to mentors and internship opportunities that helped shape the foundation of my career.

What were your experiences like in the Environmental Studies and Science department on the Pleasantville campus? What faculty had been instrumental in your journey as a student?

I truly loved my time in the Environmental Studies and Science department. Every professor I had played a role in shaping the environmentalist I am today by opening doors to opportunities I might never have discovered on my own. However, two professors who had the greatest impact on my journey were Professor John Cronin and Professor Michelle Land. Through their classes and mentorship, I gained a deeper understanding of the policy and advocacy side of the environmental field, a perspective that ultimately helped me secure an internship at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Their dedication to student success went far beyond the classroom, from organizing mock hearings to helping us build meaningful networks.

What advice would you give to our students, as they navigate college life?

Define your own path and stay open to where it may lead. Also, talk to your professors. Their mentorship and stories can open doors you didn’t even know existed. Further, take classes outside your major, explore topics that spark your curiosity, and seek experiences that fuel your passions, not just your resume. Most importantly, enjoy the process. College isn’t just about preparing for your career, it’s also about discovering who you are, what you care about, and what kind of impact you want to make.",https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/dyson-article-teaser-environmental-studies-science-taylor-gannis.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:01.970887

That’s why battery temperature management (cooling or heating) is critical in electric vehicles.
Once the hottest point reaches the temperature limit, thermal throttling (thermal derating) kicks in and DC fast-charging speeds decrease.
According to Hydrohertz, it’s possible to reduce the DC fast-charging time of an EV battery by two-thirds, from approximately 30 minutes to around 10 minutes, through more precise cooling of the battery.
A more advanced approach to battery cooling should enable the full potential of existing battery technology to be unleashed.","Temperature is one of the most important factors for battery charging. Temperatures outside of the optimal range for a certain battery chemistry significantly limit the acceptable charge rate. That’s why battery temperature management (cooling or heating) is critical in electric vehicles.

Over the years, we have seen EV manufacturers move from air-cooled battery systems to liquid-cooled battery systems and improve them to achieve higher performance — for example, moving them from the bottom plate to the bottom and top plates.

However, most solutions still feature a single cooling loop for the entire battery pack, which proves to be a weak point because it creates a temperature difference between the beginning and the end of the loop. Once the hottest point reaches the temperature limit, thermal throttling (thermal derating) kicks in and DC fast-charging speeds decrease.

The Dectravalve

Hydrohertz, a startup founded in 2020, proposes a solution in the form of a multi-zone valve system that delivers precise heating, cooling, or energy recovery across up to four independently controlled zones from a single inlet. It’s called Dectravalve.

According to Hydrohertz, it’s possible to reduce the DC fast-charging time of an EV battery by two-thirds, from approximately 30 minutes to around 10 minutes, through more precise cooling of the battery. Of course, the charging performance is set for a specific battery chemistry and can be limited by the charger’s power (or voltage), but at least the temperature should no longer be the limiting factor.

Hydrohertz describes an experiment where it recharged a 100-kWh EV battery (LFP chemistry) without exceeding 44.5°C and with a difference of only 2.6°C across the whole pack. The company claims that the typical limit is usually 56°C, while the differences can be as high as 12°C.

Because the hottest cells do not trigger thermal throttling, the charging process can continue at maximum/high rate. Hydrohertz claims that charging from 10 to 80% state of charge is possible in around 10 minutes:

“In the same test, Dectravalve demonstrated that charging times can be slashed by up to 68%, meaning a typical 30-minute 10-80% charge on a 350kW fast charger could drop to around 10 minutes, putting EV charging on a par with conventional petrol/diesel vehicle refuelling times.”

An additional side effect of zonal cooling and modular thermal management is that during regular operation, the vehicle might be more efficient, which translates to lower energy consumption and higher range (especially in extreme ambient temperatures). Improved safety and longevity benefits were mentioned, too.

A more advanced approach to battery cooling should enable the full potential of existing battery technology to be unleashed. Hopefully, solutions like that will be viable and reliable, offering even better DC fast-charging capabilities.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251117-153353j.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:02:04.412868

The Quiet Part of the Revolution This is the quiet part of the energy transformation.","Over the past five years, the energy transition has been loud in some places. We have seen data centers booming, capacity prices climbing, renewables surging and virtual power plants gaining traction. But beneath those headlines, a revolution message has been unfolding, sector by sector, driven not by policy or utilities but by private businesses stepping into roles once reserved for monopolies.

Take Caterpillar, for example. Long known for its heavy machinery, the company now offers a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) platform, an unexpected pivot that underscores how deeply energy intelligence is being woven into commercial and industrial operations. From retail and manufacturing to real estate and tech, companies are learning that energy is no longer a fixed cost. It’s a controllable variable, one that can be optimized, monetized and aligned with long-term business strategy.

Commercial Customers: The Grid’s Unsung Stabilizers

At the center of this shift are commercial customers, who are increasingly the steady force in an uncertain grid. Unlike residential users, whose Peak Load Contribution (PLC) is largely uncontrollable and often meaningless for planning or cost-reduction purposes, commercial PLCs can be actively managed. And that’s where the real innovation is happening.

Multifamily communities are increasingly operating like commercial customers, and that shift is transforming their role on the grid. By pairing the right supply contracts with DERMS platforms, multifamily developers and operators can now manage usage, flexibility and capacity just like office parks or manufacturing sites have done for years. This isn’t theoretical; it’s already underway. Properties are optimizing load, reducing costs and contributing to grid stability by applying commercial-grade energy intelligence to what was once a passive residential segment. The result: a fast-growing, data-driven force for grid support emerging from the multifamily sector.

From Energy Management to Energy Mastery

Nationwide Energy Partners (NEP) has seen this evolution firsthand. Our roots are in multifamily communities, properties that behave more like small commercial campuses than clusters of individual homes. By aggregating these accounts and managing energy through sophisticated metering, billing and now DERMS-aligned technology, we’re unlocking new value across the system.

What began as a niche service, helping multifamily developers navigate complex utility structures, has evolved into a multi-state energy services platform that integrates energy into the very fabric of property management. Our approach goes beyond meter reading and billing. Through data-informed operations, proactive maintenance and insight-driven tools, NEP helps property owners treat energy as a controllable asset rather than an uncontrollable expense.

Our O&M Insights system extends that philosophy further, using in-unit smart devices to proactively detect leaks, monitor performance and resolve issues remotely. The benefits are tangible: fewer truck rolls, reduced operating costs, improved resident comfort and better visibility into consumption patterns.

Private Innovation, Public Benefit

The broader implications are profound. Aggregating the huge, ignored multifamily industry (17.7 million Americans rent apartments) doesn’t just create buying power; it generates the kind of granular, real-time energy data that utilities and grid operators have long struggled to access. That visibility enables properties to proactively reduce capacity costs, generate verifiable carbon reductions and deploy grid-supportive technologies that enhance resilience across entire communities.

Even residents, who are often left out of the energy equation, stand to benefit. With smart technologies in their units, they can track usage, manage costs and understand their environmental impact in ways that were once impossible. The relationship between end-users and energy is becoming more participatory, more transparent and ultimately more sustainable.

The Quiet Part of the Revolution

This is the quiet part of the energy transformation. It’s not driven by splashy federal programs or massive new infrastructure. It’s driven by sector experts, developers, manufacturers and service providers, who see opportunity in efficiency and resilience.

Commercial customers are proving that when you give them the tools and incentives to control their energy destiny, they’ll deliver stability, flexibility and value not just for themselves, but for the grid as a whole.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/OtMknGSnIDYPuJ1hTQ__dHZpJPa62J_WFdaj_nFChH8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9pc3RvY2stMTMyMjU1MDc3NV9wcm9jZXNzZWQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-17 19:01:47.751881

Glasier, president and CEO of Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp., has a story that mirrors uranium’s history.
The company now has large uranium reserves, mostly in Colorado — more than any other firm in the state, according to Glaiser.
Restarting old mines is considerably cheaper and there’s plenty of uranium left in them he noted.
Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the 3rd Congressional District, recently toured the future Western Uranium & Vanadium processing site near Nucla with Grant and George Glasier.","Uranium mining in Colorado has a bright future.

George Glasier believes that.

From his cattle ranch near Nucla, Colo., where sagebrush valleys give way to rugged canyons, Glasier leads a company working to restart old uranium mines and build a new ore processing plant.

This push comes at a pivotal time for an industry that’s endured decades of booms and busts.

Uranium, the key material for nuclear power, was recently reclassified as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. Geological Survey under an executive order from President Donald Trump, who said he wants to “unleash” American energy. Formerly classified as a fuel source, uranium miners and refiners have not been eligible for the same kinds of taxpayer support offered to other mineral suppliers.

This designation acknowledges uranium’s vital role in clean energy, national security and the economy, especially as the U.S. seeks to cut reliance on foreign supplies. The change is intended to speed up approvals for mining projects and unlock federal funding, such as grants or loans — a potential game-changer for Colorado’s uranium sector.

Glasier, president and CEO of Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp., has a story that mirrors uranium’s history. After law school, he worked in real estate before entering mining in the 1970s. He joined Energy Fuels, a company that became the biggest uranium producer in the U.S., selling to power plants worldwide.

Though no one was harmed, the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 scared people, leading to increased safety and environmental regulations from nuclear regulators that all but halted construction of nuclear power plants for decades, according to the World Nuclear Association.

Uranium prices tanked, going below $10 per pound for years, and mines throughout the U.S. closed. Glasier left the business, bought his ranch at age 48, and learned ranching on the fly.

“Didn’t know much, but it worked for 33 years,” he said in a recent interview with The Denver Gazette.

Uranium pulled him back in 2005, when he started a new company. By 2014, he had formed Western Uranium & Vanadium and began buying old mine sites in Colorado and Utah, some of them from his former employer, Energy Fuels, which at the time was divesting some of its holdings.

The company now has large uranium reserves, mostly in Colorado — more than any other firm in the state, according to Glaiser.

At the heart of Glasier’s new energy empire is the Sunday Mine Complex in San Miguel County, a group of underground tunnels in canyon walls high above the Dolores River that were previously mined more than 3 miles back into the heart of the mesas above.

The complex’s mines operated from the 1950s to the mid-1980s, supplying uranium to the government, some of which Glaiser said created atomic bombs. After the federal government’s purchases for nuclear weapons programs ended in 1971, and after commercial exploitation of uranium under the Colorado Plateau through the 1980s ended, mines shut down when demand for uranium tanked. The Sunday Mine complex produced about 5 million pounds of uranium oxide, known as “yellowcake” for its bright yellow color, according to a 2015 technical report prepared for the company.

Western began rehabilitation and development of the mines in 2020, paused for COVID, and got going again in 2022.

The mine could run for 15-20 years, creating hundreds of jobs and boosting local economies in Montrose and San Miguel counties, said Glaiser.

But prices are still a hurdle. Uranium sells for about $80 a pound now, not enough to start entirely new mines.

Glasier said prices above $100 per pound would be necessary to open new mines. Restarting old mines is considerably cheaper and there’s plenty of uranium left in them he noted.

“Why sell cheap when it’ll cost more later?” Glasier asked.

Glasier estimates the U.S. could produce about half the uranium it needs in the next 10 years if prices justify it. Currently, however, domestic output meets only a tiny fraction of demand, with nearly all uranium being imported, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Studies from the Common Sense Institute, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the Nuclear Energy Agency, and the Colorado Geological Survey indicate that designating uranium as a critical mineral could generate up to $4.6 billion in annual economic output, support over 37,000 jobs, and revive rural Western communities impacted by coal mine closures through expanded mining and supply chains.

Glasier advocates for small nuclear reactors to provide steady power, especially as Colorado aims to attract tech companies needing reliable energy beyond wind and solar.

Western Uranium’s big plan includes a processing mill at Piñon Ridge, now renamed Mustang, near Bedrock. It’s close to the Sunday Mine, making it handy for turning ore into yellowcake.

But the site has a troubled past.

Proposed in 2007, it got a state license in 2013 after public meetings. Environmental groups sued, worried about water pollution, dust carrying radiation, and harm to wildlife and rivers.

In 2018, a Denver court ruled that the protections weren’t sufficient and canceled the license. The state followed suit, and no one appealed. Western bought the site in 2024 for about $2 million. Glasier said the company expects to file a new application by mid-2026, with hopes of opening by 2028.

Worries remain about health and the environment.

Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the 3rd Congressional District, recently toured the future Western Uranium & Vanadium processing site near Nucla with Grant and George Glasier.

“This facility is critical to reducing America’s dependence on foreign minerals and rare earth element processing, and to powering American energy dominance through safe, reliable, and clean nuclear energy,” said Hurd in a post on X.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Side-drill-1-rotated-768x1024.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:01:52.390961

Protecting primary forests is not just an environmental imperative — it is a strategic policy decision with climate, economic and social benefits.","Primary forests are the heart of the global climate and biodiversity agenda, underpinning key international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. These forests store dense carbon stocks while continuing to act as powerful carbon sinks. They also regulate water systems, reduce the risk of zoonotic disease, support livelihoods with essential resources, and provide irreplaceable habitat for countless species — many of them critically endangered and found nowhere else. Over 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity lives in forests, and primary forests host the highest concentrations of species: especially those that are endemic, endangered or both. Primary forests fulfil a host of ecological functions, and the loss of these ecosystems is permanent — no restoration plan can replicate the complexity and resilience of intact forest landscapes within a reasonable timeframe, if ever.

Since 2001, the world has lost at least 83 million hectares of tropical primary forest and 50 million hectares of intact boreal forest. In 2024 alone, tropical primary forest loss exceeded 6.7 million hectares, releasing more than 3.1 gigatonnes of CO into the atmosphere — slightly more than India’s fossil fuel emissions that year. This marks a doubling of loss from 2023 and the highest annual rate in two decades — an alarming reversal of hard-won progress. Despite rising awareness, much of the global response remains misaligned and siloed. Although restoration efforts are extremely important to repairing functionality and restoring habitat in degraded areas and ought to be continually funded, these efforts should not be at the expense of preventing further deforestation and degradation of the primary forests that remain.

We cannot plant our way out of deforestation: prevention is more effective, more cost-efficient and ecologically far superior.

A fundamental shift is needed in both policy and finance frameworks concerned with forest ecosystem integrity which sustains primary forests. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), through the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), aims to protect 30% of the planet by 2030, and countries are striving to make progress towards this target. Fortunately, the CBD took critical steps both in Montreal and in Cali to integrate a clear and strong ecosystem integrity mandate into the GBF in Goal A, and Targets 1, 2, 8 and 12. Of course, the comprehensive focus on ecosystem integrity in the GBF by definition includes primary forests, but it is important to recognise this explicitly in the CBD at COP 17. The financial commitments made through CBD by countries earlier this year represent a critical milestone, but unless primary forests are explicitly prioritised in national strategies, we are sadly liable to continue seeing significant deforestation and degradation, as was the case in 2024. Similarly, the financial commitments made at UNFCCC COP29 represent an important step towards accelerating action to combat climate change — but primary forest conservation remains an overlooked solution within climate dialogues.

Where primary forests remain, governments must integrate primary forest protection into their international commitments and back those promises with legally binding safeguards, robust monitoring, enforceable protections, policy coherence and elimination of harmful incentives. In parallel, global finance must evolve. Current funding models fall short in prioritising conservation efforts with the highest ecological returns — leaving primary forests underfunded and exposing biodiversity, climate and communities to avoidable harm.

Beyond just a new policy, safeguarding primary forests demands an evolution of mindset: environmental protection isn’t a barrier to economic growth — it’s a value-add, a long-term investment in resilience, stability and prosperity of the planet.

These ecosystems are not liabilities to be cleared or degraded for development — they are assets, already delivering high-value ecological services that underpin healthy societies and healthy economies.

Innovative financial mechanisms can help close this gap. Redirecting climate finance toward avoided deforestation strategies, including payments to communities for ecosystem services and sovereign debt swaps for countries which steadfastly protect their primary forests, can unlock substantial resources to maintain and restore the ecosystem integrity of forests. Nations and communities demonstrating effective forest stewardship should be directly rewarded. Moreover, Indigenous Peoples and local communities who have stewarded these landscapes for generations offer robust networks and approaches for maintaining these landscapes, a fact which has been reinforced by decisions made at CBD COP16 last year. Their governance systems have proven effective at protecting primary forests for millennia, and they are to this day both dependents and stewards of these ecosystems. Securing Indigenous land rights and channelling direct financial support to Indigenous forest stewards is not only equitable — it is a proven conservation strategy.

Some global conservation initiatives are already pushing for these changes and are backed by funding from multilateral organisations. For example, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which provides the largest funding for forest protection globally, supports the conservation of tropical primary forests as a priority globally - -notably through the Amazon, Congo and Other Critical Forest Biomes Integrated Program, endowed with $306 million grants leveraging in addition around $1.5 billion, as well as through other global projects executed by IUCN, Wild Heritage, Griffith University and other pioneering partners. These initiatives demonstrate that investing in primary forest integrity can simultaneously advance benefits for climate, biodiversity, people and economies, creating a win-win situation for everyone.

Protecting primary forests is not just an environmental imperative — it is a strategic policy decision with climate, economic and social benefits. Yet without immediate intervention, these ecosystems will continue to disappear, weakening global efforts to combat climate change and stem accelerating biodiversity loss. Policymakers must act to close policy gaps, realign and unlock financial flows, and position primary forests as foundational to global sustainability

South Dakota shouldn’t miss out in reaping the benefits for its citizens and helping advance U.S. dominance in innovation.","President Donald Trump has been clear in both his policies and rhetoric that he wants to help America win the next wave of technological innovation. But earlier this month, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang sounded the alarm to the Financial Times: “China is going to win the AI race.” A critical step to help realize the President’s vision is to build more data centers, and South Dakota can help.

In America, we need more digital infrastructure. Essential components of that infrastructure are more data centers. These facilities house all the cloud storage for Americans and our businesses, and as we continue to use more tech tools, our need for more data centers grows. President Trump recognizes this need and is championing the rapid build-out of U.S. data centers for AI infrastructure, streamlining permitting and incentivizing investment so America creates good jobs and leads the global technology race. However, there have been three rising challenges to this build-out of critical digital infrastructure which must be addressed. Much of the information circulating on these topics as they relate to data centers is misleading at best: energy consumption, water use and taxes.

Data Centers Help Reduce Everyone Else’s Electricity Bills

By helping the state’s electrical utilities to modernize South Dakota’s grid, hyperscale data centers can build new power generation and transmission that improves reliability. At the same time, these large-load data centers will pay a greater share of the utilities’ fixed costs. This puts downward pressure on electricity bills for households.

New research for the U.S. Department of Energy by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found higher load growth from industries like data centers reduces electricity prices for other customers.

Berkeley’s research was featured in a Washington Post article, “There’s a reason electricity prices have been rising. And it’s not data centers.” Berkeley Labs found that North Dakota, which experienced a 40% increase in electricity demand thanks to new data centers, saw real electricity prices fall by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. And Virginia, home to more data centers than anyone in the world, experienced a 14% increase in demand and a price drop of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour.

Berkeley Labs found that North Dakota, which experienced a 40% increase in electricity demand thanks to new data centers, saw real electricity prices fall by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Moreover, in their 2024 study of Virginia’s data center industry, the Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission (JLARC) found that Virginia ratepayers are not footing the bill for data centers, and that the State Corporation Commission has the tools to continue to ensure ratepayer protection. According to Kansas electric utility Evergy, “Large load customers, including data centers, absorb a greater share of the fixed costs of operating grid infrastructure (power plants, poles and wires), thus lowering rates for all customers.”

Data centers invest in the local grid, bringing lower electricity bills and more reliable energy for South Dakota businesses and households.

Data Centers Use Less Water Than a Courthouse or Office Building

Many new large-scale data centers will consume less water than your average courthouse or office by using a high-tech version of the electricity-powered air conditioning similar to that which cools our homes, schools and businesses.

In the parts of South Dakota where water is abundant, new data centers could use evaporative cooling on the warmest days of the year to reduce electricity demand. In those data centers, some of the water would evaporate into the skies above South Dakota, just like an irrigated cornfield, reservoir or golf course. The water that doesn’t evaporate is then returned to the municipal system or aquifer, as approved by local and state water authorities. This efficient technology ensures that local water resources are used smartly and sparingly to protect the community’s water supply.

Virginia again leads by example on getting to the root of this issue. Being the state with the most data centers in the country, it performed a state audit that found that the data centers using water do so in a sustainable and well-regulated manner.

Data Center Property Taxes Provide Relief for Residential Taxpayers and New Community Investment

Sales tax is commonly exempted for manufacturing inputs and equipment. 35 states–including South Dakota’s neighbors North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming–already exempt sales tax for capital-intensive industries like data centers. Hyperscale data centers are not built in states where they’re disproportionately taxed due to an outdated tax code, so without modernization, South Dakota will lose investment, jobs, and tax revenue to other states.

Moreover, data center builders bring substantial new property tax revenue to the communities where they locate, which provides property tax relief for homeowners, and funds local schools and infrastructure projects. This modernization brings an increase in property tax revenue for cities and counties. For example, Virginia’s data center industry contributes $9 billion to the state’s GDP and funds local schools and infrastructure. Virginia’s Loudoun County states that data center tax revenue “has enabled the county to reduce the real property tax rate for homeowners every year for the past decade.”

Virginia’s Loudoun County states that data center tax revenue “has enabled the county to reduce the real property tax rate for homeowners every year for the past decade.”

Modernizing South Dakota’s tax code to attract new industries like data centers will keep the Mount Rushmore State competitive with its neighbors and attract good jobs, investment and new property tax revenues.

As President Trump noted in July, “We believe that America’s destiny is to dominate every industry and be the first in every technology.” Data centers, essential digital infrastructure for the next generation of technological advancement, have already contributed 4.7 million American jobs and nearly $800 billion per year to our economy.

“Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt,” The Century Foundation wrote.

“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.”

Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank. It said that Black families were three times more likely to have an overdue balance than white ones, noting that Black and Asian households also had the highest late bills.

“Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance,” The Century Foundation explained.

Late balances for families with well-below-average credit scores increased by 30% during the studied period, the organization added. Those households were disproportionately in urban and low-income neighborhoods, according to the think tank.

“These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation – and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill,” The Century Foundation said. “Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.”

The organization accused the Trump administration of failing to address the root causes of “energy inflation” and hindering the development of renewable energy.

President Donald Trump has targeted renewable energy projects by reducing federal support for them. He has said that sources like wind and solar are unreliable and worse options than oil and gas, which he claims are more beneficial for the economy.

The first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order to protect the country’s “economic and national security” and “military preparedness” by making sure an “abundant” supply of reliable energy was available in every state.

“It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years,” the president said. “It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.”",https://wpde.com/resources/media/5f1f45d9-e3d0-4bcb-9bca-575bccbe40ee-GettyImages2165132907.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:55.671537

The proposed rule would dramatically narrow which waters are covered by federal safeguards, leaving many wetlands and headwaters vulnerable to pollution and destruction. These waters are vital for filtering drinking water, reducing flood and drought risks, and sustaining wildlife—but under the planned rule, many of them would no longer be protected.

NRDC’s 2025 GIS analysis found that between 38 million and 70 million acres of wetlands are at risk of pollution or destruction under modeled scenarios similar to the changes the proposal includes.

“This is a reckless giveaway to polluters,” says Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president, Nature, at NRDC. “By gutting protections for wetlands and streams, the EPA is trying to disown its legal obligation to protect our drinking water and our communities. For the millions of Americans who swim or fish in our nation’s rivers and lakes, this is a bracing slap in the face. Wetlands are nature’s safeguard against flooding, and stripping away protections for them puts millions of people in harm’s way. At a time when climate change is fueling stronger storms and worsening floods, taking away these protections is not just shortsighted—it’s dangerous.”

“The EPA’s proposal is an extreme and unscientific exploitation of an already extreme and unscientific Supreme Court ruling,” says Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC. “Erasing protections for wetlands and streams that clearly affect downstream water quality and community safety ignores decades of hydrological science and will create regulatory chaos, leaving businesses, farmers, and communities with less certainty while exposing waters to more pollution.”

“Instead of undermining the Clean Water Act, the EPA should be building durable, science-based safeguards that honor both the law and the realities of how water moves across the landscape,” Devine says.

Background:

The EPA’s new proposed rule sharply narrows which wetlands and streams are protected under the Clean Water Act. The proposed rule would limit federal safeguards only to wetlands that hold surface water during the “wet season” and directly touch a water body like a river or stream that has continuous water flowing or standing during that “wet season.”

This approach excludes many critical wetlands and seasonal streams—waters that are essential for drinking water supplies, flood control, and ecosystem health.",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:04.690201

Policymakers across the political spectrum increasingly agree that modernizing the federal permitting process is essential to deploying energy infrastructure at the pace and scale needed to meet U.S. economic, environmental, and energy security goals. Despite this growing consensus, questions remain about the most effective options to make permitting more predictable, coordinated, and timely while maintaining key environmental safeguards and opportunities for public input.

As part of its ongoing effort to explore bipartisan approaches to permitting reform, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a roundtable in October 2025 to discuss key provisions in the House of Representatives’ bipartisan Simplifying Permitting for Efficient and Effective Deployment (SPEED) Act. The roundtable focused on the version of the legislation introduced in July 2025 by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). The legislation proposes a range of reforms aimed at improving the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting process, updating judicial review standards, and strengthening project certainty across federal agencies. The roundtable was composed of more than forty experts in energy and the intersection of energy and environmental issues, and conversation largely centered on those areas.

Participants broadly agreed that the current permitting system for critical energy infrastructure projects is too slow and unpredictable, and that reforms to NEPA and judicial review could meaningfully improve permitting timelines and project certainty. Participants largely supported the overall direction and intent of the SPEED Act, particularly the provisions designed to streamline environmental reviews by setting clearer limits on which environmental effects agencies must study, and to reduce litigation-driven delays. However, there was significant debate over the details, especially concerning the precision of statutory language, the balance between efficiency and environmental oversight, and the degree to which Congress should limit judicial remedies—such as injunctions or vacating permits.

While perspectives varied, the roundtable discussion reflected a shared commitment to improving the permitting process. Participants emphasized that careful drafting and bipartisan coordination are essential to ensure that any reforms—whether through the SPEED Act or a broader legislative package—strengthen efficiency and accountability, and are durable across several administrations and Congresses.

This roundtable builds on BPC’s continuing work to evaluate pragmatic permitting solutions. Previous discussions in this series have focused on various permitting subtopics, such as community engagement, linear infrastructure, and reforms to the Clean Water Act. Together, these convenings aim to identify realistic pathways toward a permitting reform framework that accelerates energy deployment while preserving public trust in environmental decision-making.

This roundtable discussion focused on 18 specific reforms proposed in the SPEED Act. The issue brief will summarize the discussion and areas of consensus and divergent opinions among the participants present.

NEPA Reforms

Policy Option 1: Clarify that NEPA is a procedural statute only and does not mandate specific environmental outcomes.

The National Environmental Policy Act, the first major environmental law in the United States, was signed by President Richard Nixon on January 1, 1970. The statute emerged amid growing public concern about air and water pollution, oil spills, and habitat destruction. These pressures pushed policymakers to recognize that federal decisions on infrastructure, development, and resource use could cause long-term damage to both natural and human environments, and that the government needed a more deliberate process for evaluating those impacts.

NEPA requires federal agencies to assess and disclose the environmental consequences of major actions before making decisions. The law established a framework for environmental reviews. Under this framework, agencies prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for actions expected to have significant impacts and environmental assessments (EAs), which are categories of actions that the agency has determined do not normally have significant environmental impacts. Agencies may also rely on categorical exclusions (CEs), which are categories of actions that the agency has determined not to have significant environmental effects. Because CEs are defined in advance and grounded in experience, projects that fit within an existing CE can move through the NEPA process quicker, when compared to EISs and EAs.

Over time, NEPA’s scope and impact have evolved as courts, agencies, and regulators have expanded the scope of analysis required under the statute. Judicial interpretations have broadened what constitutes “significant” environmental effects, while agencies have conducted extensive and time-consuming reviews, mainly in an attempt to avoid or successfully defend against legal challenges. These trends have added layers of complexity to the process and resulted in longer review timelines and greater project uncertainty. As BPC’s SPEED Act explainer notes, the legislation clarifies that NEPA is a procedural statute that does not mandate any specific environmental outcomes.

Roundtable participants debated whether explicitly codifying that NEPA is a procedural statute would meaningfully improve permitting outcomes or simply reaffirm existing precedent (e.g., Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County (1970). Several participants noted that courts have long recognized NEPA as a procedural law and questioned whether legislative clarification would have any practical effect. Some suggested such clarification could help restore predictability and constrain the trend toward ever-expanding reviews. A few participants cautioned, however, that the courts and the public could interpret the effort to reaffirm NEPA’s original purpose as weakening environmental protection or limiting agencies’ flexibility to address new information or community concerns.

Overall, the roundtable agreed that NEPA should remain focused on transparency and informed decision-making rather than being the sole determiner of outcomes. Most participants supported reaffirming NEPA’s procedural foundation in principle, but opinions were split on whether doing so through legislation would offer tangible benefits.

Policy Option 2: Limit the scope of review to effects that are reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by the project, excluding speculative or attenuated impacts, impacts separate in time or place, or those tied to separate projects.

Since NEPA’s enactment in 1970, both court decisions and agency practice, guided in part by CEQ’s 1978 regulations, have expanded what qualifies as an “effect”. Early cases like Calvert Cliffs’ Coordinating Committee v. Atomic Energy Commission (1971) required agencies to evaluate the environmental consequences of their actions. CEQ’s regulations, which for decades have shaped how executive agencies structure their NEPA processes, incorporated that approach by calling for the analysis of direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. Although this more expansive practice strengthened environmental accountability, it has also broadened the scope of review beyond what some believe Congress originally intended and has contributed to lengthier permitting processes. The SPEED Act attempts to address this issue by clarifying that environmental review should focus on effects that are reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by a project, excluding speculative or remote impacts.

Roundtable participants generally supported focusing environmental reviews on effects that are direct and foreseeable, but they raised concerns about how the proposed statutory language would function in practice. Many described the language as overly broad and imprecise, noting that it could create new uncertainty rather than streamline the review process. One participant observed that every effect could be thought of as separate in time and place. Some participants cautioned that the use of the word “limit” could be interpreted too narrowly and exclude legitimate analysis of indirect or cumulative effects that are often necessary to understand a project’s overall environmental impact.

Participants emphasized that this policy option’s effectiveness would depend on precise drafting in the legislation and clear guidance to agencies. Some warned that ambiguous or open-ended language could invite litigation over the scope of analysis and ultimately undermine the policy option’s goal of improving efficiency. Overall, thereF was broad agreement that clarifying NEPA’s scope could be helpful, but most participants viewed this policy option as too imprecise to achieve that goal without unintended consequences.

Policy Option 3: Allow the review process conducted under other federal statutes to satisfy NEPA review requirements.

NEPA reviews often overlap with other environmental statutes that impose similar requirements. For example, a single project may trigger review under the Clean Water Act for discharges, the Endangered Species Act for impacts on protected species, and the Clean Air Act for emissions. Each statute has its own standards, timelines, and administrative processes, often involving separate documentation, interagency consultations, and public comment periods. This overlap can result in duplicative analysis where multiple agencies examine the same environmental impacts under different statutes.

Participants generally viewed this policy option as a practical step toward reducing duplication in agency reviews. They noted, however, that the policy option lacks a clear process for determining when another statute’s review would be considered functionally equivalent to NEPA. One participant urged creating a transparent process for determining equivalence and pointed out that without it, this policy option could itself become a litigation magnet. Other participants noted that it was unclear which agencies would make the equivalence determination and how much detail would be required to demonstrate it. As an example to follow, participants pointed to the permitting process for Class VI wells in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives primacy to states.

Overall, participants supported the policy option’s intent and agreed that clarifying when and how existing federal reviews can satisfy NEPA requirements could help reduce redundant analysis, if the legislation clearly defines the process for establishing equivalence.

Policy Option 4: Allow state or tribal reviews to satisfy NEPA requirements if these reviews determine that applicants have met NEPA standards.

This option builds on policy option three’s discussion of functional equivalence among federal statutes by extending the same concept to state and tribal environmental reviews. In some cases, states already conduct assessments that are similar in scope to NEPA, such as California’s Environmental Quality Act. This option aims to clarify that federal agencies could rely on these state or tribal reviews—when they meet NEPA standards—thereby avoiding repetitive review of the same project impacts.

Some participants suggested that if a state process is functionally equivalent to NEPA, a federal agency should be able to rely on that analysis to avoid duplication. Others cautioned that this could disincentivize states from reforming their own review processes and argued that the federal government should focus on improving NEPA rather than relying on varying state standards. Discussion on this policy option was brief, with one participant expressing support while another questioned whether it could backfire, depending on which agency determines equivalence. Overall, most participants emphasized that the onus should be on the federal government to improve NEPA.

Policy Option 5: Prohibit agencies from rescinding or altering completed environmental documents unless ordered to do so by a court.

Under current practice, federal agencies can revisit or withdraw previously finalized environmental documents or project approvals, sometimes following changes in presidential administration or policy direction. These reversals require project sponsors to repeat parts of the review process or halt construction despite having completed the required environmental reviews. These follow-up actions can increase uncertainty and project risk, increase costs, undermine long-term planning, and discourage investment.

Participants broadly supported efforts to strengthen project certainty and prevent completed environmental reviews from being reopened or withdrawn without cause. Several described this policy option as an important way to ensure stability across administrations and to give developers confidence that projects can move forward once reviews are complete. However, several participants emphasized that precise statutory language would be essential to make this provision effective and to avoid unintended consequences. A few participants questioned whether such language would actually prevent bad-faith rescissions, as agencies could still find other avenues to reopen reviews, and they suggested including an option requiring project sponsors to concur when an agency identifies a genuine error.

Policy Option 6: Require statements of purpose and need in environmental documents to align with the goals of the project applicant.

Under NEPA, an agency’s statement of purpose and need defines the objectives of a proposed project and guides the range of alternatives analyzed in an EA or EIS. In practice, agencies must evaluate a range of alternatives that could meet those objectives, including the project proposed by the applicant, a “no action” option, and other feasible approaches. When the agency defines the purpose differently than the applicant, it can expand the scope of alternatives, lengthen review timelines, and create tension over whether the agency has effectively redefined the project itself.

The SPEED Act includes this policy option to clarify that purpose and need statements should align with the applicant’s goals. This would ensure that agencies evaluate alternatives relevant to the project being proposed rather than redefining its objectives.

Participants discussed whether this policy option would appropriately balance agency authority with applicant goals. One participant cited Burlington v. Busey (1990), noting that courts have found agency authority to be primary in defining a project’s purpose. They cautioned that writing applicant goals directly into statute could invite courts or agencies to interpret the provision as a mandate to defer to the applicant’s definition in all circumstances, potentially constraining legitimate agency discretion. Several participants cautioned that a strained civil service capacity could also complicate implementation. Others agreed that while agency authority should remain primary, agencies should also consider the applicant’s goals when determining whether a project falls within their statutory authority. Overall, participants agreed that the underlying problem is real, but several were unsure whether this policy option was the right statutory fix.

Policy Option 7: Allow deadline extensions only with a project applicant’s approval.

NEPA includes statutory time limits for environmental reviews—generally, one year for EAs and two years for EISs—as established by the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act. Under current law, those deadlines may be extended only with the approval of the project applicant, after consultation with cooperating agencies. The SPEED Act builds on those provisions by specifying that any extensions to those timelines can be granted only with the approval of the project applicant. Supporters view this as a way to give developers greater certainty over project timelines and to discourage unnecessary delays, while maintaining flexibility for cases where additional time is genuinely needed.

Participants discussed how this policy option would interact with existing statutory timelines and agency practice. Several participants raised broader questions about whether deadlines are effective at all and whether this policy option is needed. Some cautioned that stricter limits could push more NEPA work into the preapplication period, effectively hiding how long reviews take. Others suggested that pairing firm timelines with stronger judicial review provisions could make the process more effective. Overall, participants agreed that the policy option’s intent to enhance accountability and predictability was sound, but views differed on whether requiring applicant approval would meaningfully improve review timelines.

Policy Option 8: Agencies do not have to undertake or consider new studies after an application is submitted or a notice of intent is issued.

This provision in the SPEED Act is intended to prevent permitting delays that occur when agencies initiate or evaluate new studies after a project application has been submitted or a notice of intent has been issued. In current practice, new information, such as recently published studies or data, can prompt additional analysis or supplemental environmental documents and extend review timelines. This policy option intends to provide greater certainty by clarifying that agencies are not obligated to undertake or consider new studies introduced after the review process has formally begun.

Participants expressed a mix of support and concern regarding this policy option. Several agreed that the intent was sensible and could help reduce delays. Others worried that the language might be interpreted too broadly and would prevent agencies from considering new information that could materially affect environmental outcomes. Furthermore, some participants noted that this policy option could create confusion about how agencies should handle studies completed after a draft EIS is issued. Overall, participants agreed that while the goal of improving timeliness was sound, careful drafting would be needed to ensure that agencies retain the ability to consider relevant new information when appropriate. Last, some participants recommended tying the cutoff to the issuance of a draft EIS, which they viewed as a more defensible point to limit new information.

Policy Option 9: Require agencies not to delay review to await anticipated new studies.

Environmental reviews under NEPA can take years to complete, and one contributing factor is agencies delaying action while awaiting anticipated new studies, datasets, or modeling results. Such delays can extend project timelines even when the existing information is sufficient to complete the review. The SPEED Act includes this policy option to clarify that agencies should proceed with their analysis using currently available information rather than pausing to await future studies.

Participants discussed this policy option briefly. Some viewed it as a logical companion to the previous provision on new studies, intended to prevent agencies from using anticipated research as a reason to postpone project reviews. However, others questioned whether the intent was to avoid unnecessary delays or to permit agencies to disregard potentially relevant information. The roundtable ultimately did not reach consensus on this policy option.

Policy Option 10: Extend the window of programmatic EIS/EA documents from five years to 10 years, subject to reevaluation.

A programmatic environmental impact statement or environmental assessment analyzes the environmental effects of a broader policy, program, plan, or group of related actions rather than a single project. These documents allow agencies to “tier” subsequent, project-specific reviews from the broader analysis. Agencies generally reevaluate programmatic analyses every five years to determine whether new circumstances or information require supplementation.

The SPEED Act would double this window and extend the period in which agencies may rely on a programmatic document from five years to 10 years. The goal is to reduce the frequency of reevaluations, improve predictability, and allow agencies to extend the use of resource-intensive programmatic analyses.

Participants had mixed opinions on this policy option. Some supported it, describing it as a straightforward improvement that would make programmatic reviews more useful. A few participants questioned whether extending the timeframe would make a significant difference in practice and pointed out the difficulty in predicting future conditions.

Several participants suggested that programmatic reviews could be especially valuable for energy transition minerals (such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements used in the production of clean energy technologies), where environmental conditions and resource locations are unlikely to change significantly over a decade. One participant noted that landscapes involving nickel or other mineral deposits evolve slowly, making a 10-year window appropriate. Overall, most agreed that this policy option would reduce administrative burdens, while others felt this policy option was not particularly important.

Policy Option 11: Allow agencies to adopt categorical exclusions established by agencies, including those legislated by Congress.

Under current practice, agencies may adopt CEs in another agency’s NEPA procedures if they determine that it fits their own activities and complies with applicable requirements. Although CEQs guidance has historically shaped how agencies develop and use CEs, the Supreme Court’s recent Seven Counties decision has clarified that CEQ’s regulations do not carry binding force for all federal agencies. As a result, agency-specific NEPA procedures, rather than CEQ regulations, now govern the establishment and application of CEs.

The SPEED Act would expand existing authority by allowing agencies to apply CEs that were created by Congress for another agency. For example, a statutory CE created by Congress for the Department of Transportation could be applied by the Department of Energy (DOE) for a similar class of infrastructure projects. This change aims to reduce duplication and streamline reviews by allowing agencies to rely on statutory CEs rather than conducting new analyses for similar actions.

Participants generally viewed this policy option favorably. Several said it would reduce redundant analysis and improve efficiency by allowing agencies to make use of CEs that Congress has already designated. There was no significant opposition, and participants characterized the policy option as a practical step to streamlining permitting.

Policy Option 12: Narrow the definition of “major federal action.”

Under NEPA, environmental review is required for “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.” This phrase determines when NEPA applies, and its interpretation has long been debated. There is no definition of “major federal action” within NEPA, although the recent Fiscal Responsibility Act added a list of actions that are explicitly not considered major federal actions. The SPEED Act would modify and expand that list.

Under current law, certain forms of federal assistance are excluded from NEPA when the federal agency lacks sufficient control over the project. The SPEED Act would tighten this standard by specifying that such assistance is not a major federal action unless the agency has “complete control and responsibility” over the project; it would also add grants, farm loans, and guarantees to the list of excluded actions and clarify that federal funding alone does not trigger NEPA.

Participants widely agreed that the goal of this policy option is important but raised concerns about the proposed language. Several commented that “complete control” seemed too narrow and could create loopholes that allow agencies to avoid environmental review. A participant noted that narrowing the definition of a major federal action could have potential consequences, such as allowing the federal government to avoid NEPA for projects in which it has substantial involvement (e.g., “Alligator Alcatraz”) or for other projects where agencies provide significant funding or approvals but could still claim they lack “complete control and responsibility.” This could create pathways to bypass NEPA despite meaningful federal influence over a project’s outcome.

Participants pointed out that DOE and other agencies often enter into cooperative agreements, where the federal government exercises significant but not complete control. Some supported this change, questioning whether projects receiving federal cost shares should be treated differently from identical projects developed without federal funding.

Additionally, some participants argued that NEPA should apply when federal funding influences project design or siting decisions, but not when funds are distributed after a project is already planned or underway. One participant cited as a potential model certain thresholds at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where projects below 5% federal funding typically do not trigger NEPA, those between 5% and one-third are decided on a case-by-case basis, and those above one-third normally require review.

A few participants emphasized the need to explicitly define “major federal action” in statute to avoid decades of inconsistent case law and administrative interpretation. Others urged “not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” noting that this provision in the SPEED Act could incentivize greater cooperation between developers and agencies even if it does not fully resolve the issue.

Policy Option 13: Add “energy” to CEQ’s list of national policy goals, alongside conservation, social, economic, and health.

The Council on Environmental Quality issues governmentwide NEPA guidance and maintains a statement of environmental policy goals that federal agencies often use to inform their decision-making. These goals emphasize the conservation of natural resources, the balance of economic and environmental priorities, and the promotion of social and health welfare. The SPEED Act would add “energy” to the list of national policy goals. The intent is to recognize energy development as a core national objective and ensure it is considered in federal decision-making processes.

Most participants viewed this policy option favorably, describing it as a symbolic but useful acknowledgment of energy’s important role in national policy. Several noted that energy could already fall under the existing “economic” goal but agreed that explicitly naming it could help guide how agencies balance priorities.

Judicial Review Reforms

Policy Option 14: Establish a two-part test for overturning agency actions.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts overturn agency decisions if they find them “arbitrary and capricious.” In practice, this has allowed courts to vacate permits even for procedural NEPA errors that may have no bearing on an agency’s final decision. To address this issue, the SPEED Act would establish a stricter, two-part test for judicial review: A court could overturn or reject an agency decision based on its noncompliance with NEPA only if it finds both that the agency “abused its substantial discretion” when rendering its decision, and that its decision would have been different but for that abuse of discretion. In short, the goal is to limit judicial intervention to truly consequential NEPA analytical and decisional errors and provide greater project certainty once reviews are complete.

Participants viewed this option as a major change that would raise the bar for overturning agency decisions. Several described the second part—requiring proof that the outcome would have changed but for the agency’s NEPA error—as the most important feature, as it would prevent costly injunctions and remands (when a court sends a decision back to an agency) when a procedural flaw has no decisive effect. Others questioned what “abuse of substantial discretion” means as a legal standard and whether it merely restates the existing “arbitrary and capricious” test.

Some participants supported this policy option in principle but worried that the threshold could be too high and could make it difficult to correct genuine deficiencies in environmental reviews. Overall, the group agreed that the policy option aims to reduce unnecessary litigation and improve predictability, but many emphasized that its effectiveness would depend on how courts interpret and apply the new standard.

Policy Option 15: Prohibit courts from substituting their judgment on environmental effects for that of the agency.

Under NEPA, courts sometimes evaluate not just whether an agency followed proper procedures but whether its conclusions about environmental impacts were reasonable. This review can allow judges to second-guess technical decisions and effectively redo an agency’s analysis. The second-guessing can contribute to uncertainty and inconsistency across jurisdictions. To address this issue, the SPEED Act clarifies that courts may not substitute their own judgment for that of the agency when they review environmental effects.

Participants expressed mixed views on this policy option. Several questioned how courts could determine whether an agency would have reached a different decision (the standard set forth in Policy Option 14 above) without substituting their own judgment—a contradiction between the policy options that one participant described as “impossible to reconcile.” Others felt the language simply restated existing practice, noting that the Supreme Court’s recent Seven Counties decision reaffirmed that NEPA is a procedural statute and that courts may not second-guess an agency’s expert technical judgments so long as the agency has taken a ‘hard look’. A few participants appreciated the intent to limit unnecessary judicial intervention but doubted this language would be effective in doing so, as judges would likely interpret it inconsistently.

Policy Option 16: Limit court remedies to remand with instructions and deadlines (judges could not issue injunctions or vacate permits).

Currently, when courts find a violation under NEPA, they can vacate the permit or issue injunctions while agencies correct deficiencies in their analyses. These remedies can add to project costs even if the judicially determined defect is procedural or would not change the agency’s permitting decision. The SPEED Act would limit courts to remanding a case to the agency with instructions specifying what needs to be fixed in the analysis and a deadline of no more than 180 days. This approach is intended to provide greater project certainty by preventing minor issues from delaying project commencement.

Although many in the room favored the increased use of remand with instructions over injunctions or vacating permits, most participants opposed this policy option as written. Several said that if courts cannot vacate permits or issue injunctions, NEPA would be left without any real enforcement power. Some argued that this remedy might not be sufficient when the bar for court action had been raised to “substantial abuse” by the relevant agency. Others agreed that while lengthy litigation can delay projects, they felt that this approach went beyond what could be supported in a bipartisan deal. Some participants argued that the policy option might help agencies and developers keep projects moving while minor issues are resolved. Overall, participants viewed this as one of the most controversial provisions in the SPEED Act.

Policy Option 17: Shorten the statute of limitations for NEPA challenges to 150 days.

Currently lawsuits challenging NEPA reviews can, in most cases, be filed up to six years after a permit approval. This leaves agencies and developers uncertain long after the review has been completed and a permit issued. The SPEED Act would shorten the statute of limitations for filing NEPA challenges to 150 days after the final agency action.

Every participant agreed with the intent of this policy option and described a three- to six-month window as reasonable. Overall, the consensus was that shortening the statute of limitations would help ensure earlier resolution of disputes and reduce project uncertainty.

Policy Option 18: Restrict standing to parties who submitted substantive, detailed comments during the public comment period.

Under current law, individuals and organizations can file NEPA lawsuits even if they did not participate during the public comment process. The SPEED Act would limit standing to parties that submitted unique, substantive, and detailed comments during the public comment period, raised the same issues in litigation, and can demonstrate direct harm.

Participants generally agreed that linking standing to participation during the public comment process could reduce unnecessary litigation and promote earlier engagement. Many pointed to the Fast-41 permitting framework as precedent for this type of reform but affirmed that the SPEED Act’s version appears more restrictive. Several participants warned that requiring both detailed comments and proof of harm could disadvantage smaller organizations, tribes, or under-resourced communities that lack the capacity to produce highly technical submissions. Others supported the idea in principle but said the timing of public comment opportunities, particularly if limited to the notice of intent stage, could further constrain meaningful participation. Overall, many participants supported the intention of this policy option but agreed that the current language may need to be adjusted to ensure communities can still access judicial review.

Conclusion

To improve the permitting process, roundtable participants agreed on the need to reform NEPA and judicial review. And participants mostly agreed that the SPEED Act’s policy options seek to solve real problems in the current system. Some of these options enjoyed consensus support, but others did not. Most importantly, participants agreed that improvements to NEPA and judicial review are necessary components of a broader permitting reform package that is also likely to include other key policies, such as project certainty and improvements to permitting for transmission and other linear infrastructure.

This roundtable builds on BPC’s ongoing work to develop pragmatic, bipartisan permitting solutions. Following this discussion on the SPEED Act’s NEPA and judicial review provisions, BPC will next convene a roundtable focused on project certainty and predictability, with a focus on the objective of ensuring that all project types are treated fairly and consistently across presidential administrations.",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Judge-Immigration-Backlog.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:00:53.038127

Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals must obtain a permit from the E.P.A.
A 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands.
E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.
These changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.","The Trump administration proposed on Monday to significantly limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit pollution in wetlands, rivers and other bodies of water across the country.

The proposed rule could strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, potentially threatening sources of clean drinking water for millions of Americans. It was a victory for a range of business interests that have lobbied to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, including farmers, home builders, real estate developers, oil drillers and petrochemical manufacturers.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners and governments,” said Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, during an event at the agency’s headquarters in Washington featuring Republican members of Congress and industry executives.

Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals must obtain a permit from the E.P.A. before releasing pollutants into the nation’s waterways. They must receive a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before discharging any dredged or fill material, such as sand, silt or construction debris.

A 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands. In the majority opinion in Sackett v. E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.

But Justice Alito did not explicitly define a “relatively permanent” body of water. Now, the Trump administration is describing it as a body of water that flows either year-round or during the “wet season.”

The new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch many intermittent streams, which do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams, which sit dry for much of the year and fill up only after rainfall or snowmelt.

These changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

“The administration is preparing to rip away protections from the vast majority of wetlands in the United States, which are the waters that protect our communities from floods, help filter drinking water and provide habitat for millions of birds and fish,” said Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president for nature at N.R.D.C.

Ephemeral streams can be small, but a recent study found that they provided about 55 percent of the water flowing through most river systems used in drinking water supplies.

“This rule will mean more unsafe drinking water and more expensive water treatment costs for taxpayers,” said Jim Murphy, senior director of legal advocacy at the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.

The National Association of Home Builders, an industry trade group, praised the Trump administration’s proposal, saying it would slash costs for builders and developers, potentially lowering the price of new homes. “This is a significant step toward reducing regulatory red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country — all while continuing to protect our nation’s vital waterways,” Buddy Hughes, chairman of the association, said in a statement.

Representative Bruce Westerman, Republican of Arkansas and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, said the proposal would help fix a “broken” permitting process in the United States. “We’re losing our ability to build things here in America,” he said at the E.P.A. event.

Ever since Congress passed the Clean Water Act to protect all “waters of the United States,” policymakers in Washington have been squabbling over how, exactly, to define those bodies of water.

In 2015, the Obama administration widened the law’s scope to cover smaller streams and headwaters. Several Republican-led states challenged the rule in court as an example of regulatory overreach, leading a federal judge to pause its implementation.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, the E.P.A. repealed the Obama-era rule and issued a weaker version. Then in 2023 the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. E.P.A., dealing a setback to the Biden administration’s efforts to again strengthen the regulation.

The Sackett case concerned an Idaho couple, Michael and Chantell Sackett, who sought to build a house on what an appeals court called “a soggy residential lot” near a lake. The E.P.A. determined that there were wetlands on the property, and it ordered the couple to stop construction or risk paying fines of more than $40,000 per day.

The Sacketts, represented by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, sued. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that the couple’s 0.63-acre lot — and other properties like it nationwide — was not subject to federal oversight.

“This proposed rule is significant not just for small landowners like the Sacketts, but for all sectors of the regulated community, whether it’s agriculture or home construction or industrial development,” said Damien Schiff, a senior attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation.

After the proposal is published in the Federal Register, the E.P.A. will solicit public comments for 45 days before finalizing the rule.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/08/multimedia/00cli-cleanwater-mkqh/00cli-cleanwater-mkqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:00:57.376217

Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.
“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, Senior Attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance.
“EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country.
Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”","November 17, 2025

Waterkeeper Alliance is sounding the alarm about the newly announced draft rule from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army to revise the definition of the “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), which further undermines landmark clean water protections, threatening water quality across the United States.

By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.

The Clean Water Act has already been severely weakened following the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, in which the Court dramatically revoked protections for thousands of bodies of water across the country. This new draft rule takes these rollbacks even further and follows EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plans earlier this year to revise wastewater regulations for coal-burning power plants, roll back coal ash management regulations, and reconsider the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. He has also withdrawn standards that could have cleaned up water pollution from slaughterhouses, announced plans to weaken PFAS drinking water standards, and ordered the closure of EPA offices responsible for addressing disproportionate pollution in low-income and rural communities and communities of color.

Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, Senior Attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance. “EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country. This isn’t abstract policy, it’s a deliberate decision that disregards the real consequences for people’s health, safety, and daily lives. Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”",https://waterkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-150x150.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:15.188071

“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.”

Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank. It said that Black families were three times more likely to have an overdue balance than white ones, noting that Black and Asian households also had the highest late bills.

“Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance,” The Century Foundation explained.

Late balances for families with well-below-average credit scores increased by 30% during the studied period, the organization added. Those households were disproportionately in urban and low-income neighborhoods, according to the think tank.

“These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation – and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill,” The Century Foundation said. “Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.”

The organization accused the Trump administration of failing to address the root causes of “energy inflation” and hindering the development of renewable energy.

President Donald Trump has targeted renewable energy projects by reducing federal support for them. He has said that sources like wind and solar are unreliable and worse options than oil and gas, which he claims are more beneficial for the economy.

The first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order to protect the country’s “economic and national security” and “military preparedness” by making sure an “abundant” supply of reliable energy was available in every state.

“It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years,” the president said. “It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.”",https://wsbt.com/resources/media/5f1f45d9-e3d0-4bcb-9bca-575bccbe40ee-GettyImages2165132907.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:27.383892

Toyota’s new US battery plant is set for an expansion

The first batteries rolled off the production line at Toyota’s new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, last Wednesday, marking a “pivotal moment” in the automaker’s nearly 70-year history in the US.

Toyota’s new plant houses 14 battery production lines, which will be used to power battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrids (HEVs), and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

At full capacity, the battery plant can produce 30 GWh per year. The plant is phasing in batteries imported from Japan through a joint venture with LG Electronics, which will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, and RAV4 HEV. It also ships hybrid battery modules to its Kentucky assembly plant and to another plant in Alabama, which it co-owns with Mazda.

Toyota’s battery plant is already massive, spanning about 121 football fields, but company executives are saying it will likely be even bigger than expected.

“Our plans are to go 70% electrified by 2030. So obviously that could fuel additional expansion here at the plant,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said during a media briefing on Wednesday (via Triad Business Journal) following a tour of the facility.

Building on its commitment, Toyota announced an additional $10 billion investment over the next five years in electrified mobility.

Toyota didn’t say exactly how it plans to invest the $10 billion, but the new battery plant is likely to see some of it. The battery modules that Toyota produces at the plant vary from hybrid to EV, but the cells are the same, enabling it to adjust based on demand.

It can also adapt to different battery types, which could possibly include solid-state batteries, according to Toyota’s plant president, Don Stewart.

Toyota, which has been one of the biggest laggards in the shift to all-electric vehicles, will continue pushing hybrids as it aims to overcome the new US tariffs.

The plant can supply batteries for around 600,000 hybrid vehicles a year while Toyota builds capacity for another 74,000 PHEVs and 45,000 EVs, including its first three-row electric SUV.

Starting next year, Toyota’s best-selling vehicle, the RAV4, will be sold exclusively as a hybrid. Toyota is also launching several new BEVs, including the C-HR and BZ Woodlands electric SUVs, as well as the 2026 electric Lexus ES.

Electrek’s Take

It’s not a surprise to see Toyota standing by hybrids at this point. What will be interesting is to see how Toyota’s new electric vehicles sell.

After solving many of the issues with its first EV, the bZ4X, will Toyota’s upcoming models sell? Several EVs, like the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and Chevy Equinox EV, have proven that an affordable electric car with enough range and features will sell.

With longer driving ranges, faster charging, and an improved interior and exterior design, Toyota’s upcoming electric vehicles are already a significant upgrade over the outgoing bZ4X. If Toyota sees EV sales improve, we could see production plans at the facility shift once again.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/Toyota-EV-battery-plant-bigger-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:59.558254

The electric vehicle industry's quest for supply chain independence faces ongoing hurdles as Syrah Resources and Tesla navigate their complex graphite supply partnership. The Australian mining company recently announced its second deadline extension in two months, pushing the material qualification timeline to January 16, 2026, highlighting the technical complexities of establishing domestic battery material production. This Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal extension underscores the broader challenges facing critical minerals energy transition as automakers work to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated markets.

This development demonstrates the broader challenges facing critical mineral supply chains as automakers work to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated markets while establishing reliable domestic processing capabilities for electric vehicle batteries.

Understanding the Default Notice and Contractual Timeline Adjustments

Tesla issued a default notice in July 2024 regarding Syrah's alleged failure to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility. The original September 16, 2024 cure date has now been extended twice, first to November 15, 2024, and subsequently to January 16, 2026.

Despite these extensions, Syrah maintains its position that it has not defaulted on the agreement terms. The company stated that while it does not accept being in default under the offtake agreement, both parties agreed to extend the cure date to provide additional time for material qualification.

The technical requirements center on delivering battery-grade active anode material that meets Tesla's specific conformance standards for electric vehicle battery integration. This involves transforming natural graphite from Syrah's Mozambique operations into processed material suitable for lithium-ion battery anodes at the Vidalia facility in Louisiana.

Critical Milestones and Final Qualification Requirements

The contractual framework establishes February 9, 2026 as the ultimate termination trigger date for Tesla. If final qualification of the plant's active anode material is not achieved by this date, Tesla retains the right to terminate the entire offtake agreement.

This creates a narrow window of approximately 24 days between the extended cure date and potential contract termination, indicating limited flexibility for further negotiations if qualification targets are not met. The material testing standards required for electric vehicle battery integration involve complex quality control benchmarks that must demonstrate consistent performance characteristics.

Strategic Importance of Domestic Graphite Supply Development

The partnership between Syrah Resources and Tesla represents a significant strategic initiative to establish domestic battery material production capacity. The 2021 contract commits to supplying 8,000 metric tons of graphite anode materials over a four-year period, translating to approximately 2,000 metric tons annually.

Breaking China's Market Dominance in Battery Materials

Syrah's Vidalia facility holds unique strategic value as the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China. This positioning directly addresses the challenge of Chinese supplies that dominate the global graphite anode market, creating supply chain vulnerabilities for Western electric vehicle manufacturers.

The facility's vertical integration means it combines both raw graphite processing and active anode material production in a single location, providing operational advantages over multi-stage processing arrangements that span different geographic regions. This integration model reduces logistical complexity and provides greater quality control throughout the production process.

Tesla's Multi-Sourcing Approach to Critical Components

Tesla's engagement with Syrah reflects a broader strategy to diversify critical battery component sourcing beyond traditional Chinese suppliers. This approach serves multiple objectives:

Risk mitigation through geographic distribution of suppliers

Supply chain transparency and quality control advantages

Long-term battery cost reduction through competitive sourcing

Alignment with U.S. policy objectives for domestic manufacturing

The partnership also demonstrates Tesla's commitment to supporting the development of domestic critical mineral processing infrastructure, even when technical qualification timelines extend beyond initial projections. Furthermore, companies are increasingly looking toward innovative solutions like the recent battery recycling breakthrough to enhance sustainability across the battery supply chain.

Technical Challenges in Natural Graphite Processing Operations

The transformation from raw graphite to battery-grade anode material involves complex processing requirements that present significant technical hurdles. Syrah must convert natural graphite extracted from its Balama operations in Mozambique into conforming active anode material that meets Tesla's lithium-ion battery specifications.

Complex Processing Requirements for Battery Integration

Active anode material production requires precise control of particle size distribution, surface chemistry, and electrochemical properties. The material must demonstrate consistent performance characteristics including:

Stable capacity retention over charge-discharge cycles

Appropriate electrical conductivity for lithium-ion insertion

Chemical purity standards for battery safety requirements

Structural integrity under operational stress conditions

The repeated deadline extensions suggest these technical specifications are more challenging to achieve consistently at commercial scale than initially anticipated. Quality specifications for lithium-ion battery applications involve stringent testing protocols that verify material performance under various operational conditions.

Geographic Integration Challenges Across Continents

Syrah manages a geographically distributed operation that spans Mozambique mining operations and Louisiana processing facilities. This arrangement requires reliable logistics coordination and quality control across international boundaries, creating additional complexity compared to single-region operations.

The integration between Balama graphite extraction and Vidalia processing involves maintaining material consistency throughout the supply chain, from raw ore extraction through final anode material production. Transportation logistics, quality preservation during shipping, and coordination between facilities on different continents add operational risk factors.

Impact of Operational Disruptions on Supply Chain Reliability

Recent operational challenges have demonstrated the vulnerability of geographically distributed critical mineral supply chains to political and economic instability. Syrah's operations faced significant disruptions in 2024 due to nationwide protests in Mozambique, affecting the Balama graphite extraction facility.

Mozambique Political Instability and Mining Operations

The Balama facility experienced operational disruptions during 2024 nationwide protests in Mozambique, highlighting the political risk factors associated with African mining operations. These disruptions affected raw material supply to the Louisiana processing facility, creating additional challenges for meeting Tesla's material qualification timeline.

To address these operational challenges, Syrah received $8.5 million under its United States International Development Finance Corporation loan facility in November 2024. This disbursement represents partial access to a total $150 million commitment designed to support operational stability at the Balama operations.

Financial Support Mechanisms and Strategic Importance

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's $150 million loan commitment reflects institutional recognition of the strategic importance of Balama operations to U.S. battery supply chain resilience. This government backing demonstrates policy-level support for establishing alternative sources of critical battery materials.

The DFC financing serves multiple purposes:

Providing working capital for sustained mining operations

Supporting operational improvements and expansion capabilities

Demonstrating U.S. government commitment to supply chain diversification

Creating financial incentives for continued Mozambique operations despite political risks

Consequently, this financial support aligns with broader initiatives such as Australia's critical minerals strategic reserve to ensure supply chain security.

Market Implications of Repeated Timeline Extensions

The pattern of deadline extensions creates market uncertainty regarding both Tesla's battery supply planning and Syrah's operational execution capabilities. The progression from September 2024 to January 2026 represents a timeline extension of approximately 16 months beyond the original cure date.

Electric Vehicle Industry Supply Chain Planning

Tesla's battery production planning must account for potential delays or termination of the Syrah supply agreement. If the January 16, 2026 deadline is missed, Tesla faces the loss of a committed 2,000 metric tons annually from its graphite anode material supply planning by February 9, 2026.

This scenario would require Tesla to secure alternative graphite anode sourcing, potentially from Chinese suppliers that the partnership was designed to replace. Alternative sourcing options may involve different technical specifications, pricing structures, or supply chain risk profiles that affect overall battery production costs.

Investor Sentiment and Operational Execution Concerns

The repeated extensions signal to investors that establishing large-scale critical mineral processing facilities involves longer development timelines than initially projected. This pattern may affect investor confidence in similar domestic battery material development projects across the industry.

Market participants are likely monitoring several key factors:

Technical progress indicators from the Vidalia facility

Financial performance of both Balama and Louisiana operations

Alternative partnership opportunities for both companies

Broader industry timeline expectations for new facility qualification

Broader Context for U.S. Battery Manufacturing Independence

The Tesla-Syrah partnership represents part of a larger strategic initiative to establish domestic battery material production capabilities that reduce dependence on Chinese-controlled supply chains. This effort aligns with broader U.S. policy objectives for critical mineral supply security.

Domestic Critical Mineral Processing Development

The Vidalia facility's role as the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China positions it as a critical component of U.S. battery manufacturing infrastructure. Successful qualification would demonstrate the viability of establishing domestic processing capabilities for critical battery materials.

Government policy support through mechanisms like the DFC financing creates favourable conditions for domestic critical mineral development. This support reflects recognition that battery material supply chain independence requires patient capital investment and technical development timelines that exceed typical commercial project horizons.

For instance, similar initiatives in other regions include India's development of a battery-grade lithium refinery to support regional battery production capabilities.

Competitive Positioning in Global Battery Materials

The success or failure of the Tesla-Syrah partnership will influence future domestic battery material development initiatives. Successful qualification would validate the technical and economic viability of establishing U.S.-based anode material production, potentially encouraging additional investment in similar facilities.

Conversely, contract termination would highlight the challenges of competing with established Chinese battery material suppliers and may discourage similar domestic development projects. The outcome carries implications beyond the specific partnership for broader U.S. battery manufacturing competitiveness.

Key Performance Indicators Through Final Deadline

Industry observers and investors should monitor several critical performance indicators leading up to the January 16, 2026 deadline and potential February 9, 2026 termination trigger.

Material Qualification Progress Metrics

This strategic partnership between Australia's Syrah Resources and the electric vehicle giant represents more than a simple contract modification—it's a critical test of whether Western companies can successfully challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. Furthermore, the outcome will likely influence investment decisions across the critical minerals & energy security sector for years to come.

Background of the Strategic Partnership

The collaboration between Syrah Resources and Tesla forms a cornerstone of North America's drive toward battery supply chain independence. This partnership focuses on Syrah's Louisiana-based Vidalia facility, which holds the unique distinction of being the Western Hemisphere's only large-scale, vertically integrated graphite anode material production plant operating outside Chinese control.

Unlike Chinese facilities that benefit from extensive integrated supply ecosystems and lower operational costs, Syrah's facility offers strategic advantages including proximity to North American battery manufacturers, compliance with Western environmental and labour standards, and reduced shipping costs for regional customers. The facility represents a critical test case for establishing competitive graphite processing operations outside China's dominant market position.

The timeline of extensions reveals the complexity of meeting Tesla's stringent qualification requirements. The original September 16, 2025 deadline has undergone two extensions within a two-month period, demonstrating both companies' commitment to resolving technical challenges rather than terminating the strategically important relationship.

Milestone Original Date Current Extended Date Significance Initial Cure Deadline September 16, 2025 January 16, 2026 Final opportunity to address compliance issues First Extension Period N/A November 15, 2025 Initial extension attempt Final Qualification N/A February 9, 2026 Last chance for material certification Contract Volume 4-year period 8,000 metric tonnes Total graphite anode material commitment

The extension structure involves two distinct phases: a cure period ending January 16, 2026, during which Syrah must address alleged compliance deficiencies, and a final qualification phase with a hard deadline of February 9, 2026. Tesla retains contractual termination rights if final qualification is not achieved by the February deadline.

Why Did Tesla Issue a Default Notice Against Syrah?

Tesla's default notification in July 2025 stemmed from technical non-conformity issues rather than contractual breaches related to payment or timeline violations. The automaker determined that Syrah's Louisiana facility failed to deliver active anode material samples that met Tesla's rigorous battery specifications.

This technical hurdle extends beyond simple quality control challenges, highlighting the complex engineering requirements necessary for electric vehicle battery components. The qualification process demands that Syrah's Louisiana-produced graphite demonstrate:

• Consistent electrochemical performance metrics across production batches

• Thermal stability characteristics under battery operating conditions

• Particle size distribution specifications within Tesla's precise tolerances

• Material purity levels that ensure long-term battery reliability and safety

Notably, Syrah disputes being in default under the agreement while simultaneously working with Tesla to extend compliance deadlines. This approach suggests both companies recognise the mutual strategic value of maintaining the partnership despite current technical challenges.

Industry Insight: Active anode material qualification in automotive battery manufacturing typically involves months of testing across multiple performance parameters, making rapid qualification extremely challenging for new suppliers entering established supply chains.

How Does This Extension Impact Tesla's Battery Supply Chain Strategy?

Tesla's partnership with Syrah aligns with broader Western efforts to diversify critical mineral supply chains away from Chinese dominance. Currently, China controls approximately 60% of global graphite processing capacity, making alternative sources like Syrah's Vidalia plant strategically valuable for supply chain resilience.

The 8,000 metric tonnes annual commitment represents a significant portion of Tesla's North American battery production requirements. Successfully qualifying this supply source would provide Tesla with several strategic advantages:

• Enhanced supply chain resilience against geopolitical disruptions

• Reduced dependency on Chinese critical mineral suppliers

• Potential cost advantages through domestic sourcing and shorter logistics chains

• Alignment with U.S. government incentives for domestic critical mineral processing

The arrangement also supports Tesla's broader strategy of vertical integration and supply chain control, particularly crucial as the company scales Model 3 and Model Y production at its North American facilities. However, the technical challenges highlight the difficulties Western companies face in establishing competitive alternatives to established Chinese supply chains, especially considering the US-China trade war impacts on global markets.

What Are the Financial Stakes for Syrah Resources?

The financial implications for Syrah Resources extend far beyond the immediate Tesla contract. The company recently secured $8.5 million from its $150 million United States International Development Finance Corporation loan facility, demonstrating continued government backing for the integrated supply chain strategy.

Financial Impact Analysis:

Metric Amount Significance Recent Capital Injection $8.5 million Immediate operational support Total USIDF Loan Facility $150 million Long-term project financing Estimated Annual Contract Value $40-60 million Based on current market pricing Four-Year Total Revenue Potential $160-240 million Full contract value realisation

The USIDF funding supports both the Louisiana operations and Syrah's Balama graphite mining operations in Mozambique, which experienced significant disruptions during 2024 due to civil unrest. This integrated financing structure underscores the strategic importance U.S. development finance institutions place on establishing Western-controlled critical mineral supply chains.

Stock Market Implications

The extension provides Syrah with breathing room to address technical challenges while maintaining investor confidence in the Tesla partnership's viability. Australian investors closely monitor how this Syrah Tesla graphite supply agreement extension affects the company's market position. Failure to meet the February 2026 deadline could result in significant stock price volatility and force strategic repositioning of the company's North American operations.

The Tesla contract represents more than revenue potential; it provides validation for Syrah's technology and manufacturing capabilities, potentially opening doors to additional North American battery manufacturers seeking supply chain diversification.

How Does Syrah's Vidalia Facility Compare Globally?

Syrah's Louisiana plant occupies a unique position in the global graphite processing landscape as the only large-scale, vertically integrated anode material facility operating outside Chinese control in the Western Hemisphere.

Facility Specifications and Capabilities:

• Processing Capacity: Designed for 18,000 tonnes annual production at full capacity

• Integration Level: Complete processing from natural graphite to battery-ready anode material

• Quality Systems: Automotive-grade quality control and certification capabilities

• Current Utilisation: Approximately 44% of design capacity based on Tesla commitment

This positioning creates both significant competitive advantages and operational challenges. Unlike Chinese facilities that benefit from integrated supply chains and economies of scale, Syrah's facility offers proximity to North American markets and compliance with Western regulatory standards.

Competitive Landscape Analysis

The facility's success or failure will likely influence future investment decisions in critical mineral processing facilities outside China. Success could validate the viability of establishing competitive graphite processing operations in North America, particularly as EVs transforming mining operations globally demand secure supply chains.

Chinese competitors typically benefit from established supplier networks, lower labour costs, and integrated supply chain ecosystems that provide significant cost advantages. Syrah must overcome these structural disadvantages through technological innovation, supply chain efficiency, and strategic customer relationships like the Tesla partnership.

What Are the Broader Industry Implications?

The Syrah Tesla graphite supply agreement extension represents far more than a simple contract modification. It embodies the challenges and opportunities facing Western efforts to establish independent battery material supply chains in an industry dominated by Chinese suppliers.

Critical Minerals Strategy Impact

The partnership serves as a real-world test of whether Western companies can successfully challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. The technical requirements, capital investments, and qualification timelines demonstrate the complexity of establishing alternative supply sources, especially as Australia's critical minerals reserve becomes increasingly important for global supply security.

Electric Vehicle Supply Chain Security

Success would encourage additional investment in non-Chinese graphite processing facilities, potentially creating a template for other Western companies seeking to establish independent critical mineral supply chains. Government development finance institutions and private investors are closely watching the outcome.

The extension reflects broader industry challenges including:

• Technical complexity of achieving automotive-grade material specifications

• Capital intensity required for establishing competitive processing facilities

• Time requirements for qualification processes in established supply chains

• Economic viability questions for Western-based critical mineral processing

What Happens If Syrah Meets the February 2026 Deadline?

Successful qualification by February 9, 2026 would enable Syrah to transition from pre-commercial testing to commercial production shipments under the 2021 agreement. This milestone would validate multiple strategic assumptions about Western battery material supply chain development.

Commercial Production Pathway

Meeting the deadline would trigger several positive outcomes for both companies:

• Immediate production ramp-up to contracted 8,000 tonne annual volumes

• Validation of facility capabilities for automotive-grade anode material production

• Potential contract expansion beyond initial volume commitments

• Market credibility for Syrah with other North American battery manufacturers

Industry Precedent Setting

Success could establish a template for other Western companies seeking to challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. The validation would likely attract additional government support and private investment for similar projects across North America and Europe.

The achievement would demonstrate that Western facilities can compete technically with Chinese suppliers, potentially reshaping investment flows in critical mineral processing infrastructure globally. Furthermore, the success could complement recent developments such as the Chinese battery recycling breakthrough by creating a more balanced global supply ecosystem.

What Are the Risks If the Deadline Is Missed?

Tesla retains contractual termination rights if final qualification is not achieved by February 9, 2026. This scenario would force Syrah to reassess the Vidalia facility's commercial viability and seek alternative market strategies.

Contract Termination Consequences

Failure to meet the deadline would result in several immediate challenges:

• Loss of anchor customer representing significant revenue potential

• Facility underutilisation with only 44% capacity currently committed

• Potential covenant violations on the $150 million USIDF loan facility

• Market credibility damage affecting relationships with other potential customers

Strategic Alternatives

Even with Tesla termination, Syrah could pursue alternative strategies including:

• Secondary battery manufacturers with potentially less stringent specifications

• Industrial applications for graphite anode materials

• Export markets leveraging the facility's strategic location

• Facility restructuring to reduce fixed costs and improve economic viability

However, these alternatives would likely operate at lower pricing and volume levels than the Tesla contract originally offered, potentially undermining the facility's long-term economic sustainability.

Market Psychology and Investment Implications

The Syrah Tesla graphite supply agreement extension reflects broader market psychology around critical mineral supply chain independence. Investors and policymakers are grappling with the trade-offs between supply chain security and economic efficiency in battery material sourcing.

Investment Strategy Considerations

The partnership outcome will likely influence investment flows in several areas:

• Western critical mineral processing facilities seeking to establish Chinese alternatives

• Government development finance for strategic supply chain initiatives

• Private equity interest in critical mineral supply chain companies

• Automotive manufacturer supply chain diversification strategies

Market participants are viewing this as a bellwether for whether Western economies can successfully establish competitive alternatives to Chinese critical mineral suppliers without significant cost premiums or performance trade-offs.

Geological and Technical Factors

The technical challenges facing Syrah highlight the complexity of graphite anode material production for automotive applications. Unlike consumer electronics batteries, automotive batteries require extremely consistent performance characteristics across temperature ranges, charging cycles, and operational conditions.

Material Quality Requirements

Automotive-grade anode materials must demonstrate:

• Particle morphology consistency affecting battery packing density

• Surface area optimisation for electrochemical performance

• Impurity control at parts-per-million levels

• Thermal expansion characteristics matching battery cell design parameters

These requirements explain why qualification processes typically require months of testing and why established suppliers like those in China maintain competitive advantages through years of production experience and process optimisation.

Conclusion: A Critical Test for Supply Chain Independence

The extended deadline between Syrah and Tesla represents more than a contract modification; it embodies the fundamental challenges facing Western efforts to establish independent battery material supply chains. The outcome will likely influence investment decisions, government policies, and strategic planning across the critical minerals sector for years to come.

Success would validate the viability of establishing competitive graphite processing operations outside China, potentially triggering increased investment in Western critical mineral processing infrastructure. It would demonstrate that technical excellence, strategic partnerships, and government support can overcome Chinese cost advantages and established supply chain networks.

Failure, however, might reinforce the narrative that Chinese suppliers maintain insurmountable advantages in critical mineral processing, potentially discouraging future Western investment in alternative supply chains and strengthening Chinese market position.

The February 9, 2026 deadline thus represents a crucial inflection point not just for Syrah and Tesla, but for the broader Western strategy of reducing dependence on Chinese critical mineral suppliers in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle market.

The Oak Park-based startup, which promised in 2023 to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in metro Detroit, is in default of its incentives agreement with the Michigan Economic Development Corp. The company was awarded $3 million by the state to help launch its Class 4 EV and has collected about a third of the cash.

Like many other EV startups that failed to launch, Bollinger’s business case has run into major hurdles, including falling demand for its pricey vehicles following the pullback of federal EV incentives.

As of Sept. 30, Bollinger had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, MEDC spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said. The company has laid off employees since then, Crain’s confirmed, though it is unclear how many.

Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

Bollinger has until May 4 to cure the default by reaching job milestones and “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if it fails to do so, Emerson said.

At the same time, the company is under investigation by the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, which has received 59 claims against the company about unpaid wages or benefits, department spokesperson Keely Lovern said.

“Those claims are still open and under investigation,” Lovern said. “Because they are open investigations, we cannot comment any further.”

Bollinger Motors was put into receivership in June when founder Robert Bollinger sued the company to recoup a loan and alleged the company was broke. David Michery, CEO and chairman of Brea, Calif.-based Mullen Automotive, which acquired a controlling stake in Bollinger in 2022, paid the founder back and promised to do the same for suppliers.

After emerging from receivership, Michery merged Bollinger Motors with Mullen to create Bollinger Innovations and consolidated operations to metro Detroit. He struck a resilient note during an interview in June, vowing that Bollinger Motors was here to stay.

A half-dozen suppliers sued Bollinger earlier this year, demanding payment of more than $5 million in outstanding bills, Crain’s reported in July. Those cases have since been disposed, but six different suppliers are now suing the company in active cases, according to Oakland County Circuit Court records.

Canadian supplier Promark Electronics Inc., German supplier Thyssenkrupp AG, Brazilian supplier Metalsa, Livonia-based Testron Corp., Troy-based Engineering Technology Associates Inc. and California-based Aibond Corp. are the plaintiffs in those cases.

Bollinger Innovations was delisted from the Nasdaq a month ago after failing to meet its market value requirements. Michery tried to remain in compliance by conducting nine reverse stock splits in three years, but its share value continually fell below the $1 minimum. The company is trading stock on the open markets at 13 cents per share as of Monday afternoon.

The company incurred a net loss of $304.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, according to the most recent financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. Its accumulated deficit at the time was $2.6 billion.

“The Company believes that its available liquidity will not be sufficient to meet its current obligations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of the filing of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements,” the August filing said. “Accordingly, the Company has concluded there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/bollinger%20trucks.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:32.238515

MESA, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the results of a new survey of 2,000 Americans who regularly use toll roads.

The survey examined Americans' perceptions of the various programs that fund roads and infrastructure.

The survey results can be downloaded by visiting www.verramobility.com/survey-ruc-road-usage-charging-toll-roads.

One of the main sources of funds to improve roads and bridges in the U.S. since 1932 has been the federal gas tax, which currently adds 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. Since the rise in electric vehicle (EV) sales, the gas tax revenue has been slowly declining. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Petroleum Association reported an estimated drop in state gas tax revenue of $250 million when comparing 2024 to 2019.

The survey found:

Americans believe that roads are in need of improvements, with 93% of survey respondents stating that the infrastructure in their state needs to be improved.

When asked what they believed was the best way to recoup these funds, 73% of Americans answered that EV owners should have to pay an 'energy tax'.

""The U.S. is experiencing a fundamental shift in how we fund infrastructure improvements and expansions,"" said Stacey Moser, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Verra Mobility's Commercial Services business. ""Toll roads, and more recently, initiatives like New York City's congestion pricing program, have demonstrated that user-based funding models can be highly effective. These models generate reliable revenue but also offer drivers faster, safer and more reliable travel.""

One alternative is toll roads, which are currently utilized in many U.S. states. The U.S. tolling market was valued at approximately $12.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $18.6 billion by 2030.

The study asked several questions on Americans' perceptions of toll roads, finding that:

67% of respondents said they believed toll roads were fairer than taxes

76% believed paying tolls is acceptable if the revenue is being used to improve the quality and safety of roads and bridges

72% believe everyone should pay the same for toll roads

75% believe that tolls should be the same regardless of time of day

65% said they would be more willing to pay tolls if they knew revenue was dedicated to infrastructure projects that directly benefited them

67% believe tolls should go away once a project is paid for

When asked directly if they were generally in favor of toll roads as a way to fund transportation projects, 51% were in favor, 30% were neutral and 20% were against. These numbers were slightly more favorable than when asked about other road use pricing models:

41% were in favor of road usage charging, with 33% being neutral and 25% against

41% were in favor of congestion pricing, with 31% being neutral and 28% against

""This evolution will have a significant impact on drivers and, even more so, on fleet operators, who must navigate a complex network of tolling authorities and payment schemes while staying compliant,"" continued Moser. ""As one of the largest payers of tolls in the country, Verra Mobility has a unique perspective on how these programs are rolled out and scaled. With many new funding models now emerging to address the decline in traditional gas tax revenues, we wanted to better understand how Americans view these changes, and this survey provides important insight into public sentiment.""

For more than 15 years, Verra Mobility has helped fleet owners and operators manage toll payments quickly and easily. Each year, the company processes over 300 million tolls and violations for more than seven million vehicles worldwide. By automatically paying tolls and preventing costly fines, Verra Mobility helps drivers stay on the move while saving businesses time and money. Its technology connects each toll to the right vehicle and driver, ensuring accurate, reliable billing and seamless travel across a growing network of toll roads.

Survey Methodology The data was derived from a survey by Verra Mobility conducted online via Pollfish on June 25, 2025. Two thousand Americans who reside in states that utilize toll roads were surveyed to ensure more awareness on alternative means of raising funds for road projects. The states included were California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.

The Just Transition Work Programme

The Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP) was established by the UN in 2022 as a response to long-standing calls to ensure that climate action is fair, inclusive, and equitable. Negotiators at COP30 have a chance to ensure the JTWP becomes a vehicle for real justice — one that does not simply describe a just transition but creates the systems and rules needed to deliver it.

The UNFCCC — the governing body of the international climate treaty — is the umbrella that allows countries to negotiate climate rules, commitments, and cooperation. These negotiations follow a mostly consensus-based model, meaning every Party must agree before a decision is adopted. This process is often slow, complex, and frustrating, but it is intended to ensure equity among countries with vastly different histories, responsibilities, and capacities.

The work on the Just Transition Work Programme is happening through an informal working group, or “contact group,” where negotiators review draft text line by line. Here, countries propose edits and attempt to find compromise text that all can accept. It is inside these rooms that the fate of the Just Transition Work Programme is being shaped, to determine whether it will remain a space for dialogue or evolve into a structure capable of delivering coordinated action, support, and resources that help foster a truly just transition.

For these discussions to have real impact, COP30 must move the JTWP from conversation to implementation. That means establishing a dedicated mechanism that ensures the principles agreed under the JTWP are carried forward, monitored, and enforced in future UNFCCC processes.

Earthworks is advocating for some key pieces to be included:

Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent

Indigenous Peoples must be at the forefront of solutions to the climate crisis. On Saturday, we saw Indigenous Peoples march through the streets of Belem carrying banners and signs reading “We are the answer.” The JTWP provides an opportunity to safeguard Indigenous Peoples’ rights.

Activities under the JTWP must fully respect Indigenous Peoples’ right to self-determination and the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as established in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. FPIC means Indigenous Peoples have the right to say no, yes, or yes with conditions to projects on their lands and territories. The JTWP must include a mechanism to ensure those commitments are upheld.

The JTWP must also include mechanisms protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation and Initial Contact, such as the precautionary principle and the principle of no contact. Mining and other energy transition activities threaten the lands, health, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Insolation.

“Critical Minerals” Mining and Processing

The JTWP must include language that recognizes the impacts of so-called critical minerals. Minerals for batteries and other cleaner energy technologies are in demand. But mining and processing those minerals is causing harm to the environment and to frontline and Indigenous communities across the globe, from Brazil to Indonesia.

These risks were underscored in the principles and recommendations outlined in the report of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals, which recognized that social and environmental impacts of mining for minerals have to be addressed in order to have a truly just transition to a green economy. This includes the protection of human and labor rights, the assurance of FPIC, establishing ecological no-go zones; and a shift toward true circularity. The JTWP must establish mechanisms that ensure reliable, diversified, sustainable, transparent, and responsible supply chains.",https://earthworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/climatemarch1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:46.219824

Domestic capacity remains one of the most critical barriers in U.S. biomanufacturing.
By providing pilot-to-demonstration infrastructure within the U.S., BioMADE aims to reduce those risks and strengthen national supply chain security.
Wendy Wintersteen, President of Iowa State University, noted that the university’s technical expertise and existing research programs will help speed commercialization, shared, “Iowa State excels at biobased innovations.
A National Network to Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience The Iowa pilot plant is one of the first three sites in BioMADE’s emerging Pilot Plant Network, alongside projects in Minnesota and California.","BioMADE, the State of Iowa, Iowa State University (ISU), and the Iowa State University Research Park have broken ground on a pilot-scale bioindustrial manufacturing facility designed to close one of the most significant infrastructure gaps in the U.S. bioeconomy. The 15,000 sq. ft. facility—scheduled to open in 2027—will provide domestic scale-up capacity for companies developing biobased chemicals, fuels, materials, and consumer products. The investment aims to strengthen U.S. manufacturing competitiveness while creating new revenue opportunities for farmers across the Midwest.

Governor Kim Reynolds emphasized the strategic importance of the project, noting that the facility will support both commercial and defense-focused scale-up efforts.

“This facility provides innovators the space and equipment to test, scale, and bring new ideas to life—ideas that will give our military servicemembers the materials they need to keep us safe.""

The governor added that the site will help bring manufacturing back to the United States, particularly for bio-based fabrics, adhesives, plastics, and other materials that rely on Iowa-grown crops.

Accelerating Domestic Scale-Up and Reducing Overseas Dependence

The facility’s pilot-scale capabilities include 5,000- and 10,000-liter industrial fermenters, wet and dry lab space, and downstream processing equipment. These assets will support the development of a broad range of bioproducts—spanning agricultural feed inputs, industrial chemicals, plant-based ingredients, and sustainable materials. The site will also complement existing Iowa assets, such as the ISU Center for Crops Utilization Research.

Domestic capacity remains one of the most critical barriers in U.S. biomanufacturing. Many companies still rely on overseas facilities to scale production, increasing the risk of intellectual property loss and prolonging commercialization timelines. By providing pilot-to-demonstration infrastructure within the U.S., BioMADE aims to reduce those risks and strengthen national supply chain security.

Michael Holthe, performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of War for Science and Technology, underscored the national security implications, stating,

“The BioMADE Pilot Plant in Iowa is a prime example of their impact and will be vital for our nation’s long-term national and economic security.” .

Creating New Markets for American Agriculture

Iowa’s agricultural strengths make it uniquely positioned for this type of infrastructure. The state is a major producer of corn, soybeans, and sugar beets—feedstocks that can be converted into biobased fuels, lubricants, composites, thermal protection materials, foams, detergents, coatings, and a growing range of consumer products.

Wendy Wintersteen, President of Iowa State University, noted that the university’s technical expertise and existing research programs will help speed commercialization, shared,

“Iowa State excels at biobased innovations. Our cutting-edge expertise and infrastructure will help BioMADE advance the U.S. as a global leader in biomanufacturing.”

The expansion of bioprocessing capacity is expected to generate new revenue streams for farmers and rural communities. Similar initiatives in the Midwest have shown that integrating crop production directly into biomanufacturing supply chains enhances local economic resilience and reduces dependency on volatile export markets.

A National Network to Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience

The Iowa pilot plant is one of the first three sites in BioMADE’s emerging Pilot Plant Network, alongside projects in Minnesota and California. The network is intended to create a distributed, scalable set of industrial fermentation and processing hubs that can support U.S.-based production from early development through commercial demonstration.

BioMADE has committed at least $20 million to the Iowa project, with ISU contributing up to $10 million and the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) providing an additional $10 million through its Strategic Infrastructure Program. IEDA Director Debi Durham described the facility as the “missing piece” of Iowa’s biomanufacturing ecosystem, enabling the critical bridge between research and industrial-scale production.

Douglas Friedman, BioMADE CEO, stated that the project represents a foundational investment in U.S. competitiveness. “This Pilot Plant joins a network of forthcoming facilities that will establish the U.S. as a leader in the global bioeconomy,” he said.

Positioning the U.S. for the Twenty-First Century Bioeconomy

The expansion of U.S. biomanufacturing infrastructure aligns with broader national objectives around supply-chain resilience, reshoring, and low-carbon industrial development. Studies from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Academies have repeatedly highlighted the economic potential of bioindustrial production, especially in industries such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), performance materials, and biobased polymers.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251117-092053-a0b-Combine%20Harvester%20in%20an%20Agricultural%20Field.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:26.073224

The government funds would take care of their installation costs, and once installed, lower the burden of rising electricity costs, a pressing concern.

Then, Praileau heard the federal government had scrapped the $7bn Solar For All programme through which his project and other solar projects across the country were to be funded, leaving them stranded.

It is one of several federally funded renewable energy projects that have been scrapped or will end early, veering off the country’s planned shift to renewable energy, also making it harder to meet climate goals.

Praileau, Virginia programme director for Solar United Neighbors, had been helping roll out the project that received $156m in federal funds to support 7,500 low- and middle-income families with solar installation. Praileau say he was “mind blown” by the sudden withdrawal.

The federal government will also end the 30 percent tax credit for solar rooftop installation in homes this December. For businesses, these tax credits will only be available if they start construction of factories, malls or other businesses, for which the solar installations are meant, by June 2026.

The Department of Energy also withdrew $13bn in funding from a range of other renewable energy projects, including upgrading power grids, carbon-neutral cement production, and battery energy storage. The administration also ended several funding initiatives for wind energy.

President Trump has said, “We’re not going to be approving windmills unless something happens that’s an emergency.”

This could lead to a $114bn loss in delays or cancellation of wind energy projects, according to an April 2025 report by BloombergNEF.

In Florida, intake forms for 10,000 low- and middle-income households to enrol for federal subsidies to get solar units installed on their rooftops were ready when the $156m project was scrapped in August.

A resident of Miami-Dade County had told volunteers who were helping her fill in the forms to enrol for the grant that she was “scared to use power. I am scared to put on air conditioning”, because the steep rise in power costs in the state had put it out of reach for her.

Power costs in the state are up 60 percent for some residents since 2019, Heaven Campbell, Florida programme director of Solar United Neighbors, which was working on implementing the project, told Al Jazeera.

Other states have also seen varying power cost hikes due to hurricanes and the war in Ukraine, which made Russian natural gas more expensive.

Florida Power and Light, the utilities provider, has also currently made a case to increase rates further to raise nearly $10bn over the next four years, according to Florida’s Office of Public Counsel.

Solar United’s staff has tried to educate residents that not using power could get them disconnected, and reconnecting comes with a fee.

Early ending of the tax credit will mean “consumers are stuck at the mercy of utilities”, and their rising rates, says Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group.

‘Rain shadow impact’

With the solar rooftop tax credits set to expire in December, there has been a scramble to install, and some solar installers say they are having to turn away customers.

“We will see the rain shadow impact of this in 2026,” Del Chiaro says, referring to a sharp drop in business and jobs that the industry is steeling itself for next year.

“This is a big plunge on the solar coaster,” says Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Cinnamon Energy Systems, a San Francisco-based solar installation company.

Ed Murray, president of the California Solar and Storage Association, told Al Jazeera he expects the elimination of tax credits to double the payback time for installation and other costs associated with the solar units to up to 12 years.

It would also lead to job losses for thousands of skilled workers in the sector, Murray said, even as the air quality is likely to worsen and the state is expected to fail to meet its climate goals.

In its announcement withdrawing from these projects, the Department of Energy notification said the projects “advance the previous Administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda”.

In the statement, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that, “By returning these funds to the American taxpayer, the Trump administration is affirming its commitment to advancing more affordable, reliable and secure American energy and being more responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Critics of solar projects have said they drive up costs for households still on the power grid because solar customers pay less to utilities but still use that power when needed.

The Trump administration has, instead, supported oil and gas production through several measures, including plans to open up the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas leasing recently. It has also eased permitting for drilling on federal lands.

Rising costs

The Biden administration had funded renewable energy projects under what it called the Green New Deal, a programme to accelerate economic growth and job creation while having a positive climate impact.

But even as these projects began rolling out, power costs have risen sharply in many states, including Virginia.

A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the rise in power costs had outpaced inflation in 26 states and listed a range of factors for it, including the Ukraine war and extreme weather factors such as wildfires and hurricanes that have damaged an already ageing electric poles and grid.

For instance, prices in California have risen more than 34 percent since 2019, the study says, in part because the record-breaking wildfires forced utilities to replace and strengthen their power lines. Federal funding of $630m to strengthen grids in California was among the projects scrapped by the Department of Energy.

“A majority of the projects that were scrapped were mid-implementation,” says Ryan Schleeter, communications director of The Climate Center, a California-based think tank.

Federal incentives also meant that more than 20 percent of the cars sold in the state over the last two years had been electric vehicles (EVs). These allowed middle-income families to buy EVs, Schleeter says. With incentives having ended on September 30, “the central challenge will be how to be equitable,” he says.

Susan Stephenson, executive director of California Power and Light, which supports places of worship to have renewable energy, says several places of worship that had planned to move to solar energy or install EV charging stations are now struggling to find installers and have seen costs going up beyond their initial budget due to federal cuts.

In Virginia, Praileau says power costs came up as one of the greatest concerns in his interactions with his congregants. The state has among the most data centres in the country, and Praileau believes that could be a reason for rising costs.

Voter dissatisfaction over rising power costs has been among the top issues in the governor’s elections in the state that went to the polls on November 4. One of the promises that Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat candidate who won, had made was to reduce power costs by increasing energy production and getting data centres to pay a higher share of power costs.

Praileau hopes the solar project, the cuts to which are already being litigated, can also be revived by the new governor. In Florida, too, there is ongoing litigation on the federal funding cuts.

Several states, including California, have announced their own rollbacks on renewable energy incentives.

But with funding withdrawals hurting residents, Steve Larson, a former executive director of the California Public Utilities Commission, expects more litigation to restore programmes and mastering “techniques of delay”, for federal cuts in grants and to allow renewable energy projects to keep going.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP23224651571332-1763402452.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:45.516166

Case in point: progressive darling Graham Platner is running strong against Janet Mills for the Maine Senate Democratic nomination.
The starkness of this challenge is underscored by the difficulties of being truly moderate in today’s Democratic Party.
Abigail Spanberger is a moderate within the current Democratic Party, but she is not a moderate from the perspective of 1998.
Most want strong public schools and the flexibility to choose which school their children attend… [Trump’s] extremism offers an opportunity to the Democratic Party.","The Democrats have a new mantra: “affordability.” It played a starring role in Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia and in the surprising mayoral victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City. By all accounts, this was an effective message even controlling for other factors like the light blue to deep blue nature of these states and municipalities, the overrepresentation of Democratic-friendly educated, engaged voters in these elections, and the general unpopularity of President Trump.

Affordability is an area of deep vulnerability for Trump and his party since they promised to fix Biden and the Democrats’ mismanagement of the economy and are not viewed as having done so. According to Silver Bulletin’s polling aggregates, Trump’s handling of the economy is 18 points underwater (approval minus disapproval) and an astonishing 28 points underwater on handling inflation (34 percent approval vs. 62 percent disapproval). Other data show that general views of the economy have not improved since Trump took office, that most believe Trump’s policies are actually making the economy worse and that more see the economy getting worse rather than better in the coming year.

In such a situation, it would be political malpractice not to focus on this vulnerability, neatly encapsulated in the term “affordability.” Everything just costs too damn much! Democrats have taken to this approach delightedly, whether moderate or fire-breathing progressive. It provides a convenient way of changing the subject when other issues, particularly cultural ones, come up where their views are decidedly less popular. Pay no attention to those other issues: we Democrats are affordability people!

Will this work? Well, it did in 2025. Indeed, it worked so well that one Democratic commentator declared it a new “theory of everything” for the Democrats and there has been general euphoria that—finally!—a way has been found to neutralize the toxic image the party has developed over time. In short, Democrats hope to affordability-wash their party brand and be reborn as a party that cares for little beyond making ordinary citizens’ lives easier and better. But can the Democrats really wash away their political sins so easily?

There are reasons to be skeptical that affordability, despite its utility as a campaign trope, has such magical powers. Start with the ongoing struggle between moderates and progressives within the party. Their differences were temporarily suppressed during the 2025 campaigns, where everyone latched onto the affordability message, but in the aftermath these differences are coming to the fore. Mamdani’s victory in New York City has put wind in the sails of the good ship Progressive; now is not the time they say to bow “at the altar of caution.” Such candidates are running hard to the left in many Democratic primaries and Democrats could well find themselves with their own version of Republicans’ Tea Party problem from the early 2010’s where insurgents undermined GOP electoral fortunes.

Case in point: progressive darling Graham Platner is running strong against Janet Mills for the Maine Senate Democratic nomination. In past social media posts, Platner referred to himself as a communist, disparaged the police, and criticized Maine’s rural white people for being “stupid” and “racist.” And then there’s his “Totenkopf” tattoo historically associated with the Nazis. Not ideal; recent polling indicates that with this baggage Republican Susan Collins would easily vanquish him in a general election.

After balanced information about Platner, he trails Collins significantly. After a positive paragraph reflective of Platner’s bio and current campaign messaging, and a negative paragraph summarizing the recent news about him and reflecting likely Republican messaging in a general election, Collins gets above 50 percent and Platner trails her by 9 (42 percent Platner / 51 percent Collins)—the same margin by which Democrats lost the 2020 Maine Senate race.

Without flipping Collins’ seat, Democrats’ chances of taking back the Senate are extremely small. In general, Democrats are in desperate need of moderate candidates who can overcome, rather than reinforce, the negative weight of the party’s image—an image which cannot be magically affordability-washed away in purple-to-red states. This imperative is underscored by this chart from Lakshya Jain on how Democrats would do in Senate contests outside of Maine and North Carolina even if 2026 is a 2018-type blue wave (D+7.3) election.

The starkness of this challenge is underscored by the difficulties of being truly moderate in today’s Democratic Party. As liberal Ezra Klein admitted, apropos of the 2025 results:

If Democrats want power in the Senate in any significant numbers ever again, they’re going to need to be competitive in places where they used to be able to win elections. Places like Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and Alaska. But they’ve not really been competitive there for some time.

So I don’t know how much I think this was a positive test of that…Abigail Spanberger is a moderate in Virginia and Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist in New York City…But also by any historical measure of politics, they’re actually just not that far apart. Abigail Spanberger is a moderate within the current Democratic Party, but she is not a moderate from the perspective of 1998.

The thing about all three of these figures is that none of them challenge Democrats in any significant way, except maybe Mamdani, from the left…I don’t think the question of what you would need to do to win an election in Ohio, Florida and Iowa is answered yet.

Indeed not. The fact of the matter is that Democrats can’t just sprinkle affordability pixie dust over their candidates—they actually need to move their left-trending party to the right in important ways. As noted in the big New York Times feature on “Moving to the Center Is the Way to Win”:

The success of candidates like [Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who successfully defended her House seat in a district that Trump won easily] demonstrates that America still has a political center. Polls show that most voters prefer capitalism to socialism and worry that the government is too big—and also think that corporations and the wealthy have too much power. Most voters oppose both the cruel immigration enforcement of the Trump administration and the lax Biden policies that led to a record immigration surge. Most favor robust policing to combat crime and recoil at police brutality. Most favor widespread abortion access and some restrictions late in pregnancy. Most oppose race-based affirmative action and support class-based affirmative action. Most support job protections for trans people and believe that trans girls should not play girls’ sports. Most want strong public schools and the flexibility to choose which school their children attend…

[Trump’s] extremism offers an opportunity to the Democratic Party. Mr. Trump is governing in ways that put the Republican Party out of step with public opinion on taxes, health insurance, abortion, immigration, executive power and more. If Democrats were willing to be less ideological—less beholden to views that many liberal activists, intellectuals and donors genuinely hold but that most Americans do not—they would have the opportunity to build the country’s next governing majority.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXFF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ae75d0-c329-46b6-824c-c820640fedd1_1100x220.jpeg",N,,2025-11-17 14:04:14.812366

Big bets on building, acquiring gas

NRG Energy expects to announce a data center agreement in 2026 associated with new natural gas development in its partnership with GE Vernova and Kiewit, the company’s CEO, Lawrence Coben, said in a Nov. 6 earnings call.

The first step of that joint venture is to start work on four gas projects totaling around 5.4 GW for the ERCOT and PJM markets. During the call, Coben said a data center agreement is set to be announced sometime next year, but he declined to pin down an exact month or quarter for the announcement.

“As far as [GE Vernova] goes, in this Kiewit partnership, did you have a certain time frame that you need to move some of this equipment — use it or lose it, if you will?” asked Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Coben said the company hasn’t disclosed a time frame yet, but added, “I’m very confident that we’re going to meet all of the timelines that are required under that agreement.”

NRG, GE Vernova and Kiewit plan to have 1.2 GW of combined-cycle gas turbines in service by 2029, another 1.2 GW in service by 2030, and an additional 3 GW brought online from 2030 to 2032. Development activities are in progress across all sites, the company said.

NRG is also anticipating the closure of its deal to acquire 19 GW of assets from LS Power in the first quarter next year for roughly $12 billion. The assets include a demand-response company and around 12.9 GW of gas-fired power plant capacity. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the plan on Friday.

On the call, NRG also provided updates on resources it is developing in Texas. In September, NRG “entered into a $562 million loan agreement with the Public Utility Commission of Texas ... for a low-interest rate loan at 3%” to support development of the 689-MW Cedar Bayou generation facility, the company said.

In response to an analyst question about NRG’s priorities within PJM, as opposed to ERCOT, Coben said the company “will really accelerate those efforts, of course, once [the LS acquisition] closes. Because once we own the generation assets there, that will really vault us into being a significant player. But there is no grass growing under our feet there in the meantime.”

Across PJM and ERCOT, NRG has expanded its data center customer portfolio with “150 MW of new premium long-term power agreements, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 MW,” Coben said.

Coben noted that total electricity consumption in Texas has increased “nearly 30% over the past five years, driven by residential, commercial and industrial demand, as electrification and onshoring of manufacturing accelerate. Data center development usage remains early, with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/vS3lpRxxYrc3eJ8ZesMJg4ICC_DxYstg5ZJ_9wghHFI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9OUkdfSm9saWV0X1Bvd2VyX1N0YXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:34.328515

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hamm Institute for American Energy's American Energy + AI Initiative, along with the National Center of Energy Analytics and the CGCN Group's American Energy + AI Coalition, today announced the outcomes of the American Energy + AI DC Summit.

The working session brought together U.S. cabinet officials, senior industry executives, investors and policy experts to examine how the United States can add enough firm power, on near-term timelines, to meet rapidly rising AI-driven demand. The event was held at GE Vernova's Washington, D.C. office.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Kate MacGregor provided a briefing on current efforts and remaining gaps.

They participated in the discussion as part of the administration's focus on modernizing federal tools at the Department of Energy and Department of the Interior to support increased power production, transmission buildout, and smarter use of federal lands and emergency authorities.

Through its American Energy + AI Initiative, the Hamm Institute has spent the past year commissioning new research on how to power AI with firm energy, translating that work into policy-ready insights, and hosting working sessions from Oklahoma City to Palo Alto to bring industry, policymakers and investors into alignment around near-term solutions.

""America's ability to lead in AI will depend on whether we can build enough firm power, fast. The Hamm Institute's American Energy + AI Initiative exists to turn convenings like the Summit into steel in the ground, projects underway, and a clear research-backed roadmap that industry and policymakers can use,"" said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, PhD, executive director of the Hamm Institute for American Energy.

As the non-political partner, the Hamm Institute is leading the convening. In contrast, the American Energy + AI Coalition, led by CGCN, is focused on the policy, legislative and regulatory roadmap required to translate those findings.

""This was yet another productive session by the leaders of the Hamm Institute. Through extensive outreach and dialogue, they are developing concrete, meaningful policy reforms to help advance the power and AI goals shared by the electricity and technology sectors, as well as the Trump administration,"" said Mike Catanzaro, CEO of CGCN Group and executive director of the American Energy + AI Coalition. ""Many thanks to Secretary Wright and Deputy Secretary MacGregor for their participation today and their effective leadership on this critically important issue for the nation.""

The Hamm Institute for American Energy commissioned a new study from Mark P. Mills, executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and distinguished fellow at the Hamm Institute, titled The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts. The report analyzes how surging AI deployment is reshaping U.S. electricity demand and the broader economy and outlines the scale of new firm power required for America to stay competitive. Mills, who testified on AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025, shared key implications for policymakers during the Summit.

""Forecasters, pundits, and policymakers have all been surprised, even shocked, by the magnitude and speed of electricity demand emerging to power AI and the hundreds of billions of dollars of data centers under construction and planned,"" said Mills. ""The economic and strategic importance of the AI race sidelines the idea of an energy transition and highlights the old 'all-of-the-above' approach, especially the immediate needs for more natural gas.""

The Rise of AI is the first paper in a series of reports and forecasts to be produced between the two organizations.

GE Vernova hosted the Summit as part of its work to support customers across power generation, grid, and nuclear as they respond to surging demand from AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

""AI has tremendous opportunity to drive economic growth, and it all starts with energy,"" said GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. ""Behind every data center is critical demand for reliable and affordable power. The countries that build resilient, modern energy systems will define the next wave of global competitiveness. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers and appreciate the Hamm Institute leading this work with research and convenings along with the partnership of Secretaries Burgum and Wright as the Administration works to develop smart energy and innovation policies to shape the future.""

Nov. 17, 2025 – New research indicates that more than 70% of energy sector respondents believe that digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and grid software, are essential to enabling the clean energy transition. Such technology supports the integration of renewables, transition to electrification and optimization of energy efficiency, all of which are key to reducing fossil fuel usage.

The Siemens Infrastructure Transition Monitor 2025, which surveyed 1,400 senior executives, shows that 59% of energy industry leaders plan major investments in autonomous systems for grids, and 68% view them as crucial for cutting emissions. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of organizations in the sector say that, over the next three years, AI will transform how their business operates, with 74% saying that AI is helping to make critical infrastructure more resilient.

Respondents indicated that the most likely outcomes from increased use of autonomous systems to manage power grids are lower operating costs, increased energy efficiency and greater reliability.

While the 2025 study indicated significant progress on a number of important goals such as the phase-out of fossil fuel energy and the expansion of large-scale energy storage and renewable generation compared to results in the 2023 Infrastructure Transition Monitor, there are still opportunities for even greater progress.

Most of the charging stations are located at gas stations like Kwik Trip.

Wisconsin will soon install 26 new electric vehicle charging stations using an influx of $14 million in federal money that the Trump administration attempted to block.

In May, Wisconsin joined 15 states in suing the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy — a former Wisconsin congressman — over the administration's freeze of electric vehicle infrastructure funds.

In June, a federal judge ordered the administration to release funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which included more than $62 million for Wisconsin.

“Thanks to our actions to get the Trump administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve,"" Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said in a Nov. 17 news release.

The new charging stations span the state, from Port Washington to Arbor Vitae to Eau Claire. Many are located at Kwik Trips, other gas stations and hotels.

In total, 78 charging stations have been installed using $36 million from the program. The vast majority are located at gas stations.

Members of both parties pushed through legislation last year that paved the way for Wisconsin to participate in the federal program, created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law during the Biden administration.

Federal funds can cover up to 80% of the costs of building out each charging station. Companies applying for the grants, such as Kwik Trip, Tesla and Universal EV, cover a minimum of 20%.

And despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that crime is out of control in big cities, residents of the nation’s largest metropolitan centers are less likely to list crime and gun violence among the chief concerns facing their communities than they were a couple years ago.

Optimism about the future is also down from last year in areas with large Hispanic communities.

These are some of the snapshots from the new ACP/Ipsos survey, which offers a nuanced look at local concerns by breaking the nation’s counties into community types, using data points like race, income, age and religious affiliation. The survey evaluated moods and priorities across the 15 different community types, such as heavily Hispanic areas, big cities and different kinds of rural communities.

The common denominator across the communities? A gnawing worry about daily household costs.

“Concerns about inflation are across the board,” said Dante Chinni, founder and director of ACP. “One thing that truly unites the country is economic angst.”

Rising optimism in rural areas, despite economic anxiety

Rural residents are feeling more upbeat about the country's trajectory — even though most aren't seeing Trump's promised economic revival.

The $15 price tag on a variety pack of Halloween candy at the Kroger supermarket last month struck Carl Gruber. Disabled and receiving federal food aid, the 42-year-old from Newark, Ohio, had hardly been oblivious to lingering, high supermarket prices.

But Gruber, whose wife also is unable to work, is hopeful about the nation's future, primarily in the belief that prices will moderate as Trump suggests.

“Right now, the president is trying to get companies who moved their businesses out of the country to move them back,” said Gruber, a Trump voter whose support has wavered over the federal shutdown that delayed his monthly food benefit. “So, maybe we'll start to see prices come down.”

About 6 in 10 residents of Rural Middle America — Newark's classification in the survey — say they are hopeful about the country's future over the next few years, up from 43% in the 2024 ACP survey. Other communities, like heavily evangelical areas or working-class rural regions, have also seen an uptick in optimism.

Kimmie Pace, a 33-year-old unemployed mother of four from a small town in northwest Georgia, said, “I have anxiety every time I go to the grocery store.”

But she, too, is hopeful in Trump. “Trump’s in charge, and I trust him, even if we’re not seeing the benefits yet,” she said.

Big-city residents are worried about the future

By contrast, the share of big-city residents who say they are hopeful about the nation's future has shrunk, from 55% last year to 45% in the new survey.

Robert Engel of San Antonio — Texas' booming, second most-populous city — is worried about what's next for the U.S., though less for his generation than the next. The 61-year-old federal worker, whose employment was not interrupted by the government shutdown nor Trump's effort to reduce the federal workforce, is near retirement and feels financially stable.

A stable job market, health care availability and a fair economic environment for his adult children are his main priorities.

Recently, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3%, up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff increases that burdened the economy with uncertainty.

Engel's less-hopeful outlook for the country is broader. “It's not just the economy, but the state of democracy and polarization,” Engel said. “It's a real worry. I try to be cautiously optimistic, but it's very, very hard.”

Crime, gun violence are less a concern in urban America

Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he said was runaway, urban crime.

Yet data shows most violent crime in those places, and around the country, has declined in recent years. That tracks with the poll, which found that residents of America's Big Cities and Middle Suburbs are less likely to list crime or gun violence among the top issues facing their communities than they were in 2023.

For Angel Gamboa, a retired municipal worker in Austin, Texas, Trump's claims don't ring true in the city of roughly 1 million people.

“I don't want to say it's overblown, because crime is a serious subject,"" Gamboa said. “But I feel like there's an agenda to scare Americans, and it's so unnecessary.”

Instead, residents of Big Cities are more likely to say immigration and health care are important issues for their communities.

Big Cities are one of the community types where residents are most likely to say they’ve seen changes in immigration recently, with 65% saying they’ve seen a change in their community related to immigration over the past 12 months, compared with only about 4 in 10 residents of communities labeled in the survey as Evangelical Hubs or Rural Middle America.

Gamboa says he has witnessed changes, notably outside an Austin Home Depot, where day laborers regularly would gather in the mornings to find work.

Not anymore, he said.

“Immigrants were not showing up there to commit crimes,"" Gamboa said. ""They were showing up to help their families. But when ICE was in the parking lot, that's all it took to scatter people who were just trying to find a job.”

Hispanic communities are less hopeful about the future

After Hispanic voters moved sharply toward Trump in the 2024 election, the poll shows that residents of heavily Hispanic areas are feeling worse about the future of their communities than they were before Trump was elected.

Carmen Maldonado describes her community of Kissimmee, Florida, a fast-growing, majority-Hispanic city of about 80,000 residents about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Orlando, as “seriously troubled.”

The 61-year-old retired, active-duty National Guard member isn't alone. The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year.

“It's not just hopelessness, but fear,” said Maldonado, who says people in her community — even her fellow native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens — are anxious about the Trump administration's aggressive pursuit of Latino immigrants.

Just over a year ago, Trump made substantial inroads with Hispanic voters in the 2024 presidential election.

Beyond just the future of their communities, Hispanic respondents are also substantially less likely to say they’re hopeful about the future of their children or the next generation: 55% this year, down from 69% in July 2024.

Maldonado worries that the Trump administration's policies have stoked anti-Hispanic attitudes and that they will last for her adult child's lifetime and beyond.

“My hopelessness comes from the fact that we are a large part of what makes up the United States,” she said, “and sometimes I cry thinking about these families.”

Parwani and Thomson-DeVeaux reported from Washington.

While the U.S. civilian nuclear industry today employs about 70,000 people, that workforce will need to at least triple within the next decade to meet the goal of ten new reactors by 2030.

In 2023, however, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced a coordinated research project to explore ways artificial intelligence (AI) might expedite the deployment of small modular reactors. The IAEA said that sophisticated AI computer systems, which mimic human logic in problem solving and decision making, can enhance efficiency, automation, safety, and predictive maintenance – all while optimizing processes.

Kevin Kong, founder and CEO of Everstar, says the reason that the U.S. nuclear workforce is aging is that its nuclear powerplants themselves are aging – for two reasons. Nuclear energy, Kong says, has perhaps the worst public relations in the history of commerce. It gets condemned for one or two bad days, while catastrophes with lesser fuels hardly slowed their development.

That’s bad enough, he says, but an even bigger obstacle to a vigorous nuclear energy industry has for the past five decades been the regulatory Gordian Knot that has driven permitting and construction times – and costs – through the roof.

It only took 22 months in the 1950s for American technology to permit and construct the nation’s first commercial nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. The recently commissioned Vogtle units 3 and 4 in Georgia took an average of 15 years apiece through the regulatory labyrinth.

Vogtle’s delays, however, pale in comparison with the nightmares experienced by the operators of the Watts Bar 1 and 2 reactors in Tennessee. Construction on unit 1 began in 1973, but the reactor did not begin commercial operation until 1996. Construction of Unit 2, which finally went online in 2016, began all the way back in 1972. That’s 44 years – no wonder there were massive cost overruns.

Tech giants like Google are counting on Everstar’s “knot-cutting” solutions to move nuclear power from being stuck in quicksand to the forefront. They need clean and guaranteed 24/7/365 energy, and nuclear is “clean, firm, carbon-free, and can be sited just about anywhere,” says Google’s Michael Terrell.

America today has an estimated 3,000 data centers, with thousands more being built or planned for operations by 2030, plus thousands more worldwide. This growth rate could increase global data center power demand by as much as 165% within the next five years. A Goldman Sachs estimate suggests energy demand for data centers could reach 400 terawatt-hours by 2030 – four times that in 2020.

Nuclear is perhaps the only technology that can meet that exponential demand growth – but only if permitting and construction periods can be slashed, a skilled workforce can be recruited and trained, and sufficient nuclear fuel can be acquired and processed. A recent MIT study found that the U.S. needs to get 45 to 50 new reactors up and running quickly just to meet growing electricity demand from data centers..

Kong says his obsession with energy abundance stems from his recognition that every leap in human development followed an increase in energy density. Humanity went from wood to coal and it tripled, sparking the Industrial Revolution; oil’s energy density, twice that of coal, powers an electrified society that has brought prosperity to billions.

Nuclear energy, Kong says, has an energy density 1.5 million times that of natural gas.

Other nations recognize this – but the U.S. remains bogged down in bureaucracy and a lack of a sense of urgency brought about by decades of being told nuclear means death. This even though wood, coal, and oil have killed many more humans than nuclear power plants and that all three pollute the atmosphere to one degree or another. Cheaper nuclear can extend prosperity – if it ever gets the chance.

China is on a push to build 100 nuclear power plants in the next two decades, using U.S.-based reactor designs – at 20% of the cost for the same unit in the United States. Six to eight new plants are coming online each year. The shortage of qualified nuclear personnel in the U.S. is reflected in the fact that South Korean firms are providing the technical expertise for U.S. plants.

Kong, however, is not just pointing fingers. Everstar is already a world leader in designing AI for the nuclear energy industry. Everstar’s Gordian, its flagship AI platform, is revolutionizing nuclear licensing and regulatory compliance by cutting through the regulatory “Gordian Knot” that has grown exponentially since the Three Mile Island mini-meltdown.

Last November, Everstar and NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. announced the success of a three-month pilot project using Everstar’s AI solutions across a broad range of NANO’s regulatory and licensing workflows. The collaboration produced an advanced AI-driven compliance solution that simplified and streamlined NANO’s regulatory processes.

Everstar capitalized on that success after receiving $4 million in pre-seed funding in February to build out its Gordian Research, which launched on September 1. Built by a world-class team of nuclear and AI experts from Google, Microsoft, SpaceX, Tesla, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the CIA, Gordian organizes complex nuclear information and slashes document-heavy workflows by 80% or more.

The typical nuclear powerplant amasses 2 million labor hours and 2 million pages of paperwork just to get its reactor design approved – and a total of 500 million labor hours over the life of the reactor. That, says Kong, means that up to 90% of the cost of a new nuclear reactor is the result of paperwork. For example, the regulatory specs for a simple valve make the nuclear buyer pay 90 times the cost of the same valve to an oil and gas company.

While China is building 150 new nuclear plants, and other nations are start-to-finish in just a few years, the United States half a century ago – and even today – replaced a building culture at the old Atomic Energy Commission with a permission (denied) culture at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Without the regulatory Gordian Knot, nuclear might already be the cheapest of all.

Because Everstar’s Gordian platform has demonstrated its ability to dramatically accelerate the regulatory process without compromising safety standards, it is already in use in the operating reactor, new reactor, and radioactive materials industries and allowing engineers to do engineering work rather than endless paperwork.

Everstar’s Gordian platform is fundamentally changing how nuclear teams operate, says Kong. “This is why I built Everstar – to help unleash nuclear power as an abundant energy source.”

America, believes, cannot afford to miss the next quantum leap toward energy abundance, and nuclear, he insists, is the Standard Oil of the 21st century. Imagine where we would be today had we invested the $1.5 trillion we spent on far less efficient wind, solar, and other “green” energy on the one “green” energy that has the potential to turn the lights on worldwide.

With this growth comes significant capital investment and energy consumption.

Fortunately, U.S. tax policy offers key incentives data center operators can leverage to reduce costs and enhance cash flow while improving their energy consumption strategy.

Renewable energy credits for data centers

The investment tax credit

An increasing number of data centers are looking to renewable energy technologies such as solar and battery storage to supplement traditional grid-based sources. These systems not only support the growing energy demands of data centers — they also provide substantial tax savings through federal credits.

For decades, the investment tax credit (ITC) has served as a powerful tax incentive for organizations installing various types of renewable energy systems. The list of eligible technologies and the amount of the ITC were greatly expanded with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with many systems qualifying for a minimum credit of 30% of their cost. Investments eligible for the ITC include solar, battery storage, fuel cells, and geothermal HVAC — all of which can reduce grid reliance, costs, and carbon output — providing an all-around win for data center operators.

What’s more, data centers that can’t use their federal energy credits due to net operating losses can sell them for cash under the IRA’s transferability option, which has created a robust market for credit buyers and sellers.

Solar

Whether ground- or roof-mounted, solar installations have become common investments for businesses thanks to technology gains and improved project economics through tax incentives.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), however, enacted rollbacks impacting the solar ITC, including an accelerated termination date of December 31, 2027 for certain projects and more stringent beginning-of-construction rules. Despite the changes, solar projects remain attractive investments, but could be up against a running clock. As such, now is the time for data centers to explore how solar can enhance operations and cash flow.

Energy storage

The IRA placed a major emphasis on energy storage investments like battery and thermal systems. Batteries can be incorporated into data centers on a standalone basis to store grid-based electricity or by being integrated with photovoltaic arrays to store solar-generated power. In both cases, they can play a major role in energy peak shaving and back-up generation while supporting sustainability goals.

Fuel cells

Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction, often by combining hydrogen and oxygen. As a secondary energy source at data centers, they can be used for backup power or during high peak times. Fuel cells can further integrate with combined heat and power systems and storage technology to create a microgrid environment, allowing data centers to operate independently from the main grid during outages or peak demand. With a boost under the IRA, fuel cells can generate significant ITCs, often at a rate of 30% or higher.

Geothermal cooling

Geothermal cooling is a highly energy-efficient option for absorbing the large amount of heat data centers generate. It leverages the stable temperatures found underground to help regulate the temperature of the facility and serve chilled water needs for industrial processes. Geothermal heat pump systems provide a reliable, year-round heat sink (or source), reducing reliance on traditional HVAC systems.

The ITC for geothermal can be quite generous thanks in part to the extensive list of system components that can be used toward the credit. With a comprehensive geothermal ITC analysis, nearly the entirety of a facility’s heating and cooling systems can be claimed in some circumstances.

How do cost segregation and bonus depreciation apply for data centers?

A cost segregation study is a tax strategy used by property owners to increase cash flow by accelerating depreciation deductions. This is done by segregating building assets — which are generally depreciated over 39 years — into shorter-lived assets that may qualify for faster depreciation periods of 5, 7, or 15 years.

These shorter-lived assets are also generally eligible for bonus depreciation, which was restored to 100% and made permanent under the OBBBA for property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025.

Below are common data center assets that can often qualify for shorter tax lives and full expensing with bonus depreciation:

Servers and racking

Networking equipment (e.g., routers, switches)

Electrical dedicated to processing/computing assets

Dedicated cooling equipment and piping

Certain renewable energy assets and improvements

How can the section 179D deduction impact data centers?

Often overlooked by data centers, Section 179D is a deduction available for energy efficient commercial buildings that can exceed $5 per square foot. The deduction specifically applies to certain energy-related components like interior lighting, HVAC, and a building’s envelope (e.g., insulation, windows, roofing). For a building to qualify, it must meet certain energy efficiency requirements and be certified by a properly credentialed energy professional.

For building owners that missed claiming the Section 179D deduction when their qualifying building was placed in service, the deduction can be claimed in a subsequent year without having to amend tax returns. This is done by filing an accounting method change on IRS Form 3115 to “catch up” the missed deductions. (The Form 3115 process is also available for depreciation changes resulting from a cost segregation study).

Section 179D, when combined with a cost segregation and bonus depreciation, can result in immediate expensing of the majority of a data center’s structural and non-structural assets. Companies, however, need to evaluate Section 179D now because the OBBBA accelerated its termination date to June 30, 2026 for property that has not begun construction on or before such date.

“This project demonstrates how nonprofit organizations like the Soundview Family YMCA can achieve meaningful financial savings while advancing sustainability goals,” said Kyle Ramm, managing director at Titan Energy. “By leveraging creative energy strategies, we were able to deliver long-term benefits without upfront cost. We’re proud to partner with Greenskies to complete such an impactful project.”

Cool factor: Unlike a traditional power purchase agreement (PPA), this project was structured as a roof lease. By hosting solar panels on its rooftop, the Soundview Family YMCA will receive approximately $20,000 annually from Greenskies — providing a consistent, long-term revenue stream without requiring any upfront investment or changes to existing energy systems.

The Soundview Family YMCA’s facility already operates a combined heat and power (CHP) system that covers much of its electricity and heating needs. To ensure compatibility and avoid interfering with the CHP system, Titan Energy and Greenskies structured the solar project to deliver power directly to Eversource’s grid under the state’s Non-residential Renewable Energy System (NRES) program. This arrangement allows the Soundview Family YMCA to benefit from annual lease payments while Greenskies generates clean energy for the regional grid.

In addition, the project implemented a series of additional energy-saving measures, reducing its Eversource utility costs at no out-of-pocket expense to the organization. Together, these efforts align with the Soundview Family YMCA’s core motivation: lowering operational costs while advancing its commitment to sustainability.

“This project is a great example of how creative solar structures can deliver tangible value to mission-driven organizations,” said Ryan Linares, VP of Real Estate of Greenskies Clean Focus. “By partnering with Titan Energy and the Soundview Family YMCA, we were able to turn unused roof space into a reliable source of revenue, helping the YMCA strengthen its financial foundation while contributing to a cleaner energy future for the broader community.”

Zelestra closes on tax equity transaction for 81 MW Jasper County Solar Project

Zelestra has secured tax equity funding of approximately $60 million from Stonehenge Capital for the 81 MWdc (60 MWac) Jasper County Solar Project. Located in Jasper County, Indiana, the project has a long-term environmental attributes purchase agreement (EAPA) with Meta, one of six in total that the two companies have in partnership across the United States. The project will be fully operational in Q4 2025.

“This marks another significant milestone in our commitment to deliver projects that meet our clients’ needs,” said Sybil Milo Cioffi, Zelestra’s U.S. CFO. “We look forward to celebrating the completion of Jasper later this year, and to advancing our 1 GW of fully contracted projects now moving toward construction and expected to be operational in the next two years.”

Cool factor: This significant milestone follows the announcement in April 2025 that the company closed a $113 million project financing for the project with Banco Santander. Zelestra is advancing its position in the U.S. energy landscape with innovative, multi-technology solutions tailored to the evolving needs of hyperscalers and corporate partners. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, the company is developing a robust portfolio of more than 10 GW of renewable energy projects across key markets.

“The collaboration with Zelestra exemplifies Stonehenge Capital’s focus on supporting energy infrastructure throughout the nation,” said Whitney LaNasa, senior managing director at Stonehenge Capital. “We look forward to working alongside Zelestra, a distinguished name in global energy, to bring this project to operations.”

With a portfolio of approximately 32 GW of carbon-free projects in six key growth markets (U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Latam and India), 6.8 GW is contracted with customers and in operations, construction, or pre-construction stage.

Fullmark Energy completes 65 MW San Jacinto Energy Storage Project

Fullmark Energy has announced the commercial operations date (COD) of its 65 MW / 130 MWh San Jacinto storage project in Banning, California. The milestone marks the final project within Fullmark Energy’s Redwood Projects portfolio — a strategic collection of energy storage facilities across Southern California — to achieve commercial operations.

“Reaching commercial operations across the Redwood Projects marks a major milestone for our team and our partners,” said Chris McKissack, Chief Executive Officer of Fullmark Energy. “These projects strengthen grid reliability, accelerate the renewable energy transition, and demonstrate our team’s ability to deliver high-performing assets at scale. San Jacinto is particularly meaningful because it shows how energy storage can simultaneously enhance grid infrastructure while revitalizing communities and creating value for local stakeholders.”

Cool factor: San Jacinto is Fullmark’s third project to reach COD in 2025, joining three other operational facilities in Fullmark Energy’s Redwood Projects portfolio. The 20 MW / 80 MWh Johanna ESS project in Santa Ana reached COD in October 2021, while the 20 MW / 40 MWh Desert-Carris project in Palm Springs and the 20 MW / 40 MWh Ortega Project in Lake Elsinore both reached COD earlier this year. These three 2025 projects deliver 105 MW of new capacity to the Southern California Edison distribution system.

The San Jacinto project exemplifies how energy storage development can drive positive community transformation. The 65 MW facility sits on previously abandoned property that had become an overgrown, nuisance property, creating challenges for surrounding residents and businesses. Working closely with local stakeholders, Fullmark transformed the site into well-maintained infrastructure with proper security fencing and lighting, significantly improving conditions for the neighborhood. The project also generates economic benefits for the city of Banning’s municipal electric utility, which serves approximately 13,500 customers and serves the project’s load.

The Redwood Projects represent 125 MW / 290 MWh of operational capacity across four strategically located facilities in Southern California, making it one of the largest independently owned battery storage portfolios in the region. The projects were developed with diversified offtake agreements to strengthen revenue profiles and reduce risk. In January 2023, Fullmark secured $100 million in financing for the portfolio through a consolidated term loan and letter of credit facility. All four facilities participate in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market, providing critical grid services including energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, and resource adequacy.

Dispatch Energy acquires Green Lantern Solar

Dispatch Energy LLC has acquired Green Lantern Solar (GLS), along with more than 64 solar and battery storage projects totaling 208.9 MWdc, at various stages of development and operations. This transaction brings Dispatch’s total portfolio to 489.5 MW, as the company works to aggregate distributed generation resources nationally.

“This acquisition provides an excellent result for GLS shareholders and employees,” said Luke Shullenberger, founder and CEO of Green Lantern Solar. “We appreciate the execution-oriented approach of Dispatch Energy’s team and believe that the business will continue to grow under their leadership into the future.”

This acquisition expands Dispatch’s footprint in the growing distributed generation market across Georgia, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

Cool factor: Dispatch will acquire 100% of Green Lantern’s operations, including operating and early-stage development assets as well as Operations and Maintenance (“O&M”) services business.

“Dispatch remains committed to the energy transition and we are excited to welcome Green Lantern’s team, operations, and assets into our portfolio,” said Richard Dovere, CEO of Dispatch Energy. “We are proud to have the opportunity to acquire this excellent founder-led business.”

Founded in 2024, Dispatch Energy raised over $360 MM in 2025 to pursue opportunities in distributed generation.

RWE’s first project in Louisiana completes construction

RWE has completed construction of its first project in Louisiana, the 100 MW Lafitte Solar project located in the Ouachita Parish, outside of Monroe. The project will be fully online and generating energy by the end of the year. Lafitte Solar was enabled through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Meta, through which Meta also receives all environmental benefits associated with the project, including RECs.

“Lafitte Solar is RWE’s first project in Louisiana, and will provide low-cost, homegrown energy to the Louisiana grid and generate enough electricity to power 17,000 local homes and businesses,” said Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy. “By providing affordable and reliable electricity, we are strengthening Monroe’s power supply while supporting the community’s growth and resilience.”

The project was celebrated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, local officials from the Ouachita Parish Police Jury and Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership and employees and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies (McCarthy).

Cool factor: Over its operating lifetime, Lafitte Solar is projected to generate approximately $32 million in regional tax revenue — supporting public schools, law enforcement and emergency services. Construction of Lafitte Solar was completed in collaboration with RWE’s EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) partner McCarthy, supporting more than 150 full-time jobs on the project at its peak. During construction, workers supported local businesses and restaurants, and shopped at area stores, amplifying the project’s economic impact.

RWE remains dedicated to supporting local schools and families. The company partnered with Roy Neal Shelling, Sr. Elementary School, providing donations to support classroom resources, while its construction partner McCarthy supplied toys during the holiday. RWE and McCarthy remain committed to improving the quality of life for children in the local area by funding a new playground being built at Tanglewood Community Park. Additionally, RWE and McCarthy together provided one of the largest holiday food donations the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana has received, supporting families throughout Monroe during the Christmas season.

Lafitte Solar’s site design features natural and native vegetation around the perimeter, promoting biodiversity and habitat conservation to benefit the project’s land and surrounding farmlands. The project will also incorporate agrivoltaics, using a flock of over 600 sheep to maintain healthy vegetation onsite. This practice not only protects local farmland but deepens partnerships with regional farmers, demonstrating how renewable energy coexists with agriculture.

By Joshua T. Bledsoe, Nikki Buffa, Jennifer K. Roy, Nolan Fargo, and Samantha Yeager

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved Texas’s application to assume primary enforcement responsibility, or “primacy,” for Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells within the state. Class VI UIC wells are used for the permanent geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep underground rock formations. Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide. For more details on the proposed rule to grant Texas primacy, see this Latham blog post.

EPA’s approval follows a comprehensive technical and legal review of Texas’s program revision application, which concluded that the state’s statutes, regulations, and administrative framework for permitting and regulating Class VI UIC wells meet the federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Texas already administers UIC programs for other well classes. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality oversees Class I (deep waste disposal), III (mineral extraction), IV (hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup), and V (non-hazardous fluid disposal) wells. The RRC oversees certain Class V wells (shallow geothermal injection wells) and Class II (oil and gas waste disposal and enhanced oil recovery wells).

Class VI primacy could accelerate permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by leveraging local technical expertise and Texas’s established regulatory infrastructure.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy

The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy. RRC Chairman Jim Wright called it “an important step forward for [the] state’s energy sector” that could serve “to reduce regulatory overlap.” According to Senator John Cornyn, primacy allows Texas “to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency.”

The RRC reports that it has already received 18 Class VI UIC well applications and is aware of additional projects being planned across the state.

Broader Trend

Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Most recently, EPA granted Arizona primacy for all UIC well classes. These approvals underscore a broader national trend toward state-level administration of CCS permitting.

What’s Next

EPA’s final rule will take effect December 15, 2025. Project proponents should track the RRC’s Class VI program implementation — including application forms, guidance, and timelines — and prepare to participate in state permitting processes.

A spokesperson for Daimler Truck North America told CCJ Monday that the company appreciates EPA's efforts to reduce costs while maintaining a focus on air quality and legislative consistency, adding ""[This] announcement provides the regulatory certainty needed for effective production planning and customer support.""

The decision to remain on course is somewhat of a reversal in recent emissions policy that has seen EPA dismantle California’s vehicle emissions standards, target for repeal the Endangerment Finding — which would roll back the Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 rule — and help unravel the Clean Truck Partnership between California and truck and engine manufacturers.

The standards require heavy-duty commercial vehicles to limit nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to 0.035 grams per horsepower-hour during normal operation, 0.050 grams at low load, and 10.0 grams at idle, and will also increase the useful life of governed vehicles by 1.5 to 2.5 times and yield emissions warranties that are 2.8 to 4.5 times longer — provisions that guarantee that as vehicles age, they will continue to meet EPA’s more stringent emissions standards for a longer period of time.

Given the expected cold weather, crude oil prices are unlikely to decrease much further, and there remains considerable risk of a price spike in the coming month.
Across the United States, the scale of data center development is remarkable.","It’s astonishing that oil prices aren’t soaring higher, given the dramatic headlines. Ukraine has managed to strike deep into Russia with long-range drones, hitting one of the country’s top ten refineries at Novokuybyshevsk and a military base—an operation confirmed by Ukraine’s General Staff and reported by the Kyiv Independent.

Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Oman, the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara was intercepted and diverted by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on November 14, suspected of carrying unauthorized goods. US Central Command and UKMTO have issued warnings about persistent threats in the region, urging extreme caution for maritime transit.

Yet, despite these significant disruptions, Russia’s flagship oil price just plunged to its lowest in over two and a half years, mere days before new U.S. sanctions are set to target the nation’s two biggest producers. The price drop is set to squeeze Russian oil companies’ finances and shrink tax revenues for the Kremlin—funds that help sustain the war in Ukraine. Discounts on Urals crude widened to an average of $23.52 per barrel below last week, the biggest gap since June 2023, according to Argus data. On Thursday, Urals crude from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk plummeted to $36.61 a barrel, its lowest since March 2023, with a similar story in the Baltic Sea market. Prices did inch up on Friday, but the trend remains surprising.

For a country where oil and gas make up about a quarter of the state budget, it’s truly remarkable that—with all the geopolitical turmoil—oil prices are not climbing higher. Oil continues to kind of struggle and because some Russian refineries are down, it’s assumed they’ll be dumping cheap barrels of crude even though no one wants to buy them right now. Given the expected cold weather, crude oil prices are unlikely to decrease much further, and there remains considerable risk of a price spike in the coming month.

The other big picture is the demand for artificial intelligence and data centers. Market watcher Tom Conrick wrote that Web Services (AWS) is making a historic investment in Indiana, with a massive $13 billion data center campus under construction between South Bend and New Carlisle. This project, which marks the largest single corporate investment in the state’s history, spans over 600 acres acquired through the shell company Razor5. Located along Indiana State Road 2 and Larrison Boulevard, the campus features at least seven buildings, each measuring 216,000 square feet, with their shells already completed.

The scale of the investment has grown from its initial $11 billion announcement, and AWS expects to create 1,000 jobs for both its own staff and contract workers. The company has secured sales tax exemptions for eligible capital investments over a 50-year period. Construction is moving at an “unprecedented” pace, with the first facilities scheduled to become operational in the first quarter of 2025. AWS has already started recruiting for technical and operations positions, underscoring the project’s momentum.

This new campus is strategically significant, as it will support AWS’s expanding need for cloud services and AI workloads. The development is also positioned near the $3.5 billion / electric vehicle battery plant, signaling the emergence of a high-tech corridor in northern Indiana. Similar activity is underway elsewhere in the country, including Chicago, where the former CBOE Global Markets headquarters is being converted into a 33-megawatt data center by Legacy Investing, a Virginia-based real estate firm. The building, which sold in October 2025 following upgrades to its power capacity, is expected to complete its transformation by late 2026. Another notable example in Chicago is the former R.R. Donnelley printing plant, now the Lakeside Technology Center at 350 East Cermak Road, recognized as one of the world’s largest data centers and a major internet interconnection hub.

Across the United States, the scale of data center development is remarkable. More than 3,000 facilities are currently tracked for development, expansion, or retrofitting. In August 2025 alone, 10.5 gigawatts of planned capacity were filed, representing billions of dollars of investment in states such as Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. The year-to-date construction value for 2025 stands at $12.9 billion, a 48% increase over the previous year, with $2.4 billion in new projects launched in June. The South and Midwest are especially active, with states like Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, and Texas leading the charge. Major projects include Amazon’s $2 billion facility in Sunbury, Ohio, Google’s $600 million data center in Mesa, Arizona, and the $100 billion Stargate joint venture by OpenAI, , and .

Infrastructure trends show rising power demand, prompting increased investment in energy infrastructure, while the acceleration of AI and cloud computing is driving the construction of hyperscale and edge data centers. Many previously paused projects are now resuming construction, reflecting renewed confidence in the sector. As of mid-2025, about 404 data centers are actively under construction across the U.S. ’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has noted that these developments will require hundreds of thousands of electricians and plumbers, highlighting the significant workforce implications of the ongoing data center boom.

is going to be a big part of that and the weather is going to be a big part of natural gas pricing. Fox Weather reported that, “Record-breaking November heat wave grips the South after major deep freeze for millions.

Fewer solar developers reported delays in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, the Energy Information Administration said in a Nov. 10 report.

In the third quarter this year, “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in the same period in 2024,” EIA said.

“Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions,” EIA said. Developers added around 31 gigawatts of utility-scale solar capacity last year, though their projections at the beginning of the year forecasted 36 GW in additions.

“Because survey respondents may not anticipate the occurrence or duration of delays, ultimate capacity additions tend to be less than the expected amount that developers report to us at the beginning of the year,” EIA said. The agency said in February that it predicts 32.5 GW of utility-scale solar will be added this year, indicating that less solar may come online this year than last year, despite the decrease in delays.

EIA also noted that delays are more common than cancellations, and “less than 1% of planned solar capacity is entirely cancelled in a typical month … Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two.”

Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email to ESG Dive sister publication Utility Dive that it’s “important to note that most of the solar capacity that has come online this year began construction last year.”

“The vast majority of what began construction this year received permits prior to July of this year, when the memo from the Department of the Interior slowing permitting was released,” Baca said. “As such, this data does not yet reflect the recent permitting obstruction, including from the DOI memo.

Policymakers can build on this initiative by supporting the commercialization of technologies that could help address AI startups’ energy challenges.","What energy policy agenda will enable startups to compete in AI?

That question is becoming more urgent as AI’s exponential growth drives an unprecedented demand for electricity. The Department of Energy forecasts that data center electricity use will nearly triple to 12 percent of US supply by 2028, up from 4.4 percent in 2023. Yet this surge is colliding with an analog-era grid: as of late 2023, an astounding 2,600 gigawatts (GW) of new energy projects—over 95 percent of which are zero-carbon—were waiting in grid interconnection queues, a backlog more than double the entire installed capacity of the US power plant fleet.

This multi-year logjam creates more than just scarcity; it creates a two-tiered market that structurally disadvantages startups. Large, established hyperscalers can lock in long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), securing billions of dollars in predictable energy and effectively buying out entire regions’ future power capacity. Startups don’t have this luxury. Lacking the scale and balance sheets to make such long-term commitments, startups cannot negotiate these priority positions and are left to face volatile spot markets and higher rates. Moreover, startups don’t have the legal teams or lobbying muscle to develop a bespoke AI energy policy agenda or to advance that agenda on Capitol Hill. Because of their comparative disadvantages in business and policy negotiations, the next generation of AI innovators may be denied access to the energy they need to compete with larger platforms; energy scarcity could become a durable competitive moat.

In AI, energy policy is not a peripheral concern; the challenge of “speed-to-power”—how fast a new data center can access energy—is key to competing in the AI industry. To ensure a level playing field, we need an AI energy policy agenda that works for startups.

This agenda should focus on three core concepts:

Generating energy abundance

Ensuring fair energy access

Innovating in energy supply and demand

The Abundance Agenda: More Supply, Lower Costs

AI’s energy demands require more supply. Without enough energy, costs increase and both large and small developers will face obstacles to building new AI tools. As the administration’s AI Action Plan recognizes, the foundational pillar of a forward-thinking energy policy must therefore focus on dramatically increasing the total supply of energy and data center capacity to lower costs for everyone.

Momentum for a pro-abundance energy agenda is increasingly bipartisan, with leaders from the Trump administration to the Democratic mayor of Silicon Valley’s largest city, championing robust reforms to expand energy supply and accelerate infrastructure buildout. Journalists Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein have provided an intellectual framework for abundance policy, articulating how supply-side solutions can underpin America’s competitiveness and innovation. Organizations such as the Abundance Institute and the Niskanen Center are researching and advocating for policy to realize a future of plentiful, affordable energy, bridging ideological divides and shaping a common path forward. This emerging consensus reflects a rare moment in contemporary policy where growth, innovation, and economic opportunity are rallying points across parties and institutions.

Policymakers are starting to realize the importance of expanding energy access. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 2023, which aims to reform the grid interconnection process and clear backlogs by shifting to a “first-ready, first-served” cluster study model. More recently, the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan calls for fast-tracking energy infrastructure construction, and Congress has held hearings on the energy needs of the AI sector. States are also heavily engaged in energy policy—some, fearing strain on the energy grid, are reconsidering existing data-center incentives or considering proposals that would require more transparency about data center energy usage, while others are doubling down on encouraging more AI activity within their borders.

But policymakers should take additional steps to reduce burdens to energy production and access:

Accelerate energy permitting. Speed up federal and state permitting for new energy generation and transmission infrastructure to allow supply to more rapidly meet demand from the AI sector. This should be coupled with a concerted effort to streamline and standardize the state and local permitting processes for data center siting.

Design smart transparency rules. Step cautiously in enacting data center transparency mandates—proposals that would require operators to report on metrics like energy consumption and water usage. There were more than 20 such bills introduced in 2025 alone. Any new transparency rules should be carefully designed to avoid slowing the construction of new capacity or imposing burdensome compliance costs that will disproportionately affect startups, given their small teams and limited budgets.

Unlock existing grid capacity. Reform outdated utility regulations that discourage the use of innovative grid-enhancing technologies. Incentivizing the deployment of these modern optimization tools could unlock as much as 100 GW of capacity on existing power lines.

Invest in the workforce. We must invest in the skilled workforce needed to build this new infrastructure. Addressing critical labor shortages, particularly for electricians, is not only essential to removing a key bottleneck for deployment but also represents a major opportunity to create a new generation of high-paying jobs for skilled trade workers across the country.

While boosting supply is paramount, we must also continue to innovate in efficiency. It’s crucial to increase public R&D for more energy-efficient AI, spanning both hardware and algorithms. However, we must also be clear-eyed about the limits of this approach. Efficiency gains alone are insufficient to address the demand problem, as improvements in efficiency frequently trigger increased consumption, a phenomenon known as the Jevons Paradox.

The Pro-Competitive Agenda: Ensuring Fair Access

While an abundance of energy is critical for both startups and large hyperscalers, it’s insufficient on its own to foster a competitive AI ecosystem. Policies that create more supply must be accompanied by policies that distribute that supply fairly. Preferential energy access would create new barriers to AI development, favoring large players over startups. To avoid this outcome, energy policy must address the structural disadvantages startups face in the energy and compute markets.

The cornerstone of fair, balanced access is ensuring that startups do not pay for the energy needs of hyperscalers. Large-scale AI deployment could increase energy costs for everyone else: a single hyperscale data center can require grid upgrades costing billions of dollars. If policy permits these costs to be “socialized” across all ratepayers rather than being borne directly by the entity causing them, startups will be disadvantaged.

For instance, a large hyperscaler could negotiate a custom contract with a state utility to power a new data center, a project requiring costly, large-scale upgrades to transmission lines and substations. If state regulators, eager to attract the investment, allow the utility to recover those upgrade costs across its entire customer base—overall electricity rates for all other customers will rise. Simultaneously, this type of project could consume all planned grid capacity in the region for years to come, leaving startups unable to secure power for their own smaller facilities. If costs rise due to hyperscaler demand, but hyperscalers don’t pay for this increased price, then residential customers and smaller businesses—including startups—would effectively subsidize the energy infrastructure of their largest competitors.

To prevent this outcome, policymakers could implement a “causer pays” principle that requires large-load users to directly fund the grid upgrades they require, rather than socializing these costs. This ensures that the entities driving increased demand are the ones who bear the financial responsibility for the necessary infrastructure improvements.

Fairness should also extend to energy procurement. To correct the imbalance caused by large companies securing favorable long-term PPA terms, policymakers and energy regulators should establish aggregated purchasing programs that allow startups to pool their demand, giving them the collective bargaining power needed to secure the same competitive energy contracts.

Energy policy should also reduce barriers to entry in AI by ensuring startups have access to the foundational resources needed for innovation. The immense cost of high-performance computing can prevent promising ideas from ever being developed. As we have written previously, the federal government can address this challenge by establishing a National AI Competitiveness Institute (NAICI), which would provide startups, researchers, and nonprofits with access to the infrastructure they need, including compute power, data, and model evaluation resources. By providing direct access to these energy-intensive computing resources, the NAICI would help startups manage the high infrastructure costs that can cut off their ability to innovate, making it easier for Little Tech to compete with larger platforms in building and testing new AI models.

The Innovation Agenda: Unleashing New Approaches to Energy Supply and Demand

Startups cannot compete with hyperscalers on sheer capital expenditure; their strength lies in their innovation and agility. Policy must create opportunities for them to leverage these unique advantages. A forward-looking strategy should focus on enabling startups to capitalize on their operational flexibility and participate in the development of next-generation energy technologies.

A key area for innovation is demand-side flexibility: the ability of energy consumers to actively manage when and how much electricity they use in response to the needs of the grid. State utility commissions, for instance, could direct utilities in their jurisdictions to offer innovative tariffs, like real-time pricing, which would allow startups to significantly reduce costs by shifting their computational workloads to off-peak hours when power is cheaper.

Furthermore, state and federal policymakers can increase startup access to demand response programs, which pay companies to temporarily reduce their energy use during periods of high grid stress. Lowering participation barriers for these programs would enable agile startups to generate revenue simply by pausing non-critical workloads, turning their operational agility into a direct economic advantage.

At the same time, policy should promote the development of next-generation power sources that can provide the 24/7 clean energy that AI data centers require, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). To accelerate SMR deployment, policymakers must build on the important progress of the bipartisan 2024 ADVANCE Act, which began to address the high cost of licensing through reducing certain fees and authorizing prize competitions to cover regulatory costs for innovators. Policymakers should ensure this new framework succeeds by conducting oversight to confirm the law’s regulatory reforms are being implemented effectively.

Likewise, advanced geothermal energy is a promising source of the 24/7 clean power that AI data centers require, but its deployment is severely hampered by complex permitting processes that can take seven to ten years on federal land. To accelerate this technology, policy should focus on speeding up federal leasing and drilling permits to reduce these costly development delays.

The Department of Energy’s recent funding for emerging technologies like AI and nuclear energy is a welcome step. Policymakers can build on this initiative by supporting the commercialization of technologies that could help address AI startups’ energy challenges.

For any new technology that expands energy supply or mitigates energy demand, startups must have equal access to the opportunity. To prevent large platforms from securing exclusive access to these new energy resources, legislators and regulators could mandate that utility development partnerships include opportunities for startup participation, either as energy off-takers, who purchase shares of the generated power, or as co-locators, who physically site their facilities at the new power source.

Securing America’s Energy Advantage in AI

The race for AI leadership could be won or lost on the electrical grid. The policy landscape, designed for a pre-AI era and predisposed to favor large providers over startups, now risks creating insurmountable barriers for the next generation of innovators. The path forward is not to simply power the nascent AI sector, but to ensure that energy policy does not leave small AI developers behind.

By embracing a comprehensive strategy built on abundance, pro-competitive market access, and a commitment to innovation, we can move beyond the zero-sum mindset of scarcity and toward a future where startups have affordable access to the energy they need. Let’s ensure the best ideas—not just the biggest balance sheets—have the power they need to win.",https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/11/Energy-Policy-Agenda-for-Ensure-a-Thriving-AI-Market-X.png,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:51.261571

Notable Upcoming Events

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana’s Recycling Market Development Board just awarded six Indiana organizations with $2 million in grant funding to expand recycling across the state, a decision expected to create 42 new jobs and prevent an additional 197,884 tons of materials from going into landfills annually.

The grant recipients aren’t just community recycling bins. They span themes of textile waste, food waste, and lumber production. Goodwill Industries of Michiana will receive over $300,000 to buy new equipment that will let them recycle more textiles and phase out 4 million plastic bags used by Goodwill shoppers. Greencycle in Marion County will dedicate over $450,000 to a wood waste grinder that will process more than 21,000 tons each year. And in LaPorte County, Nexus IN RNG received $500,000 to buy equipment that will divert 105,000 tons of organic waste—that’s food waste—from landfills each year, while also creating new jobs for this project.

The grant money comes from the Recycling Promotion and Assistance Fund, which is funded by a per-ton fee on solid waste disposed of at Indiana landfills. This means the fees we pay when trash goes to the landfill help fund programs that keep trash out of landfills in the first place. Indiana currently diverts about 19% of waste from landfills through recycling and composting, but the state’s goal is 50%. These grants are part of the effort to close that gap—turning waste into resources, creating jobs, and building what experts call a “circular economy” where materials get reused instead of buried.

COP30

This week, thousands of diplomats and climate experts began gathering in Brazil—right at the edge of the Amazon rainforest—for COP30, the latest round of United Nations climate talks.

This conference takes place November 10-21 and is being called the Amazon COP or even the Nature COP—a moment for the world to see what’s at stake through Brazil’s eyes.

For the first time, more than 1,000 Indigenous representatives will have access to the main negotiation venue. Brazil is proposing something called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which would financially reward countries for protecting forests rather than cutting them down. The Amazon covers 6.5 million square kilometers, holds 13% of known species on the planet, and stores between 150 and 200 billion tons of carbon—that’s equivalent to 15-20 years of global carbon emissions. But over 17% of the forest in Brazilian territory has already been cut down, and 31% is degraded. Scientists have warned that losing just 5% more could push the forest past a tipping point, irreversibly transforming it into a savanna and releasing 300 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, making it impossible to meet the Paris Agreement’s climate targets.

The conference will also focus on mobilizing $1.3 trillion a year in climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change. As one Brazilian climate leader put it, “Our window to prevent runaway climate change is closing fast. The next five years will determine the next hundred years. The world is looking to Brazil to show that a standing forest is worth more than one that’s cut down.”

The White House has confirmed that no high-level U.S. officials would be in attendance, likely due to Trump’s repeated insistence that human-caused climate change is a hoax.

Instead, California Governor Gavin Newsom and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham have been the United States’ unofficial ambassadors. Whether COP30 becomes a turning point on climate progress or another round of unfulfilled promises will depend on whether world leaders choose action over politics, and implementation over negotiation.

Aurora Borealis Shows Off

GRIFFY LAKE via FACEBOOK -

Longtime Bloomington residents were stunned by a rare sighting on Tuesday evening—a glimpse of the incredible Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, dancing across our Midwest skies. The fantastical display of colors and lights was visible in Indiana and reached as far south as Florida with displays of green, red, and purple waves of light.

The sun is at the peak of its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum. The aurora occurred when the sun sent several bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections that reached Earth Tuesday night and early Wednesday. Forecasters explain that this created a severe geomagnetic storm and when those charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, they create these colorful light shows. Usually, you’d have to travel hundreds of miles north to see the aurora, but during strong storms like this one, they can stretch much farther south.

If you missed the display this week, you don’t need to book your ticket to the Arctic Circle just yet—we’re likely to see more of the aurora borealis over the next several months as the sun continues through this active phase. Nature’s light show might just be coming to our skies again soon.

The new facility will span over one million square feet and is designed for the production of First Solar’s Series 7 thin-film solar modules. The plant is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026.

This expansion will add an estimated 600 new jobs to the region. It is projected to increase First Solar’s total U.S. annual production capacity to 17.7 gigawatts (GW), adding 3.7 GW of new capacity.

The investment is part of a broader strategy to solidify First Solar’s U.S. manufacturing base. The company currently operates facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio. This South Carolina announcement follows a separate $1.1 billion investment in new capacity, which includes a new factory in Louisiana and expansion of its existing Ohio footprint, both expected to be operational in 2025.

First Solar utilizes a thin-film technology platform that differs from traditional silicon-based solar panels. The company states its modules have a carbon footprint that is up to 30% lower than that of typical crystalline silicon PV panels manufactured in China.

The company’s expansion is occurring in a market influenced by U.S. industrial policy. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes advanced manufacturing production credits designed to incentivize domestic production of solar components. And this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, barring solar projects from tax credits if they source products from Chinese businesses or businesses with substantial investment from Chinese entities.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The move into South Carolina follows recent challenges for other manufacturers in the U.S. solar market. Qcells, another major producer, recently faced customs delays on components and furloughed workers in Georgia.

Why does this matter right now?

On September 30, 2025, the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles vanished. No fanfare, no final countdown. For the EV industry, this is more than a fiscal shift; it’s a signal that growth now must stand on its own.

Research from Gartner Inc. notes EV shipments will grow in 2025, but subsidies won’t drive the next wave. The International Energy Agency reports that global EV production reached 17.3 million in 2024, with China accounting for much of that volume. Meanwhile, charging networks, pricing strategies, and consumer perceptions still present real hurdles. This is a now-or-never pivot for EVs in markets like the U.S.

How does it compare to rivals?

Consider the four models shaping the next chapter. The 2026 Nissan Leaf starts at about $29,900, offers ~250 miles of range, and has newly updated battery chemistry. It’s aimed at everyday buyers, not early-adopter trophy seekers. The Volkswagen ID. Buzz arrives as a three-row electric people-carrier with ~260 miles of range, 282 hp, and a cabin styled to turn heads, though at around $60,000 it demands a premium. The Ford Mustang Mach-E GT focuses on excitement: 480 hp, 634 lb-ft torque, 0–60 ~3.6 s, range ~250 miles, and 0% financing, rather than tax credits, as Ford’s incentive. Then the Audi A6 e-tron represents tech-luxury: up to ~321 miles range, 270 kW fast charging, panoramic OLED displays, and air suspension. In effect, affordable, fun, aspirational, and premium all co-exist. Yet the real competition is no longer just EV vs EV, it’s EV vs internal combustion, used car inflows, and hybrid crossover pressure. Value and infrastructure will decide winners.

If you’re an urban commuter looking for an affordable electric vehicle, the Leaf makes clear sense. Minimal frills but solid value. If you’re a family needing flexibility and want a bit of flair, the ID. Buzz offers personality and utility, assuming the higher price fits. If you crave performance, the Mach-E GT delivers, but keep in mind its firm ride, higher cost per mile, and less range than some might hope.

If luxury, tech sophistication, and status are your key metrics, the A6 e-tron delivers, but for a price. Conversely, if you live in a rural area without reliable fast chargers, or you’re on a tight budget where used models or hybrids dominate your choices, you might consider waiting. The subsidy era is over; the next wave demands readiness, both from buyers and infrastructure.

Tesla’s applications to open stores in Bismarck and Fargo, filed in 2024, were denied because state law prohibits vehicle manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.
Tesla, however, has appealed, claiming it should be exempt from the law since its sales model relies exclusively on direct-to-consumer sales throughout the United States.
Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Michael Pitcher, however, argued that the exemptions in state law do not apply to Tesla.
North Dakota and Louisiana have some of the lowest EV adoption rates, with electric vehicles accounting for just 1.3% and 1.4% of new car sales, respectively.","Tesla is suing North Dakota’s Department of Transportation after it has rejected its applications to open direct-to-consumer showrooms in the state.

The information was first revealed by The Bismarck Tribune, according to which the lawsuit was filed in August, with the first hearings scheduled for December.

Tesla’s applications to open stores in Bismarck and Fargo, filed in 2024, were denied because state law prohibits vehicle manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.

The state argues that this separation between manufacturers and dealerships is necessary to protect both franchise dealers and consumers.

Tesla, however, has appealed, claiming it should be exempt from the law since its sales model relies exclusively on direct-to-consumer sales throughout the United States.

Not a “Manufacturer”

The company argued that it does not technically meet the definition of a “manufacturer” because it does not sell new vehicles through third-party dealerships.

According to the lawsuit, North Dakota law defines a “manufacturer” as “any person who manufactures, assembles, or imports and sells new motor vehicles to new vehicle dealers for resale in the state.”

The company contends that even if it fits this definition, it should still be allowed to seek an exemption from the Department of Transportation, which permits manufacturers to operate a dealership if no independent dealer is available.

“Traditional motor vehicle manufacturers sell their vehicles through independent franchised dealers. Tesla, by contrast, sells its vehicles directly to customers throughout the United States,” the company wrote.

“As a result, Tesla has no franchised dealerships in any state,” the legal filings showed.

Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Michael Pitcher, however, argued that the exemptions in state law do not apply to Tesla.

They are intended only for temporary situations, such as when a manufacturer cannot immediately take over an existing dealership, in order to prevent market disruptions.

Tesla, by contrast, was seeking to establish its own permanent dealerships.

Unconstitutionality Claims

Tesla alleges that the Department of Transportation’s rejection violates the North Dakota Constitution, citing clauses that protect the “right to earn a livelihood” and the “right to equal protection.”

According to Tesla, North Dakota’s law unconstitutionally favors franchise dealerships.

“To the extent that the North Dakota Legislature or the Department seek to protect franchised dealerships from competition, that is not a reasonable legislative goal,” the filings read.

The Assistant Attorney General countered that establishing a franchise system is a legitimate way for the state Legislature to protect vehicle dealerships and does not infringe on any constitutional rights.

“North Dakota’s laws are not designed to shield dealers from competition per se, but from exploitation by manufacturers who could otherwise undercut them,” Pitcher wrote, adding that “Tesla, as a manufacturer, falls squarely within that concern.”

Direct Sales Ban in Other States

North Dakota isn’t the first state where Tesla has challenged dealership laws. The company has also filed petitions against similar direct-sales bans in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and several other states.

North Dakota and Louisiana have some of the lowest EV adoption rates, with electric vehicles accounting for just 1.3% and 1.4% of new car sales, respectively.

Only Mississippi is lower, at 1.2%.

By contrast, California — the state with the highest adoption rate — saw electric vehicles make up 29% of new car sales in the third quarter.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tesla_Lincoln.webp,N,,2025-11-17 13:03:53.899416

Across all rulemakings, federal agencies published roughly $2 billion in total cost savings and cut 7.1 million paperwork burden hours.
The agency estimates that this will produce roughly $171 million and 3.6 million hours in cost and paperwork reductions annually.
Extrapolated across a 10-year period under a 7-percent discount rate, this means roughly $1.2 billion in total savings[1].
Utilizing a somewhat different set of calculations than the 2023 iteration, EPA now estimates the total cost reductions from these proposed changes “to be approximately $786-$843 million,” with the average estimate being roughly $815 million.","The major policy news last week was, of course, that the longest government shutdown in U.S. history ended. Throughout the week, however, agencies were still very much in shutdown mode. As such, federal rulemaking output continued to be minimal with only three actions that contained any measurable effects. But what this cohort lacked in numbers, it more than made up for in impact. Proposed rules from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeking to roll-back certain Biden-era rules were the main items of the week, bringing sizable estimated cost and paperwork reductions. Across all rulemakings, federal agencies published roughly $2 billion in total cost savings and cut 7.1 million paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 7

Final Rules: 13

2025 Total Pages: 50,961

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$74.1 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$627.9 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week comes in the form of the proposed rule from CFPB regarding “Small Business Lending Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B).” Under this proposal, the agency “is reconsidering coverage of certain credit transactions and financial institutions; the small business definition; inclusion of certain data points and how others are collected; and the compliance date.” Specifically, CFPB is revisiting a 2023 rule on the matter. The agency estimates that this will produce roughly $171 million and 3.6 million hours in cost and paperwork reductions annually. Extrapolated across a 10-year period under a 7-percent discount rate, this means roughly $1.2 billion in total savings[1].

The other significant rulemaking of the week comes in the proposed rule from EPA on “Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Data Reporting and Recordkeeping Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); Revision to Regulation.” As the title suggests, the proposal seeks to make “amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulation for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).” Incidentally, the requirements in question also stem from a 2023 rule. This current proposal would all but wipe out the reporting requirements and their ensuing costs. Utilizing a somewhat different set of calculations than the 2023 iteration, EPA now estimates the total cost reductions from these proposed changes “to be approximately $786-$843 million,” with the average estimate being roughly $815 million.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

There were no new broad-based regulatory policy announcements from the White House. The only document of note coming out of the Office of Management and Budget was a largely ministerial memo directing the resumption of normal agency operations in light of the end of the government shutdown. From a regulatory perspective, it seems like agencies have already stepped to it, with a more typical volume of rulemaking already flowing through the Federal Register pipelines.

Also, there were no new CRA developments. The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 68 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

Since January 1, the federal government has published $702 billion in total regulatory net cost savings (with $74.1 billion in cost savings from finalized rules) and 72.1 million hours of net annual paperwork cuts (with 48.1 million hours coming from final rules).",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/regrodeo-11-14-25.png,N,,2025-11-17 12:01:35.231664

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled en banc in Allegheny Defense Project v. FERC that FERC cannot toll rehearing requests to approve natural gas infrastructure projects.","Building natural gas infrastructure should get easier in the future by way of a recent ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission). On October 7, 2025, FERC issued a Final Rule, entitled “Removal of Regulations Limiting Authorizations to Proceed with Construction Activities Pending Rehearing” (Docket No. RM25-9-000, 193 FERC ¶61,014 (2025)). The new rule rescinds FERC’s prior rule that barred construction on gas infrastructure during project appeals. In doing so, FERC plans to accelerate energy projects to meet the growing demand for energy, due in part to the rapid build-out of data centers.

FERC Order No. 871 is a Biden-era rule that delayed construction of approved natural gas projects during the 30-day rehearing request period, or while such rehearing requests were pending. In other words, natural gas construction could not start if a party seeks rehearing of the order authorizing construction of the project for as long as the rehearing process continues. This also has meant that some projects were tolled up to 150 days for a potential rehearing request, even if no rehearing request was ultimately filed.

This Order responds to increased interest and stakeholder participation in sections 3 and 7 proceedings under the Natural Gas Act (NGA). NGA section 3 (15 U.S.C. 717b) requires FERC approval for any import or export of natural gas between the U.S. and a foreign country. Section 7 (15 U.S.C. 717f(c) and (e)) mandates that FERC only issue a certificate of a proposed pipeline if “required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.” Order No. 871 ensured that stakeholders, particularly affected landowners and community members, had a right to have their concerns fully heard and decided before construction of a pipeline could begin.

Challenges to FERC Order No. 871

Shortly after Order No. 871 was issued in 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled en banc in Allegheny Defense Project v. FERC that FERC cannot toll rehearing requests to approve natural gas infrastructure projects. The court held that doing so contravenes the NGA, which provides that if FERC does not act on a rehearing request in 30 days, the request is deemed denied.

After President Trump took office in 2025, FERC reversed course on its policy. On June 18, 2025, FERC approved a one-year temporary waiver of Order No. 871, pausing regulation enforcement through June 30, 2026. In addition, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to permanently rescind Order No. 871.

On October 7, 2025, FERC permanently revoked Order No. 871, lifting the bar on construction activities on gas infrastructure while approvals are being challenged. In the final rule, FERC stated that, “Based on these considerations and given the commission’s command pursuant to the [NGA] to encourage the orderly development of plentiful supplies of natural gas, the commission concludes that [Order No. 871] is no longer in the public interest.”

The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America commended FERC’s actions, stating that this will “expedite pipeline construction following issuance of a FERC certificate without delay…and provide[] added regulatory certainty for our members on their investments in needed natural gas infrastructure.”

Broader Implications of FERC’s Scrapping of Order No. 871

FERC’s repeal of Order No. 871 is just the latest of a series of rollbacks by the Trump Administration that seek to streamline the development of natural gas infrastructure. For example, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” directing the removal of regulatory burdens on energy projects, especially natural gas projects. On the same day, President Trump declared a national energy emergency, highlighting the importance of critical energy infrastructure for national and economic security.

Tied to national security is the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). And as AI data centers boom, the transmission grid needs to catch up. As such, on July 23, 2025, the Trump Administration published America’s AI Action Plan (the Plan). The Plan aims to simplify permitting for energy infrastructure and to accelerate construction of AI infrastructure. Along with this Plan, the Administration released Executive Order 14318, expediting the permitting process for energy projects, including natural gas pipelines.

What’s Coming Down the Pipeline

By removing restrictions on natural gas construction activities, FERC aims to accelerate energy projects to meet the demands of a growing world and the boom of AI data centers. While this move promises greater certainty and speed for pipeline projects, it also signals a broader trend toward streamlining energy infrastructure permitting under the Trump administration. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, stakeholders should remain vigilant, monitoring new policies and legal challenges that could impact future natural gas projects and the broader energy sector.

Cobalt from unregulated sites routinely enters the global supply chain, aided by falsified documentation, official collusion, and bribes paid to border officials.","This article examines the severe environmental health risks facing children who work in cobalt mines in the DRC and analyzes the legal and institutional failures that enable these harms—focusing on the limitations of international law, gaps in domestic enforcement, and the narrowing scope of the primary U.S. antibribery statute governing corporate conduct abroad. It also considers how China’s dominant position in the global cobalt supply chain and broader corporate practices further weaken protections for children’s environmental health. Framed through the lens of environmental justice and equity, the article concludes with targeted legal and policy recommendations aimed at strengthening corporate accountability, promoting ethical sourcing, and safeguarding vulnerable populations in high-risk supply chains characterized by weak oversight, environmental harm, and labor exploitation.

Cobalt Mining Effects on Children

More than 70% of the world’s cobalt is mined in the DRC, with a significant share extracted in the southeastern provinces of Lualaba and Haut-Katanga. See From Cobalt to Cars: How China Exploits Child and Forced Labor in DR Congo: Hearing Before the Cong.-Exec. Comm’n on China, 118th Cong. (Nov. 14, 2023). These regions include the mining-intensive cities of Kolwezi and Lubumbashi, where cobalt extraction dominates the local economy. In this part of the country, children face daily exposure to hazardous substances—through direct labor in cobalt mines and environmental contamination in nearby communities. See Amnesty Int’l, This Is What We Die For: Human Rights Abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Power the Global Trade in Cobalt 19–33 (2016). An estimated 35,000 to 40,000 children live or work near mining sites, many of them digging ore from narrow tunnels, hauling heavy sacks of raw cobalt, and handling minerals without gloves, masks, or access to clean water. See From Cobalt to Cars, supra. Thousands more suffer indirect exposure by inhaling cobalt-laden dust or drinking water from rivers and wells contaminated by mining runoff. See Karly Domb Sadof et al., The Hidden Costs of Cobalt Mining, Wash. Post, Feb. 28, 2018.

Despite mounting evidence from medical researchers, environmental scientists, and human rights organizations documenting cobalt’s toxic effects on human health, these conditions have persisted with little meaningful intervention. The environmental health crisis unfolding across the DRC’s mining regions is not an unforeseen consequence of rapid mineral extraction: It is the predictable outcome of weak legal enforcement, fragmented oversight, and the failure of both domestic and international systems to safeguard vulnerable communities. This section examines the environmental consequences cobalt mining imposes on Congolese children, particularly those linked to informal mining and broader governance failures.

The most acute human health risks arise in the context of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), that is, operations that rely on manual extraction with minimal mechanization and virtually no government oversight. See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Forced Labor in Cobalt Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 2–5, 22, 27–30 (May 2023). Although many ASM sites are loosely organized by traders, intermediaries, or cooperative leaders, these operations often remain informal or illegal, operating outside the regulatory framework governing industrial mining and providing little to no protection for workers or nearby residents. Id. In the cobalt sector, ASM accounts for an estimated 15 to 30% of national production and supports thousands of families. See Dorothée Baumann-Pauly, Cobalt Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Addressing Root Causes of Human Rights Abuses 3, 5 (N.Y.U. Stern Ctr. for Bus. & Hum. Rts. & Geneva Ctr. for Bus. & Hum. Rts., Feb. 2023). These sites, often dug by hand, lack reinforcement, ventilation, or safety protocols and frequently collapse.

As children dig, crush, sort, and wash cobalt ore, they inhale toxic dust and come into frequent contact with contaminated soil and water—exposures that typically occur without masks, gloves, or other basic personal protective equipment. See Amnesty Int’l, This Is What We Die For, supra, at 19–30. Prolonged inhalation of cobalt-mining dust can lead to hard metal lung disease and other respiratory ailments, while repeated interaction with polluted soil, dust, and water exposes children to uranium, lead, and other toxic metals that commonly occur alongside cobalt deposits and are released into the environment during ore extraction and processing. See Fleur Scheele et al., Cobalt Blues: Environmental Pollution and Human Rights Violations in Katanga’s Copper and Cobalt Mines 21–26 (Centre for Rsch. on Multinational Corp. 2016). Combined exposure to these metals can heighten toxic effects, increasing the overall health risks for those living and working in mining areas. See C. L. N. Banza et al., Sustainability of Artisanal Mining of Cobalt in DR Congo, 1 Nat. Sustainability 495, 498–99 (2018). Scientific studies in communities near artisanal cobalt mines have documented elevated concentrations of these metals in children’s blood and urine, with biomarkers indicating systemic toxicity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. Id. Such health outcomes are not anomalies—they reflect widespread, predictable consequences of ASM’s unregulated nature and the government’s failure to implement health-protective regulation.

Beyond acute respiratory and toxicological symptoms, chronic exposure to cobalt and associated heavy metals poses serious long-term risks to children’s health in affected mining regions. See Connor W. Brown et al., Occupational, Environmental, and Toxicological Health Risks of Mining Metals for Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Narrative Review of the PubMed Database, 19 J. Occupational Med. & Toxicology 35, 37 (2024). Children are especially vulnerable due to higher absorption rates, immature detoxification systems, and frequent hand-to-mouth behaviors that increase exposure to mining pollutants. See RAID & AFREWATCH, Beneath the Green: A Critical Look at the Environmental and Human Costs of Industrial Cobalt Mining in DRC 40 (Mar. 2024). Compounding these dangers are malnutrition, unsanitary living conditions, and limited access to medical care. See Amnesty Int’l, This Is What We Die For, supra, at 23–24, 30–32. For many children, long hours in or near mining sites replace time in school, reinforcing cycles of poverty and ill health. Id. at 28–32.

Nowhere are these environmental health risks more visible than in Kolwezi, where artisanal sites operate just steps from homes, schools, and markets. In neighborhoods like Kasulo, families live amid open pits, metal-laden waste, and clouds of dust. See Todd C. Frankel, The Cobalt Pipeline: Tracing the Path from Deadly Hand-Dug Mines in Congo to Consumers’ Phones and Laptops, Wash. Post, Sept. 30, 2016. A 2018 study found that children living near these sites had urinary cobalt levels more than 10 times higher than those in non-mining areas, with elevated levels of uranium and manganese as well. See Banza et al., supra, at 498–99. Researchers found signs of toxic exposure even among children not directly engaged in mining, illustrating how environmental contamination affects entire communities, not just those working in the mines. Id. at 500–01. In Kolwezi, as in other mining communities, families face stark choices: expose their children to toxic environments in exchange for income or slip deeper into poverty. These conditions persist with little oversight—underscoring how the DRC’s cobalt economy externalizes its environmental and health costs onto its most vulnerable residents.

Cobalt Supply Chains and Global Accountability

The environmental harms facing Congolese mining communities are not simply by-products of weak enforcement—they are embedded in a transnational supply chain that obscures origin, fragments responsibility, and rewards opacity. Although the DRC produces most of the world’s cobalt, the path from mine to market is shaped by layers of intermediaries, refiners, and manufacturers whose geographic and legal distance from extraction sites renders accountability elusive. China is at the center of this structure, controlling the vast majority of cobalt refining capacity and holding significant stakes in the DRC’s most productive mines. This concentration of power enables downstream firms to source cobalt at scale while avoiding direct engagement with the conditions of its extraction, deepening the disconnect between environmental justice principles and global resource governance.

Chinese companies now own or control stakes in at least 15 of the 19 largest industrial cobalt operations in the DRC, including some of the country’s highest-output mines. See Patrick Anderson, Cobalt and Corruption: The Influence of Multinational Firms and Foreign States on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 14 J. Glob. Bus. & Cmty. 1, 2, 7–9 (2023). Firms such as China Molybdenum, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and Sinohydro have secured long-term access through joint ventures with state-owned Congolese companies and opaque acquisitions brokered over the past two decades. Id. at 7–9. These companies often indirectly rely on subcontractors and intermediaries to source cobalt, including material from artisanal mining sites. See Matthieu Bolay & Filipe Calvão, Labour, Incorporated: Dependent Contracting and Wageless Work in Africa’s “Responsible” Mines, 62 Cahiers d’Études Africaines, no. 245/246 (1/2), 2022, at 123, 134–36. Once extracted, most raw cobalt is exported to China for refining and processing. See Suleyman O. Altiparmak et al., Cornering the Market with Foreign Direct Investments: China’s Cobalt Politics, 7 Renewable & Sustainable Energy Transition, art. 100113, at 5–6 (2025). By 2024, Chinese refineries handled approximately 83% of global cobalt output—up from 65% in 2018—and the six largest refiners globally are all Chinese. See Jon Emont, How China Beat Out the U.S. to Become the Top Player in Rare-Earths Refining, Wall St. J., Mar. 24, 2025. From there, cobalt enters manufacturing chains that supply battery producers and end-users across North America, Europe, and Asia. See U.S. Energy Info. Admin., China Dominates Global Trade of Battery Minerals (May 21, 2025). This vertically integrated model consolidates China’s control over sourcing and processing while creating multiple degrees of separation between multinational buyers and extraction sites—particularly those reliant on artisanal or unregulated labor. The resulting structure generates an accountability gap that obscures the true human and environmental costs of the global cobalt trade.

This arrangement allows multinational firms to benefit from Congolese cobalt while remaining insulated from the conditions under which it is mined. Brands such as Apple, Tesla, Samsung, and General Motors remain heavily reliant on cobalt processed through predominantly Chinese-controlled channels, where sourcing practices are often unclear and weakly regulated. See RAID & CAJJ, The Road to Ruin? Electric Vehicles and Workers’ Rights Abuses at DR Congo’s Industrial Cobalt Mines 6, 14, 18–19, 25–28, 60, 65 (Nov. 2021). While these companies typically do not purchase directly from ASM sites, they profit from a procurement system in which cobalt extracted under hazardous and exploitative conditions is indistinguishably blended into global supply. See Siddharth Kara, Cobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives (2023). In 2019, several Congolese families filed suit in Doe v. Apple Inc., alleging that Apple, Alphabet, Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla had “knowingly benefited” from forced child labor in cobalt mines operated by their suppliers. The complaint described children working underground for as little as two dollars a day, exposed to tunnel collapses and toxic dust without protective equipment. The suit was ultimately dismissed on procedural grounds, including lack of standing and difficulty establishing direct causation—highlighting the structural challenges of imposing liability on downstream firms. See Compl. ¶¶ 5–8, Doe v. Apple Inc., No. 1:19-cv-03737 (D.D.C. Dec. 16, 2019).

Many companies cite supplier audits, traceability initiatives, and voluntary certification schemes as evidence of ethical sourcing. Yet, these mechanisms often fail to detect or deter the flow of cobalt from unregulated ASM operations. Certification programs—such as the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process—rely heavily on self-reporting and limited third-party verification, methods ill-suited to fragmented, transnational supply chains. See Galit A. Sarfaty & Raphael Deberdt, Supply Chain Governance at a Distance, 49 Law & Soc. Inquiry 1036, 1046–53 (2024). In practice, corporate actors operate within systems where legal responsibility is diffused, while profits remain concentrated. Public commitments to responsible sourcing frequently coexist with procurement practices that externalize social and environmental risks onto those at the base of the supply chain. Id. at 1052–53.

Recent U.S. and European initiatives aim to correct structural imbalances in the global cobalt trade. The U.S. Department of State’s Minerals Security Partnership promotes secure and resilient supply chains by supporting investment in critical minerals projects in resource-rich nations and recently endorsed principles for high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. Similarly, the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act introduces mechanisms to diversify sourcing and improve transparency. While these policies signal a shift toward greater market resilience, they remain in early stages and focus primarily on securing material access—not labor protections, environmental safeguards, or governance reforms in producer countries. Unless accompanied by parallel efforts to formalize ASM, combat corruption, and strengthen local enforcement, supply chain restructuring risks becoming a geopolitical strategy that marginalizes the communities most affected by extraction.

Global awareness of cobalt’s human costs is growing, and reform efforts are becoming more visible. But without robust legal accountability and investment in equitable governance at the source, the harms embedded in cobalt supply chains will continue to fall on Congolese mining communities, particularly children, even as global markets reap the rewards.

Legal and Regulatory Gaps in Cobalt Governance

Despite the severity of environmental and labor abuses in the DRC’s cobalt mining sector, international human rights law remains ill-equipped to address these harms. Key instruments, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Labour Organization’s Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, establish standards but lack enforcement mechanisms. The CRC relies on mandatory periodic reporting rather than adjudicatory remedies. See U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3. Convention No. 182 depends on domestic implementation and provides no international complaints mechanism or private right of action for victims. Similarly, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are nonbinding and impose no legal obligations on companies. Advocacy efforts to develop a binding treaty on business and human rights or to codify “ecocide” under the Rome Statute have gained traction but remain politically stalled. See Joe Udell, Environmental Destruction and Human Rights Abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Examining the Epicenter of the Cobalt Mining Industry from an International Criminal Law Perspective, 32 Minn. J. Int’l L. 195, 198–200, 212–13, 215–16 (2023).

While international frameworks remain aspirational, the implementation of mining regulations in the DRC presents its own systemic failures. The 2018 Mining Code includes provisions to formalize ASM, protect workers, and establish designated artisanal mining zones (Zones d’Exploitation Artisanale, ZEAs), but enforcement remains sporadic and ineffective. Most artisanal miners continue to operate in unregulated conditions, as ZEAs either do not exist or lack meaningful oversight—leaving workers vulnerable to hazardous conditions, extortion, and violence. SAEMAPE, the agency tasked with supporting and monitoring artisanal mining, often lacks the resources to inspect sites or enforce safety protocols. See Emmanuel Umpula et al., Islands of Responsibility? Corporate Sourcing of Artisanal Cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Int’l Inst. for Env’t & Dev. 10–11, 18–19 (2021).

Corruption and institutional weakness further undermine oversight. In 2019, the government created two new institutions: the Entreprise Générale du Cobalt (EGC), tasked with formalizing artisanal cobalt purchasing, and the Autorité de Régulation et de Contrôle des Marchés des Substances Minérales Stratégiques (ARECOMS), charged with overseeing strategic mineral exports. Both were designed to improve traceability and curb illicit trade. Nevertheless, oversight remains weak despite these mandates. EGC has failed to stem illegal mining or smuggling, while ARECOMS continues to face operational challenges due to limited capacity and persistent corruption. See Aymeric Vincenot, DR Congo Bets on Cobalt Export Freeze to Halt Price Tumble, Agence France-Presse (Mar. 9, 2025). A 2025 study on environmental crime and mineral governance found that informal mining in the DRC remains largely beyond government control. See Zeynab Malakouti & Mohammad Hazrati, Interconnected Challenges: Examining the Nexus of Environmental Crime and Money Laundering in the Context of Energy Transition, 8 J. Econ. Criminol., art. 100151, at 4 (2025). Cobalt from unregulated sites routinely enters the global supply chain, aided by falsified documentation, official collusion, and bribes paid to border officials. See Henry Lazenby, Middlemen Siphon Billions from War-Ravaged DRC’s Cobalt, Coltan Trade, Mining.com (Feb. 10, 2025). According to a 2024 ENACT Observer report, the DRC loses nearly $1 billion annually to smuggling into Rwanda alone. See Oluwole Ojewale, Illegal Cobalt Mining Taints Transition to Green Technology, ENACT Observer (May 27, 2024). These failures not only erode the rule of law but also allow multinationals to source Congolese cobalt with little assurance that it was mined ethically or legally.

As domestic enforcement falters, transnational legal tools have been used to pursue corporate accountability. Chief among them is the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits bribing foreign officials for business advantage. In 2022, Glencore International AG, a multinational mining and commodities trading company, pleaded guilty to bribing Congolese officials in exchange for access to cobalt and copper concessions. See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Just., Glencore Entered Guilty Pleas to Foreign Bribery and Market Manipulation Schemes (May 24, 2022). Yet, the case focused narrowly on financial misconduct and failed to address the broader labor and environmental abuses linked to Glencore’s operations. This narrow prosecutorial focus on bribery, rather than the broader supply chain abuses, reflects a deeper limitation in transnational enforcement: While bribery can trigger prosecution, systemic harms embedded in global supply chains often escape legal scrutiny. See Udell, supra, at 229–30.

Recent enforcement trends have further narrowed the reach of the FCPA. While early applications of the statute targeted systemic corporate misconduct, more recent cases have focused on individual executive culpability, often addressing discrete acts of bribery rather than broader patterns of abuse in global operations. See Veronica A. Guerrero et al., FCPA Enforcement: Back with a Twist? DOJ Issues New FCPA Guidelines Following Trump Executive Order, Arnold & Porter (June 11, 2025). This shift was previewed in February 2025, when an executive order directed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to pause new FCPA enforcement actions pending a policy review. See Exec. Order 14,209, Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security, 90 Fed. Reg. 9587, 9588 (Feb. 14, 2025). Citing concerns about economic competitiveness and supply chain security, the directive raised alarm among anticorruption advocates who feared it signaled a broader retreat from corporate accountability abroad. Although the pause was lifted in June 2025, new DOJ guidance narrowed enforcement priorities to cases implicating U.S. strategic interests (such as critical minerals and national security), while deemphasizing broader corporate misconduct. See Memorandum from U.S. Dep’t of Just., Guidelines for Investigations and Enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (June 9, 2025). This change in focus has diminished the FCPA’s deterrent power, particularly in sectors like cobalt mining, where harms arise not from isolated acts of bribery but from structural conditions of environmental degradation, forced labor, and unclear supply chains.

In the absence of binding legal mandates, corporations have turned to voluntary initiatives to demonstrate ethical compliance. Programs such as the Cobalt Industry Responsible Assessment Framework and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Due Diligence Guidance promote supply chain accountability but rely primarily on company self-reporting, with limited independent oversight or enforcement. Membership or participation is typically not revoked for noncompliance unless the failure is egregious or publicly exposed, leaving implementation effectively self-managed. These frameworks often prioritize reputational risk management over systemic reform, enabling companies to project a façade of ethical sourcing while distancing themselves from labor and environmental conditions at the extraction stage. See Umpula et al., supra, at 4. Many shift the burden of compliance onto local suppliers or third-party auditors, creating fragmented oversight with limited transparency. See Filipe Calvão et al., Cobalt Mining and the Corporate Outsourcing of Responsibility in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 8 Extractive Indus. & Soc’y, no. 4, 2021, art. 100884, at 8–9. In practice, this outsourcing of responsibility has enabled cobalt from hazardous and unregulated artisanal sites to enter global markets under the veneer of due diligence. Id. at 5–6, 8–9.

These layered failures—across international law, domestic governance, transnational enforcement, and corporate policy—create a global accountability vacuum where human rights and environmental harms persist unchecked. International legal instruments remain nonbinding or aspirational; domestic regulators in the DRC struggle with corruption, weak capacity, and institutional underperformance; and transnational tools like the FCPA are narrowly applied or temporarily paused. At the same time, voluntary corporate frameworks often allow companies to claim compliance even though oversight of upstream labor and environmental conditions at cobalt mining sites remains weak. See Amnesty Int’l, Time to Recharge: Corporate Action and Inaction to Tackle Abuses in the Cobalt Supply Chain 5–6, 8–9, 75 (2017). Absent mechanisms that align legal authority with corporate behavior, the inequities of the DRC’s cobalt economy will continue to fall on those least empowered to resist them.

Toward Accountability and Reform

Addressing the environmental health crisis linked to cobalt mining in the DRC requires more than market diversification or voluntary oversight. Legal and policy reforms must put the rights and health of affected communities at the center while closing the accountability gaps that enable global supply chains to profit from harm. The following measures, grounded in environmental justice and regulatory equity, offer a path forward.

First, domestic enforcement in the DRC must be strengthened through sustained investment in institutions tasked with overseeing artisanal mining. Agencies such as SAEMAPE and ARECOMS need stable funding, technical capacity, and operational independence to monitor mine sites, enforce safety standards, and trace mineral flows. The formalization of ASM—long promised but rarely realized—should be treated not as a bureaucratic benchmark, but as a human rights imperative. International donors and development banks can support these efforts by conditioning infrastructure and mineral-sector financing on transparent enforcement benchmarks and anticorruption safeguards.

Second, the United States should restore and expand the substantive reach of the FCPA. Future enforcement should move beyond transactional bribery to address broader patterns of misconduct, including environmental harm, labor exploitation, and corruption embedded in transnational supply chains. Given the extraterritorial nature of cobalt sourcing and mineral trade, U.S. efforts should be coordinated with complementary frameworks such as the UK Bribery Act and emerging European corporate accountability legislation.

Third, governments in cobalt-importing countries should replace voluntary sourcing frameworks with mandatory due diligence requirements. Recent EU legislation requiring companies to assess and address human rights and environmental risks across their supply chains provides a model. In the United States, disclosure-based laws—such as the Dodd-Frank conflict minerals provision—could be expanded to include cobalt, with specific attention to child labor, toxic exposure, and traceability gaps. Companies that fail to conduct meaningful risk assessments, or that knowingly source from unregulated artisanal mining sites, should face enforceable legal consequences.

Fourth, affected communities must have a voice in monitoring and remedy efforts. Civil society organizations and community-based observers in cobalt mining regions should be funded and empowered to report abuses, monitor site conditions, and provide ground-level feedback on whether sourcing practices reflect local realities. Community participation in oversight initiatives and grievance processes is essential to establish legitimacy and build trust. To root these systems in local perspectives, international minerals partnerships should require Congolese civil society representation in governance structures and ensure community members have access to complaint mechanisms that yield meaningful outcomes.

Finally, supply chain resilience must be redefined to include environmental health and human rights. Policies promoting critical mineral security—whether through domestic production, stockpiling, or foreign investment—also should embed standards for safe working conditions, pollution prevention, and child protection. Public and private procurement frameworks should incorporate environmental justice criteria into supplier eligibility, rewarding firms that demonstrate ethical sourcing at the ground level.

As the world accelerates toward a clean energy future, the urgency of securing critical minerals must not eclipse the rights of those most harmed by their extraction. In cobalt-rich regions of the DRC, children continue to suffer toxic and exploitative consequences of a supply chain built for efficiency, not accountability. These harms are not inevitable. They stem from legal failures, weak enforcement, and corporate structures that obscure responsibility. Ensuring that environmental progress does not come at the cost of human dignity requires more than due diligence checklists or corporate pledges of ethical sourcing. It demands enforceable laws, equitable oversight, and sustained international engagement with the communities that power the transition. Only by closing legal and accountability gaps can the energy transition fulfill its promise of equity as well as sustainability.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/editorial/16x9/16x9-editorial-mine-congo-child-57575632.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:04:46.456548

While both political parties are taken to task in the book, blue states and Democratic policies are a focus from a left-of-center perspective. Whether it is the inability to build high-speed rail in the country, the failure to develop energy generation and transmission projects to meet surging energy demand and mitigate climate change, or being incapable of constructing new housing at a pace to tackle cost of living concerns, the status quo is not working. Further, Klein and Thompson argue that these failings have political implications, with Democratic elected officials losing voters’ trust because of governing failures in blue cities and states. The issues highlighted in the book are at the core of the work of many Section members, and the expectation is that abundance-related policy and politics will remain center stage in the near term.

One Klein and Thompson criticism is that environmental and similar laws, while necessary, have become focused on process over outcome. An abundance agenda seeks to reform government (e.g., loosening zoning laws, simplifying environmental permitting, speeding up infrastructure projects) to focus on building and innovation as central to liberal governance. This approach requires honesty that there are trade-offs involved. For example, advancing infrastructure projects more quickly may result in greater localized environmental impacts, or NIMBY opposition to housing density may need to take a back seat to the greater public benefit of more and cheaper homes in blue states.

Climate change is an example of our inability to tackle big problems. There is simply no scenario where the U.S. both can meet surging energy demand due to data centers and emerging AI technologies and mitigate climate change without a historic and herculean effort to build the necessary energy infrastructure. The Biden administration prioritized climate change unlike any prior administration. Congress passed historic legislation providing hundreds of billions of dollars to build the necessary infrastructure. However, the federal government and blue state approach to environmental reviews and permitting for the necessary infrastructure did not align with those policy goals and the claimed urgency. The U.S. must build more and at unprecedented speed, scale, and scope. Klein and Thompson argue that Democratic elected officials should shift toward supporting pro-growth and development policies, particularly in the energy sector. Politicians who want to enact ambitious government programs need to show voters they are capable of implementing such programs.

Nowhere is this policy and political shift more apparent than in California, where Governor Newsom and other elected officials have adopted abundance-focused policies. When signing legislation to limit the applicability of the California Environmental Quality Act to housing development, Governor Newsom explained, “We’re urgently embracing an abundance agenda by tearing down the barriers that have delayed new affordable housing and infrastructure for decades.” Newsom also signed legislation lifting the moratorium on carbon dioxide pipelines, which are critical for carbon capture and sequestration projects, and signed legislation to authorize the development of additional oil and gas resources in the state. Notably, not all Democratic elected officials support the abundance movement, and there is certainly NGO and other opposition.

The differing opinions on the abundance movement preview potential political fault lines within the Democratic Party, which may have electoral but also practical implications on public policy priorities relevant to Section members and our clients. The lasting power of the abundance movement may impact the ability to push necessary infrastructure development, thereby restoring public faith in the role of government to provide a foundation for the county to tackle big problems.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-powerlines-1341067698.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:02.047044

Finally, integrating a more granular approach to environmental justice in drinking water contamination law necessitates a more localized approach.
Despite the Trump administration’s disinterest in environmental justice at the federal level, its decentralized approach to this issue may permit the persistence of environmental justice efforts at other geographic levels.","Exposure to PFAS contamination is associated with a wide variety of detrimental health effects. The immune system and thyroid function can be compromised, and liver and kidney diseases are more likely, as are reproductive and infant development issues. S.E. Fenton et al., Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Toxicity and Human Health Review: Current State of Knowledge and Strategies for Informing Future Research, 40 Env’t Toxicology & Chemistry 606 (2021). Certain types of cancer are also more prevalent with PFAS exposure. While research on these effects is ongoing, the present understanding of these effects is that they are chronic, except in cases of extremely high exposure. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency (EPA), Our Current Understanding of the Human Health and Environmental Risks of PFAS (2024). Higher exposures in adults are generally associated with occupational risks, such as industrial workers or firefighters who produce and use PFAS products consistently. The risk of high-level exposure in children presents a different, more concerning issue.

Because children are smaller than adults, the relative concentration of contaminants to body size presents a more significant health risk. Further, young children are more likely to be exposed to PFAS-derived products while crawling and putting objects in their mouths. These exposures can lead to developmental effects or delays, variation in bone growth, puberty changes, and even behavioral issues. These effects may be subtle and widespread across populations who are exposed, even at relatively low levels, to PFAS in their environment and drinking water. Jennifer L. Ames, Vanshika Sharma & Kristen Lyall, Effects of Early-life PFAS Exposure on Child Neurodevelopment: A Review of the Evidence and Research Gaps, 12 Current Env’t Health Rep. 9 (2025). While we are still working to assess the social correlates of PFAS contamination, we would expect them to correlate to patterns of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as do other categories of drinking water contamination. David Switzer & Manuel P. Teodoro, Class, Race, Ethnicity, and Justice in Safe Drinking Water Compliance, 99 Soc. Sci. Q. 524 (2018). Consequently, regulation of PFAS contamination of drinking water has become a hot topic in environmental regulation broadly and environmental justice specifically.

How Is PFAS Contamination in Drinking Water Regulated?

Local drinking water utilities are governed by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f et seq. (2018). Under the SDWA, utilities are required to regularly collect samples, which are sent to a certified laboratory and tested for a variety of contaminants. Violations come in a variety of forms, but health violations are the most salient and include sample contaminant levels in excess of regulatory standards and failures to comply with treatment technique standards. The EPA regularly releases data on these violations and water utilities more generally, allowing social scientists to test for correlations between the likelihood of violations and a variety of potential causes, ranging from utility characteristics to the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic composition of the populations those utilities serve. David M. Konisky & Manuel P. Teodoro, When Governments Regulate Governments, 60 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 559 (2016). This analysis of social and demographic correlations is an effort to pursue environmental justice and address the unequal distribution of violations in areas that are poor and disproportionately made up of members of disadvantaged communities. Switzer & Teodoro, supra. Nearly 100 contaminants are currently regulated under the SDWA, with more being added all the time. PFAS constitute the most recent set of additions to the list.

In 2024, EPA established regulatory limits for PFAS contamination in drinking water under the SDWA. See PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation, 89 Fed. Reg. 32,532 (Apr. 26, 2024). The rule sets limits for six categories of PFAS compounds: four parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and PFOS, and four more categories (perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, or GenX)) individually as well as aggregated in the form of an aggregated Hazard Index, the regulatory limit for which is set to 1.0. At present, these levels are remarkably aggressive in comparison to PFAS regulations globally. This decision has faced criticism from both scientists, who question their grounding in toxicology and epidemiology, J.A. Cotruvo, S.B. Goldhaber & A.J.B. Cohen, EPA’s Unprecedented Interim Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS, 61 Groundwater 301 (2023), and industry groups, who cite high costs as a concern. A.L. Ling, Estimated Scale of Costs to Remove PFAS from the Environment at Current Emission Rates, 918 Sci. Total Env’t 170647 (2024).

This rule was promulgated under the Biden administration, and the administration’s commentary on the topic makes clear that environmental justice is to be a primary factor in implementation. EPA, Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes First-Ever National Drinking Water Standard to Protect 100M People from PFAS Pollution (2024). The Trump administration claimed credit for the rule (noting its origins in a 2019 initiative) and asserted its continued enforcement. While the Trump EPA does not explicitly reject the concept of environmental justice, broader trends at the agency indicate that environmental justice will not be a priority. EPA, EPA Announces It Will Keep Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFOA, PFOS (May 14, 2025). Instead, the Trump administration frames PFAS regulation in terms of small, rural communities, suggesting that these communities will require additional time to comply. This approach is in tension with the data on PFAS, which indicates that contamination is not as likely in less dense communities.

These regulations are designed to be gradually phased in, not taking full effect until 2029. However, testing for PFAS contamination of drinking water is already underway, and EPA has released the resultant data as part of the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule dataset, allowing analysis of PFAS contamination across a large set of drinking water utilities, as well as its correlation to social and demographic factors. EPA, Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule Data Finder (2024). As such, we can examine this issue quantitatively through an environmental justice lens to assess the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic correlates of PFAS contamination in drinking water.

Where and When Is PFAS Contamination Likely?

Environmental justice work on previously regulated contaminants under the SDWA has tended to treat all contaminants as basically identical, lumping them in together and looking at the patterns of race and ethnicity in SDWA violations in the aggregate. Switzer & Teodoro, supra. Our analysis of the new data on PFAS levels above the regulatory standard forces us to reconsider that picture. Michael A. Powell, David Switzer, & Manuel P. Teodoro, Disaggregating Disparities: Divergent Contamination in a Diverse Country, in Safe Drinking Water Act: The Next Fifty Years (Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming). While the data on the new PFAS “Hazard Index” are too sparse for statistical analysis at this stage, we were able to analyze PFOS and PFOA contamination individually, and we found that the picture is substantially more complicated.

Our traditional understanding of the environmental justice of drinking water contamination—supported by aggregated statistical analysis—would suggest that the probability of contamination correlates positively with the percentage of a water system’s service population that is Black and/or Hispanic. Id. However, while the presence of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water is indeed positively correlated with the percent of the population served that is Black, PFOA is negatively correlated with the percent that is Hispanic. PFOS shows no significant correlation to Hispanic population. In short, PFAS is a problem primarily for Black communities, but not Hispanic ones, a fact that would not be apparent if they were aggregated with other violations of SDWA standards. Indeed, when we look specifically at nitrate contamination—usually attributable to agricultural runoff in rural areas—we find that the opposite pattern holds, and contamination is likelier for Hispanic than Black communities.

The relationship between PFAS contamination and community demographics is similarly complex. While SDWA violations in aggregate are likelier in poorer areas, the probability of PFOA contamination increases with increasing median household income and decreases as economic inequality widens—that is, PFOA contamination is most likely in wealthy communities. PFOS contamination is likeliest in very densely populated communities; however, aggregated SDWA violations are less likely in denser communities, but more likely in municipalities that serve a larger population in total (controlling for density).

Examining the characteristics of water systems likely to be contaminated with PFAS in excess of the regulatory standard hones our geography further. PFAS contamination is likeliest in older systems, possibly due to the simple fact that the stability of PFAS in the environment means that it is likeliest where it has had an opportunity to accumulate over time, and newer systems are most likely to be built in newly established communities.

In sum, PFAS contamination is disproportionately a problem for communities that are wealthy, long-established, and densely populated, with a history of heavy industry, with populations that are more Black but less Hispanic. This is in contrast not only with the pattern of SDWA violations more broadly—which are likeliest in communities that are both Black and Hispanic, with low income levels and large populations—and other categories of contaminant. Coliform, a prototypical bacterial contaminant with acute effects that lead to immediate endangerment of children, is correlated almost exclusively with population density; nitrate, which also can cause acute health issues that are particularly dangerous for infants, is likeliest in places with relatively high median income but an inequitable economic distribution. Both contaminants were regulated under the SDWA long before PFAS standards were implemented, and they remain a serious problem in many American communities.

More significantly, exposure to these “traditional” SDWA contaminants presents an emergent health threat, particularly to infants and children. The potential health effects of PFAS contamination are substantial, but they present a chronic rather than acute threat to human health, even in children, except in cases where exposure is very high. We might be tempted, in response to recent coverage of PFAS contamination and, perhaps, in search of precedent, to focus more of our energy on litigation arising from the new PFAS standards. We should take care in pursuing that impulse: While drinking water enforcement and litigation are not necessarily a zero-sum game across nearly 100 SDWA-governed contaminants, an excessive focus on PFAS may lead us to underrepresent the needs of communities whose children are in imminent danger from water tainted by more traditional contaminants that are currently less in the limelight.

As legal professionals, we also should be cognizant of the makeup of the communities we represent. Though PFAS is a significant public health issue that disproportionately impacts the Black community, it is also likeliest in communities that have the financial resources to address the issue. A disproportionate focus on PFAS contamination is, in effect, steering resources desperately needed by poor, rural communities to relatively wealthy, urban communities that likely have the ability to mitigate contamination despite a concentration of a historically disadvantaged population group, mirroring the competing frames of the PFAS rule under the Biden and Trump administrations. While the detrimental effects of PFAS on child development are significant and meaningful, a failure to address acute nitrate contamination may lead to death or permanent disability. Further, because PFAS contamination is less likely in Hispanic communities, focusing on it to the exclusion of other, less headline-grabbing contaminants may disadvantage that historically excluded group, even as Black populations benefit. While a response to the new regulations is natural, and even reasonable, we must take care not to overreact in response to novelty.

The Future of Environmental Justice in Safe Drinking Water

The new regulatory standards for PFAS contamination of drinking water arrive at a tumultuous moment for regulatory law. The recent decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), presages a foundational change to environmental governance broadly and environmental justice in drinking water specifically. Loper Bright abolished the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to give broad deference to the expertise of regulators in the implementation of legislation, in favor of the level of deference granted in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944). Under Skidmore, courts are given primacy in the interpretation of legislative ambiguity, relegating regulators to a secondary role. In effect, this reversion transfers considerable power from the bureaucracy to courts. Putting aside assessment of that decision, it has substantial ramifications for any area of regulation defined by a high level of technical expertise. While we should presume the judiciary possesses considerable technical expertise in the legal arena, those of us who attended law school know that little to no time was spent on the particulars and mechanics of various chemical compounds, to say nothing of that chemistry’s effects on complex ecological systems or human toxicology. Continuing to work in these highly technical areas will require a reallocation of time and expertise for practicing attorneys.

In short, those of us who practice law relating to drinking water contamination should work to develop a deeper level of technical knowledge and to communicate the complex realities of environmental justice to judges who may now be forced to grapple with a host of highly technical regulatory areas. Winning strategies for litigation going forward will require attorneys to be adept at not only understanding the legal ramifications, but also the underlying scientific (and social scientific) reasoning governing those decisions. More importantly, we must develop the ability to communicate these highly technical concepts clearly and concisely. Understanding and communicating the differing patterns of various SDWA contaminants in use, health implications, and social correlations will be paramount, particularly in the early stages of the post–Loper Bright world. Until courts develop their own highly expert bureaucracy, it will be incumbent on us to distill the vast complexities of social and scientific interactions in drinking water regulation to a form compelling and usable by the judiciary. These complexities will have lasting public health implications for communities of color and, in particular, children of color.

Those of us interested in environmental justice also must take on a new burden in understanding the social and political ramifications of safe drinking water regulation and litigation. We must move beyond the impulse to treat Black, Hispanic, and low-income voters as broadly aligned and aggregated and engage with the more complicated reality of difficult trade-offs between disadvantaged communities. See, e.g., Hakeem Jefferson, The Curious Case of Black “Conservatives”: Assessing the Validity of the Liberal-Conservative Scale Among Black Americans, 88 Pub. Op. Q. 909 (2024); Eileen Díaz McConnell & Daniela A. Carreon, “It’s Not About Numbers, It’s About Power”: How Latino Young Adults Imagine the Ethnic and Racial Demographic Future of the United States, Am. Behav. Sci. (2024). Not only will understanding these societal linkages be vital to winning court cases, but they also must inform the practice of environmental justice law itself. If we are to continue to be on the front lines of the environmental justice struggle and continue to harness our legal skills to protect children from environmental degradation and contamination, we need to remain cognizant of the distributive effects of the allocation of our time and effort, particularly in the pro bono and public service arenas that are focused primarily on aiding underrepresented groups and individuals otherwise without the resources to retain legal counsel. Our ability to direct resources to where they are most needed gets at our most foundational obligation to professional ethics.

Failing to do so not only has ethical ramifications, but also political ramifications. The excessive aggregation of environmental justice analysis may have feedback effects that reinforce polarized, reactionary politics. The perceived redistribution of societal benefits away from rural areas in favor of urban populations has created significant political division over the last several years. Katherine J. Cramer, The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker (Univ. of Chi. Press 2016). Further, amalgamating racial and ethnic groups despite differing patterns in the distribution of drinking water contamination is likely to breed resentment in those communities, further fracturing the political landscape. Ivelisse Cuevas-Molina, White Racial Identity, Racial Attitudes, and Latino Partisanship, 8 J. Race, Ethnicity & Pol. 469 (2023). The effect of policy on social identity is profound, particularly for children and in interaction with other categories associated with social disadvantage. Mary Elizabeth Collins & Michelle Mead, Social Constructions of Children and Youth: Beyond Dependents and Deviants, 50 J. Soc. Pol’y 493 (2021). Failing to understand and address these patterns risks the further degradation of decades of imperfect but important environmental justice advocacy and litigation.

Finally, integrating a more granular approach to environmental justice in drinking water contamination law necessitates a more localized approach. Because of the variety of patterns across the numerous types of water contaminants governed under the SDWA, effective management of contaminant issues will be most effective at a local level where mitigation can be carefully and specifically targeted. The political landscape necessitates a similar approach to advocacy; under the current Congress, presidential administration, and Supreme Court, expanding the capabilities of regulatory agencies at the federal level is unlikely to succeed, particularly where the justification is grounded in environmental justice concerns. However, because of the SDWA’s highly delegated structure, there remains considerable opportunity to engage with these issues at the state and local levels. The current administration even has signaled a willingness to permit this type of engagement, emphasizing flexibility for water systems in rural communities in complying with the new PFAS standards. EPA, EPA Announces It Will Keep Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFOA, PFOS (2025). Despite the Trump administration’s disinterest in environmental justice at the federal level, its decentralized approach to this issue may permit the persistence of environmental justice efforts at other geographic levels. Focusing on not only advocacy but also negotiation and litigation at the state and local levels is the right approach to addressing the disparate patterns of contamination.

Scaling Up State and Local Mitigation Efforts

By focusing on smaller geographic scales for enforcement, we complicate the process of achieving safer drinking water at the national scale. However, doing so is not only the correct approach to tackling PFAS contamination in drinking water, but also offers the opportunity to work upward. State and local mitigation efforts offer useful test cases that may be scaled upward, particularly in states like California, Texas, or Pennsylvania, which possess large, diverse populations and a variety of land uses. Focusing on these potentially scalable laboratories of regulation is useful for not only testing effectiveness but also scalability, maximizing the likelihood that the approaches transmit both upward—to federal policy—and outward to other states. Local, granular approaches to solving drinking water contamination are the way forward—for attorneys, for communities, and for our children.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-child-water-cup-98478537.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:07.079280

264, 622) (noting changes to the NEPA regulations for the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Transit Administration); see also Fed.","These shifts, which generally portend a leaner NEPA process, come at a time when federal agencies and private sector partners are looking to achieve rapid development of data centers to meet the population’s data-processing needs. Data centers are essentially physical locations to store and process data; they also require significant amounts of energy and water. With the recent NEPA changes, data center developers and other complex project proponents may see a more streamlined NEPA process.

NEPA was the first major federal environmental law passed in the United States. It established a process that requires agencies to take a “hard look” at potential environmental impacts of their actions. NEPA applies to “proposals for . . . major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). Generally, a “major Federal action” includes any project that the federal government conducts, funds, or approves. The agencies review potential impacts through an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). EAs are relatively brief reports that agencies use to determine whether the environmental impacts of a proposed project warrant an EIS. An EIS is a lengthy and detailed report that provides a more comprehensive analysis of the project’s environmental impacts and assesses potential alternatives to the proposed project. EAs are the most common NEPA compliance tool, as most federal actions do not have a significant effect on the environment.

NEPA only dictates procedural requirements, not a particular outcome on project approval. Seven Cntys. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1507 (2025) (“NEPA is a purely procedural statute. . . . [It] does not require the agency to weigh environmental consequences in any particular way.”). Because litigants cannot challenge the substance of an agency’s decision via NEPA, they typically argue that noncompliance—like a failure to identify an impact or an inadequate evaluation of one—resulted in an “arbitrary and capricious” decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Where project opponents can prove procedural deficiencies, the court may remand the case for further agency proceedings, vacate the agency action, or enjoin the project. These lawsuits invariably add time and costs to a proposed project.

Despite NEPA establishing procedural requirements, the statute does not identify the exact details for fulfilling those requirements. That gap is where CEQ and federal agencies have traditionally stepped in with implementing regulations.

CEQ promulgated ubiquitous NEPA implementation regulations (now guidance). First issued in 1978, CEQ regulations specified, among other things, the required scope, timeline, and page limits of NEPA documents. Implementation of Procedural Provisions, 43 Fed. Reg. 55,978 (Nov. 29, 1978). Notably, CEQ’s implementing regulations applied to the entire federal government. Thus, any additional regulations promulgated by individual agencies had to be consistent with those already created by CEQ.

Despite CEQ regulations guiding NEPA implementation for nearly 50 years, CEQ’s authority to promulgate regulations was recently denied. In lawsuits challenging CEQ’s 2024 regulatory changes, two federal courts separately held that CEQ lacked authority to issue binding regulations. See Marin Audubon Soc’y v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 121 F.4th 902 (D.C. Cir. 2024); Iowa v. CEQ, 765 F. Supp. 3d 859 (D.N.D. 2025). Then, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025), directing CEQ to propose rescinding its implementing regulations. CEQ then promulgated an interim final rule rescinding 50 years’ worth of regulations. Removal of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 10,610 (Feb. 25, 2025).

Ahead of the rescission, CEQ issued guidance to federal agencies to help streamline each agency’s NEPA regulations. Memorandum from Katherine R. Scarlett, Chief of Staff, CEQ, on Implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act to Heads of Fed. Dep’ts & Agencies (Feb. 19, 2025) (CEQ Guidance). Notably, CEQ only issued guidance, which does not have the binding effect of regulations. CEQ’s guidance encourages agencies to develop new regulations by February 2026 (within 12 months of the guidance’s issuance). Additionally, CEQ advised that agencies may maintain current NEPA procedures, including those prescribed under the now-rescinded regulations, until their new regulations are in place. CEQ also requested that agencies use CEQ’s 2020 implementing regulations as an initial framework in developing the agencies’ new regulations. Many agencies already have responded by proposing new NEPA implementation guidance, including the Department of Energy, Department of Interior, and Army Corps of Engineers. E.g., Dep’t of Energy, Revision of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures, 90 Fed. Reg. 29,676 (July 3, 2025) (to be codified at 10 C.F.R. pts. 205, 1021).

Despite CEQ’s rescission, NEPA’s statutory requirements remain, including those in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), Pub. L. No. 118-5, § 321, 127 Stat. 10. The FRA amended NEPA to codify select components of CEQ regulations at the time. For example, the FRA codified EIS’s 150-page limit, two-year timeline for completing the review document and the ability to allow project sponsors to prepare EISs, among other provisions. This means that despite CEQ’s rescission, those provisions mirrored in the FRA will remain applicable across the federal landscape.

With these recent judicial and executive actions, NEPA is returning to a more constrained version reminiscent of how it was in the 1970s. These actions have largely aimed for NEPA to impose less of a burden on project developers. So, what does this mean for data center developers and other project proponents moving forward?

Data centers, depending on the circumstances of the project, can trigger NEPA by requiring federal permits or permission to build on federal land. This includes when development of a site requires a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act, or other federal statutes—even if the project does not otherwise require federal funding or approval.

New data center construction also can potentially trigger NEPA through the permits or federal approvals associated with the future site’s energy and water infrastructure needs. Data centers may require large amounts of water and energy. In 2023, data centers accounted for 4.4 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and directly consumed 66 billion liters of water. Arman Shehabi et al., 2024 United States Data Center Energy Usage Report 52, 55 (2024). By 2028, data centers could use up to 12 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 124 billion liters of water. Id.

In the short term, per CEQ guidance, ongoing and pending projects should expect few, if any, changes. CEQ Guidance at 1. For these projects, agencies can carry on as usual, relying on prior procedures and guidance.

In the near future to longer term, i.e., projects initiated after new regulations or guidance take effect, proponents could actually see a meaningful reduction in NEPA processing time. As stated above, several agencies already have proposed amended NEPA procedures. These procedures resulted from monthly meetings with CEQ to promote consistency and avoid a complex regulatory patchwork of NEPA requirements across federal agencies. These efforts appear to have had the intended effect. The new NEPA procedures generally follow the same template. However, proponents should note and track key differences, which may have implications for various projects such as allowing for greater flexibility on publishing a draft EIS for public comment or in determining federal funding triggers for qualifying federal actions. See Revision of National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 29,426 (July 3, 2025) (to be codified at 23 C.F.R. pt. 771; 49 C.F.R. pts. 264, 622) (noting changes to the NEPA regulations for the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Transit Administration); see also Fed. Aviation Admin., Order 1050.1G, FAA National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures (2025). These changes could help project proponents, but how the agencies will address public comments on these procedures or ultimately administer the final NEPA requirements remains to be seen.

While there are uncertainties facing NEPA’s administration, the Supreme Court recently eased some concerns by reaffirming the “substantial judicial deference” owed federal agencies under NEPA. Seven Cntys., 145 S. Ct. at 1508. The Court’s majority was critical of NEPA challenges, stating, “Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new [] projects,” id. at 1514, and emphasized that whether an EIS was detailed enough “should not be excessively second-guessed by a court.” Id. at 1512. Notably for data center proponents, the majority placed the consideration of indirect environmental effects and cumulative effects within the sphere of agency deference. Id. at 1513. After Seven Counties, it will be more difficult to challenge federal approval of data centers by arguing that an EIS or EA failed to account for natural resource demands not directly a part of the data center project. However, the Court did not preclude NEPA litigation completely, as judicial deference to agencies does not absolve them of arbitrary and capricious actions.

With challenges still permitted, and the potential changes to NEPA regulations already taking shape, project proponents should closely track these developments with a focus on the following. First, litigants are likely to challenge new agency regulations under the APA. When CEQ revised its regulations in 2020 and 2024, lawsuits quickly followed each change. See, e.g., Wild Va. v. Council on Env’t Quality, No. 3:20-cv-00045 (W.D. Va. 2020); Iowa v. CEQ, No. 1:24-cv-00089 (D.N.D. 2024). Second, projects requiring multiagency permits may be particularly vulnerable to litigation claiming noncompliance with NEPA if agencies have to coordinate and harmonize unique requirements.

All in all, it has been a big year for NEPA, and there are more changes to come. This is a critical time, and these decisions will have lasting implications for project development. Project developers should pay close attention to these changes and engage the agencies throughout the regulatory process.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-north-dakota-2161394212.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:12.776651

15,000 PUBLIC COMMENTS: New York’s Energy Planning board received about 15,000 public comments on its draft state energy plan from July to October, according to a presentation of the comments during Thursday’s board meeting, with commenters expressing a range of views on fossil fuel infrastructure, renewable energy development and nuclear energy.","Good morning and welcome to the weekly Monday edition of the New York & New Jersey Energy newsletter. We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

NJ LOOKS TO COPY NYSERDA MODEL: New Jersey Sen. Andrew Zwicker was at a Climate Week dinner in New York when he met someone from NYSERDA. Now the Middlesex County Democrat is looking at remaking his state’s energy policy landscape in New York’s image, a move that would reduce the power of the state Board of Public Utilities.

“We should let BPU do what it is supposed to do, which is regulate, and then put together another organization solely dedicated to energy policy in New Jersey,” Zwicker told POLITICO in an interview last week.

In the Empire State, that organization is the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the juggernaut of the state’s energy policy and planning. The authority was originally established in 1975 in response to the oil crisis to reduce the state’s reliance on gas. It supports planning efforts, including the work of proposing not-yet-implemented measures to achieve the climate law and facilitating an ongoing state energy plan process.

In the Garden State, the BPU seems to be involved in everything. In recent years, the BPU has been tasked with regulating utilities but also setting, crafting and executing key energy policies. At times, this has put the board in the position of working with economic development officials to promote policies — like offshore wind — at the same time it was tasked with watchdogging the offshore wind companies.

During their affordability-focused gubernatorial campaigns, both Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli showed little love lost for the BPU.

That suggests if Zwicker does introduce legislation, it might not be met with knee-jerk criticism from Republicans and could catch Sherrill’s eye too. Zwicker, who is a scientist at Princeton University’s Plasma Physics Laboratory, was on the Senate select committee formed this year tasked with tackling rising energy costs.

The idea would be that one entity, the new one, has a strong team looking at energy policy, while the BPU focuses on rates.

Where some states delegate procurement of new renewables to utilities, New York relies on NYSERDA to run a centralized process to contract for new onshore wind and solar, offshore wind and storage. The authority has also been tapped to run statewide energy efficiency and heat pump efforts. It oversees programs funded by ratepayers, including through the regional carbon trading program and a $5 billion Clean Energy Fund that’s supported everything from green hydrogen research to building decarbonization competitions. NYSERDA also oversees contracts to pay the upstate nuclear plants to stay online and is responsible for a legacy nuclear site in New York.

Creating a NYSERDA-like entity would still require the BPU to sign off on decisions that affect rates, but could create new ways to do things without having to involve ratepayer dollars, which is generally what the board’s current work is tied to.

“I have mixed feelings about it, I think it could create some new opportunities for financing clean energy,” said BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. — Ry Rivard and Marie J. French

What you may have missed

NEW NUCLEAR BILL — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: A new bill could pave the way for a new nuclear power plant — the first in decades for New Jersey.

The bill, introduced Thursday by Senate Environment and Energy Committee Chair Bob Smith, could put utility customers on the hook to pay for at least part of the construction of enough new nuclear energy to power more than a million homes.

It creates a state-backed incentive program to develop 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear power, according to a draft of the bill obtained by POLITICO. A new nuclear plant could take at least a decade to build.

15,000 PUBLIC COMMENTS: New York’s Energy Planning board received about 15,000 public comments on its draft state energy plan from July to October, according to a presentation of the comments during Thursday’s board meeting, with commenters expressing a range of views on fossil fuel infrastructure, renewable energy development and nuclear energy.

A closer look: Among the roughly 15,000 comments received, 99 percent were from individuals and about 80 percent of individual comments were associated with 13 comment campaigns. The campaigns that drove the most amount of comments were UA Local 798, a union representing pipeline workers, and Smarter NY Energy, a coalition of heating fuel companies that are critical of New York’s 2019 climate law. These two campaigns drove 55 percent of the comments.

Environmental organizations also led comment campaigns, with Sierra Club, New York Renews, Renewable Heat Now, New Yorkers for Clean Power, Food & Water Watch and New York League of Conservation Voters collectively driving 22 percent of the comments.

Many commenters raised concerns about energy affordability — a key issue at the ballot box earlier this month and for the 2026 midterms. But commenters differed in how they think the state should address affordability issues, with some expressing support for fossil fuels and others arguing that renewable energy will help lower bills.

Staffers are updating the draft energy plan to emphasize affordability concerns and “added language that recognizes the need for a diverse mix of energy resources to meet the state’s current and growing electricity demand needs,” said Jessica Waldorf, director of policy implementation at Department of Public Service.

They’re also working on updating the draft’s modeling and scenarios due to federal policy changes, and some commenters expressed concerns about the state’s ability to deploy new solar and battery storage given the federal government’s antipathy to renewable energy. — Mona Zhang

PSC PROTECTS EAP — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: New York’s Public Service Commission ordered electric and gas companies to limit their reliance on federal programs to determine eligibility for the state’s Energy Affordability Program. This ensures delays in federal winter heating assistance for low-income ratepayers won’t also prevent those families from getting help with their bills from the state level program.

HOW TO LOWER BILLS — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: New Jersey could lower residents’ electric bills by $467 a year by 2030, according to a new report by Synapse Energy Economics for the Natural Resources Defense Council and Evergreen Collaborative.

HOCHUL EMBRACES GAS — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Mona Zhang: Facing a tough reelection battle next year, Gov. Kathy Hochul is steering a monumental pivot on energy policy.

Hochul approved a new gas pipeline championed by President Donald Trump and cut a deal that will keep a gas-fueled cryptocurrency miner running for five more years. The two decisions have sparked outrage from the progressive environmental wing of her party — with three climate-focused groups pointedly endorsing her primary opponent last week.

“She did not just approve a fossil fuel project. She made a moral choice,” Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is primarying Hochul, said “New Yorkers deserve a governor who does not treat the climate crisis as a PR problem, but as a test of moral leadership.”

With Trump’s antipathy toward renewables like solar and wind, increasing energy demand and skyrocketing utility bills, moderate Democrats like Hochul are embracing an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy.

With the United States absent, all eyes were on China.

A crowd had gathered around a glossy Chinese Pavilion, its two upright flags flanking a stage and podium with ceremonial precision. Behind the podium stood a member of China’s delegation, addressing an audience larger than any other at the conference while ticking through images on a screen: Rural streets glowed beneath solar lamps; a smiling driver posed beside a gleaming electric bus; a slide promoted the Vientiane Saysettha Low-Carbon Demonstration Zone, a China-Laos initiative bringing electric transportation and solar power to one of Southeast Asia’s poorest capitals.

In 2024, China accounted for about 40 percent of global electric vehicle exports, and it still controls the overwhelming bulk of solar manufacturing steps. Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told Sierra, “As we [arrived to COP30], in the wee hours of this morning, I drove by a number of Chinese EV manufacturers and dealerships. They are here, they are popular, they're inexpensive.”

Whitehouse chose to attend COP30 in response to the Trump administration’s refusal to send a delegation. “There will be lasting economic damage to the United States from failing to keep up with China in the race to succeed in the clean energy future that is inevitable,” he said. Still, Whitehouse asserted, the Trump administration does not represent the American public on climate issues. “Who they represent is the fossil fuel industry and most importantly, the big fossil fuel donors who have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s political campaign. You are seeing [that influence] in action.”

China invested around $625 billion in clean energy in 2024—a third of the global total—and reached its 2030 renewable-capacity target six years early. Abroad, its state banks and construction firms have financed or built solar mini-grids, EV fleets, and battery plants across dozens of developing countries, sometimes within months. That speed contrasts sharply with Western or multilateral projects that can take years to clear approvals. Beijing presents its global finance as South-South cooperation—a way of collaborating with countries in the Global South to pool resources and strategies through aid and other initiatives.

But for all the promotion of itself as a green leader, China remains one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, responsible for roughly a third of global fossil CO₂ in 2024 (though its emissions have peaked in the last 18 months, according to Carbon Brief), and its reliance on coal-fired power has continued to surge, offsetting emissions reductions gains. President Xi Jinping’s “no new coal abroad” pledge has produced real, if uneven, results since he introduced it four years ago. China has canceled enough projects to book a reduction of 6.1 billion metric tons of CO₂ emissions, more than the United States’ total annual emissions in 2024,, though operation coal projects funded by China have grown in capacity by 4.1GW.

“There is no doubt that China has driven down the cost of renewables, which everyone is benefiting from—and that’s a huge plus to the world overall,” said Jonathan Beynon, senior policy associate on climate finance at the Center for Global Development. “But it is not providing as much climate finance as it should, and a lot of what it does provide is on very nonconcessional terms, which is a major problem.”

“I get the impression that China is willing and able to step up and is looking to fill the gaps left by others,” he added, an indirect nod to the vacuum in the market left by the US.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-17 14:03:01.796678

They’re called nurdles, and while they’ve bedeviled environmental organizations for years, there are now fears that they could cause serious economic harm as well.

The beads are used to make most plastic products. They’re made as part of a preproduction process at several facilities around the state and often end up escaping the factories that produce them, entering the environment. That puts more plastic in Texas waterways and in the animals that inhabit or depend them.

Recently, almost a dozen organizations – some of them activists, and others representing Gulf Coast tourism and fishing industries – have written a letter to Gov. Greg Abbot asking for his help on the matter. This time, it’s not just about the pollution; their appeal emphasizes the monetary impact Nurdles could have if the contamination continues.

Chris Gray is the Gulf Coast Reporter for Chron.com. He sat down with the Standard to talk about nurdles, where they come from, and what activists say could happen if they continue to proliferate. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This interview has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So first off, tell us, how are all these nurdles getting into the water and onto Texas beaches?

Chris Gray: Well, they come from about three dozen facilities – three of which are on Galveston Bay, which is sort of how the story came to my attention – but they really are all over Texas, and have even apparently started washing up on Mexican beaches as well.

What happens is they get into the wastewater as they’re being created. And these plastic pellets, later used to make more refined plastic products like bottles and such, they get into the water if they fall off of trucks and trains, and then they wind up on the beaches.

Apparently one organization, the Turtle Island Restoration Network, has collected over 16,000 [pellets] just doing their own beach patrols with their volunteers.

You mentioned in your article that these beads have been troubling environmentalists for years. How long has this been a problem for Texas?

Plastic pollution has been around for decades. I don’t know if it’s become this acute until the last few years, maybe.

I guess it just depends on how carefully these plants are watching, how they’re getting rid of these nurdles and how they’re loading them onto their transportation methods.

Now, you’ve reported that nearly a dozen groups have written a letter to the governor asking for his help with the nurdle issue. Tell us a little bit about what their appeal is.

What has really changed about the conversation around this thing is that these tourism officials are now recognizing that it’s just bad for business to have all these plastic pellets washing up on the beach and come to the media’s attention, and reflecting negatively on what it’s like down here. It could potentially turn people away from wanting to come visit down here.

» GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard’s weekly newsletters

Yeah, so environmental and economic. What if the issue goes unresolved? How much damage could nurdles do?

You talked about tourism, but what about the fisheries, the animals that ingest them, beach health and water health? Tell us a little bit about that.

I mean, these little pellets can really wreak havoc in the food chain down here. They’ll get into the fish, and then into people who eat the fish.

It also can hinder growth in fish and their ability to reproduce, which in turn would have a negative impact on both the commercial and recreational fishing industries.

Any sense on the dollar value that is being lost, or could be lost, as this problem goes unresolved?

The numbers that I’ve seen show that the outdoor recreation industry in Texas – which I guess is fishing and that sort of thing, but also coming to the beach – supports 300,000 jobs, is responsible for $14 billion in salaries, and $31 billion in added value to the state’s economy.

I don’t think, at least not that I’ve seen, that anyone has tracked how much has actually been lost, or is being lost from plastic pollution, but if you take that as kind of the high-water mark, just imagine how much could be affected if it’s not curbed somehow.

Yes, that’s a lot of money at stake. Well, finally, is the governor, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or any other state agency likely to step in?

I have not seen any kind of response from the governor’s office to this letter. I believe the TCEQ is supposed to publish an updated surface water quality standards sometime next year.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Nurdles_01_gentlemanrook-1024x748.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:27.297893

But what does the artificial intelligence push mean for the rest of the country?

On Friday, Gov. Greg Abbott and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced plans for the centers, which will power AI and cloud operations nationwide. The facilities are expected to create hundreds of jobs and shift critical infrastructure away from Silicon Valley.

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott said in a statement. “We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen.”

Google is not alone. The announcement follows news that Anthropic, the startup behind Claude AI, plans to invest $50 billion in data centers in New York and Texas, with operations going online next year.

AI could spike electric costs: Analysts

Analysts warn AI could significantly raise electricity costs. Americans are already seeing higher bills as data centers become a growing strain on the power grid.

The Department of Energy predicts AI could double nationwide electricity demand by 2030, and Texas is now the testing ground.

ERCOT, the state’s grid operator, has the authority to cut power to large users if supply runs low.

Google says it will add solar panels and battery storage to ease grid stress, but experts caution this is just the beginning of a national challenge over energy and AI.

“The question is who pays for all of that infrastructure, those grid upgrades,” said Benjamin Lee, an engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “There is a risk that the data center operators are benefiting disproportionately from those energy investments, but then those costs are being distributed to the local ratepayers, the local consumers in those communities.”

Ecology’s latest greenhouse gas inventory covers 2021. Without fresher information, the public can’t judge whether cap-and-trade taxes are reducing emissions, said Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy.

“It is a terribly heavy burden for the productive people of the state, and we deserve to know whether that sacrifice is making a difference,” she said.

Dye filed the lawsuit in Thurston County Superior Court with Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, and Washington Policy Center vice president for research Todd Myers. The Citizen Action Defense Fund, a nonprofit law firm, represents the three.

Washington law requires Ecology to issue a report every two years on the state’s carbon footprint. The lawsuit claims the department has fallen inexcusably behind. The department doesn’t expect to report emissions for 2022 and 2023 until early 2026.

Meanwhile, cap-and-trade has raised almost $3.5 billion for carbon-reduction programs in less than three years. The tax raises the price of electricity, natural gas and liquid fuels.

An up-to-date greenhouse gas inventory would help legislators use the money wisely, Dye said.

“I have to have the information because without it I can’t evaluate the policies that come to us,” she said. “Ecology needs to be transparent to gain the trust of the Washingtonians who are paying the money.”

Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said the lawsuit was “an example of an ongoing misinformation campaign meant to undermine climate policy.”

“Measuring greenhouse gas emissions from every source in the state is a complex undertaking, and it takes time,” Sixkiller said in a statement.

Ecology reported early this year that the state’s carbon output in 2021 was 96.1 million metric tons. By law, Washington’s carbon footprint by 2030 must be only 50 million metric tons.

Ecology said future reports will show the impacts of cap-and-trade, the low-carbon fuel standard, electric-vehicle mandate and new building codes.

“They should be curious about whether their policies are working,” Myers said. “If you really cared, nobody should have to beat you with a stick.”

The Environmental Protection Agency provides most of the data that Ecology needs. The EPA released emissions data for 2022 in April 2024.

Washington’s emissions in 2022 rose slightly from the year before, according to the EPA. Ecology has said it needs time to evaluate the EPA’s data.

EPA released preliminary national data for 2023 early this year. The EPA has not provided state-level data.

“We’re building our own state-level inventory so we can rely on accurate, transparent data to guide smart decisions and track our progress,” Sixkiller said.

Myers filed a similar lawsuit this year, but a judge ruled he lacked standing to bring the suit. He said he hopes adding two legislators as plaintiffs will bolster the case.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/Mary-Dye-Photo-2025-11-21-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 12:01:48.861277

Just a year ago, the transition from fossil-fueled to electrified transportation and buildings was well-funded by the federal government. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) had provided tax credits and other programs that would make nearly $400 billion available for electric vehicles and $28 billion for building improvements like heat pumps over ten years, based on estimates from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That’s gone now.

States that remain committed to addressing climate change are deciding how to respond. Choices include backfilling federal spending or backing off of their climate ambitions. In late 2024, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom initially said the state would replace lost federal funding for electric vehicles, but then he reversed course. Many states are facing fiscal challenges and have balanced budget obligations that make backfilling federal funding unrealistic. Summing up the challenge, during a recent Politico interview about the loss of federal electric vehicle tax credits, incoming California Senate leader Monique Limón said the state needs to “find the middle ground between desire and capacity.”

There’s a Hole in the Clean Energy Budget

Much of the funding provided through the IRA was in the form of tax credits claimed by individual taxpayers, so the lost federal funding that would have flowed into California can only be estimated. Assuming that the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates were spread evenly over ten years and that California’s share would have been proportionate to the state’s population, the annual lost funding is likely in the single digit billions of dollars for electric vehicles and in the hundreds of millions for building electrification. These are big numbers, even in the context of California’s sizable $300+ billion state budget.

Traditionally, California, and many other states, have funded clean energy programs through charges on consumers’ utility bills – a popular “off budget” funding source. The state’s large program to subsidize the installation of heat pumps for space and water heating is largely funded through this approach. However, many Californians are pushing back against what they say they are experiencing as excessively high electricity rates. Large electric bills are especially hitting the pockets of lower income households and are making electric vehicles and buildings less attractive. Backfilling the loss of federal funding through electricity prices is obviously a bad idea since the recovery of that funding through higher rates hurts all households and undermines widespread electrification.

Cap-and-Trade Offs

During a period of tight budgets, the revenues generated through California’s cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases stand out as the most viable “on-budget” source of funding to encourage electrification. The program, which was just extended to 2045, includes quarterly auctions of carbon permits in which entities that emit greenhouse gases purchase permits to offset their pollution. This makes it more expensive to pollute and creates an incentive to reduce pollution. The auctions also generate revenues that the state can distribute or spend. The first, eagerly awaited, auction since cap-and-trade was extended is later this week.

In a blog post last week Severin Borenstein discussed the 37% of proceeds from those auctions that are refunded directly to customers via utility bills. The remaining proceeds, referred to as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), are appropriated by the Legislature and Governor. In the flurry of bills adopted in October, the legislature set new spending priorities. Two bills on this subject create a prioritized list of what the auction proceeds will be spent on, most of which have little to do with clean energy. Electrification programs are not on the list of precommitted spending areas, but could still receive spending in two specified ways.

First, if auction proceeds exceed the committed amount, additional funding is intended to go to areas including clean transportation. There is a second possible source of funds if the California Air Resources Board (the program administrator) ends up selling permits to keep prices from rising too high. Any proceeds from those particular permits are intended to go toward building electrification (see blog posts from James Bushnell for more on how this price ceiling process works).

Allocating Proceeds Will Be a Charged Issue

I am pleased to see that the Legislature plans to put some thought into how money should be spent in the priority areas. A commitment to developing multiyear spending plans is written into the bills. State money for clean energy is especially precious at this time and the state faces tough choices. For electrification in particular, foremost in my mind is the choice between spending money on programs and returning money directly to consumers by lowering rates.

The arguments for using revenues to reduce electricity rates are strong. In a 2022 paper, Severin Borenstein, Meredith Fowlie and James Sallee estimated that the already excessively high electricity rates in 2019 were equivalent to a $600 annual tax on driving an electric vehicle. Taking the present value of the annual tax over 15 years amounts to $6,500. The “tax” is surely much higher in 2025 given continued rate escalation. In other words, reducing volumetric electricity rates to a level that reflects the economic costs of using energy would essentially fully backfill for the lost federal subsidies. Unfortunately that level of rate reduction is beyond the reach of the revenues that will be available through the GGRF. Still, the point is that, directionally, rate reductions are a widely available incentive to electrify transportation and buildings.

Spending programs to encourage electrification could also have a place, but I believe the bar on what programs merit funding should be set high. Policymakers should ask questions like: What market failure is the spending addressing? How will the program be rigorously evaluated and improved or eliminated if ineffective or no longer needed? Energy Institute researchers have evaluated numerous energy programs in the past using rigorous methods like randomized controlled trials and machine learning, and the results have often been far worse than hoped.

The loss of federal funding for clean energy puts legislators and governors in a difficult place. States will need to think hard about how to balance clean energy spending with other priorities and carefully assess how to best use the limited resources still available for clean energy.

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), today announced 26 additional locations will receive grant awards totaling $14 million in federal funding to build electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Wisconsin. Supported through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program under former President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these fast-charging stations will help ensure residents and visitors alike have access to the charging infrastructure needed to travel from point A to point B in Wisconsin.

This announcement comes as, earlier this year, Gov. Evers announced Wisconsin would be joining a multi-state lawsuit to stop the Trump Administration from blocking over $60 million in NEVI Formula Program funding Wisconsin expected to receive to support electric vehicle infrastructure projects across the state. The lawsuit came after Gov. Evers spent months urging the Trump Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to release and stop obstructing funding that Wisconsin was promised to expand access to electric vehicle infrastructure across the state and prevent any delays in federal funding to support improving Wisconsin infrastructure. Thanks to these efforts, in June, a federal judge blocked the Trump Administration’s action, allowing several EV infrastructure projects utilizing NEVI funding to move forward in Wisconsin. However, federal threats to the future of this impactful program remain.

“My administration and I have prioritized ensuring our state’s infrastructure meets the needs of the 21st Century since Day One because expanding our clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure helps create jobs and bolster our economy, and it’s good for our planet, too,” said Gov. Evers. “Thanks to our actions to get the Trump Administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve.”

This latest round of awards fills coverage gaps after the first round of awards was announced in May 2024. The first round awarded $22.4 million in federal funding for 52 projects, 11 of which are currently operational and 16 have been authorized for construction. Through the first two rounds of awards, WisDOT has awarded more than $36.4 million for a total of 78 projects. The governor celebrated the launch of the first of these charging stations in Wisconsin at Kwik Trip stores in Ashland, Menomonie, and Chippewa Falls earlier this year.

“As transportation choices continue to evolve, we’re seeing a growing interest in electric vehicles, with more than 37,000 EVs registered in Wisconsin,” said WisDOT Secretary Kristina Boardman. “WisDOT is pleased to help offer drivers reliable and convenient places to stop, so they can feel comfortable making a trip across the state and have the opportunity to support local businesses along the way.”

The charging stations will be built along Wisconsin’s Alternative Fuel Corridor, reaching all corners of the state to support the more than 37,000 EVs registered in the state, as well as travelers and visitors. Site locations include fuel convenience stores, restaurants, lodging, and retail/grocery stores.

WisDOT evaluated a variety of factors when choosing these projects, including location, the potential for future development, availability of pull-through parking spaces to allow for larger EVs, and extended business site hours to accommodate longer refueling times. A full list of the 26 awarded locations can be found here. The locations of every planned charging station can be found on WisDOT’s EV charging station dashboard.

Today’s announcement also builds on the Evers Administration’s previous efforts to build a strong clean energy economy, including establishing the Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change and prioritizing supporting hybrid-electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and related infrastructure as a key climate pollution reduction recommendation in the Task Force final report, as well as releasing the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan, which recommends accelerating the development of Wisconsin’s EV and EV charging station equipment manufacturing and supporting the transition to EVs statewide.

Saying Yes To Offshore Wind will help keep us on track to meet our climate goals,"" said Connor Yakaitis Deputy Director at CTLCV.","NEW LONDON, Conn. – Today, at New London Pier, Attorney General William Tong, New London Mayor Michael Passero, and several climate organizations, shared local stories of offshore wind’s economic, health, and climate benefits, as well as important updates on the fight to defend offshore wind in Connecticut.

In September, the Trump Administration halted work on Revolution Wind, an offshore wind project 32 miles southeast of the Connecticut coast. At the time, the project was 80 percent completed. The action threatened local jobs and Connecticut’s clean energy future. Attorney General Tong, alongside Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to ensure Connecticut can pursue clean and renewable offshore wind.

During the press conference, 16 groups presented Attorney General Tong with a letter celebrating his work fighting the Trump Administration's attacks on the offshore industry.

“The Port of New London is evidence of the economic impact of this new American industry that is the offshore wind energy supply chain,” said New London Mayor Michael Passero. “State Pier, a long-neglected, underutilized state asset, was transformed into a premier East Coast marine terminal thanks to the offshore wind industry. Union workers rebuilt the facility, with local contractors from southeastern Connecticut also participating. The Connecticut Port Authority now earns more revenue than ever before from the shipping of offshore wind turbine components to and from State Pier. All of these direct benefits have led to indirect benefits for subcontractors and small businesses across the region.”

“Harnessing the breeze off the Atlantic coast is the key to powering our homes, bettering our local economies, and improving public health for all here in Connecticut,” said Samantha Dynowski, Sierra Club Connecticut Chapter Director. “New London is among the first Connecticut towns to so clearly experience the benefits of offshore wind development. Because of the hard work nearly completed here, 350,000 homes will receive clean power. Offshore wind is our state’s offramp, making Connectiut less dependent on costly fossil fuel projects that raise our energy bills. As Revolution Wind nears the finish line, we will continue to champion the project and look forward to when its clean power and cost savings reaches homes.”

“It’s fitting that we are holding this event in the middle of the latest COP meeting on Climate Change. Those who take science seriously understand that climate change is the single greatest challenge we face today, with devastating consequences for us if we fail to meet that challenge,” said Charles Rothenberger, Director of Government Relations for Save the Sound. “At the same time, we need to improve the resilience and reliability of our electric grid while also addressing the rising energy costs that households are facing. Offshore Wind is the perfect solution to all of these problems. It is the single largest source of zero-carbon domestic energy available to New England in the near term, its generation profile is ideally suited to address winter reliability concerns, and multiple analyses have shown its potential to save ratepayers money by lowering wholesale energy prices and insulating customers from the impacts of natural gas price volatility.”

""Connecticut has already laid the groundwork for being a leader in offshore wind. We must continue to invest in these projects that offer sustainable jobs as well as affordable, reliable, renewable energy for our communities. Saying Yes To Offshore Wind will help keep us on track to meet our climate goals,"" said Connor Yakaitis Deputy Director at CTLCV.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-17 13:01:30.469613

While regions like the Middle East and the United States still rely on the fossil fuel sector, Asia has emerged as a favoured destination for astonishing innovative projects that drive the international energy community towards the renewable energy markets.

Taiwan has secured the approval for a 180 MW floating wind project

Taiwan has long been living in the shadow of China, with the nation constantly under threat of a full-scale invasion by Beijing. The geopolitical issues have not dampened the nation’s ambitions for clean and renewable energy production, as Netherlands-based IX Renewables is set to commission a new 180 MW floating wind project in Taiwanese waters.

The Rui Li 1 floating wind facility will lean on the substantial expertise of its stakeholders as Taiwan aims to increase renewable energy capacity over the next few years. The myriad of interested parties came together at the recent Energy Taiwan 2025 renewable energy and net-zero trade show, and agreed on terms to advance the project beyond the planning phase towards actual, on-the-ground commissioning.

Asia’s renewable energy market has grown exponentially over the past decade

The news that Taiwan is planning to expand its renewable energy capacity is not a singular stance, with other Asian nations also boasting substantial investments in solar and wind power projects. China produces the vast majority of the world’s solar panels, and India has a foothold in the sector as well. With the loss of Russian energy resources due to the new wave of sanctions, the renewable energy sector is perfectly positioned to become a force in the international energy market.

Asia Cement Corporation has jumped on board the Rui Li 1 project

Asia Cement Corporation has agreed to serve as a sponsor for the planned 180 MW floating Rui Li 1 wind project. Dutch company IX Renewables is the major stakeholder, with Japan’s GF Corporation, Hexicon, and SNOW BV playing essential roles as well. Asia Cement has agreed to serve as the principal sponsor for the project, leveraging its vast construction expertise.

“By combining Taiwan’s strong industrial foundation with IX’s international offshore wind experience, we can jointly bring floating wind technology from vision to reality.” – Eric Kamphues, CEO of IX Renewables

The Rui Li 1 project will be located off the coast of Hsinchu County at water depths of 70–95m, and will feature 12 turbines spinning at maximum speed to increase renewable energy production for Taiwan. The expectation is for the wind farm to generate roughly 833GWh of electricity annually, which is enough juice to power 205,000 households.

As other Asian nations call on their wind sectors to increase local manufacturing, Taiwan is set to become a dominant force in the region’s renewable energy sector. The Rui Li 1 facility is expected to be commissioned in 2029, just in time to assist Taiwan in its clean energy goals.

The first funding opportunity provides up to $275 million for American industrial facilities capable of producing valuable minerals from existing industrial and coal byproducts. The second provides up to $80 million to establish Mine of the Future proving grounds for real-world testing of next-generation mining technologies.

The Department announced in August its intent to invest $1 billion to advance and scale mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies, delivering on President Trump’s Executive Orders, Unleashing American Energy and Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production. These actions will secure America’s critical material supply chain, increase domestic mineral production, reduce reliance on foreign sources, and strengthen U.S. energy independence.

“For too long, the United States has relied on foreign nations for the minerals and materials that power our economy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “We have these resources here at home, but years of complacency ceded America’s mining and industrial base to other nations. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing that trend, rebuilding America’s ability to mine, process, and manufacture the materials essential to our energy and economic security.”

“The Mine of the Future - Proving Ground Initiative will be among the Department of Energy’s first major investments into mining technology research and development in almost four decades,” said U.S. Department of Energy Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy Kyle Haustveit. “This effort will help establish the United States as the world’s leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals—creating economic prosperity in fossil energy communities across the country while strengthening critical mineral supply chains for the United States and its allies.”

Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion – Piloting By-Product Critical Minerals and Materials Recovery at Domestic Industrial Facilities

FE announced up to $275 million under the Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) to address the potential for America’s industries to recover valuable critical materials by piloting promising future separation and recovery technologies directly at industrial sites.

This NOFO includes two focus areas for the design, construction, and operation of large pilot-scale facilities to produce critical materials:

Coal-based feedstocks – advancing and accelerating demonstration of critical material production using coal-based resources as feedstocks.

Industrial byproducts and wastes – open to all U.S. industry sectors that produce market-ready materials where industrial byproducts and/or wastes can be a source of crucially needed critical materials.

These pilots will demonstrate the feasibility of recovering critical minerals from existing American infrastructure and industrial activity, reducing waste while building new domestic supply chains for high-value materials. Read the complete NOFO here.

Mine of the Future – Proving Ground Initiative

FE also announced up to $80 million under the Mine of the Future – Proving Ground Initiative NOFO, which supports DOE’s broader Mine of the Future initiative to accelerate technology commercialization and increase the competitiveness of domestic mining operations.

Field sites are essential for minerals and mining stakeholders to test innovative technologies under real-world conditions. Awards made under this NOFO will not only develop mining proving grounds but also support R&D projects that accelerate technologies past laboratory and/or bench scale to testing and demonstration in a field-scale setting, an essential step to de-risk commercial adoption of these new mining technologies.

Projects selected under this initiative will also create opportunities for hands-on workforce training to prepare the next generation of American miners and engineers to operate advanced mining systems safely and efficiently.

Many companies fall within the reach of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule solely due to their import of items that may contain PFAS during the reporting period.
Recognizing these challenges, EPA has proposed several new exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule aimed at providing relief to entities that are least likely to have relevant information.
EPA also proposes a broad de minimis exemption for mixtures or articles with PFAS concentrations under 0.1%.
Comments on the proposed rule are due by December 29, 2025.","As the longest federal government shutdown on record continued earlier this week, EPA stayed busy putting the finishing touches on one of its PFAS-related priorities — enabling EPA to “smartly collect” information about PFAS substances under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as required by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Early signs of EPA’s desire to simplify the TSCA PFAS reporting rule, which was finalized by the Biden EPA in 2023, were evident in the agency’s April 2025 announcement of “Major Actions to Combat PFAS Contamination” discussed here, where EPA committed to implement the required information collection “without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

Earlier this week, EPA announced and then promptly published in the Federal Register its proposal to deliver on that promise. If finalized, the rule would significantly rein in what many see as an overly broad TSCA PFAS reporting scheme. This scheme requires manufacturers of certain PFAS, including importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing articles, to submit a one-time report to EPA regarding these manufacturing and importing activities over an 11-year window stretching from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2022. Due to both the long lookback period and the breadth of activities covered by the rule, the reporting scheme has presented a host of challenges for regulated entities, many of whom have expended significant resources simply to determine whether they are subject to the rule, and if so, what information they should report.

Many companies fall within the reach of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule solely due to their import of items that may contain PFAS during the reporting period. Given the ubiquitous presence of PFAS in hundreds of kinds of ordinary articles, many companies that import everyday items like electronic devices, cables, or gaskets have had to engage in significant due diligence to assess their reporting obligations. This is particularly true given the long lookback period, which left some companies sifting through vintage records to determine whether they even possess the necessary information. In many cases, document retention policies do not require companies to keep records that old, and in cases of mergers, acquisitions, or other corporate changes, determining which entity has the records and which entities must report is no simple task.

Recognizing these challenges, EPA has proposed several new exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule aimed at providing relief to entities that are least likely to have relevant information. The most impactful of these proposed exemptions is probably the exemption for article importers. In the economic analysis supporting the 2023 rule, EPA estimated that of the universe of article importers who have or will conduct due diligence to identify reportable PFAS, only 10% would determine that they possess reportable information. The remaining 90% would be burdened by compliance determination activities only to determine that they do not need to report because they either do not possess or cannot reasonably ascertain the information. Of course, with the proposed exemptions coming exactly two years after the reporting rule became effective, many companies have already expended significant resources on the very effort the proposal is designed to alleviate.

EPA also proposes a broad de minimis exemption for mixtures or articles with PFAS concentrations under 0.1%. This low-concentration exemption would apply regardless of total production volume of the mixture or article. This exemption, along with the article importer exemption, is likely to remove the reporting obligation for a large swath of entities if finalized as proposed. Other proposed but less widely applicable exemptions cover PFAS byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates, as well as PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes.

For entities that will still have a reporting obligation despite the new exemptions, EPA has proposed a new reporting window: the reporting portal will open 60 days after the proposed rule is finalized and entities will have three months to report. This time frame is shorter than the original rule’s reporting window of six months, which is currently slated to begin on April 13, 2026, and end October 13, 2026. Given how much time has passed since the rule was originally promulgated, EPA believes that companies have had adequate time to consider their reporting obligations and three months should be sufficient.

“We organized the program around four big thrusts we’ve advanced for years,” said Philip Bedient, director of the SSPEED Center and the Herman and George R. Brown Professor of Engineering at Rice.
Nature-based flood solutions followed, featuring Dutch and Rice experts on green infrastructure that slows, stores and soaks stormwater across neighborhoods, counties and watersheds.
“To have a big conference and not address the Guadalupe flood would be a mistake,” Bedient said.
“The second day was about market-based natural carbon solutions,” said Chris Ordoñez, program manager for nature-based solutions at the SSPEED Center.","Rice University’s Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center convened more than 100 experts, industry leaders and attendees Nov. 6-7 for its 12th annual conference, connecting cutting-edge flood mitigation with the fast-emerging world of market-based natural carbon solutions.

Hosted at Rice’s Anderson-Clarke Center, the meeting was deliberately split into two distinct but deeply linked days. The first day of the conference focused on major infrastructure, nature-based flood strategies and real-time lessons from this summer’s devastating Hill Country flood. The following day’s topics turned to natural climate solutions and the carbon market, tools that can channel private capital into land stewardship, coastal protection and methane abatement while reinforcing long-term flood resilience.

“We organized the program around four big thrusts we’ve advanced for years,” said Philip Bedient, director of the SSPEED Center and the Herman and George R. Brown Professor of Engineering at Rice. “Galveston Bay Park Plan, nature-based solutions, Harris County’s MaapNext floodplain modeling and hard-won lessons from the Hill Country flood — getting all of that into one day is ambitious, but it’s exactly these conversations Houston and Texas need.”

The conference opened with updates on the Galveston Bay Park Plan, a regional surge and flood-mitigation concept SSPEED has refined since 2016 with architects, engineers and public partners. Sessions led by Rogers Partners, Jim Blackburn and Rice engineer Avantika Gori charted how design, advanced modeling and governance are converging as the region invests in layered coastal protection.

Nature-based flood solutions followed, featuring Dutch and Rice experts on green infrastructure that slows, stores and soaks stormwater across neighborhoods, counties and watersheds.

“What used to be called ‘low-impact development’ has matured into nature-based solutions, and we’ve become leaders in the field — working with researchers, students and practitioners to actually build these systems,” said Blackburn, professor in the practice of environmental law at Rice and co-director of the SSPEED Center.

A highlight was Harris County Flood Control District’s preview of MaapNext (Modeling, Assessment and Awareness Project), a next-generation, countywide 2D floodplain modeling effort expected to change how risk is mapped and mitigated.

“Bringing Harris County leadership to campus to discuss MaapNext matters,” Bedient said. “These are the people who can implement change in one of the most flood-prone cities in the United States.”

Recognizing the urgency of extreme rainfall beyond Houston, the program also examined the July 4 Hill Country flood, which struck the Guadalupe River Basin with astonishing speed and intensity. University of Texas at Arlington’s Nick Fang and Jacob Torres shared advances in flood warning and monitoring, while a poster session convened the teams running the region’s flood-warning system.

“To have a big conference and not address the Guadalupe flood would be a mistake,” Bedient said. “We’re tackling it head-on to accelerate practical improvements.”

Equally important, the first day threaded engineering with social science and community partnership. Rice scholars Jim Elliott and Dominic Boyer discussed the university’s new Creative Ventures-supported outreach with residents affected in the basin.

“If you don’t have buy-in from communities, you’re wasting your time,” Bedient said. “We’re blending engineering with social impact because implementation is where resilience succeeds or fails.”

Bedient also pointed to collaborations seeded during the meeting: “We’ve got the city of Houston, Harris County, the Port of Houston and state partners here — people who can take research and turn it into projects. There are real opportunities with UT-Arlington, and we’re building new ties with Texas Tech’s meteorology group to pair advanced weather analysis with our hydrology and infrastructure work.”

The conference’s second day showcased how natural systems can store carbon and strengthen resilience with sessions spanning soil carbon on working lands, forest carbon, coastal “blue carbon” and methane abatement via orphan-well plugging. It also traced how carbon markets and registries, like BCarbon, incubated in collaboration with Rice and its Baker Institute for Public Policy, help landowners, companies and communities monetize stewardship.

“The second day was about market-based natural carbon solutions,” said Chris Ordoñez, program manager for nature-based solutions at the SSPEED Center. “We brought together the market architects, the scientists and the project developers in one intimate space to learn from each other and form long-term partnerships.”

Ordoñez emphasized the scientific backbone of the agenda: “Soils are tremendous carbon stores — native grasses pull carbon from the air and move it into the ground for durable storage. Our biochar keynote with Rice’s Carrie Masiello highlighted a fast-growing approach that locks carbon into a stable form while improving soil health and water retention. It’s one of those win-wins where you can store carbon and support sustainable agriculture.”

Beyond Texas, SSPEED and partners discussed work in Tamaulipas, Mexico, where teams are helping develop protocols for nature-based credits and piloting on-the-ground projects. Sessions also examined the methane market and practical steps to plug abandoned and orphaned wells, actions that generate credits while delivering immediate climate and public-safety benefits.

Amid skepticism about climate solutions, Ordoñez voiced reasons for resolve. “There’s plenty of pessimism out there, but Earth already gives us the best tools we have right now,” he said. “We won’t meet our climate goals without carbon removal, and nature is our most readily deployable pathway today.”

Houston’s long history with hurricanes and extreme rainfall has taught a clear lesson: Resilience is not one project or one agency but rather a portfolio that blends engineered protection, watershed wide green infrastructure, community partnership and policy and market mechanisms that mobilize investment at scale. In that sense, the conference functioned less as a symposium than a launchpad to align infrastructure, ecology and economics to help communities thrive in a wetter, warmer century.",https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/2025-11/featured_sspeed.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:31.731598

A filing published on Nov. 13 by the Shaanxi Administration for Market Regulation shows the company will obtain about 62% (61.9998%) of PotisEdge’s voting rights through a mix of equity purchase, capital injection and voting-rights entrustment. The acquisition gives LONGi a ready-built foothold in energy storage at a moment when the solar PV sector faces collapsing prices and industry-wide losses.

The transaction follows a period of rapid momentum for PotisEdge. Just weeks before the filing, the Suzhou-based firm signed a strategic agreement with Australia’s Club Solar to deploy 2 GWh of residential storage systems, underscoring its strength in overseas markets.

LONGi, which dominates the supply of silicon wafers and modules, has had relatively limited exposure to storage. But after seven consecutive loss-making quarters and a 2024 net loss of CNY 8.6 billion, the company is under pressure to build a second growth engine after its hydrogen venture stalled amid slow commercialisation.

PotisEdge, founded in 2015, has built full-stack R&D capabilities across five core system technologies – integrated Centralized Cell Safety Monitoring/Management System (iCCS), BMS, PCS, EMS and TMS – and has filed nearly 350 patents. It ranks second globally among DC-side storage-system integrators and top six in China’s commercial and industrial segment. Its 31GWh of global capacity and more than 10GWh of grid-connected systems place it among the most internationally active Chinese storage firms.

Its rapid financing history — attracting more than 30 strategic investors, including CRRC Capital, GoodWe and Maxwell — made it one of the highest-valued independent integrators in China’s storage sector.

LONGi’s move makes it the last of China’s top module manufacturers — alongside Trina Solar, JinkoSolar, JA Solar and Canadian Solar — to formally enter the storage business. But the timing aligns with surging sector economics. China’s storage industry generated CNY 493.1bn in the first three quarters of 2025, with profit up 38% year-on-year, far outpacing revenue growth.

The challenges remain significant. LONGi will need to integrate PotisEdge’s technology and overseas channels effectively to differentiate itself and compete with battery giants like CATL and BYD.

But for China’s largest solar manufacturer, the acquisition marks the clearest signal yet that the future of the industry lies not in solar panels alone, but in dispatchable, storage-enabled clean power.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PotisEdge-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:01:34.765310

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday approved NRG Energy’s plan to buy 12.9 GW in gas-fired power plants, and a demand response company from LS Power in a roughly $12 billion deal, saying it wouldn’t hurt market competition.

FERC rejected calls by the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor to impose conditions on NRG designed to prevent it from exerting market power in PJM’s energy and capacity markets. Monitoring Analytics failed to show that NRG would be able to influence market prices after the deal is completed, FERC said.

Under the deal, NRG’s capacity in PJM would jump to 9.5 GW from 2.1 GW and NRG would own 2.2 GW in New York, up from 1.2 GW, according to the companies’ application at FERC. The Houston-based independent power producer will also acquire CPower, a commercial and industrial virtual power plant platform with 6 GW of capacity under contract, including about 4 GW in PJM, according to an investor presentation.

Once complete, the deal would roughly double NRG’s generating fleet. Besides the assets in PJM and New York, the transaction includes three power plants in Texas totaling nearly 2,060 MW and two power plants in New England totaling 940 MW.

NRG contends the U.S. power markets are in an “unprecedented supercycle,” after about 15 years of little demand growth. At the same time, new gas-fired generation generally cannot come online until the 2030s, partly due to supply chain and labor constraints as well as regulatory bottlenecks, according to the company.

NRG and LS Power expect to close the deal early next year. The transaction must be approved by the New York State Public Service Commission. As part of the deal, LS Power will receive about 11% of NRG’s outstanding stock and $6.4 billion in cash. NRG will assume about $3.2 billion in debt from LS Power.

The pending transaction follows NRG’s early-May purchase of Rockland Capital’s 738-MW stake in six gas-fired power plants in Texas for $560 million.

FERC OKs LS Power 1.3-GW wind buy

Separately, FERC on Friday approved LS Power’s planned purchase of BP Wind Energy North America’s 1.3-GW wind fleet in seven states. Power from the wind farms is under contract to more than 15 offtakers, according to the companies.

The wind farms are in Indiana, Kansas, South Dakota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Hawaii and Idaho.

They are thus willing to deliberately lose the climate change technology race rather than adopt measures to catch up. They would rather concede than admit that America has been outperformed.

China’s dominance in clean energy manufacturing is quantifiable and accelerating. According to multiple sources, China now controls over 70% of global manufacturing capacity related to renewables. Last year, China installed nearly nine times the US total of new renewable energy capacity. In the first half of 2025, it added more solar panels than the rest of the world combined. Clean energy now contributes 10% to China’s GDP. Innovations like five-minute electric vehicle (EV) charging and massive solar farms, such as the Tibetan Plateau complex, position Beijing to capture 70% of global clean technology exports by 2030.

Moreover, China’s EV industry has surged to global preeminence, commanding over 60% of worldwide sales and reshaping the automotive landscape through unmatched scale, affordability, and innovation. This dominance stems from battery supremacy by firms like CATL, BYD, and CALB, which leaves US and European competitors struggling to compete.

President Donald Trump routinely calls climate change a “hoax” benefiting China, emphasizing the need for oil and gas development, where the United States is the top producer and exporter.

“They don’t see climate change as a problem,” George David Banks, who ran Trump’s first-term climate portfolio, told Politico. He added: “They don’t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.”

Policies reflect this: The One Big, Beautiful Bill, signed July 4, 2025, repealed key Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. Trump executive orders banned new federal wind leasing and paused EV incentives, temporarily halting the nearly complete Revolution Wind farm off Rhode Island, citing unspecified national security interests.

Critics highlight the stakes. US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, attending COP30 unofficially as the administration boycotted it, spotted Chinese EV dealerships upon arrival and warned: “It actually really hurts us economically to be missing out on the clean energy transition and to be missing out on global leadership.”

Even many analysts who are not deeply concerned with the development of renewables note that US grid strains stemming from the rising demands of Artificial Intelligence data centers argue for rapid buildouts of all energy resources.

Globally, even traditional fossil fuel powers are embracing the transition to renewable energy. Saudi Arabia, for example, is eyeing 50% renewables by 2030.

While many nations have adopted slow and unambitious renewable energy plans, no other government matches the Trump administration’s wholesale assault on the solar and wind power industries, which is based in part on superpower rivalry.

Hornbach, Reber Logistik, Teva Germany (with its brand ratiopharm), Rhenus, and DHL Supply Chain will each successively deploy a Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck on their regular logistics routes within Germany. The goal is not only to test use cases across various industries and capture additional operating scenarios, but also to ensure that all findings feed directly into further vehicle development as well as preparations for sales and service processes.

All five fuel-cell trucks will be deployed by the partners over a period of one year on different routes under real operating conditions in various logistics applications — from temperature-controlled pharmaceutical transport to general cargo transport in international long-distance transport.

As a fuel-cell truck with a gross vehicle weight of around 40 tons and a payload of approximately 25 tons, the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck offers technical specifications on par with modern diesel long-haul trucks. Its fuel-cell system delivers a continuous output of up to 300 kW, supported by a small buffer battery to provide situational power support during peak loads and to recover energy during braking.

The truck uses liquid hydrogen as the energy source, which offers significant advantages over gaseous hydrogen: higher energy density enables greater range per tank fill and reduced transport requirements – both enhancing economic efficiency and sustainability of operations. Refueling takes place at dedicated liquid hydrogen (sLH2) stations in Woerth am Rhein and the Duisburg area.

In the initial trial phase, the five fuel-cell trucks covered more than 225,000 kilometers in total, with average hydrogen consumption ranging between 5.6 and 8.0 kilograms per 100 kilometers, depending on use case, and an average combined vehicle weight between 16 and 34 tons.

In parallel, Daimler Truck has already started developing the next generation of its fuel-cell trucks. As part of a small-series production, a total of 100 tractor units are to be built at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Woerth and put into customer operations starting at the end of 2026.

When it comes to decarbonizing transport, Daimler Truck is pursuing a dual-track strategy with battery- and hydrogen-powered vehicles. However, the expansion of hydrogen refueling infrastructure is progressing significantly slower than expected.

As a result, customers will not be able to deploy hydrogen trucks in large numbers in the next few years. Consequently, large-scale industrialization of fuel cells and the planned series production of hydrogen-powered trucks with a focus on Europe is targeted for the early 2030s.",https://electriccarsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Daimle-Trucks.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:03:23.969031

Heavy machinery, steel beams, and hard hats mark the start of Con Edison’s Gateway Substation in Canarsie, a major step toward building a cleaner, stronger, and more reliable energy grid for New Yorkers.

Once completed in 2028, the new indoor substation will deliver reliable power to thousands of homes and businesses across Central Brooklyn. It will also connect to the Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub, bringing renewable energy — including offshore wind power — straight into the city’s power supply.

But this project is about more than technology. It’s about community and connection. Many of the Con Edison employees on-site grew up in Brooklyn and take pride in helping to strengthen the neighborhoods they know best.

“We’re building the grid of the future,” says construction manager John Carucci, “but we’re also doing it responsibly — using eco-friendly materials and aiming for LEED certification.”

For longtime residents like Winston Hoppe, who’s lived just blocks from the site for more than 30 years, the project represents real progress. “There’s more housing now and more demand for electricity,” he says. “We’ve had outages in the summer — this will help. A little disruption is worth it.”

(AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

Suspicions about skyrocketing demand

There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.

Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.

One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft — clients, financing or otherwise — to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.

Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.

Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.

The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation’s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.

“Better data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,” the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.

Real, speculative, or ‘somewhere in between’

The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.

The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a “fundamental first step of really meeting this moment” of energy growth.

“Wherever we go, the question is, ‘Is the (energy) growth real? How can we be so sure?’” Tinjum said. “And we really view commercial readiness verification as one of those important kind of low-hanging opportunities for us to be adopting at this moment.”

Igal Feibush, the CEO of Pennsylvania Data Center Partners, a data center developer, said utilities are in a “fire drill” as they try to vet a deluge of data center projects all seeking electricity.

The vast majority, he said, will fall off because many project backers are new to the concept and don't know what it takes to get a data center built.

States also are trying to do more to find out what’s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.

In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.

They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.

Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren’t sure if the power requests “are real or just speculative or somewhere in between.”

Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.

Electricity bills are rising, too

PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.

Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects “are real, they are coming fast and furious” and that the “near-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.”

The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.

Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.

Ratepayers in Burgos' Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills — attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.

That's why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.

“Once they make their buck, whatever company,” Burgos said, “you don’t see no empathy towards the ratepayers.”",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/11/ap25318621647754.7nRff7G4j6.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:58.694434

The law includes a provision that allows wind and solar projects to keep their eligibility if they begin construction before July 4 of next year.","Fewer U.S. solar projects are pushing back their expected online dates, according to third-quarter 2025 data from the the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory. About 20 percent of planned solar capacity reported a delay, down from 25 percent in the same period in 2024.

Solar remains the country’s fastest-growing source of new generating capacity, largely from utility-scale photovoltaic projects developed by electric utilities and independent power producers. Although delays remain common, they have been trending lower, and most are short.

Even with elevated delays in 2024, the year set a record for utility-scale solar additions. Developers brought 31 gigawatts of solar capacity online, increasing the nation’s utility-scale total by 34 percent, EIA reported. Cancellations continue to be rare, with less than 1 percent of planned capacity typically withdrawn in any given month.

Project developers initially report planned online dates in the Annual Electric Generator Report. Beginning 12 months before those dates, they provide monthly updates on project status and schedule. Because many developers cannot predict the timing or length of delays, total annual additions often fall short of early-year expectations. In January 2024, developers anticipated more than 36 GW of additions, about 5 GW more than the final total.

Most reported delays occur in late construction or testing stages, often only one to two months before a project is ready to start operation. These short setbacks account for much of the slippage in reported timelines.

In EIA’s latest monthly inventory, developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online from October 2025 through September 2026. About 5 GW of that total comes from projects that have already pushed back their expected startup dates.

Developers are reportedly moving quickly to start new solar projects after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) shortened the window to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits.

“You want to find the right price, which is important, and find the quantity of power,” Gabriel said.
Different resources have different capacity and energy.” Gabriel also looked to locally source his power supply.
“Think about it like a stock portfolio.” When United Power was getting all its power from Tri-State, it was like having a single savings account.
When Kit Carson left it had 3 MW of local solar power.","When Brighton-based United Power quit its longtime power supplier, Mark Gabriel, the cooperative’s CEO, went shopping for electrons.

The Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association provided United Power with about 600 megawatts of electric capacity, and assured another 200 MWs of backup, under a 50-year contract that required the cooperative to get 95% of its electricity from the association.

That contract blocked United Power from developing more clean and local energy alternatives, which ultimately led to the co-op paying a $627 million exit fee in 2024 and then Gabriel had to replace the 800 missing megawatts.

United Power’s solution speaks to the transformation underway in the power sector as utilities scramble to find new generation sources to meet new loads. The cooperative is banking on the merchant and wholesale markets to meet its needs.

“You want to find the right price, which is important, and find the quantity of power,” Gabriel said. “It’s much like buying anything.”

“You go to one store for one thing, but you may need to go to multiple stores,” he said. “That’s kind of what we have to do. Different resources have different capacity and energy.”

Gabriel also looked to locally source his power supply. “If I don’t have to put something on transmission, I won’t,” he said. “I’m not counting on big transmission lines, which may be congested.”

To bring power into the United Power’s service area by high-voltage transmission lines, the cooperative must pay for the electricity and the cost of transmitting over the lines. If it has to use the lines of multiple utilities it pays multiple fees.

“Avoiding using transmission saves our members money,” Gabriel said.

United Power has embarked on a program to develop as many resources — large solar arrays, gas plants, batteries — as possible inside its distribution network.

“This is a really cool model,” Ric O’Connell, executive director of GridLab, a Berkeley, California-based clean energy consultant. “It’s hard to make it work, because the world is still kind of set up for big projects.”

Keeping things “hyperlocal,” Gabriel said, “can handle immediate needs faster.”

That is all more important since nailing down new supplies has been a challenge across the region. “It’s getting harder for everybody in the West,” Gabriel said. “There is a lack of capacity.”

Working out the power supply and demand problem

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electricity provider, recently asked state regulators to allow it to run its Comanche 2 coal-fired plant, scheduled to close in December, for another 12 months because of worries about adequate capacity.

“The supply of electricity is not growing fast enough to keep up with demand growth,” said the Western Electric Coordinating Council, which oversees electricity adequacy for 14 Western states and two Canadian provinces. “What was once a simple problem of supply and demand has become complicated.”

So how has United Power charted its course? Especially as it has seen its peak demand continue to rise, reaching 653 MW in 2024.

United Power has about 113,000 customers in two service areas — one stretching from north of Denver to Longmont and another including Golden, Louisville, Black Hawk and Nederland — and it has been growing, with demand increasing as much as 4% a year.

“The big challenge was to build a portfolio with a variety of resources,” Gabriel said. “Think about it like a stock portfolio.”

When United Power was getting all its power from Tri-State, it was like having a single savings account. “Now you may have a dozen stocks or mutual funds,” he said. “We’re just trying to build that portfolio with some short-term and long-term assets.”

The principal tool the cooperative is using are purchase power agreements, or PPAs, with merchant power developers, which are in essence long-term “build it and we will buy” deals.

Merchant power — where private developers raise private capital to build power projects and then sell the electricity — had its beginning in the 1990s electricity deregulation movement.

“Merchant power has been evolving over the last 25 years,” Gabriel said. “There are a lot of different merchant suppliers out there now, and the landscape changed a lot in the last five or 10 years.”

“Storage is the new game changer”

United Power’s portfolio deals are constantly being refreshed, he said, but it has about 20 PPAs and when it can, the utility has encouraged developers to build in the cooperative’s service territory.

Solar developer Silicon Ranch has five solar installations totalling 192 MW in United Power’s area. Mountain Peak Power has a new 162-MW natural gas peaking plant to be used for high-demand periods, and Ameresco has installed 78 MW of battery storage.

The installations also bolster the local economy and tax base. “The gas plant is a really good example,” Gabriel said. “I think there’s eight or nine people that are employed there now from the local community. It’s local tax dollars.”

In all, United Power has 119 MW of batteries in nine locations across the service area each with four to six hours of capacity. They can serve to meet peak demand, or just a portion of the capacity can help balance the system.

“I call it battery slices,” Gabriel said. “It’s very flexible.”

“Storage is really the new game changer,” O’Connell of GridLab said. “If you wound the clock back 10 years, it would have been much harder for United to do what it is doing.”

Gabriel, however, has had to go farther a field than his service territory to fill his portfolio. In October, the cooperative struck an agreement with Apaya Power for the electricity from a 220-MW solar installation with battery storage in Brush. The power will be carried on Tri-State transmission lines.

United Power also has a 25-year PPA for solar from an installation in Alamosa and a 25-year agreement with NextEra Resources for power from its solar farm in Morgan County.

On any given day the last 10% of the cooperative’s demand may be covered with energy trades and purchases that may come from Tri-State, Xcel Energy or Guzman Energy, a wholesaler with whom United Power has a long-term contract.

“So it’s a much more complex model for everybody, not just for us,” Gabriel said.

United Power along with — Colorado Springs Utilities, the CORE Electric Cooperative and Platte River Power Authority — is exploring the possibility of linking the five with a transmission line.

“We abut each other, and we think it’s best to keep things local,” Gabriel said. The utilities already have the rights of way for the project. “We call it the lariat loop because we go around the Xcel system.”

Trading for a better deal on power

In May, United Power will join the Southwest Power Pool, which operates a grid and wholesale power market serving all or parts of 14 states from Texas to North Dakota. SPP is extending west and most Colorado utilities, except Xcel Energy, are becoming members.

Energy trading — buying and selling power among utilities in a regional market — is more efficient with the lowest-cost electricity available always being offered and with a single transmission charge.

“Transmission costs go down because there’ll be one unified tariff,” Gabriel said.

United Power isn’t alone among cooperatives experimenting with new models of managing their electricity needs. In 2016, Kit Carson Electric Cooperative, in Taos, New Mexico, was the first co-op to leave Tri-State and strike out on its own.

When Kit Carson left it had 3 MW of local solar power. At the end of this year it will have 52 MW of solar and 25 MW of storage — all local.

“Our daytime peak is 40 MW, so we can cover 100% of our daytime demand with renewables,” said Luis Reyes, Kit Carson’s CEO. By 2028, the co-op aims to cover its round-the-clock demand with 60% to 70% renewables.

The utility is also developing a green hydrogen storage project with the help of federal funding.

“All this is local, so it does buy us time, because I still think in the Western states, we don’t have enough transmission lines, and so it’s a plus that we’ve been able to address some of the local issues,” Reyes said.

The approach being taken by United Power and Kit Carson may not be possible for all cooperatives, Kevin Brehm, a manager in the carbon-free electricity practice at the nonprofit clean energy consultant RMI.

“Some cooperatives have more limited abilities to get renewables and build in their territory,” Brehm said, and some distant generation may still be cheaper. “We do exist within this bigger grid.”

Still, Brehm said “it seems like such a big opportunity with a win-win for community economic development as well as cost-effective power supply, and resilience potential in the future.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MOUNTAIN-PEAK-POWER-KS-11052025158.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:01:39.380766

This would make it the second time in two months and, three times in general, that the deadline is being extended as the miner struggles to keep its U.S. operations afloat.

Syrah is struggling to provide acceptable grade materials

The new agreement between Syrah and Tesla comes after Tesla’s issuance of a default notice in July in response to Syrah allegedly failing to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility for Tesla’s electric vehicle batteries.

According to the Australian company, the original September 16 deadline, which was initially extended to November 15, has now been further pushed to January 16, 2026.

Through it all, the company has refused to admit that it is in default under the offtake agreement; despite that, Tesla has gone ahead to agree to an extension.

The contract that has prompted the extensions was drafted as far back as 2021 and aimed at supplying Tesla with 8,000 metric tons of graphite anode materials over a four-year period from its Vidalia plant in the U.S. state of Louisiana.

The facility remains the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer functioning outside China, and it has greatly helped Trump’s America reduce dependence on Chinese supplies that dominate the market.

According to what Syrah said under its agreement, Tesla has the right to terminate the offtake agreement if final qualification of the plant’s active anode material has not been achieved by February 9, 2026.

Even though it was able to secure an extension, which helps the company avoid immediate termination of the contract, its shares dropped about 3% to 29.5 cents on the ASX today, as investors reacted with disappointment.

Many of them seem to have hoped for a full resolution and another delay, even though it means Tesla is still willing to remain in bed with the company, is simply not enough after all this time.

Syrah reaches new agreement with the DFC

In a separate announcement, Syrah revealed it has reached a new agreement with the US International DFC, which provides additional funding support for its Balama Graphite Operation in Mozambique.

With the agreement, Syrah’s subsidiary Twigg is expected to get a$8.5 million disbursement from its existing DFC loan, funds that will be used for working and sustaining capital at Balama.

After the payment, the outstanding balance on the DFC loan will have risen to $68 million, excluding origination costs.

As part of the agreement, the DFC has also agreed to defer approximately $5 million in interest and fees that were due today, postponing the payment date until 15 May 2026.

Syrah will also issue the DFC warrants for around 17.5 million Syrah shares, which represent up to 1.3% of the company if exercised. The warrants will be issued at an exercise price of A$0.0001 and will last for five years after issuance.

Speaking about the partnership, Syrah’s managing director and CEO, Shaun Verner, said: “Balama is the largest integrated graphite mining and processing operation globally and is strategically important for supply chain security and the critical minerals supply required for the electric vehicle and energy transition in the US.

Syrah is focused on delivering Balama production and natural graphite sales safely to improve cash flow and strengthen ex-China supply resilience with a focus on our stakeholders’ objectives.”

Even though they have reached a new agreement, the DFC has pointed out that several events of default tied to the DFC loan have not been resolved.

Still, it has graciously signed a temporary waiver to allow the latest disbursement to proceed while Syrah rushes towards providing a permanent resolution.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tesla-to-ink-deal-with-defaulting-Australian-EV-battery-material-supplier.webp,N,,2025-11-17 12:03:09.968704

The directive, active from November 13, 2025, through February 10, 2026, allows PREPA to continue operating generation units essential for maintaining baseload supply while accelerating vegetation management across high-risk transmission corridors.

DOE officials pointed to the gains achieved under the May and August orders, including the restoration of up to 820 MW of baseload capacity. Several units that had been offline for years returned to service, providing roughly a 13% increase to the island’s available generation. For a system where individual unit failures can trigger island-wide consequences, those incremental restorations have been critical to avoiding deeper reliability gaps.

Operational Pressures Highlight System Vulnerabilities

Governor Jenniffer González-Colón emphasized that Puerto Rico has recovered more than 1,200 MW of baseload capacity since spring, attributing much of that progress to the emergency flexibilities that enabled PREPA to prioritize essential repairs and fast-track line clearing. Vegetation remains one of the most persistent threats to the grid; dense growth and steep terrain frequently lead to line faults during high winds, causing outages that ripple across the system.

DOE’s push to maintain emergency authority reflects the reality that Puerto Rico’s thermal fleet continues to age faster than it can be replaced. Even with restoration of large units, the overall grid remains fragile, subject to equipment failures, storm damage, and delayed maintenance cycles that have accumulated over decades.

Federal and Private Investments Are Redefining the Long-Term Outlook

The renewed emergency orders land at a moment when long-term transformation is accelerating across the island. Federal investments such as the $861.3 million initiative to expand renewable energy deployment and storage—are reshaping Puerto Rico’s future resource mix. The funding is designed to support large-scale solar development, speed interconnection timelines, and expand storage capacity enough to reduce dependence on aging thermal units.

Community-scale solar and resilience projects continue to take root as well. Recent federal programs promoting solar access for underserved neighborhoods are intended to increase energy affordability and reduce the strain on central generation—particularly during outages.

These investments complement national initiatives such as the $7 billion Solar for All program, which provided resources to expand residential and community solar in areas with high energy burdens, including Puerto Rico. The combined effect is a steady shift toward distributed generation that reduces peak load on the central system and enhances local resilience during extreme weather.

Private-sector momentum is growing in parallel. Projects like Eaton’s clean-energy microgrid installation demonstrate how commercial partners are establishing reliable, localized power systems designed to operate independently during outages. These microgrids are increasingly viewed as essential pieces of the island’s broader resilience strategy, offering operational continuity for critical community facilities.

A Transition Period Where Emergency Actions and Modernization Coexist

Puerto Rico’s grid is entering a period in which short-term stabilization and long-term transformation must operate side by side. Emergency authorities remain necessary because renewable and microgrid deployments—while accelerating—have not yet reached a scale that can fully offset the vulnerability of the existing generation fleet. Even as solar and storage installations grow, the central grid continues to shoulder the majority of the island’s load, and failures within the legacy system still carry outsized consequences.

Federal officials have signaled that the goal is to eventually phase out emergency interventions as the island’s energy system becomes more distributed, more modernized, and less dependent on large thermal units. Until then, DOE’s 202(c) orders serve as a bridge—keeping power stable enough for the long-term buildout to take hold.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251114-075244-32f-View%20of%20a%20Cobblestone%20Street%20between%20Colorful%20Buildings%20in%20San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 12:00:27.798006

The dream of geothermal energy is to meet humanity’s energy demands affordably, without harnessing horses for horsepower, slaughtering whales for their oil, or burning fossil fuels.
This partly explains why, in the field of clean energy, geothermal is often either not on the list or mentioned under the rubric of “other.” For decades, both private and government investment in geothermal energy was all but negligible.
Much of the relevant work Latimer came across turned up in papers about geothermal energy.
“I think the big question is: Who are the next nine Fervos?” Roland Horne, a professor of energy science and engineering at Stanford, who has studied geothermal energy for about fifty years, said.","When I arrived in Reykjavík, Iceland, last March, a gravel barrier, almost thirty feet at its highest point, had been constructed to keep lava from the Reykjanes volcano from inundating a major geothermal power station not far from downtown. So far, it had worked, but daily volcano forecasts were being broadcast on a small television at the domestic airport where I was waiting to take a short flight to Akureyri, a town on the north coast about an hour’s drive from one of the country’s oldest geothermal plants, the Krafla Geothermal Station. Until the early nineteen-seventies, Iceland relied on imported fossil fuels for nearly three-quarters of its energy. The resources of the country—a landscape of hot springs, lava domes, and bubbling mud pots—were largely untapped. “In the past, people here in the valley lacked most things now considered essential to human life, except for a hundred thousand million tons of boiling-hot water,” the Icelandic Nobelist Halldór Laxness wrote in “A Parish Chronicle,” his 1970 novel. “For a hundred thousand years this water, more valuable than all coal mines, ran in torrents out to sea.” The oil crisis of 1973, when prices more than tripled, proved a useful emergency. Among other efforts to develop local energy, public-investment funds provided loans for geothermal projects, whose upfront costs were considerable. By the early eighties, almost all the country’s homes were heated geothermally; in Reykjavík, a subterranean geothermal-powered system is in place to melt snow and ice off sidewalks and roads. Today, more than a quarter of the country’s electricity comes from geothermal sources, a higher proportion than in almost any other nation. Most of the rest is from hydropower.

In some ways, the process of harnessing geothermal energy is simple. The deeper you dig, the hotter the temperatures get. For direct heating, you dig relatively shallow wells (typically several hundred metres deep), to access natural reservoirs of hot water or steam, which can be piped into a structure. For electricity, wells are dug farther down, to where temperatures are above a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius. (In Iceland, this temperature is reached at around one thousand to two thousand metres deep.) Pressurized steam spins a turbine that in turn spins a generator. Thermal energy (steam) is translated into mechanical energy (the spinning turbine), which is translated into electrical energy (via the generator). Geothermal energy is essentially carbon-free, it is available at any time of day and in any weather, and it leaves a small—albeit very deep—footprint on the landscape.

In 2008, Iceland’s three largest energy companies collaborated on a research project to drill down even farther, at a site near Krafla, for steam that was even hotter, some four hundred degrees Celsius. Such “supercritical” steam is water that is so hot and pressurized that it has passed into a fourth state, beyond gas. The hotter a well the better, typically: it will produce more energy more efficiently. The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (I.D.D.P.) engineers had planned to dig down some four kilometres—but their drill got stuck at around two kilometres. Bits of black glass shot up from the well. After some disbelief, the team concluded that they had hit magma. This oops-ing into magma was at first received as “very bad news,” Bjarni Palsson, a chief project manager on the I.D.D.P. and now an executive vice-president of the energy company Landsvirkjun, told me. Many people thought that drilling into magma might trigger a volcanic eruption. “Then we started to see: What actually do we have here?” Palsson said. They put a wellhead on their work to measure the flow rates of steam. “What happened next was remarkable,” Palsson continued. The magma was about nine hundred degrees Celsius. The steam flow was such that it could produce ten times more energy than a regular well. They had created the hottest and most powerful geothermal well in the world.

The station provides power to commercial buildings and heating to homes in the district. A rust-red building in the shape of a giant barn stood across from silvery cooling towers capped by cloud-white steam. Construction began in 1974 but took four years to finish, working around the Krafla fires, a series of volcanic eruptions that went on for years. (In Icelandic folklore, the region is where the Devil landed after being expelled from Heaven.) Around the station is a volcanic valley of green vegetation and basalt rock, with patches of snow. The wellhouses appeared as igloo-size aluminum geodesic domes; like the main power station, they were rust red. Einarsson opened one for me. Visible within was a thick horizontal pipe joined to a vertical one, with what looked like a ship’s steering wheel attached. Not visible was the well itself, which extended belowground like a long metal straw. (Krafla’s geothermal wells are about seven inches across, notably narrower than many oil and gas wells.) “Some wells last twenty years, some last two—you can’t know for certain,” Einarsson explained. The temperature and permeability of the rock, as well as the amount of fluid flowing across it, affect a well’s performance. Also, Iceland has myths about “hidden people”—huldufólk. It is said that building on their land brings bad luck, so there’s that, too.

We stopped by the station’s canteen, taking our shoes off before entering. Lunch had ended, but there was homemade apple cake, dried apricots, and skyr available. Workmen in neon-yellow suits, who had traded their boots for slippers, were having tea. Einarsson then took me to the I.D.D.P. site, not far from the Krafla plant, where a sign marked a snow-covered depression about the size of a modest pond. Compared with the turbines and steam towers and the idyllic orderliness of the canteen, the site was underwhelming. Two years after the well was dug, the extreme pressure and heat began to corrode the metal casing of the well itself. Black smoke poured out each time the well was reopened. Soon, it had to be shut down permanently. In 2017, another research well, I.D.D.P.-2, was drilled down four and a half kilometres, where temperatures reached at least four hundred and twenty-six degrees Celsius—but this time the well failed after only six months. “One thing we learned is that you don’t open and close and open and close the well—you just leave it open,” Palsson had told me, explaining that such actions made the well more brittle.

Landsvirkjun, which had paid for most of the I.D.D.P. work, decided that it needed financial support to drill more exploratory wells. “We said, ‘We’re just a small energy company in Iceland,’ ” Palsson told me. But it made its research available to the international scientific community, and there has been intermittent interest from the U.K., Germany, Canada, and New Zealand. “That’s where we are now, trying to fund it as a science project that can also benefit the energy industry,” Palsson said.

Driving back to the airport, we saw snow ptarmigans and cairns of black stones marking trails that stretched beyond view. Iceland’s transition into a country powered nearly completely by renewables can seem fantastical, and the landscape furthers this impression. Because Iceland is singular in so many ways—that lonely arctic-char species! those small horses with their tölt!—you can get the feeling that geothermal energy is a niche endeavor, as opposed to one that is technically and economically feasible in places where volcanic eruptions aren’t part of the daily forecast. But that feeling is outdated and misleading.

Geothermal is underdeveloped, and its upfront costs can be high, but it’s always on and, once it’s set up, it is cheap and enduring. The dream of geothermal energy is to meet humanity’s energy demands affordably, without harnessing horses for horsepower, slaughtering whales for their oil, or burning fossil fuels. The planet’s heat could be used to pasteurize milk or heat dorm rooms or light up a baseball stadium for a night game.

At more than five thousand degrees Celsius, the Earth’s core is roughly as hot as the surface of the sun. At the Earth’s surface, the temperature is about fourteen degrees. But in some places, like Iceland, the ground underfoot is much warmer. Hot springs, geysers, and volcanoes are surface-level signs of the Earth’s inferno. Dante’s description of Hell is said by some to have been inspired by the landscape of sulfurous steam plumes found in Devil’s Valley in Tuscany.

Snow monkeys and humans have been using Earth-heated waters as baths for ages. In the Azores, a local dish, cozido de las furnas, is cooked by burying a clay pot in hot volcanic soil; in Iceland, bread is still sometimes baked this way. The first geothermal power generator was built in Devil’s Valley, in 1904, by Prince Piero Ginori Conti of Trevignano, who had been extracting borax from the area and thought to make use of the steam emerging from the mining borehole. The generator initially powered five light bulbs. Not long afterward, it powered central Italy’s railway system and a few villages. The geothermal complex is still in operation today, providing one to two per cent of Italy’s energy. In the United States, the first geothermal plant was built in 1921, in Northern California, in a geyser-filled area that a surveyor described as the gates of Hell. That plant powered a nearby resort hotel and is also still in use.

There aren’t gates of Hell just anywhere. A kilometre below ground in Kamchatka is considerably hotter than a kilometre below ground in Kansas. There is also readily accessible geothermal energy in Kenya (where it provides almost fifty per cent of the country’s energy), New Zealand (about twenty per cent), and the Philippines (about fifteen per cent)—all volcanic areas along tectonic rifts. But in less Hadean landscapes the costs and uncertainties of drilling deep in search of sufficient heat have curtailed development. This partly explains why, in the field of clean energy, geothermal is often either not on the list or mentioned under the rubric of “other.” For decades, both private and government investment in geothermal energy was all but negligible.

That has now changed. In the past five years, in North America, more than a billion and a half dollars have gone into geothermal technologies. This is a small amount for the energy industry, but it’s also an exponential increase. In May, 2021, Google signed a contract with the Texas-based geothermal company Fervo to power its data centers and infrastructure in Nevada; Meta signed a similar deal with Texas-based Sage for a data center east of the Rocky Mountains, and with a company called XGS for one in New Mexico. Microsoft is co-developing a billion-dollar geothermal-powered data center in Kenya; Amazon installed geothermal heating at its newly built fulfillment center in Japan. (Geothermal energy enables companies to avoid the uncertainties of the electrical grid.) Under the Biden Administration, the geothermal industry finally received the same kind of tax credits given to wind and solar, and under the current Trump Administration it has received the same kind of fast-track permitting given to oil and gas. Donald Trump’s Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, spoke at a geothermal conference and declared, in front of a MAGA-like sign that read “MAGMA (Making America Geothermal: Modern Advances),” that although geothermal hasn’t achieved “liftoff yet, it should and it can.” Depending on whom you speak with, either it’s weird that suddenly everyone is talking about geothermal or it’s weird that there is a cost-competitive energy source with bipartisan appeal that no one is talking about.

Scientific work that has been discarded or forgotten can return—sometimes through unknowing repetition, at other times through deliberate recovery. In the early nineteen-seventies, the U.S. government funded a program at Los Alamos that looked into developing geothermal energy systems that didn’t require proximity to geysers or volcanoes. Two connected wells were built: in one, water was sent down into fractured hot, dry rock; from the other, the steam that resulted from the water meeting the rock emerged. In 1973, Richard Nixon announced Project Independence, which aimed to develop energy sources outside of fossil fuels. “But when Reagan came into office, he changed things,” Jefferson Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University, who was involved in the Los Alamos project, told me. The price of oil had come down, and support for geothermal dissipated. “People got this impression that it was a failure,” Tester said. “I think if they looked a little closer, they would see that a lot of the knowledge gained in those first years could have been used to leverage what is happening now.”

In 2006, Tester and his colleagues published their report, “The Future of Geothermal Energy.” One finding was that new drilling technology employed by the oil-and-gas industry was changing the economics of geothermal power generation. Latent ideas—like those from the Los Alamos project—had met their moment. “I was called to testify a few times before Congress. It was a relatively modest investment that was needed, and people were excited,” Tester told me. “But then we submitted the report to the Department of Energy. And they did nothing. It was crazy.” He was still visibly dismayed.

One explanation for the lack of action is that, around that time, the U.S. went from being an oil importer to an oil exporter. This turnaround was largely due to the innovations of George Mitchell, a second-generation Greek American in Galveston, Texas, who spent years trying to extract oil and gas from the Barnett Shale formation, in North Texas, in an economically viable way. His approach synthesized hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, with horizontal drilling. Fracking involves injecting fluid down a well at high pressures, which cracks the subsurface, and the horizontal drilling augments the area of cracking. Eventually, Mitchell’s company, helped by generous tax incentives, made the economics work. Vast oil reserves became accessible. Fortunes were made. Fracking overwhelmed the renewed interest in geothermal power. But a couple of decades later there was a reversal: fracking accelerated geothermal power.

Tim Latimer, the thirty-five-year-old C.E.O. of Fervo Energy, a geothermal company founded in 2017, grew up in Riesel, Texas, a small town about fifteen miles outside Waco. After graduating from the University of Tulsa with a degree in mechanical engineering, Latimer wanted a well-paid engineering job close to home. “My adviser was just, like, ‘Have you ever heard of the oil-and-gas industry?’ ” he said, smiling.

As a greenhorn drilling engineer with the international mining company BHP Billiton, Latimer was put on a fracking project in the Eagle Ford Shale, in South Texas. The shale, which is a Cretaceous-era formation dense with marine fossils from when the area was an inland sea, is relatively hard and hot. “The motors in our drill systems were failing early,” Latimer said. His supervisors suspected that this was because of the wells’ unusually high temperatures, around a hundred and seventy-five degrees Celsius. “They said, ‘Can you research what tools we could use to deal with the fact that these drilling temperatures are really high?’ ” Latimer told me.

Much of the relevant work Latimer came across turned up in papers about geothermal energy. “I’d never heard of geothermal before,” he said. “I was, like, ‘Well, this seems pretty cool.’ ” When Latimer read the 2006 “Future of Geothermal Energy” report, including its description of the Los Alamos geothermal project, he saw parallels to his work in oil and gas. The report described two big technical challenges that were standing in the way of affordable, bountiful clean energy. One was getting drilling costs down—an area that oil and gas had made great progress in. The other was getting water flowing through hot rock that isn’t sufficiently permeable, like shale, so that you can generate steam. “And I’m just looking at the rig, being, like, ‘This is a solved problem.’ ” Generating flow where there isn’t much naturally—that’s what hydraulic fracturing does.

Latimer reported what he had found to BHP. The shale drilling started working again, but Latimer’s imagination had shifted. In 2014, he applied to Stanford Business School with the goal of using fracking technology in geothermal wells. “Geothermal is an industry that, frankly, at that point in time, people had given up on as forgotten,” he said. “I didn’t think that was right. I was, like, ‘I’m a drilling engineer. I actually have a skill that can make a direct impact on this.’ ”

In 2017, Latimer and his Stanford colleague Jack Norbeck co-founded Fervo Energy. “Fracking” is an unpopular word. Fervo describes itself as a “next-generation geothermal energy developer.” Just as the fusion-energy industry avoids the phrase “nuclear fusion,” and the term “natural gas” is now used for what is mostly methane, geothermal systems involving hydraulic fracturing tend to be referred to as “enhanced” geothermal systems, or E.G.S.

In 2023, Fervo drilled a pair of demonstration wells in Nevada, proving its ideas in anticipation of scaling them up. The goal is to begin operating a five-hundred-megawatt geothermal power plant in Cape Station, Utah, with a hundred megawatts going online in 2026. This past June, Fervo drilled a four-and-a-half-kilometre appraisal well—a well for confirming predicted subsurface conditions before going all in on a site—that reached temperatures of two hundred and seventy degrees Celsius. The well was drilled in sixteen days, remarkably fast, and faster drill times mean lowered costs. Fervo’s well design and drilling technologies are central to its hopes, and have helped it raise more than eight hundred million dollars in investment capital. Most everyone I spoke to seems to be rooting for Fervo, albeit with some skepticism. The Utah site is far away from a source for the large amounts of water that will be required, for instance. There are more technical points of concern, too. Fracking can induce seismic activity, so the siting of wells is an important consideration. Enthusiasts see these as solvable problems. And Fervo is not alone in showing promise in the use of fracking to access geothermal power. At the end of October, Mazama Energy demonstrated a pilot E.G.S. in Newberry, Oregon, that works at an even higher temperature: above three hundred degrees Celsius. For now, though, E.G.S. is still a kind of wildcat proposition. “I think the big question is: Who are the next nine Fervos?” Roland Horne, a professor of energy science and engineering at Stanford, who has studied geothermal energy for about fifty years, said. “Fervo has expanded tremendously, they’re a nearly two-hundred-person company, but they don’t have the wherewithal to do a gigawatt project yet.”

Fervo pitches itself as a landing place for oil-and-gas workers. “I’ve spent a lot of my life and career in small towns where the largest economic driver is oil and gas,” Latimer said. Geothermal means jobs in drilling: engineers, geologists, project managers. Barry Smitherman, who has worked as an oil-and-gas regulator in Texas and as the head of a utility company, told me, “We’ve been drilling oil and gas wells in Texas for over a hundred years. We’ve drilled over a million wells. We know what the world looks like below the surface in Texas.”

In February, 2021, Winter Storm Uri left most of Texas without power for days. Not long afterward, Smitherman was asked to speak to state legislators about what went wrong and what needed to change. Soon he got a call from a foundation set up by George Mitchell and his wife, Cynthia. (George, who died in 2013, is known as the “father of fracking.”) The Mitchell Foundation wanted Smitherman to help start a local organization that would advocate on behalf of geothermal energy. He co-founded the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance in 2022. During his long career in energy, Smitherman said, “we never had a conversation about geothermal. No one had brought it to my attention.” Smitherman had a series of meetings with people from geothermal startups, oil-and-gas companies, the Sierra Club, and utility companies. “What we’ve always said around energy is that you need three legs—reliable, clean, and cheap. Those are the three legs of the stool. The old saying was ‘I can give you two of three, but I can’t give you all three,’ ” he said. “But, as we began to look at geothermal, it really began to look like it had all three—low to no carbon, 24/7, and, as the cost curve comes down, eventually, cheap. It really began to look like this unicorn resource.”

Tester now teaches at Cornell, near the Finger Lakes, where in the winter Buttermilk and Taughannock Falls turn to blue ribbons of ice. “If we look at the country and say our goal is ultimately to be much more sustainable with respect to our carbon footprint, you can’t ignore heating,” Tester said. Around thirty per cent of New York State’s carbon footprint can be attributed to heating and cooling buildings, a figure that is not far from the worldwide average. “A lot of it is for space heating and water heating, but also for low-temperature food processing, things like that,” Tester added. The excitement about geothermally generated electricity can obscure the thing that geothermal technology is, arguably, best suited to provide. “It’s a little bit apples and oranges, and we need both electricity and heating,” Tester told me. But he went on to explain that using electricity for heating is not nearly as efficient as using heat for heating. And geothermal wells for heating, which can be relatively shallow, can work in places with no hot springs or volcanoes.

Midtown Manhattan, for example: as part of a major renovation completed in 2017, ten geothermal wells were dug beneath St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Some of the wells are less than a hundred metres deep, while others extend more than six hundred and fifty metres, more than ten times deeper than Manhattan’s deepest subway tunnel—and yet much shallower than the wells needed for a geothermal power plant. These wells carry warmth into the cathedral in winter, and out of the cathedral in summer, and do so with less noise and vibration than typical HVAC systems. The main issue is the upfront cost. When the cathedral’s system was built, it felt radical. One of the lead engineers on the project, Paul Boyce, of P. W. Grosser Consulting, told me that the demand for geothermal heating systems has grown dramatically since then. P.W.G.C.’s current geothermal projects include the Mastercard headquarters, in Purchase, New York, and the Obama Presidential Center, in Chicago. In Greenpoint, Brooklyn, an eight-hundred-and-thirty-four-unit apartment complex that’s under construction has its heating and cooling provided through three hundred boreholes, none much deeper than about a hundred and fifty metres. The system was put in by Geosource Energy, a geothermal company started in 2004.

But those projects provide geothermal energy building by building, not district by district. “I wish we were looking at how we plan our cities,” Tester said. “It’s crazy that heating, electricity, cable, water—these are all managed separately.” He is now in the midst of a research project that aims to demonstrate the feasibility of an ambitious geothermal system to serve Cornell’s seven-hundred-and-forty-five-acre campus, something close to what downtown Reykjavík has—but without the aid of close-to-the-surface magma. In the summer of 2022, a rig set up not far from Cornell’s School of Veterinary Medicine drilled for sixty-five days through layers of shale, limestone, and sandstone, passing beyond the geologic time of the dinosaurs to a crystalline basement dating to the Proterozoic eon, more than five hundred million years ago. This created the Cornell University Borehole Observatory (CUBO). In Iceland, if you dig down this deep, the temperatures could easily be four hundred degrees Celsius; in New York, the rocks are cooler, but the Cornell project needs to reach only eighty to ninety degrees Celsius. As CUBO was drilled, rock samples from each depth were analyzed, and the surrounding natural fracture systems were mapped. If CUBO secures more funding, the next stage will be to drill a pair of wells, with one for injecting water to make an underground reservoir and the other to bring the heated water up.

In other geographies, geothermal energy for district heating and cooling has been accomplished with shallower wells. Mieres, Spain, a historic mining town, uses warm water from the now closed mines to supply heat to the region. Nijar, also in Spain but closer to a volcano, uses an underground fluid reservoir to heat its greenhouses. Hayden, Colorado, a former coal town, is working with Bedrock Energy, a Texas-based company started in 2022, to construct a municipal geothermal district, in the hope that reduced energy bills will attract businesses. In Framingham, Massachusetts, activists and a local energy company collaborated on a geothermal heating-and-cooling network, and near Austin, Texas, the neighborhood of Whisper Valley is putting in a similar grid. Several companies, including Bedrock and Dig Energy, are aiming to bring drilling costs down by half or more. Geothermal systems for heating and cooling individual homes remain somewhat pricey to install, but they last for decades, reduce energy bills by twenty-five to fifty per cent, and avoid reliance on the ever more burdened electrical grid. Most people I spoke with in the geothermal industry make their case for it by focussing on cost savings; the unspoken climate benefits are known to those disposed to care, and potentially off-putting to those who are not.

Some environmentalists argue that the resources given to geothermal—or to small modular nuclear plants, or to fusion—would be better spent elsewhere. Why not just go all in on solar, wind, and batteries, which are proven, scalable technologies? To invest in more speculative solutions, the argument goes, is a moral hazard, and a cynical or naïve distraction that obscures the solutions available now. But this line of thinking rests on the assumption that the people or nations or agencies that would fund one kind of energy would equally fund some other kind. This tends not to be true—funding is rarely fungible, and always capricious. One geothermal-startup founder spoke of receiving a call from a potential investor’s adviser, who said, Sorry, the managing partner wants to invest in a blimp company instead. “Geothermal is the least moral hazard-y of the clean-energy technologies,” Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, said. “And we are still subsidizing nuclear a thousand times more than geothermal.”

An energy future without hydrocarbons will require working flexibly with the many variables of resources, geography, and politics. “We can get maybe ninety per cent of the way with solar, batteries, wind,” Leah Stokes, a professor of environmental politics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told me. “But geothermal is one of the things that can fill that gap.” Investment follows fashion—and geothermal has become fashionable—but it’s not only investors who appear confident about geothermal. Wagner called this “the moment when Ph.D.s meet M.B.A.s.”

The role of geothermal becomes easier to see when looking beyond the local noise of discussions in America. “You know, there’s this thing called the curse of abundance,” Agnelli Kafuwe, the principal energy officer for the Zambian government, told me. Typically, the phrase refers to countries driven into corruption and misery by their oil endowments, but Kafuwe was referring to Zambia’s seemingly boundless supply of hydroelectric energy, from power stations such as one at the Zambezi River’s Mosi-oa-Tunya, the natural feature known to most Americans as Victoria Falls. For many years, hydropower met practically all of Zambia’s energy needs, even powering its lucrative copper mines.","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6913c03f9ce1c24aaa1bac3c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r47020.jpg",N,,2025-11-17 13:01:43.157268

Under the new “American Energy Dominance” policy, US taxpayers are supposed to shell out millions of dollars to keep old, outdated coal power plants up and running. Too bad all that money will go to waste. The killer combo of solar energy plus energy storage is already dominating new grid capacity additions, and now here comes the US startup First Solar with plans to expand domestic production of its next-generation thin film solar technology.

Thin Film Solar & Domestic Manufacturing

Thin film solar is just what it says. Instead of the chunks of silicon that characterize conventional solar cells, thin film solar cells can be mixed in a solution and sprayed or printed onto a surface. That opens up the potential for deploying low cost, roll-to-roll manufacturing systems, helping to push down the overall cost of solar power (see lots more thin film background here).

First Solar has its roots in the 1990 thin film solar startup Solar Cells, Inc, a specialist in the CdTe (cadmium telluride) thin film formula. Following a buyout and rebrand in 1999, the company has been making thin film solar cells under the First Solar moniker since 2002, currently billing itself as the only one among the biggest solar manufacturers in the world to be headquartered in the US. With domestic orders for its thin film technology on the rise, the missing link is a fully domestic manufacturing footprint.

First Solar has taken several steps in that direction in recent years with a healthy assist from state policy makers, including many who put aside red-state rhetoric in favor of job creation and long term economic benefits. In September of 2024, for example, state and local officials in Alabama celebrated the opening of a new First Solar factory in Lawrence County.

“First Solar is a world-class manufacturer, and its solar modules are poised to play an increasingly important role in U.S. energy self-sufficiency,” said Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who welcomed the company’s plans to invest in South Carolina back in November of 2022.

The Law Of Unintended Consequences

The abrupt shift in federal energy policy this year has put a crimp in the momentum of the domestic solar industry. Among other hurdles, in July the US Congress cut back on solar tax credits with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” In addition, new regulations that restrict the use of overseas supply chains in domestic manufacturing will kick in next year.

Despite the fresh obstacles, the demand for solar power is not going to vanish into thin air. It’s common knowledge but worth repeating that solar and energy storage are the quickest and most competitive means of adding more generating capacity to the nation’s grid. A new analysis from Deloitte, for example, finds that renewable energy accounted for more than 90% of new capacity additions during the first half of this year, with solar and storage making up more than 80% of that figure.

With that in mind, it’s no surprise to see that First Solar plans to build yet another new US factory. To be located in the city of Gaffney in Cherokee County, South Carolina, the new facility will fabricate thin film solar cells from First Solar’s existing fleet of factories into solar modules, satisfying the demands of the forthcoming domestic manufacturing environment.

Word of the new factory leaked out through the trade press two weeks ago. On November 14 the company finally outlined its plans in a general announcement, in which it explained why it expects the venture to be a rousing success.

“The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025,” First Solar stated, giving credit where credit is due.

“The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027,” the company added, referring to the new restrictions on overseas supply chains.

Thin Film Solar & Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

Following First Solar’s lead, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster also endorsed the project as a springboard for domestic energy production.

“First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence,” McMaster said in a press statement. “Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

No kidding. Between inflation, tariffs, and job-sucking AI technology, a good job is getting harder to find these days. First Solar expects the new facility to be up and running sometime during the second half of next year, much to the relief of 600 job seekers in South Carolina.

What’s All This About Coal, Then?

First Solar also points out that the new factory will complement its five existing plants in Ohio, Alabama, and Louisiana, along with R&D facilities in California and Ohio. “By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.”

In terms of direct employment, First Solar expects to have more than 5,500 people on its direct employment rolls by the end of next year. That’s just one solar company. There are others, of course. Keep an eye on Texas, which has refashioned itself as an epicenter of solar manufacturing in the US.

In comparison, all of US coal mining only accounted for about 41,000 jobs as of August this year. It’s also worth noting that competition from wind, solar, and storage is a recent phenomenon. Coal jobs were falling by the wayside all throughout the earlier part of the 20th century as machines took over hand labor, reaching a 40-year peak of 178,000 in 1985 and dropping to 90,000 in 2011. That trend was largely spurred by the natural gas fracking boom of the early 2000s, as the cost of renewable energy was relatively high.

Now that the cost of renewables and storage has dropped, coal-friendly policy makers have a tougher row to hoe. It’s going to get tougher in the coming years. Alongside thin film solar, new energy storage systems are also emerging on the market, with new, next-generation solar materials following close behind.

,American Energy,2025-11-17 15:21:40+00:00,Utility Dive,America's EVs are a $30B grid asset. Let's not lock it away. | Utility Dive,"Robert Walton, Nick Woolley",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/electric-vehicle-ev-grid-asset-charging-dr/805642/,"In contrast to other distributed energy resources like energy storage, EVs require no capital to deploy.
In the future, with vehicle-to-grid technology, we can also use the colossal latent capacity in EV batteries to export energy onto the grid.
This simple act of coordination strengthens the grid, prevents blackouts and lowers costs for everyone, not just EV drivers.
If we create an open road, we can bring every stakeholder to the table and enable truly dynamic load shifting, critical to reducing energy rates.
Committing to this shared vision is our direct route to finally lowering electricity rates for everyone.","Soaring electricity prices are squeezing American households and businesses, and are expected to continue rising. Simultaneously, a quiet revolution is taking place in our driveways: Over 7 million electric vehicles have already been sold in the U.S. Right now, we treat them as just cars, but they are also massive, mobile batteries that have the potential to slash electricity rates for every American household by as much as 10% and deliver over $30 billion in annual grid benefits by 2035 — all without disrupting EV drivers’ needs.

In contrast to other distributed energy resources like energy storage, EVs require no capital to deploy. People are already buying EVs to drive places. When we tap into them when they are not being used, we’re tapping an asset with no additional costs. But we are at a critical moment and must move forward with openness, to achieve scale and avoid squandering the momentum we’ve gained so far.

The technology to unlock this value is called “managed charging.” Instead of every EV charging the moment it’s plugged in, creating huge spikes in demand for electricity, managed charging allows vehicles to intelligently draw power when it’s cheapest and most abundant, such as overnight or when solar and wind generation is high — and when vehicles are already plugged in and have plenty of time to charge. In the future, with vehicle-to-grid technology, we can also use the colossal latent capacity in EV batteries to export energy onto the grid. This simple act of coordination strengthens the grid, prevents blackouts and lowers costs for everyone, not just EV drivers.

Pioneering programs from California to New York are already proving this works for tens of thousands of drivers. The technology is secure, tested and ready to scale. The question now facing industry leaders is no longer whether managed charging works, but how to implement it. Will we build an open, competitive and consumer-friendly energy future, or will we allow a few dominant players to create closed, proprietary “toll roads” that lock in consumers, stifle innovation and raise electricity rates everywhere across the U.S.?

The first path, built on interoperability and open standards, accelerates innovation with a dynamic marketplace. In this future, an EV driver can choose to enroll and coordinate their charging anywhere, using any app or service provider. An open, omni-channel experience enables users to enroll from wherever they are and maximizes the potential for growth. This is critical if demand flexibility is to scale and reach its potential to drive down all of our energy bills. And it’s just like the internet, where you can browse on multiple devices, across different browsers, in any location.

We know this is the model that built the modern technology economy — one of explosive innovation driven by open access. It’s also the foundation for a competitive market where the many buyers and providers of demand flexibility can all participate, from vehicle or charger integrations to utilities’ advanced metering infrastructure. Limiting market interactions to one pathway interferes with the market and misses the opportunity to optimize energy supply and demand.

The open road creates a clear win-win-win. For automakers, it accelerates EV adoption by making ownership more affordable and appealing, increasing sales volume. For utilities, it provides the dynamic grid control needed to improve reliability and integrate more renewables. And most importantly, for consumers, it delivers real reductions on their monthly electricity bills and preserves their freedom of choice to interact with their charging through any service provider, whether that’s an OEM, an energy utility, or other third party.

The second path is a toll road leading to a monopolistic future. In this scenario, a few powerful players become roadblocks, controlling access to the vehicle’s charging data, gating it behind exorbitant fees or locking consumers into their proprietary systems. Competition withers. Participants are shut out of the market because there’s not enough value left to incentivize them to do the right thing. Instead of reducing energy bills, this approach will bake in new costs for consumers and create a new, unnecessary class of gatekeepers. We’ve seen this movie before with closed technology ecosystems, and it always ends with less choice, higher utility bills, lower participation rates and a less equitable energy transition.

If we create an open road, we can bring every stakeholder to the table and enable truly dynamic load shifting, critical to reducing energy rates. Previous approaches to managing demand, like electricity rates that vary by time of day based on general usage patterns, have been a valuable first step, but this static tool is now showing its limitations. In some areas, these rates have actually created new, artificial “charging peaks” at the start of an “off peak” time period that can stress the grid more than the problem they were designed to solve. This isn’t smart management; it’s just moving the problem around. What we need is a system that responds dynamically to the shifting needs of the grid, the user and capabilities of the charging equipment. This requires an open road, with everyone playing their part to drive costs down.

AURORA, Ill., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- West Aurora School District 129 (SD129) today introduced 27 all-electric Blue Bird school buses, now the largest electric school bus fleet operating in the Chicago region. The fleet will reduce emissions in the community, lower operating costs, and provide a quieter, more comfortable experience for students and drivers alike. The initiative reflects West Aurora's ongoing leadership in improving operational efficiency and environmental performance across its schools, including investments in solar energy, building upgrades, and waste reduction efforts.

The district partnered with Highland Electric Fleets, North America's leading provider of Electrification-as-a-Service (EaaS), to support the transition. Highland managed vehicle procurement, charger installation, and long-term fleet services to ensure reliable daily operations. The fleet is powered by 14 Zerova 60kW chargers, providing flexible charging capacity to meet route demands and support future fleet growth.

Funding for the initiative includes nearly $5 million from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program and additional incentives from ComEd, which provided $450,000 in vehicle rebates and approximately $480,000 in make-ready support to prepare charging infrastructure.

""West Aurora is proud to strengthen our commitment to our schools and community by adding electric buses to our sustainability efforts,"" said Dr. Angie Smith, SD129 Associate Superintendent of Operations. ""We continue to work to find ways to provide a healthier environment for our students and families, while also achieving savings for our taxpayers. We hope to be able to demonstrate to other districts that electrification of even a portion of your fleet can make a difference that we can all benefit from.""

Project partners include Central States Bus Sales, which supplied the Blue Bird buses; ComEd, the district's utility partner, in addition to providing financial support; and Grand Kahn Electric, which led installation of the charging equipment.

""ComEd is proud to fund electrification projects like West Aurora School District 129's and hundreds of others across the region as our customers and communities take steps toward a lower carbon future,"" said Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd. ""EV rebates are helping reduce the upfront costs while also bringing us closer to achieving the state's energy and climate goals.""

""West Aurora's leadership is evident across everything they do, from energy efficiency to waste reduction and now transportation,"" said Joshua Williams, Senior Midwestern Regional Manager at Highland Electric Fleets. ""They're showing what it looks like when a district turns long-term commitments into measurable progress for students and the community.""

A ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the launch will take place at 10:30 am on 11/17/25 at 220 Alder Dr., North Aurora, IL 60542. Media and community members are invited to attend.

The newest facility, in Louisiana, began production earlier this year.
“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar.

The company currently has three US manufacturing facilities in Ohio, one in Alabama and one in Louisiana, as well as research and development (R&D) facilities in Ohio and California. The newest facility, in Louisiana, began production earlier this year.

First Solar’s decision to expand its US manufacturing presence is a direct response to the US government’s trade policies and the passage of the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) act which set more stringent rules on sourcing renewable energy technologies and components.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

First Solar said it expects its US production to be “fully compliant” with the new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which were introduced under the OBBB and limit the access of China-based or Chinese-backed companies to the US renewables market. Widmar previously said that the OBBB “strengthens” First Solar’s position in the US market – this is largely due to its use of CdTe technology, which is isolated from the silicon-based supply chain that dictates most of the global industry.

As well as benefitting from greater protectionism by the Trump administration – measures which are likely to cause problems for its silicon-based competitors – First Solar will be pleased with the decision of the US Geological Survey to include tellurium in its list of Critical Minerals.

The verdict came as Hasina has been living in exile in India. Bangladesh has been rocked by 30 bomb explosions and dozens of arson attacks over the past few days in the lead-up to the verdict. This comes as Bangladesh is expected to hold parliamentary elections in February of next year.

Bangladesh

In Gaza, Israeli forces have killed at least three Palestinians as Israel continues to violate the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Since the start of the truce on October 10, at least 266 Palestinians have been killed and 635 wounded by Israeli attacks. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel is reporting that at least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, and that the real death toll is likely to be much higher because hundreds of people detained in Gaza are still missing. Meanwhile, UNICEF estimates more than 600,000 Palestinian children have missed out on school during the war, and only 100,000 have managed to return to classrooms. Humanitarian NGOs say Israel is still restricting the entry of food aid and other critical supplies into the Gaza Strip. Here’s Zahia Al-Shambari, who waited in line to buy bread in Khan Younis.

Zahia Al-Shambari: “After two hours of struggle at the supermarket to get a bag of bread, thank God, I finally got one bag of bread for about eight people. I’m really happy that I’m returning with a bag of bread. And I hope the suffering doesn’t happen again, not today, not tomorrow, not any other day.”

This comes as the U.N. Security Council is set to vote today on a U.S. proposal to establish an International Stabilization Force to enforce the Gaza ceasefire. The U.S.-drafted resolution also mentions the possibility of a future Palestinian state. But on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outright rejected any path for Palestinian statehood.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory west of the Jordan River, this opposition exists, is valid and has not changed one bit. I have been rebuffing these attempts for decades, and I am doing it both against pressure from outside and against pressure from within. So I do not need affirmations, tweets or lectures from anyone.”

Meanwhile, new details are emerging about a shadowy organization called Al-Majd Europe that’s been taking Palestinians in Gaza to South Africa. The organization reportedly has ties to Israel. Last week, a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians landed in Johannesburg. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said, “It does seem like they were being flushed out” of Gaza.

President Trump said Sunday he was open to talks with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as he considers whether to launch a unilateral attack on Venezuela. In brief remarks to reporters, Trump did not offer details about the possible discussions but said, “Venezuela would like to talk.” Trump’s remarks came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated the organized criminal group Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. U.S. officials have claimed without evidence Maduro and other government officials lead the cartel. Trump has claimed that allows the Pentagon to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it had killed another three people in the eastern Pacific accused of smuggling drugs by sea, though officials offered no evidence. That brings the reported toll to 83 people killed across 21 strikes since early September.

This comes amid the largest buildup of U.S. forces in the Caribbean since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, involving nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 15,000 sailors and Marines. In Caracas, President Nicolás Maduro warned the U.S. public against allowing the Trump administration to lead the U.S. into a new “forever war” in South America.

President Nicolás Maduro: “Do we want another Gaza, now in South America? What do the people of the United States say? Do you want a new Afghanistan? Do you want Vietnam again? Do you want Libya once more? Or worse, do you want a new Gaza in South America? Let me tell you: no, no and no. Here peace will triumph, international law will triumph.”

Masked federal immigration officers fanned out across Charlotte over the weekend, sparking protests as the Trump administration shifted its mass deportation campaign to North Carolina’s largest city. Democratic Governor Josh Stein said the agents were carrying out racial profiling and stoking fear.

Gov. Josh Stein: “We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks.”

Among those targeted were landscapers decorating Christmas trees and congregants of an east Charlotte church volunteering to tend a garden. In another incident shared widely on social media, masked federal agents pulled over Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduras-born U.S. citizen, and forced him from his vehicle.

Willy Wender Aceituno Medina: “No. If you break it, you will pay for it. If you break it, you will pay for it. If you break my window.”

CBP agent: “Get out!”

Willy Wender Aceituno Medina: “Why did you do this, sir? Why are you doing this?”

Aceituno told reporters he warned the agents he was a U.S. citizen but that they didn’t believe him. He suffered cuts to his arm and a neck injury. He later filed a police report over the broken glass.

President Trump has called on House Republicans to approve a measure compelling the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Trump’s reversal late Sunday came after he unsuccessfully lobbied Republican Congresswomen Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace to remove their names from a discharge petition seeking the files’ release. This follows months of stonewalling by the Trump administration over the files’ release, and after Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson adjourned the House early to prevent a vote on the Epstein files. On Friday, Trump demanded the Justice Department investigate a list of powerful Democrats discussed in a trove of newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein — but omitted his own name. The list includes former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. Trump wrote on social media, “Epstein was a Democrat and he is the Democrats problem, not the Republicans problem!”

The Georgia election interference case against President Trump and his allies will now have a new prosecutor after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed from the case. The executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, Pete Skandalakis, is set to take over the case. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis told the Associated Press, “I doubt anything will ever move forward with the president.” But the case could proceed against 14 other Trump allies, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Trump has pardoned Giuliani, Meadows and dozens of other Republican officials and activists accused of helping him overturn the results of the 2020 election, but the pardons only apply to federal cases, not the Georgia election interference case, which is a state-level prosecution.

In the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets Sunday to demand accountability over a corruption scandal that exposed how top government officials were receiving kickbacks from construction companies responsible for faulty and incomplete flood defense projects. The three-day protest rally comes after typhoons battered the Philippines earlier this month, leaving at least 259 people dead.

Armelyn Bandril: “Almost a hundred days has passed since the process began, yet no one has been jailed. There already is plenty of proof. A lot of evidence has come out. But our question is: How come no one has been jailed yet?”

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 32 people were killed after a bridge at a copper and cobalt mine collapsed due to overcrowding. A government agency report said gunfire from soldiers at the site sparked panic among the miners, who rushed to the bridge, causing it to collapse. The DRC is the world’s largest producer of cobalt, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.

A BBC investigation has uncovered new evidence that implicates two U.S. Marines in the killing of Iraqi civilians in Haditha two decades ago. The BBC reports statements and testimony given in the aftermath of the Haditha massacre raise doubts about the investigation into what happened November 19, 2005, when U.S. forces slaughtered 24 Iraqis, posing significant questions over how U.S. armed forces are held to account. Just one U.S. soldier was convicted of a crime over the massacre. Marine Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich was found guilty of negligent dereliction of duty in 2012 and served no jail time.

Disability rights advocate and writer Alice Wong has died at the age of 51. When Wong was born with muscular dystrophy in 1974, doctors said she wouldn’t live to the age of 18. Despite that prognosis, Wong went on to earn an undergraduate degree at Indiana University and a master’s degree from the University of California, San Francisco before founding the Disability Visibility Project, an online community dedicated to creating, sharing and amplifying disability media and culture. This is Alice Wong speaking with Democracy Now! in 2021.

Alice Wong: “I think a lot of people in the public do not know what ableism is, and if they hear about it, they actually deny that it exists. … You know, ableism is systemic. And it’s really bound up with hypercapitalism and white supremacy.”

Budzinski was one of 48 farm state lawmakers who wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin last month urging his agency to stick with the higher standards, despite opposition from refining state members.
Oil state lawmakers, meanwhile, are concerned that the proposal would force U.S. refiners to raise costs, making their products less competitive.","The perennial battle over EPA’s biofuels mandates is coming to a head soon as the agency works on finalizing updates to the Renewable Fuel Standard’s blending obligations.

So far, the EPA’s proposal for the 2026 and 2027 RFS mandates has drawn the support of farm-state lawmakers — who often find themselves at odds with the Trump administration over issues such as trade policy — and put some of the president’s oil industry allies on the defensive.

The proposed updates, released in June, would increase the program’s renewable volume obligations, which dictate how much biofuel — such as corn-based ethanol and biodiesel made from feedstocks like soybean oil and animal fats — is mixed into the nation’s transportation fuel supply.

The agency is now sifting through public comments, submitted during a period that ended Oct. 31, before sending a draft final rule to the White House Budget office for review.

Imports penalized

Under the proposed rule, the renewable fuel volume requirement would rise from the current standard by about 1.7 billion ethanol-equivalent gallons in 2026 and 2.1 billion EEGs in 2027.

And, in a departure from current policy, the proposal would cut in half the value of renewable identification numbers, or RINs — tradeable credits oil refiners can buy in lieu of meeting their biofuel blending targets — for imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks.

These changes would provide a competitive advantage to U.S. farmers and biofuel producers, who would benefit from the larger renewable volume obligations, known as RVOs, combined with larger RIN values for their domestic products that make them more attractive.

But they could make meeting those obligations more costly for refiners. To keep expenses down while maintaining compliance with RFS requirements, refiners often rely on a global supply of feedstocks and biofuels. Industry sources say this is at least partly because domestic supplies are insufficient to meet RFS volume obligations.

“You can think of it this way — that biofuel producers end up getting a subsidy out of this program, but oil producers end up getting taxed because they have to comply with this and actually buy those tradeable credits,” said Nafisa Lohawala, a fellow at Resources for the Future whose research focuses on transportation issues. “The fact that the incentives are quite different on both sides means that their priorities are going to be quite different.”

Members representing farm states — including Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. among others — have been outspoken in their support for the RFS update as proposed in June.

“I’m hoping to see a standard that gets finalized before the end of the year that gives our growers in Illinois and throughout the Midwest, especially our corn and soybean growers — who are growing for the ethanol and the biodiesel that we make right here — some certainty around the RFS,” Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., said in an interview.

Budzinski was one of 48 farm state lawmakers who wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin last month urging his agency to stick with the higher standards, despite opposition from refining state members.

Oil state lawmakers, meanwhile, are concerned that the proposal would force U.S. refiners to raise costs, making their products less competitive.

“Domestic producers rely on global supply chains for cost-effective feedstocks and imports are critical to the viability of the domestic refinery industry,” a group of 40 House Republicans wrote to Zeldin in September. “If the RIN value for foreign feedstocks is reduced, domestic fuel manufacturers will be at a competitive disadvantage compared to foreign producers, hampering President Trump’s strategy to unleash American energy.”

Small-refinery exemptions

Also at issue is whether and to what degree larger refiners may have to take on the extra obligations that result from small-refinery exemptions, known as SREs, that are sometimes granted by EPA to small refiners that can demonstrate “disproportionate economic hardship.”

The EPA has historically taken differing approaches to handling the waived volumes, given their impact on the overall blending mandate. But whether those gallons should be reallocated or reduced under the new guidelines has been cause for debate. The September House GOP letter to Zeldin, which included the party’s full Texas delegation, urged him not to reallocate the waived volumes.

“SREs are essential to helping small refineries manage the regulatory costs of the RFS program, but it is critical these obligations are not transferred to other refineries,” they said. “Reallocating these obligations would place an undue burden on companies that have invested billions of dollars to legally comply with the program and create significant disruptions in the fuel market.”

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, took the matter further, complaining about the influence of the “swampy corn lobby” and introducing a bill to block EPA from implementing reallocation.

“By jamming through more biofuels and environmental compliance costs, the corn lobby is stifling US energy producers and jacking up the price of fuel,” Lee, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a September news release announcing his bill. “It’s bad for refineries, bad for American families, and bad for American energy independence.”

The following week, EPA issued a supplemental proposal that added the option of partial reallocations to the mix. But the farm state lawmakers told Zeldin 100 percent reallocation would be best for the heartland.

“Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won’t reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump,” the bipartisan and bicameral group of farm state lawmakers said in their letter to Zeldin. “Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices.”

‘Death by a thousand cuts’

Oil industry insiders say that, taken together, increased RVOs, reduced RIN values for foreign-produced feedstocks and potential SRE reallocations could increase the cost of compliance.

“It’s really kind of death by a thousand cuts,” an industry source said. “And what our fear is is that if all these things go forward, there essentially aren’t enough RINs to buy, and compliance becomes very difficult for refiners.”

Asked about those concerns, Budzinski said, “I don’t see it.”

“I think that this allows our ethanol and biodiesel industries to have competitive equal footing with the oil refineries,” she said, “especially during a time when our growers are going through a lot of uncertainty within the farm economy itself.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/dem_retreat_613_031325.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 11:09:02.312777

To do otherwise is to poorly serve the future generations who will bear the brunt of our neglect,” said Pinsky. “We must not fail to hear the pulse of the planet amid the daily political static. Climate change is real, happening now, and can begin to be corrected by coupling cleaner energy technologies with political and decisive action.”

“Maryland is already moving — solving problems, proving concepts, and scaling solutions,” added Ortiz. “We’re coming together across sectors, and our job now is simple: keep the momentum going.”

The Forum also feature breakout sessions featuring local and state government representatives, climate resiliency experts, and private industry and nonprofit partners and discussions centered on best practices and scalable strategies for clean energy development, building resilient communities, strengthening community engagement, and mobilizing climate finance.

Maryland’s Chief Sustainability Officer Meghan Conklin closed the program discussing several of the advancements Governor Wes Moore’s administration is implementing at the State level on climate and sustainability and encouraged local governments and agencies to do the same.

“During these trying times at the Federal level, I am proud to highlight the record of accomplishments on climate, clean energy, and the environment of the Moore-Miller Administration, such as Governor Moore's historic agreement to provide $340 million to improve water quality at the Conowingo Dam,” said Conklin.

“Today’s gathering showed that leaders across multiple sectors in Maryland increasingly recognize that clean energy is cheap energy,” said Tim Lattimer, Administrator, Office of Community Sustainability. “By bringing the public and private sectors to forge closer partnerships, we can boost economic prosperity, secure reliable and affordable energy, and safeguard our environment for ourselves, our kids, and generations to come.”

Since taking office in December 2018, Ball’s administration quickly stepped up Howard County’s climate leadership by signing the “We Are Still In” declaration in support of the Paris Agreement and joining the U.S. Climate Alliance in early 2019. In 2020, the County executed Maryland’s largest solar power purchase agreement (PPA). Projected to save the County about $30 million in energy costs over 25 years, through this innovative deal, a solar provider has installed and maintained solar panels across various County properties at its own expense and then sells the electricity generated at an affordable rate. With these PPA projects now nearly 97 percent complete, the County today generates enough clean solar power to meet the electricity needs of more than half of all County Government buildings.

In 2022, the County became the first county to be certified as ‘LEED Platinum for Cities and Communities’ by the U.S. Green Building Council.

In July 2025, Ball signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) to enhance collaboration on climate and sustainability priorities with the Columbia Association (CA). This MOU leverages the strengths of local county partners to elevate the County’s ‘Howard County Climate Forward’ from a “whole-of-government” effort to a “whole-of-community” approach.

Additionally, this past August, Ball signed a climate and energy independence MOU with Howard Community College (HCC) and Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) to enhance collaboration between the County, HCPSS, and HCC and strengthen local action on energy production and independence. The MOU provides a framework for Howard County, HCPSS, and HCC to collaborate on energy generation, transportation, waste management, stormwater, nature-based climate solutions, ecosystem services, emergency management, infrastructure and heat resiliency, education, and community engagement campaigns and programs. The County and these two education partners are currently working toward developing a second solar PPA.

In addition, the County has:

Expanded solar deployment countywide by 23 percent this past year alone, reaching 150 megawatts installed, which is already one-third of the County’s Howard County Climate Forward 2030 target;

Implemented new building codes that ensure every new home or business constructed in Howard County will be solar-ready, EV-ready, and electric HVAC-ready, embedding tomorrow’s progress into every blueprint;

Established a Solar Implementation Task Force, a cross-departmental team of experts across the County working to bring more clean energy online faster. The Task Force aims to streamline processes to help accelerate clean energy deployment in pursuit of the County’s goal of reaching 437 megawatts of solar by 2030;

Americans just lost federal tax credits for buying an electric vehicle, but charging one has grown more convenient in recent months.

About 780 public high-speed charging stations opened in the US in the third quarter, the largest such infrastructure boom on record, according to Department of Energy data. The nation’s charging infrastructure expanded by 19% in the first nine months of the year.

“The growth is pretty amazing right now given current policy and investment sentiment,” said Chris Pierce, an analyst covering charging networks at Needham & Co. investment bank.

Many of the new stations were likely given the green light before President Donald Trump took office, according to Pierce. However, charging executives say the market for electrons is still underserved, even though EV sales are expected to slow without federal incentives.

“For a long time, the market was totally lopsided with a scarcity of chargers,” Pierce said. “Now, it’s getting a little less scarce, but we’re still nowhere near a saturation point.”

Though early EV adopters tend to charge at home, newer converts are far more likely to charge in the wild, according to EVgo Inc., which operates one of the largest charging networks in the US. Battery-powered cars are particularly popular among rideshare drivers, and the market for used EVs is booming.

“The recent trend of more electric vehicles per fast charger is likely to continue,” EVgo Chief Executive Officer Badar Khan told investors on an August earnings call.

The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see cords as a way to attract customers. From July through September, six charging stations switched on at Cracker Barrel restaurants in the Deep South, for example. The list of openings in the past three months also included 14 at Target Corp. stores; 12 at Wawa Inc. outlets; and four apiece at Ikea and Dunkin’ donut shops.

Pilot Travel Centers LLC, which owns about 800 truck stops and travel centers in the US, has been particularly aggressive. The company now has chargers in slightly more than a quarter of its locations, including 27 stations that switched electron pumps on in the most recent quarter.

Pilot has been adding chargers in places that until recently were electron deserts, namely the Dakotas, the Deep South and Wyoming. “We are committed to showing all of our guests that they matter,” Brandon Trama, the company’s head of vehicle electrification, said via e-mail.

The charger growth is at odds with estimates that EV sales will stall in the coming years without federal subsidies. Last month, Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley posited that the electric share of US car sales may fall from around 10% to around 5% in the fourth quarter.

However, charging executives remain sanguine. Charging infrastructure, they note, is still catching up to EV adoption and sales of new EVs may prove more resilient than expected, particularly as prices drop and more affordable models debut. Indeed, the US still has one of the developed world’s largest imbalances between registered EVs and public chargers.

“There’s just a bunch of things happening out there that are going to bring the selection up and the price down on EVs,” ChargePoint Holdings Inc. CEO Rick Wilmer told investors in September, “which we believe will drive overall demand for EVs and thus, charging going forward in the future.”

While federal dollars may no longer be flowing to EV buyers, the spigot has once again opened for chargers. A January executive order from Trump froze a $5 billion program to stand up charging stations in rural areas and disadvantaged communities. However, in June a federal court ordered the administration to restore funds to 14 states that sued over the suspension.

On Sept. 17, Illinois — one of the states that sued — awarded $18 million to build 25 new charging stations along its interstate corridors.

The renewable energy portfolio includes hydropower, solar power, onshore and offshore wind power, biomass, fuel cells, and battery storage.
EGCO Group has investments in seven countries, including Thailand, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and USA.
EGCO Group is proud to be named a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for each of the past 5 years running.","Electricity Generating Public Company Limited or EGCO Group, reported operating results for both the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2025, supported by strong cash flow and steady financial growth.

The performance was mainly driven by the operation of its hydropower plants in Lao PDR, an infrastructure solutions company CDI Group in Indonesia, and successful investments in the United States. Looking ahead, the company will continue expanding its portfolio of natural gas-fired and renewable power plants both domestically and internationally.

Mr. Tawatchai Sumranwanich, President of EGCO Group, said, “The operating performance in the third quarter and the nine months of this year clearly underscores EGCO Group’s efficiency in managing our assets and investment portfolio, as well as our ability to strengthen our financial position amid numerous challenges in both domestic and international power and energy markets. During this period, EGCO Group has continued to make significant strategic moves, including the completion of a 49% acquisition of the 125 MW Wheatsborough Solar power plant in Ohio, the United States which is the second of two clean energy projects in the Pinnacle II Portfolio acquired by EGCO Group. In addition, EGCO Group has increased its stake in Linden Cogeneration, a 980 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, to 38%. This reinforces EGCO Group’s strategic presence in the U.S. power market.”

In Q3/2025, EGCO Group recognized a total revenue of THB 6,928 million, an operating profit of THB 844 million, and a net loss of THB 656 million. Key contributors of the operating profit were the performance of the two hydropower plants in Lao PDR – Nam Theun 2 and Xayaburi -supported by high water levels during the rainy season. Additional positive contributions came from international power plants, including Linden Cogen and Compass Portfolio in the United States, Paju ES in South Korea, San Buenaventura in the Philippines, as well as the infrastructure solutions company CDI Group in Indonesia.

However, several factors significantly affected Q3/2025 results. These include the scheduled outage maintenance of the Quezon power plant in the Philippines in preparation for its commercial operation date (COD) on 26 October 2025, under the new Power Supply Agreement (PSA). The third quarter’s performance was also impacted by the effects of fair value measurement of financial instruments and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which are accounting-related items that are specific to the period and do not affect the long-term return generating potential.

For the nine-month period of 2025, EGCO Group posted a total revenue of THB 29,126 million, an operating profit of THB 4,348 million, and a net profit of THB 5,078 million. Key contributors to this 9M/2025 performance included the hydropower plants in Lao PDR, the San Buenaventura power plant in the Philippines, the Paju ES power plant in South Korea, and the U.S. power plants. The company also recognized gain from the divestment of its investments in the RISEC power plant in the United States and the Boco Rock Wind Farm in Australia. These divestments align with EGCO Group’s asset recycling strategy, under which assets are sold at an appropriate time and the proceeds reinvested in new projects.

Mr. Tawatchai added, “The outlook of the total operating performance in 2025 will be supported by revenue contributions from international projects in which the company has invested, including the Pinnacle II Portfolio with a combined capacity of 251 MW and the increased ownership interest in the Linden Cogen to 38%. The company also anticipates that its U.S. power assets will benefit from rising electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centers and AI-related industries, alongside generally positive electricity market conditions in the United States.”

In terms of new investments, EGCO Group continues to pursue strategic initiatives, including seeking investment opportunities within its core power business. The company is focusing on natural gas-fired and renewable energy projects that support its Net Zero emissions target. This includes investments through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as greenfield developments in markets where the company already operates and has local partners – particularly in the United States, where EGCO Group has steadily expanded its presence over the past five years.

For domestic investments, the company is awaiting the results of the second round of the RE Big Lot, in which EGCO Group has been shortlisted for 11 projects with a combined installed capacity of 448 MW. The company is also exploring the feasibility of the direct PPA policy, which allows private-sector entities to purchase electricity directly from clean energy producers.

As of 17 November 2025, EGCO Group currently has a total equity capacity of 6,735 MWe in operation and under construction. Total equity capacity from renewable energy is 1,535 MWe (equivalent to 23% of the total portfolio). The renewable energy portfolio includes hydropower, solar power, onshore and offshore wind power, biomass, fuel cells, and battery storage. EGCO Group has investments in seven countries, including Thailand, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and USA.

In addition to its power business, EGCO Group has other energy-related businesses including fuel and utilities infrastructure as well as customer solution and start-up businesses. The associated subsidiaries include EGCO Engineering and Service Co., Ltd. (ESCO) which provides power plant operations, maintenance, and engineering services, the infrastructure and utilities company CDI Group in Indonesia, Thai Pipeline Network Co., Ltd.

This reflects an increase of 17.6% from the previous year’s electric car sales.
Investors looking to benefit from the strong EV sales growth outlook may choose to invest directly in electric car stocks like Tesla TSLA, or in companies such as BYD Company BYDDF, which is known for manufacturing EV batteries.

This reflects an increase of 17.6% from the previous year’s electric car sales.

Against this backdrop, investors interested in making an entry in the electric vehicle (EV) market space may consider keeping a watch on prominent EV-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF DRIV, KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility ETF KARS, State Street SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF HAIL and iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF IDRV.

Why ETFs and Not Individual Stocks?

As demand for passenger and goods transport continues to rise rapidly worldwide, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, EVs play a critical role in the decarbonization of the transport sector. Investors looking to benefit from the strong EV sales growth outlook may choose to invest directly in electric car stocks like Tesla TSLA, or in companies such as BYD Company BYDDF, which is known for manufacturing EV batteries.

However, it is worth mentioning that both Tesla and BYD Company are dealing with crucial challenges at the moment, albeit of different kinds. Tesla has been facing increasing competition from Chinese automakers, who offer a wider range of more affordable EV models. This has put significant pressure on the American EV maker’s sales performance in recent quarters.

Notably, after suffering its first-ever annual delivery decline in 2024, Tesla started 2025 on a rough note, with sales falling by double digits in the first two quarters. While the third quarter offered Tesla a temporary breather as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit, fourth-quarter deliveries are once again expected to decline amid the withdrawal of incentives and intense competition from Chinese EV makers.

Meanwhile, the stock’s high valuation is tied to a great extent to the future success of its innovative technologies like autonomous robotaxis and humanoid robots, rather than the performance of its core EV business.

On the other hand, BYD Company's aggressive pricing strategy and a bruising price war in the Chinese market led it to lose profit margins. Moreover, after a period of explosive growth, its sales momentum has stalled in its home market of China due to increased scrutiny of price discounting and strong competition from other domestic rivals like Xiaomi and Geely.

Considering the aforementioned discussion, it is safe to conclude that investment in an ETF might be a smarter move for an investor eager to profit from the EV market’s tailwind without being exposed to the company-specific financial challenges and competitive pressures that can severely impact individual stocks like Tesla or BYD Company’s performance.

1. Digital transformation of power systems essential, says IRENA

The digital transformation of energy systems is no longer optional but a ""decisive enabler"" of electrification and decarbonization, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The agency’s Digitalisation and AI for Power System Transformation report, which it developed together with the G7 Presidency, says that the COP28 goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 can be ""catalyzed by digitalization"".

With many countries recognizing digitalization as a strategic priority in energy planning, the report highlights a window of opportunity for the G7 to ""set the direction for power system transformation"" and unlock benefits for consumers and businesses while boosting energy security and affordability.

IRENA identifies five key areas in which digital technologies can transform power systems: monitoring through smart sensors and metres; AI-enhanced forecasting for demand and renewable generation; operational optimization to reduce losses and congestion; end-use automation for demand response; and transparency through digital platforms and energy certificates.

The chart below, based on a BNEF analysis featured in the IRENA report, shows where digitalization in the power sector is currently focused.

2. World Energy Outlook 2025: IEA report

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its annual World Energy Outlook report, which explores the future of energy security, access and emissions.

Here are some of its key findings:

Energy security concerns are on the rise due to geopolitical tensions, supply risks (especially critical minerals) and the vulnerability of electricity systems to cyber and weather threats.

Global energy demand keeps rising, led by emerging economies like India and those in Southeast Asia, while energy use in richer countries levels off.

The world is witnessing record growth in both fossil fuel and renewable energy use, but renewables — especially solar and wind— continue to be the fastest-growing sources.

The availability and supply chain for critical minerals is now a real concern. The report highlights the need for more resilient and diverse supply chains.

Grid investments are lagging behind power generation, creating risks of congestion and outages.

3. News in brief: More energy stories from around the world

The United States is looking to advance its energy ties with Greece, the US ambassador to the country has said. The US believes the country could become a key energy gateway to Europe, Kimberly Guilfoyle said. Greece has increased purchases of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and built a second LNG terminal in a bid to become a major route for US-imported gas into Europe.

Australia is planning to require energy companies to offer three hours of free electricity to households during the day in a bid to use excess solar capacity and ease demand on the grid. Solar supply is strongest during the day in the country, where more than 4 million households have rooftop solar panels that generate more electricity than their residual coal-fired power stations.

A report from Schneider Electric says that energy companies in the Middle East are setting the pace for autonomous operations, with almost 80% of leaders reporting advanced operational readiness. Compared to the global energy sector, which typically operates at lower levels of autonomous operations – characterized by connected systems and visible data but still reliant on manual decision-making – many Middle East organizations claim to be operating with selective autonomy, where systems function independently in specific scenarios with limited human intervention.

Planned rules in India to require renewable energy producers to strictly adhere to their promised power delivery could hit company earnings and slow clean energy investment, according to industry letters reviewed by Reuters. Some wind projects could lose up to 48% of their revenue, it warned.

French state-owned power utility EDF is looking to finalize the conceptual design of a small modular reactor by 2026. The company is aiming to have up to 30 of the reactors in operation by 2050, it has said.

But systems that have not yet detected PFAS or have more recently detected PFAS (“Phase 2” systems) must initiate the claim process by 2026. Specifically, all Phase 2 water systems must file a claim no later than January 1, 2026, to be compensated for their PFAS baseline testing of their water sources, under both the 3M and Dupont settlements. To file a claim for treatment and costs against the Dupont fund, Phase 2 water systems must file by June 30, 2026. To file such a claim against the 3M fund, these systems must file by July 31, 2026. Phase 2 systems can file a single claim form against both the Dupont and 3M funds for treatment of PFAS in their systems.

Utility officials should be aware that there are some firms trying to sign up clients that are not well informed about the settlements; utilities should check the settlement website and ensure that whatever firm they hire to help is knowledgeable about the settlement’s details.

PFAS are a class of more than 14,000 man-made chemicals and are linked to a wide range of health risks, including cancer (kidney and testicular), liver and thyroid problems, immune system suppression, and abnormal fetal development. The vast majority of water systems in U.S. states have been contaminated with PFAS. The contamination comes from several sources, like the industrial or government dumping of PFAS-laden wastewater directly into rivers, lakes, and streams (which is still often legal) or the seeping of PFAS into groundwater from industrial, military, and commercial facilities, airports, or landfills. And this pollution is often even more intense in already overburdened environmental justice communities, according to the NRDC report Dirty Water.

The EPA has known for decades that PFAS endanger human health. After extensive advocacy from environmental and public health advocates, in 2024, the EPA decided to regulate six toxic PFAS chemicals commonly found in drinking water for the first time. Unfortunately, organizations representing the chemical industry and water utilities, like the American Water Works Association, filed lawsuits challenging these new PFAS limits in drinking water.

Subsequently, the Trump administration’s EPA announced that it will abandon its previous defense of its determinations to regulate four of the six PFAS chemicals, along with the tap water limits on those four PFAS chemicals. The agency also said that it would extend the deadline for compliance with the remaining two PFAS tap water standards by two years, until 2031. NRDC, Earthjustice, and impacted community partners have intervened in that case to preserve these valuable health protections.

PFAS contamination is dangerous to our health and our communities. Drinking water is a major source of PFAS exposure, especially in highly impacted communities.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/dupont-chemical-plant-pickaway-county-ohio.jpg?h=e6e78363&itok=MIqTjQPf,N,,2025-11-17 11:08:30.350218

AURORA, Ill., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- West Aurora School District 129 (SD129) today introduced 27 all-electric Blue Bird school buses, now the largest electric school bus fleet operating in the Chicago region. The fleet will reduce emissions in the community, lower operating costs, and provide a quieter, more comfortable experience for students and drivers alike. The initiative reflects West Aurora's ongoing leadership in improving operational efficiency and environmental performance across its schools, including investments in solar energy, building upgrades, and waste reduction efforts.

The district partnered with Highland Electric Fleets, North America's leading provider of Electrification-as-a-Service (EaaS), to support the transition. Highland managed vehicle procurement, charger installation, and long-term fleet services to ensure reliable daily operations. The fleet is powered by 14 Zerova 60kW chargers, providing flexible charging capacity to meet route demands and support future fleet growth.

Funding for the initiative includes nearly $5 million from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program and additional incentives from ComEd, which provided $450,000 in vehicle rebates and approximately $480,000 in make-ready support to prepare charging infrastructure.

""West Aurora is proud to strengthen our commitment to our schools and community by adding electric buses to our sustainability efforts,"" said Dr. Angie Smith, SD129 Associate Superintendent of Operations. ""We continue to work to find ways to provide a healthier environment for our students and families, while also achieving savings for our taxpayers. We hope to be able to demonstrate to other districts that electrification of even a portion of your fleet can make a difference that we can all benefit from.""

Project partners include Central States Bus Sales, which supplied the Blue Bird buses; ComEd, the district's utility partner, in addition to providing financial support; and Grand Kahn Electric, which led installation of the charging equipment.

""ComEd is proud to fund electrification projects like West Aurora School District 129's and hundreds of others across the region as our customers and communities take steps toward a lower carbon future,"" said Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd. ""EV rebates are helping reduce the upfront costs while also bringing us closer to achieving the state's energy and climate goals.""

""West Aurora's leadership is evident across everything they do, from energy efficiency to waste reduction and now transportation,"" said Joshua Williams, Senior Midwestern Regional Manager at Highland Electric Fleets. ""They're showing what it looks like when a district turns long-term commitments into measurable progress for students and the community.""

A ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the launch will take place at 10:30 am on 11/17/25 at 220 Alder Dr., North Aurora, IL 60542. Media and community members are invited to attend.

Why does DIA think it needs to look beyond Xcel Energy?
As for the buffet, it was part of DIA's outreach after an abortive effort last summer to solicit bids about potential nuclear energy at the airport.
Last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency reported that $15 billion in public and private financing has been invested in the technology.
""And, of course, we're working with Xcel Energy to install some other things as well,"" he said.","Denver International Airport, which proclaims itself the largest economic hub west of the Mississippi River, has begun investigating whether it can generate its own electricity to meet accelerating needs in the next 20 years.

In doing so, it would lessen or conceivably end dependence on Xcel Energy, its current supplier.

In January, the airport plans to formally post a request for information. It hopes to get proposals for everything from nuclear to geothermal to solar to -- well, that is the purpose of this request. The airport, which is owned by the City of Denver, wants to gather ideas, including new ones.

The airport now uses 45 megawatts of electricity, but it sees potential need for 300 to 400 megawatts of electrical generation.

This projected need for 300 to 400 megawatts compares with the peak demand of 295 megawatts of Holy Cross Energy, which provides electricity for the Vail and Aspen areas. Platte River Power Authority has peak demand of 707 megawatts from its four member municipalities along the northern Front Range. Those four cities have a combined population of about 360,000 people.

Projected passenger numbers provide one measure of expanded needs. The airport was designed for 50 million annual passengers but in 2024 accommodated 82.3 million. It expects 120 million passengers by 2045, when the airport will celebrate a half-century of operations.

Other components of air traffic -- most immediately air taxis that use the airport -- will want more electricity, likely in the next decade. Air cargo will also expand.

At a community meeting on Nov. 5, Phil Washington, the chief executive, also said that DIA is working with a financial firm to help determine how sites within the airport complex can be developed with ""horizontal infrastructure,"" meaning water and sewer, fiber and other necessities. That includes electricity.

DIA is currently focused on developing 1,500 acres, primarily along Peña Boulevard. This is among 16,000-plus acres of non-aviation land available for compatible commercial development. Data centers have also been mentioned as a possibility.

Vehicle electrification is part of broad market trend, but this also fits in with Denver's aspirations: it aims to be carbon-neutral in energy by 2040. DIA aims to be the greenest airport in the world.

Denver's green ambitions would seem to rule out new natural gas plants, as were deployed by the Pittsburg airport in 2021 in an effort to create greater self-sufficiency. In theory, carbon capture and sequestration could be used with natural gas generation. In practice, the economics remain daunting.

Why does DIA think it needs to look beyond Xcel Energy? Phil Washington, the chief executive, explained the reasoning somewhat obliquely at a community outreach meeting on Nov. 5.

""We're thinking about energy capacity because we feel like ... we are concerned that we are building at a rate where supply will be an issue.""

This, Washington took pains to say, is ""no knock on any specific or particular energy provider; we love them all -- but we love the one that we know best."" The one that it would know best is presumably the one it controls.

Later, after several more assertions about supply worries, the Q&A part of the meeting arrived. I asked what seemed to me to be an elephant-sized question in the room:

""What is the evidence that your current provider will be unable to provide the power you need?"" I asked.

""I don't have any evidence,"" Washington replied. ""We have been working with Xcel Energy. So I don't have any evidence. We're doing this because we want to be sure that we have power. That's the only answer I can give.""

The meeting, the third in the outreach series, was held at the Westin hotel adjacent to the airport terminal. A buffet was part of the evening. The hotel's green chili was excellent, but I also decided a sandwich was in order. I wasn't wearing glasses. What I thought was going to be a ""roast beef sandwich"" turned out to be, once I had sat down at my seat, a ""red beet sandwich.""

That was a first for me.

As for the buffet, it was part of DIA's outreach after an abortive effort last summer to solicit bids about potential nuclear energy at the airport.

DIA announced in August that it planned to spend $1.25 million for a study that would examine the potential to build a small modular reactor somewhere on the airport's property. It has 53 square miles, the second most of any airport in the world.

""Denver leads with bold ideas, and our vision for the future of our airport is no exception,"" said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston in the news release posted on Aug. 6.

""SMRs are gaining traction as a clean energy source for their potential to offer a safe, more scalable and potentially cost-effective approach to generating nuclear power,"" the announcement added. It went on to explain that nuclear could provide 24/7 baseload generation to complement renewable energy.

This announcement produced pushback from a Denver City Council member, and two weeks later the airport quietly shelved the proposed study.

The technology has momentum. Last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency reported that $15 billion in public and private financing has been invested in the technology. Around the world, 74 designs are being pursued. Renewables have very strong legs, but something more -- storage technologies or firm baseload -- is needed.

In July, Canary Media explained the attraction to this technology: ""With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs.""

But, after 50 years of development, the world currently has only two SMRs, one in China and the other in Russia. The Chinese, however, may be bending the cost curve.

Bryan Hannegan, the chief executive of Holy Cross Energy, told a forum on Tuesday evening that he's open to nuclear.

""We've been running small modular reactors in our Navy all around the world for decades with nary a mishap, at least one that we know of,"" he told the Empower Hour, a monthly session sponsored by the Boulder-based Empower Our Future.

""There's every reason to think that it should be something that's possible. And yet, every time we try to build a new nuclear reactor, whether it's a large one like Vogel, or a small one like the one that was planned at the Idaho National Lab, the costs get out of control, the timeline slips.""

Hannegan said that costs rise and then utilities escape. That is what happened at NuScale's small modular reactor project at Idaho National Laboratory in 2023. NuScale raised the target price for power from the SMR to $89 per megawatt-hour from $58. The Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems then pulled out.

""This is one where I'm not really willing to stick my neck out and be the first adopter. That being said, there's perhaps a spot in the portfolio at some point if the community wants it, and that's a big if.""

In putting out the RFP for small modular reactors, DIA last summer got out in front of its skis. Now it is doing what it should have done last summer, asking for many ideas about many technologies, not just one.

""We're asking the private sector to think out of the box,"" said Washington at the DIA forum. ""We're not limiting them. So this will include small modular reactors, or nuclear. This will include hydrogen, geothermal, wind -- all of those things we're asking, ""Give us proposed solutions'.""

Unmentioned was the fact that the City of Denver is currently renegotiating its franchise agreement with Xcel Energy. It's not clear whether that fact plays into this request.

What this amounts to, though, is the prospective creation of something resembling a new utility. Washington acknowledged that the airport might be able to sell the electricity to others.

""If we are energy independent as an airport, if we are our own power company, we can then sell excess power to development to create a new revenue stream,"" said Washington. ""That is not the sole reason we're doing all of this, but that is a residual benefit if we are power independent.""

""Considering the complex energy demands of airports and the surging adoption of electric vehicle technology, the need for airports to decrease reliance on the aging US power grid is significant,"" said two researchers in a January 2025 article called ""Airport Electrification"" that was published in the Journal of Aviation Technology and Engineering.

Energy resilience has emerged as a major concern at airports. This concern is triggered, at least in part, by extended electrical outages. Delta estimated that an 11-hour outage caused by an electrical fire at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport in 2017 cost up to $50 million. Schedules of 30,000 travelers were disrupted.

The Government Accountability Office in 2023 identified 321 outages that lasted at least five minutes at two-dozen U.S. airports from 2015 to 2022.

As the New York Times noted in March, DIA has two dedicated substations, each of which can power the whole facility, providing redundancy in an emergency. It also has two backup generators.

Resilience -- making sure the lights are on -- has been a major driver, but as the CEO of the Pittsburg airport told a New York Times reporter in early 2025, that airport's investment in natural gas and solar had saved the airport $1 million annually.

""The traditional energy infrastructure airport operators have relied on for the past half-century may not be able to keep pace with ballooning power requirements,"" said Juan Macias, the CEO of AlphaStruxure, in a February 2024 posting at Cipher. ""For many airports, it's time to think outside the grid.""

What DIA plans could be called a microgrid. Many hospitals and university campuses have them. They are electrical networks that can operate within the context of the larger electrical grid but with enough generating capacity to operate when outside electrical supplies are unavailable.

DIA already self-generates electricity. The 11 solar arrays at the airport can together produce 50 megawatts of electricity. It also has the largest energy performance contract in Colorado, said Washington. And it is also taking measures to save water. ""And, of course, we're working with Xcel Energy to install some other things as well,"" he said.

""We're concerned that the supply of power and energy may not be available at the pace that we're building now,"" said Washington.

Respondents to DIA's request for information will be asked to consider physical requirements of the generating capacity, the site requirements, the impacts, the operations, and the security. This RFI is to be posted by January, with a deadline of April, then an unspecified number of months for evaluation and then more community input.

""We will then determine what is the best path forward for the alternative energy options for this airport,"" said Washington. ""We're not limited to any energy source.""

Washington has a way of speaking that is at once folksy and forceful. At the meeting, he commented on food compared to the burritos served at a previous community outreach meeting.

""They were okay, but they were like, gut busters,"" he said. ""This is the good stuff.""

It's not hard to imagine him being in the military, and he was. Growing up on the South Side of Chicago, he was expelled from high school. That prompted him to join the U.S. Army, and there he did well at Camp Carson, near Colorado Springs.

In 2000, Washington joined metropolitan Denver's RTD as assistant manager, becoming general manager in 2009. RTD then was building the FasTracks expansion of commuter rail. In 2015, Washington left to manage the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority for six years before returning to Denver in 2021 to run DIA.

DIA certainly has a powerful economic wake. The airport credits itself as spawning $47 billion annually in economic activity. ""We're the largest economic hub west of the Mississippi right now,"" said Washington.

Traffic at DIA is down, but Washington assured his listeners that it is temporary. ""I haven't seen too many Canadians come down lately, but they will be back. The numbers will rebound.""

That will include more international flights. DIA has added flights to Dublin, Rome, and Istanbul in the last few years, and Washington reported being ""very close to a flight"" to Africa.

In what Washington called the ""near term,"" DIA expects to have 50 new gates located within what he called ""walkable complexes"" as it looks toward accommodating 120 million passengers annually. ""And all this will take power and electricity.""

Outside the terminal itself, DIA plans a consolidated rent-a-car facility with a capacity for between 15,000 and 17,000 spaces. Current capacity is 12,760. The complex will have more cars but also EV chargers and other new electrical needs that collectively will require 40 megawatts. Again, the comparison is to DIA's existing overall use of 45 megawatts.

New transportation connecting the terminal with this facility will require electricity. The airport currently has 250,000 annual trips of buses shuttling passengers between rental cars and the terminal.

Changes to the often-congested Pena Boulevard are planned. A north entrance to DIA remains a possibility. Work is underway for a new $500 million baggage-handling system.

Currently 40,000 people work at DIA. In the expansions now planned, said Washington, the airport will have around 60,000 employees.

But again, why is DIA now thinking it needs to provide self-generation? In the Q&A, Washington got a question that mentioned Coca-Cola.

A 570,000-square foot aluminum and plastic bottling plant near DIA had been planned since at least 2023. The company announced in August that it was going elsewhere in Colorado. In part, it said, it was doing so because Xcel Energy had failed to supply electricity to the site, according to City of Denver documents and a city council member cited by The Denver Post.

""Xcel Energy and Denver International Airport could not figure out a time-efficient manner to get Coca-Cola power to build out there, and then they all started pointing fingers at each other,"" Stacie Gilmore, the council member, told the newspaper. Xcel pointed to lack of commitment by the bottling company.

Others have complained about the slowness of Xcel to deliver electricity. In February, the Post reported that real estate developer Brightland Homes sued Xcel, claiming that service and installation delays of Xcel in metropolitan Denver had caused the builder lost sales.

“People have this techno-utopian view of AI that it will save us from the climate crisis,” said Jean Su, a climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We know what will save us from the climate crisis – phasing out fossil fuels.
“Overall we are very, very far from a situation where AI for good balances out the negative environmental impact of AI.
“The environmental cost of AI is already alarming and I don’t see data center growth winding down any time soon.","Artificial intelligence is often associated with ludicrous amounts of electricity, and therefore planet-heating emissions, expended to create nonsensical or misleading slop that is of meagre value to humanity.

Some AI advocates at a major UN climate summit are posing an alternative view, though – what if AI could help us solve, rather than worsen, the climate crisis?

The “AI for good” argument has been made repeatedly at the Cop30 talks in Belém, Brazil, with supporters arguing AI can be used to lower, rather than raise, emissions through a series of efficiencies that can spread through areas of our lives such as food, transport and energy that cause much of the pollution dangerously heating our planet.

Last week, a coalition of groups, UN bodies and the Brazilian government unveiled the AI Climate Institute, a new global initiative aimed at fostering AI “as a tool of empowerment” in developing countries to help them tackle environmental problems.

Proponents say the program, in time, will help educate countries on how to use AI in an array of ways to bring down emissions, such as better optimizing public transit, organizing agricultural systems and recalibrating the energy grid so that renewables are deployed at the right times.

Even weather forecasting, including the mapping of impending climate-driven disasters such as flooding and wildfires, can be improved in this way, according to Maria João Sousa, executive director, Climate Change AI, one of the groups behind the new initiative.

“Very few places in the world actually run numerical weather prediction models because numerical weather prediction models are very compute-intensive,” she said. “I definitely believe (AI) is a positive force to accelerate a lot of these things.”

AI can help monitor emissions, biodiversity and generally see what is going on, said Lorenzo Saa, chief sustainability officer at Clarity AI, who is also attending Cop30.

“You can really start looking at where the problem is,” he said. “Then you can predict, and the prediction is actually short-term and long-term. You can now predict floods in the next week, but you can actually figure out sea level rise and things like that.”

Saa admitted there are legitimate concerns about the governance of AI and its impact upon society but, on balance, the effect on the environment could be positive. In June, a report by the London School of Economics had an unexpectedly sunny estimate – AI could reduce global greenhouse gases by 3.2bn to 5.4bn tonnes in the next decade, even factoring in its vast energy consumption.

“People already make dumb decisions about energy, such as running air conditioning for too long,” Saa said. “How much of our phone has bad stuff for us? I think a lot. How many hours do we spend on Instagram?

“My view of this is that society is going to go in this direction. We need to think about how we are not destroying the planet with heating and we’re actually trying to make sure that there’s a net benefit.”

Some other experts and environmental advocates are not convinced. The huge computational power of AI, particularly generative AI, is fueling a boom in data centers in countries such as the US that is gobbling up a huge amount of electricity and water, even in places prone to droughts, pushing up electricity bills in some places as a result.

The climate cost of this AI gold rush, driven by companies such as Google, Meta and OpenAI, is large and set to get larger – a recent Cornell University study found that by 2030, the current rate of AI growth in the US will add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the equivalent of adding 10m gasoline cars to the road or the entire annual emissions of Norway.

“People have this techno-utopian view of AI that it will save us from the climate crisis,” said Jean Su, a climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We know what will save us from the climate crisis – phasing out fossil fuels. It’s not AI.”

Also, while AI can be used to drive efficiencies to lower emissions, the same sort of tools can be used to optimize other areas – including fossil fuel production. A report last month by Wood Mackenzie estimated that AI could help unlock an extra trillion barrels of oil – a scenario which, if the energy markets were to be amenable to such a thing, would obliterate any hopes of restraining catastrophic climate breakdown.

Natascha Hospedales, lead lawyer for AI at Client Earth, said there is some merit to the “AI for good” argument, but that it is a “really small niche” within a much larger industry that is much more focused on maximizing profits.

“There is some truth that AI could help the developing world, but much of this is in the early stage and some of it is hypothetical – it’s just not there yet,” she said. “Overall we are very, very far from a situation where AI for good balances out the negative environmental impact of AI.

“The environmental cost of AI is already alarming and I don’t see data center growth winding down any time soon. A small percentage of AI is used for good and 99% of it is companies like Google and Meta lining their pockets with money, damaging the environment and human rights as they do it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd20b2ca286178d3ada81c6fa78de0d77a069fe/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02798ea6f7ae381d18ffa027d39426ea",N,,2025-11-17 13:02:35.904057

SOURCE Verra Mobility","Poll found more than 75% of Americans are in favor of road usage charging – having a positive or neutral view of the concept

MESA, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the results of a new survey of 2,000 Americans who regularly use toll roads.

The survey examined Americans' perceptions of the various programs that fund roads and infrastructure.

The survey results can be downloaded by visiting www.verramobility.com/survey-ruc-road-usage-charging-toll-roads.

One of the main sources of funds to improve roads and bridges in the U.S. since 1932 has been the federal gas tax, which currently adds 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. Since the rise in electric vehicle (EV) sales, the gas tax revenue has been slowly declining. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Petroleum Association reported an estimated drop in state gas tax revenue of $250 million when comparing 2024 to 2019.

The survey found:

Americans believe that roads are in need of improvements, with 93% of survey respondents stating that the infrastructure in their state needs to be improved.

When asked what they believed was the best way to recoup these funds, 73% of Americans answered that EV owners should have to pay an 'energy tax'.

""The U.S. is experiencing a fundamental shift in how we fund infrastructure improvements and expansions,"" said Stacey Moser, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Verra Mobility's Commercial Services business. ""Toll roads, and more recently, initiatives like New York City's congestion pricing program, have demonstrated that user-based funding models can be highly effective. These models generate reliable revenue but also offer drivers faster, safer and more reliable travel.""

One alternative is toll roads, which are currently utilized in many U.S. states. The U.S. tolling market was valued at approximately $12.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $18.6 billion by 2030.

The study asked several questions on Americans' perceptions of toll roads, finding that:

67% of respondents said they believed toll roads were fairer than taxes

76% believed paying tolls is acceptable if the revenue is being used to improve the quality and safety of roads and bridges

72% believe everyone should pay the same for toll roads

75% believe that tolls should be the same regardless of time of day

65% said they would be more willing to pay tolls if they knew revenue was dedicated to infrastructure projects that directly benefited them

67% believe tolls should go away once a project is paid for

When asked directly if they were generally in favor of toll roads as a way to fund transportation projects, 51% were in favor, 30% were neutral and 20% were against. These numbers were slightly more favorable than when asked about other road use pricing models:

41% were in favor of road usage charging, with 33% being neutral and 25% against

41% were in favor of congestion pricing, with 31% being neutral and 28% against

""This evolution will have a significant impact on drivers and, even more so, on fleet operators, who must navigate a complex network of tolling authorities and payment schemes while staying compliant,"" continued Moser. ""As one of the largest payers of tolls in the country, Verra Mobility has a unique perspective on how these programs are rolled out and scaled. With many new funding models now emerging to address the decline in traditional gas tax revenues, we wanted to better understand how Americans view these changes, and this survey provides important insight into public sentiment.""

For more than 15 years, Verra Mobility has helped fleet owners and operators manage toll payments quickly and easily. Each year, the company processes over 300 million tolls and violations for more than seven million vehicles worldwide. By automatically paying tolls and preventing costly fines, Verra Mobility helps drivers stay on the move while saving businesses time and money. Its technology connects each toll to the right vehicle and driver, ensuring accurate, reliable billing and seamless travel across a growing network of toll roads.

Survey Methodology

The data was derived from a survey by Verra Mobility conducted online via Pollfish on June 25, 2025.

And now, it’s pulling down its climate claims,” said Eberly.
EWG’s complaint alleged it is currently impossible for Tyson to cut enteric emissions without eliminating the cattle themselves, making the “net-zero” or “climate-smart” claims misleading.","WASHINGTON – The Environmental Working Group has reached a settlement in its lawsuit alleging that Tyson Foods’ promises to reach “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and sell “climate-smart” beef were not backed by sufficient actions to make those goals credible.

Under the settlement, Tyson will refrain from making these environmental claims for five years and cannot introduce new related claims unless they are supported by expert analysis and verified facts. The settlement was filed today in D.C. Superior Court.

It follows a separate settlement reached on November 10 between the New York attorney general’s office and JBS USA, the giant meat producer, which also agreed to stop making unsubstantiated claims about reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

JBS and Tyson together produce about 50% of the beef consumed in the United States. The settlements represent a positive step in efforts to protect consumers from false and misleading statements made by major beef corporations.

EWG is represented by Animal Legal Defense Fund(link is external), or ALDF, Earthjustice(link is external), Edelson PC(link is external) and FarmSTAND(link is external) in the suit filed under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act. Filed in September 2024, the suit accused Tyson of making “false or misleading” marketing claims targeting D.C. consumers concerned about climate change.

“This settlement reinforces the principle that consumers deserve honesty and accountability from the corporations shaping our food system,” said Caroline Leary, general counsel and chief operating officer at EWG. “The outcome makes clear that corporate climate pledges must be transparent, verifiable and rooted in real change.”

Significant victory

“This settlement is a significant milestone for advocates and consumers who demand honesty in climate-related marketing,” said Amanda Howell, Managing Attorney at ALDF.

“Tyson Foods, the second largest meat company in the world, has agreed to stop making climate and emissions claims unless those claims are substantiated by a third-party expert using credible science and an actual, achievable plan,” she added.

“ALDF will continue working to ensure that consumers who care about the climate crisis, sustainability, and the harmful environmental impacts of animal agriculture have access to truthful and non-misleading information,” said Howell.

“This settlement should be a clear signal to consumers to be cautious of major beef producers’ marketing their products as ‘climate-smart,’” said Carrie Apfel, Deputy Managing Attorney of Earthjustice’s Sustainable Food and Farming program.

“Industrial beef production emits vast amounts of greenhouse gases from every stage of the operation. Achieving meaningful emission reductions at this industrial scale would require corporations to make transparent, transformative changes — which we allege Tyson hasn’t shown,” said Apfel.

“Today’s resolution marks a crucial turning point in the fight against climate greenwashing,” said Kelsey Eberly, Senior Staff Attorney at FarmSTAND.

“Tyson Foods is the second-largest meat and poultry producer in the world, controls a fifth of the country’s beef, pork, and chicken — and has been estimated to produce nearly as much methane pollution as major oil companies. And now, it’s pulling down its climate claims,” said Eberly.

“With climate-forward policies weathering existential attacks, legal actions like this are increasingly critical to raise consumer awareness about the outsized impact conglomerates like Tyson have on our climate,” added Eberly.

Beef production’s climate impacts

Industrialized meat production generates tremendous volumes of climate-warming emissions at every stage of the process, from deforestation and overgrazing to feed production, and from cattle enteric and manure emissions to slaughter and distribution.

Tyson’s greenhouse gas emissions alone exceed those of Austria or Greece(link is external). Its beef production is responsible for 85% of the company’s emissions.

In 2022, enteric fermentation from beef cattle – their natural digestion process – accounted for about 18% of total U.S. methane emissions. Methane acts as a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential more than 80 times that of carbon dioxide over 20 years.

Manure management also contributes to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions(link is external). And through the use of fertilizers, feed production for beef cattle releases additional nitrous oxide, which has a global warming potential nearly 300 times that of carbon dioxide.

Deforestation and degradation of land for beef cattle production globally release carbon dioxide and also incur a carbon opportunity cost by precluding additional sequestration that would occur under alternative land use scenarios.

EWG’s lawsuit allegations

In its complaint, EWG alleged that studies show methane and nitrous oxide emitted by Tyson’s intensive beef production cannot be eliminated with existing or anticipated technology. EWG’s complaint alleged it is currently impossible for Tyson to cut enteric emissions without eliminating the cattle themselves, making the “net-zero” or “climate-smart” claims misleading.

Industrially produced meat contributes significantly to climate emissions, and beef such as Tyson’s contributes far greater emissions(link is external) than all other major food products.

Consumers increasingly seek products that are better for the planet. EWG’s complaint noted Tyson’s recognition that “a growing number of consumers are willing to pay a premium to eat beef and other foods with lower GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions,” that “[c]onsumers would be willing to pay at least 24% more for environmentally friendly sustainable options in retail,” and that “[i]ncreasing concern over climate change also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences.”

In an intentional effort to capitalize on consumer preferences for sustainable options, Tyson repeatedly told consumers on its website and in news releases over nearly four and a half years that it was committing to achieving “net-zero” emissions by 2050, and that it “sells climate-smart beef.”

As the lawsuit alleged, despite the enormous scale of Tyson’s industrial production and its GHG emissions, the company has taken little action toward achieving these commitments. It has fallen far short of offering anything close to substantiation for these claims, the suit alleged.

Rather, the complaint maintained, Tyson has spent less than 0.1% of its revenue on efforts to reduce its climate impact, mostly on research – $50 million dollars out of a total annual revenue of roughly $53 billion. Tyson spends about three times as much on advertising(link is external) as it does on research.

Ministers say the move will unlock the materials, data and manufacturing muscle needed to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030.

Australia, Canada, Kenya, the Netherlands, the UK and Zambia have joined the Global Clean Power Alliance Supply Chains Mission.

The initiative is backed by the European Commission and the COP30 Presidency and is designed to tear down the barriers that are slowing the energy transition across both rich and poorer nations.

Downing Street says the mission is the next stage of the UK’s strategy to lead global clean power deployment.

The Prime Minister launched the Global Clean Power Alliance at the G20 Summit in 2024 and confirmed the supply chains expansion at the IEA Future of Energy Security Summit in April 2025.

The mission has one clear aim. Build resilient clean power supply chains fast enough to match the pace of the transition.

Leaders warn that without coordinated supply chains the world will not meet the Global Stocktake pledge to triple renewables by 2030. They say the transition is “the transformational opportunity of our time” and that stable supply chains are now central to global energy security.

The mission is built around four pillars. Each one targets a weakness slowing the rollout of clean power.

The first tackles data.

Governments say the lack of transparency is crippling effective policymaking and holding back investment so the mission will work with the IEA to create reliable global supply chain data.

The second targets grid equipment.

Bottlenecks in transformers, switchgear and key components are stretching project timelines so countries will harmonise standards, attract investment and expand manufacturing to cut delays.

The third pillar pushes circularity.

The mission says recycling markets are blocked by clashing regulations and no global standards so partners will unlock cross-border flows of recycled materials and reduce pressure on primary minerals.

The fourth pillar focuses on emerging markets.

Leaders say too many resource-rich nations are shut out of clean power value chains so the mission will help derisk finance, expand skills and secure better economic participation.

The UK says the mission is grounded in partnership between the Global North and Global South. Governments and industry will work together to design practical solutions that share the economic benefits of the transition.

International bodies will be plugged in from day one. The mission will work with the IEA, UNEZA, IRENA and the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions as technical partners.

,American Energy,2025-11-17 14:15:15+00:00,EurekAlert!,Nearly 47 million Americans are at high risk of potential health hazards from fossil fuel infrastructure,Not Available,,,,,https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106021,"These mid-supply chain steps occur in a sprawling fossil fuel infrastructure network that spans the United States and is often hidden from plain sight.
Storage facilities—like peak shaving facilities, underground gas storage facilities, and petroleum product terminals—have more than 6 million nearby residents.
Almost 90% of the population near end-use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure is found in urban areas.
This indicates that while there are more pieces of extraction infrastructure across the country, they are generally located in less populated spots.
By identifying communities already hosting significant amounts of fossil fuel infrastructure, the researchers say their work can help guide more equitable siting of energy infrastructure in the future.","Fossil fuels release pollutants into the air when extracted and burned, but there’s more to their production than massive oil rigs diving deep into the Earth and smoky power plants. Those processes are examples of only the first and last—and generally most visible—moments in a fossil fuel’s five-stage journey.

Between the initial extraction site and the final power-generating facility, oil and gas are also refined to remove impurities, held in storage facilities, and transported from place to place. These mid-supply chain steps occur in a sprawling fossil fuel infrastructure network that spans the United States and is often hidden from plain sight.

A new study by Boston University researchers offers a first-time look at populations living within 1.6 km (roughly a mile) of fossil fuel infrastructure across all stages of the supply chain. Published in Environmental Research Letters, the study estimates that 46.6 million people in the contiguous US live within about a mile of at least one piece of fossil fuel infrastructure. This represents 14.1% of the population.

While a growing body of research confirms that communities residing near extraction and end-use facilities face a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes and asthma—and research on other health outcomes, including leukemia, is emerging—much less is known about the health effects of living near mid-supply chain infrastructure. Harmful pollutants such as volatile organic compounds have been detected near some of these facilities.

“This study helps us get a general size of the potential problem, and really starts the process of doing a better job of understanding exactly what the hazards are and how many people are potentially exposed,” said Jonathan Buonocore, the paper’s first author, an assistant professor of environmental health at BU’s School of Public Health (SPH), and core faculty at BU's Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS). “Especially for these more obscure pieces of energy infrastructure, this is the first step to tracking what emissions and stressors those are imposing on the communities.”

Breaking down that 46.6 million figure, the team estimated how many people live near each type of infrastructure nationwide. Almost 21 million Americans live near end-use facilities, including power plants. More than 20 million are within a mile of extraction sites, like oil and gas wells. Storage facilities—like peak shaving facilities, underground gas storage facilities, and petroleum product terminals—have more than 6 million nearby residents. Fewer people live near refining and transportation. Many Americans, about 9 million, are counted toward several of those totals, as their homes are in proximity to multiple types of infrastructure.

“There is reason to believe that there could be air pollution coming from each of these stages, from consistent pollution, gas leaks, or blowouts, when gas or oil flows from a well uncontrollably,” said Mary Willis, the study’s senior author, an assistant professor of epidemiology at SPH, and core faculty at IGS. “All of these stages can reasonably impact a range of population health outcomes, yet the basic information of who is even near the infrastructure components has not been examined to date.”

Identifying Inequities in Fossil Fuel Exposure

According to the study, infrastructure is not distributed evenly across the nation. Predominantly non-white groups are disproportionately exposed across all stages of the energy supply chain, a finding that aligns with previous research and indicates an environmental injustice.

Urbanites are also more exposed than their rural counterparts. Almost 90% of the population near end-use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure is found in urban areas.

Examining each infrastructure type helped the researchers reveal important trends that could guide policymaking. For instance, they found that a single piece of storage infrastructure has, on average, 2,900 residents within a mile, while a single piece of extraction infrastructure has an average of only 17 nearby inhabitants. This indicates that while there are more pieces of extraction infrastructure across the country, they are generally located in less populated spots. Pieces of storage infrastructure are less plentiful, but more likely to be found in dense urban areas.

“That means that if a local policymaker in an urban area were to take interest in reducing exposures, they may receive the most impact per piece of infrastructure if they focus on storage,” Buonocore said.

By identifying communities already hosting significant amounts of fossil fuel infrastructure, the researchers say their work can help guide more equitable siting of energy infrastructure in the future.

New Results Made Possible by First-of-its-Kind Database

The publication marks the first study based on the Energy Infrastructure Exposure Intensity and Equity Indices (EI3) Database for Public Health, launched by Buonocore and Willis in spring 2024 at the Power & People Symposium. Additional co-authors on this article include Fintan Mooney, Erin Campbell, Brian Sousa, Breanna van Loenen, Patricia Fabian, and Amruta Nori-Sarma.

Until EI3’s launch, data on fossil fuel energy infrastructure was scattered across local, state, and national agencies and jurisdictions, sometimes behind paywalls or password protection. With an IGS Sustainability Research Grant jointly funded by IGS and SPH, the team centralized all publicly available information for the first time into a single harmonized national tool. Their dataset is accessible on Harvard Dataverse. This grant also catalyzed the launch of the interdisciplinary SPH Energy and Health Lab, which Buonocore and Willis co-direct.

“The study really shows that there are big knowledge gaps across the supply chain, in terms of the hazards people are being exposed to, the consequent health impacts, and who is being exposed,” Buonocore said. “With a lot of these different types of infrastructure, the hazards have not been fully characterized. Characterizing hazards and understanding who is most heavily exposed should be the first steps of understanding the possible health impacts. This research takes the first steps down that path.”

A Clearer Picture Opens New Directions for Future Research

While some US municipalities or states have set zoning regulations, in many regions, fossil fuel processes are permitted in any proximity to homes and schools. The team hopes their work will spur continued research to inform policymaking and promote community health. They note that future research may aim to better monitor air, water, noise, and light pollution near facilities, and expand on potential health impacts into novel datasets, such as Medicaid claims, or unique populations like pregnancy planners.

“We're really the first group thinking about this as an integrated system. By quantifying all of these factors at once, we're potentially able to, down the line, directly compare: what are the health effects of living near an extraction site, compared to living near a storage site?” Willis said. “Having that in one database is the first step to doing any health studies in the future on this integrated system.”",https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert-bluebg_Twitter_601X601.png,N,,2025-11-17 12:01:28.078867

In the first half of 2025, renewables accounted for more than 34% of the world’s electricity, while coal’s share fell to just above 33%. Notably, these gains were largely driven by emerging economies.

As the world’s attention turns to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), this milestone serves as a powerful reminder that the clean-energy transition is already underway.

Having led investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation and now serving as chief investment officer at the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, I know a promising business opportunity when I see one.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 91% of new renewable-energy projects are now cheaper than their fossil-fuel counterparts.

This finding provides clear evidence that, despite the ongoing growth in coal and oil use, renewables are both economically and technically viable throughout much of the world.

We cannot afford to let today’s momentum slip away.

To reduce climate pollution, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen energy resilience where it is needed most, we must build on these achievements.

As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, meaningful global climate action is still possible, even in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions and competing national priorities.

Progress is inherently fragile

Yet such progress is inherently fragile. All too often, clean-energy adoption stalls once the infrastructure is in place.

Solar projects, for example, can fail when communities lack the necessary tools and financing to make full use of the electricity they produce.

Providing solar panels is not enough

Providing solar panels is not enough. To lock in the benefits of renewables, governments must invest not only in power generation but also in systems, training, and equipment – such as electric mills and water pumps – that enable communities and countries to harness clean energy for business growth and job creation.

When implemented effectively, such investments deliver benefits across the board. Climate goals advance as renewables replace costly, polluting fuels.

Communities gain access to affordable power, enabling them to improve education and health care, create jobs, and raise incomes.

And with energy companies profiting from rising demand, emerging economies can attract new investment.

The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity

The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity. The World Bank projects that 1.2 billion young people in developing economies will reach working age over the next decade, but that only 420 million new jobs will be created by then.

Access to clean energy, and the opportunities it brings, offers a way to bridge this gap before it becomes a global crisis.

The World Economic Forum estimates that the renewables industry alone could generate more than 30 million jobs and mobilize $2.2-2.8 trillion annually.

Embedding renewable technologies into other downstream sectors such as industry and agriculture could create a further 500 million new jobs and improve the quality of 700 million existing ones.

We must align energy policies with broader development objectives

To succeed, we must align energy policies with broader development objectives, integrate renewables into local industries, and accelerate investment in the equipment and training needed to use it effectively.

Across Africa, this approach is already delivering tangible results. In Nigeria, farmers and traders are increasingly using solar-powered irrigation pumps, cold-storage facilities, and mills.

These investments, in turn, have fueled a wave of distributed renewable-energy projects that are rapidly transforming local power systems.

In the Amazon, where COP30 is underway, the government of Brazil is investing $800 million to expand energy access and transition away from reliance on diesel.

My organization is helping to ensure that this new renewable energy creates jobs and powers sustainable economic development for thousands of farmers and entrepreneurs.

The clean-energy transition is within reach

India offers a useful model for emerging economies seeking to strengthen their power grids and absorb growing renewable capacity. In New Delhi, the country’s first commercial, utility-scale battery-energy storage system – the largest in South Asia – now guarantees a reliable supply of clean electricity to 100,000 low-income households and businesses.

Meanwhile, solar plants in Rajasthan provide steady daytime power to 40,000 farmers.

And in Uttar Pradesh, a women’s entrepreneurship program aims to help 500,000 women-owned businesses adopt clean-energy technologies by 2030.

Together, these examples show that the clean-energy transition is within reach.

But with 685 million people worldwide lacking electricity, and more than a billion relying on unaffordable or unreliable supply, there is still a long way to go.

The choice before us is clear: continue investing in renewables or slide back into fossil-fuel dependence.

23 schools have now installed Great British Energy solar panels and are cutting their energy bills, from Notre Dame RC School in Plymouth to Christ The King RC Primary School in Manchester. This has allowed savings to be reinvested in school services as part of the government’s clean energy superpower mission, enabling communities to reap the benefits of homegrown, clean power.

This is part of the government’s drive to make all public buildings more climate resilient. The government is building all new schools to be climate-resilient and net-zero in operation as part of the School Rebuilding Programme.

Rocketing energy bills in recent years have eaten into school budgets. This has been driven by the UK’s dependency on global fossil fuel markets over which government has no control. By enabling schools to generate their own electricity, it is estimated schools will save millions, far more than installation costs.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Great British Energy is helping schools to save money on bills, meaning more money for textbooks and technology.

Across the country, solar panels are going up on rooftops to power classrooms with clean, homegrown power.

This is our clean energy superpower mission in action, protecting our public services with lower bills and energy security.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail said:

Great British Energy’s ongoing solar rollout delivers tangible benefits to the people that need it most in our hospitals and schools.

This not only provides clean energy to communities, it also ensures that the public own and benefit from these projects through energy security, good jobs and above all, real tangible local outcomes such as more funds to support teaching and health.

Education Minister Josh MacAlister said:

Solar panels are slashing schools’ energy bills by thousands of pounds year after year, with the money going straight back into the textbooks and resources pupils need to succeed.

This is part of our wider work to drive national renewal, rebuilding more than 750 schools in every corner of the country.

The scheme will target schools and colleges with buildings that are able to accommodate solar panels in areas of England most in need. As part of this, the government has selected schools that will be primarily clustered in areas of deprivation in the North East, West Midlands and North West, as well as at least 10 schools in each region of England.

Each region includes a further education college which will work with the contractors appointed to promote careers in renewables to support growth in the construction and renewables workforce. This could be through work placements, skills bootcamps and workshops.

This follows the government’s commitment to curriculum reforms which will strengthen climate and sustainability education across geography, science, citizenship, and design and technology – from year one through to a new Natural History GCSE – helping to ensure pupils understand the planet, take action on climate change and develop the skills for a greener future.

This is alongside all nurseries, schools and colleges being called upon to put in place a climate action plan, while empowering young voices through Youth Sustainability Champions to help advise, evaluate and champion sustainability in education.

The rollout of these solar panels marks progress in Great British Energy and government’s Local Power Plan that will ensure the benefits of the government’s clean energy mission are felt at a local level, with energy security, good jobs and economic growth – while also helping to rebuild the nation’s public services.

Mark Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Bellevue Place Education Trust, London said:

We are delighted to have Kilburn Grange School and Halley House School enrolled in the Great British Energy’s solar programme in addition to other Bellevue Place Education Trust schools. Last year, all our schools collectively achieved a 9.4% reduction in energy consumption, saving £299K in energy bills, which we can invest back into the education provision for our pupils.

The event will be streamed live on the official Future Energy Summit YouTube channel. Among the top-level sessions, particular attention will go to panels co-organized with the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), which will address institutional, regulatory and financial challenges for the region’s energy transition.

On the first day, the closing panel will bring together former Chilean energy ministers Claudio Huepe (in office March–September 2022), Juan Carlos Jobet (June 2019–March 2022), and Carolina Zelaya, former Acting Executive Secretary of the National Energy Commission (CNE).

The discussion — titled “Public Policy Priorities for Chile’s Next Government” — will be moderated by Andrés Rebolledo, current Executive Secretary of OLADE and also a former Chilean energy minister. The session will focus on the strategic steps Chile needs to take to advance toward a cleaner, more resilient energy matrix.

A key contextual element: FES Chile will take place just ten days after the presidential and congressional elections, providing a timely forum to assess the energy proposals of the political groups competing to lead the country from 2026 to 2030.

The second day will revolve around battery energy storage systems (BESS) under the theme #ExperienciaBESS. The program begins with a VIP networking breakfast featuring Luis Felipe Ramos Barrera, Chile’s current Undersecretary of Energy.

Panel 1 — “Energy Strategies of Southern Cone Governments” — will bring together:

Mauricio Bejarano, Vice Minister of Mines and Energy of Paraguay

Agustín González, Energy Efficiency Manager at Uruguay’s National Energy Directorate

Antonio Milanese, Undersecretary for Energy Transition and Planning of Argentina

Moderated once again by OLADE’s Andrés Rebolledo.

The summit coincides with a milestone in Latin America’s energy storage deployment. The region, including the Caribbean, has already surpassed 3 GW of installed storage capacity, driven mainly by electrochemical technologies that account for 60% of the total.

Chile is leading this regional trend with more than 1,800 MW of operational BESS capacity, expected to exceed 2 GW by January 2026, four years ahead of its official 2030 target.

The new plant is expected to reinforce that leadership while bolstering domestic production capacity amid a shifting regulatory landscape.

A Milestone for Toyota’s US Operations

The North Carolina plant began production on November 12, 2025, and was described by Toyota Motor North America CEO Ted Ogawa as a “pivotal moment” in the company’s history, according to CNBC. The factory is designed to produce 30 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries annually once fully operational, powering a mix of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric vehicles.

This new facility represents the largest individual manufacturing investment Toyota has made in the United States to date. The company noted that its total cumulative US investment will now approach $60 billion since it began operations in the country nearly 70 years ago.

The site is expected to create up to 5,100 jobs and includes 14 production lines that will supply batteries for models such as the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a future three-row electric SUV.

Aligning With Evolving Mobility Goals

While market enthusiasm for electric-only vehicles has cooled, Toyota’s strategy has stayed focused on diversified electrification. Hybrid vehicle sales in the US are continuing to outpace expectations, and Toyota’s longstanding focus in that area appears to be paying off. The company leads hybrid sales through Q3 2025 with a 51% share, based on data from Motor Intelligence.

The Liberty plant is a direct outcome of US government initiatives to bring more battery production onshore, a priority that gained momentum in recent years. Although the project was first announced back in December 2021, Toyota’s continued investment trajectory suggests a long-term commitment to reshoring its supply chain and mitigating geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties.

During a press event, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the announcement a “show of confidence” in the current administration’s policies aimed at strengthening domestic manufacturing. Fox Business reported Duffy’s remarks, highlighting the government’s emphasis on creating well-paying industrial jobs and stimulating regional economies through large-scale infrastructure projects like this.

Investing in Workforce and Infrastructure

Beyond the production lines, Toyota is positioning the Liberty site as more than just a factory. The facility will also feature a range of amenities designed to support employees and build community ties—among them, an on-site medical clinic, pharmacy, childcare center, and fitness facility. These additions are part of a broader effort to attract and retain skilled labor in a highly competitive job market.

This human-centered approach to manufacturing was emphasized during Toyota’s public statements, underscoring the company’s efforts to invest not just in technology but in people and local economies. As more production lines are added by 2030, the plant is expected to become a central hub for Toyota’s electric and hybrid vehicle platforms in the region.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toyota-dealership.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 11:09:22.219831

Summary

U.S. energy production and demand are growing, driven by LNG exports, data centers, and grid modernization, with Texas and shale basins supporting growth.

Major utilities are investing more than $1 trillion through 2029 to upgrade grids and support evolving energy mixes.

Large midstream firms are positioned to benefit from expanding export markets, power infrastructure buildouts, and needed pipelines.

Despite the tech sector's dominance, energy remains a foundational and complementary investment area.

I offer some takeaways from a Fed energy conference.

Energy production and consumption is an important feature of the U.S. economy. We're the pace car of the world in some respects. From a Nov. 13 Federal Reserve Bank energy conference in Denver, representing Dallas’ 11th and Kansas City’s 10th districts, a range of takeaways emerged from

The $14 billion plant, located in Liberty, is the first and only Toyota battery plant outside of Japan.
“Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts,” the release says.
“This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.
Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030.","Toyota announced the start of production at its new battery plant in North Carolina Wednesday, along with a commitment to an additional $10 billion U.S. investment, according to a company press release.

The $14 billion plant, located in Liberty, is the first and only Toyota battery plant outside of Japan.

“Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts,” the release says. “This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

According to Automotive News, a Toyota spokesperson declined to specify which projects the funds would go toward. The trade publication noted that President Donald Trump announced last month that Toyota was preparing to invest $10 billion in auto plants in the United States.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) president and chief executive officer, said in the release. “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy is mentioned in the Toyota release as expressing support for the investments, stating that the battery plant marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said Duffy in the release. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

Automotive News also reports that Duffy said regulatory relief will be coming to automakers who wrestle with their powertrain strategies, he said.

“I haven’t been able to announce it yet because of the [federal government] shutdown, but on the horizon, we’re going to have an announcement where we’re going to have a very reasonable fuel efficiency standard,” Automotive News said he told an audience at the plant event. “And when we do that, what’s going to happen is you’re going to be able to make more cars, because your cars are going to be more cost-effective for the American consumer. We’re going to bring down the price of vehicles because we don’t have standards that, frankly, you can’t [meet].”

The 1,850-acre site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity, the release says. It will serve as the company’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its portfolio of electric vehicles.

It will house 14 battery production lines supporting HEVs, BEVs and PHEVs. The batteries will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row BEV. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama, the release says.

Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030.

Toyota also announced the second phase of its “Driving Possibilities” initiative in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District with a Toyota USA Foundation grant of an additional $2.7 million.

“This incredible gift will provide our students and their families with life-changing opportunities,” said Wendy Poteat, president and CEO of shift_ed, a nonprofit regional leader connecting education to workforce development, and coordinating partner for the NC Driving Possibilities program. “Toyota has become a generous supporter and dedicated stakeholder in enriching our school districts by inspiring innovation and nurturing curiosity and creativity in our learners from classroom to career. Programs like these are essential in closing opportunity and exposure gaps, empowering students to reach their full potential.”

THE TOP FIVE

1. Trump opens half of an untouched Alaska reserve to drilling

The Department of the Interior finalized a rule last week opening up roughly half of the largely untouched National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to oil and gas drilling. The regulatory change overturns a Biden-era measure blocking oil and gas drilling on 11 million acres of the nation’s largest swath of public land, as my predecessor in anchoring this newsletter, Heatmap’s Jeva Lange, wrote in June. The Trump administration vowed to “unleash” energy production in Alaska by opening the 23 million-acre reserve, as well as nearby Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to exploration. By rescinding the Biden-era restrictions, “we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities, and strengthen American energy security,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement, according to E&E News. In a post on X, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, called the move “yet another step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance.”

The new rule is expected to face challenges in court.“Today’s action is another example of how the Trump administration is trying to take us back in time with its reckless fossil fuels agenda,” Erik Grafe, a lawyer with Earthjustice, an environmental nonprofit group, said in a statement to The New York Times.

2. In a first, UN climate talks address critical minerals

For the first time in United Nations climate negotiations, countries attending the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, are grappling with the effects of mining the minerals needed for batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines, Climate Home News reported. In a draft text on Friday, a working group at the summit recognized “the social and environmental risks associated with scaling up supply chains for clean energy technologies, including risks arising from the extraction and processing of critical minerals.”

The statement came amid ongoing protests from Indigenous groups, including those from Argentina who warned that the world’s increased appetite for South America’s lithium reserves came at the cost of local water resources for peoples who have lived in regions near mining operations for millennia.

3. More than 2,600 EPA employees opt for mass resignation

Nearly one fifth of the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce has opted into President Donald Trump’s mass resignation plan, according to new data E&E News obtained on Friday. The agency had 16,155 employees at the start of this year. As of the end of September, the EPA’s payroll included 15,166 employees, according to data released during the government shutdown, meaning that more than 2,620 employees accepted the “deferred resignation” offer.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has advanced proposals that even the agency under Scott Pruitt, the top environmental regulator at the start of Trump’s first term, dared not attempt. Zeldin has moved to rescind the endangerment finding, which forms the legal basis for virtually all major climate regulations at the EPA. Zeldin even tried to kill off the popular Energy Star program for efficient appliances, but — as I wrote earlier this month — he backed off the plan.

4. Eavor is preparing to launch its next-generation geothermal technology

The next-generation geothermal company Eavor is preparing to start up its debut closed-loop system at its pilot project in Germany, Think Geoenergy reported. The startup has stood out in the race to commercialize technology that can harness energy from the Earth’s molten core in more places than conventional approaches allow. While rivals such as Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy, pursue projects in the American Southwest, Eavor focused its efforts on Germany, where it saw potential to tap into the lucrative district heating market. Eavor also developed special drilling tools that promised to shave “tens of millions” off the cost of digging wells. As I wrote here last month, the company just completed successful tests of its technology.

5. BlackRock launches a $2.3 billion data center venture with a Spanish firm

BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners inked a deal with the Spanish construction company ACS to form a joint venture to develop roughly $2.3 billion worth of data centers. The 50-50 joint venture will consist of ACS’ existing data-center portfolio, including 1.7 gigawatts of assets under development in Europe, the U.S., and Australia. ACS is contributing its existing portfolio to the business, The Wall Street Journal reported, “in exchange for about 1 billion euros in cash and initial earnout payments of up to 1 billion euros” if the data centers hit certain commercial milestones. “Global demand for data centers is set to grow more than 15 times by 2035, driven by the expansion of AI, cloud migration, and the exponential rise in data volumes,” ACS CEO Juan Santamaria said.

Flaring and venting unwanted gas from equipment are the largest sources of oil and gas methane pollution.","As season two of the oil-country drama kicks off, it continues to portray the risks of leaking gas in west Texas and other oil patches worldwide.

In the very first episode of Taylor Sheridan’s latest hit series, the Billy Bob Thornton-led Landman, 14.9 million people got to see the risks that oil workers in the West Texas Permian basin take every day to keep supply flowing.

As workers try and fix a rusty pipe valve, a spark ignites the methane spewing from it, creating an enormous fireball that kills the entire crew, save for the son of Thornton’s character, named Cooper.

While Cooper’s aggressive handling of the valve is initially blamed for the accident, it turns out that such deadly mishaps — as well as routine releases — are not uncommon. With Landman Season 2 airing, new research by RMI shows that wasted gas and methane emissions from West Texas’s oil and gas fields are some of the largest in the United States, as shown on the map below. Moreover, not all assets and operations are the same. One equivalent barrel of West Texas gas can leak over three times more than another barrel from the same region.

Here’s what Landman gets right about risks in the oil patch

Faulty equipment and outdated machinery cause explosions. Accidents are not the intentional act of oilfield workers. It is reported that more than two workers per month die from explosions, blunt force trauma, poisonous gas, or vehicle crashes. In 2023, someone died every dayon the Permian’s highways in West Texas, double the death count in 2010.

It’s an ongoing battle to keep aging oil and gas fields up and running, as Thornton’s character in Landman knows firsthand. Texas has a reported 278,000 oil and gas wells currently pumping. The majority — 70 percent — are low-producing marginal wells. And over 70,000 wells trickle at less than one barrel of oil and gas equivalent a day. Marginal wells’ oil field equipment, so prevalent in the United States that they can be found in backyards next to swing sets, is not generally equipped to handle gas and can recklessly spew it into the air.

Beyond spewing deadly gas and causing explosions, the gas from leaking wells is laden with dangerous chemicals — like the carcinogen benzene — that poison people and their drinking water. Texas’ regulators are increasingly focused on such “priority wells” that are leaking and pose environmental, safety, or economic risks.

Adequate comprehensive oversight is sorely lacking. US oil and gas production operations are estimated to emit more than 17 million metric tons per year of methane gas. And production in Texas is ground zero for such leaks, responsible for nearly 40 percent of US oil and gas methane emissions. Funding regulators to staff inspectors who can investigate operations is crucial. Last year, the State’s oil regulator requested $100 million to tackle West Texas well blowouts.

Prevention puts money back into Americans’ pockets. Studies estimate that leaking gas represents at least $1 billion annually in US commercial gas value and some $10 billion in annual social cost.

Solutions are readily available, and operators are increasingly turning toward them

Gathering and making data on gas waste public can surface tradeoffs and new opportunities. For too long, gas has been seen by the industry as an unwanted waste product of oil production, allowing it to be squandered by venting and flaring. Today, satellites and other sensing equipment are spotting and measuring methane waste. Ongoing remote sensing offers a path to publicly detect thousands of high-consequence events. Getting this into the hands of operators and policy makers can spur rapid mitigation, updating official emissions inventories, and realistic assessments of effective mitigation technologies tailored for specific regions like West Texas.

An oil and gas operator’s business decisions — and ethics — make a big difference in how much gas leaks, its climate impacts, and overall risks. Flaring and venting unwanted gas from equipment are the largest sources of oil and gas methane pollution. Both are largely preventable. Some companies are beginning to seize the safety, economic, and societal benefits of certifiably producing fewer leaky barrels. This is a huge safety and environmental win. In addition to being toxic and explosive, methane gas is a climate change super-pollutant that heats the planet over 80 times more powerfully than carbon dioxide. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is currently at the highest level since measurements began. Oil and gas operations offer the easiest and most cost-effective means to slash methane waste.

In the past five years, pioneering efforts have been made to measure and certify oil and gas methane emissions. Cutting-edge opportunities, like MiQ, help companies stop wasting and start making money from their gas. Currently, one in every five cubic feet of US gas has been certified by small and multinational companies alike. And major gas importers, like Europe, are setting the stage for a sizeable price premium on certified low-leakage gas.

Oil and gas operators can take advantage of market incentives to do things the right way. Making it easier than ever for companies to pivot away from outdated practices that lead to excessive leaks will safeguard workers, surrounding communities, and the planet. Taylor Sheridan’s dark television dramas don’t deal in happy endings, but in the real world, we can make the choices that keep us safe, secure, and ready for the future.

Lead pipes are ubiquitous. At this point, no state has gotten rid of all of its toxic lead service lines, which pipe drinking water to homes and businesses. But some cities like Chicago, New York City, and Detroit have more lead plumbing than others, and replacing it can cost tens of thousands of dollars. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Biden-era infrastructure law, promised $15 billion for lead pipe replacements across the country to be disbursed over five years.

But in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency sent earlier this week, a group of Illinois congressional delegates allege that $3 billion appropriated for lead pipe replacements nationwide for the fiscal year that ended in September has not reached communities yet. They warn that the delay is a “dangerous politicization” that puts children and families at risk.

“Federal resources are not partisan tools—they are vital lifelines intended to serve all Americans,” the letter notes. “Using federal funds as leverage against communities based on political considerations represents a dangerous abuse of power that undermines public trust and puts lives at risk.”

The move comes as communities in Illinois, which is among the top five states with the most lead service lines, and across the country are grappling with the overwhelming cost of removing the hazardous metal piping from water systems. The Trump administration has already withheld congressionally appropriated funding for infrastructure and energy projects from Democrat-led states like New York, Colorado, Minnesota, New York, and Massachusetts. Now, lawmakers fear money for lead pipes is stuck in Washington too.

“I think that they’re playing games,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to send the letter. “It feels like it’s targeting blue states or blue cities that might require more of this mitigation than other parts of the country.”

Lead is toxic and dangerous to human health. Lead plumbing can flake and dissolve into drinking water, which can lead to brain damage, cardiovascular problems, and reproductive issues. The EPA advises that there is no safe level of lead exposure.

A spokesperson for the federal agency said it is “actively working” on allotments for lead service line replacements. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible for disbursing the federal funds to local governments, did not respond to a request for comment. The Chicago Department of Water Management said it received $14 million from the Illinois EPA for the 2025 financial year and was approved for $28 million for the next fiscal year.

“The estimated replacement cost for the Chicago region alone is $12 billion or more, and statewide, it could be $14 billion,” Krishnamoorthi said. “Whatever amounts would come to Chicago would not be enough to do the entire job, but the federal component is vital to get the ball rolling.”

Chicago has more than 412,000 lead service lines, the most of any city in the country. So far, the city has replaced roughly 14,000 lead pipes at a cost of $400 million over the past five years. That’s due in part to the high cost of replacing lead pipes. In Chicago, a single lead pipe replacement can cost on average $35,000. Federal rules require that Chicago replace all its pipes by 2047, but city officials have cited concerns over the unfunded federal mandate.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WATCHWATER-120422-15-min.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-17 08:59:43.986061

The programme is centred on delivering new cloud and AI infrastructure with a parallel focus on bringing new energy resources to the grid and developing a skilled workforce to build and manage it.

The investment includes plans for new data centre campuses in Armstrong and Haskell Counties, alongside an expansion of its existing facilities in Ellis County.

Aligning data centre expansion with energy strategy

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, describes the move as “a significant expansion of our commitment to the Lone Star State”.

“AI is poised to accelerate a new golden age of American innovation and Texas – with its optimism and talent – is leading the way,"" he adds.

""To power this progress, we must invest in world-leading infrastructure and the people who build it.

""That's why we are investing more than US$40bn in Texas through 2027 to expand our Cloud and AI infrastructure.”

The state-wide build is anchored in a multi-site plan where each location is part of a wider cloud region design.

This model integrates capacity, connectivity and energy planning into a single programme.

All sites in Armstrong, Haskell and Ellis Counties are positioned to support the next generation of Search, Maps and AI workloads, which have considerable power requirements.

This strategic placement highlights the importance of a robust energy grid for technological advancement.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott commented on the scale of the project, stating, “This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state.

""Texas is the epicentre of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.”

Greg added, “Google's US$40bn investment makes Texas Google's largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.”

New energy generation and grid stability

A core principle of Google's Texas expansion is that new energy is brought to the grid as new data centre capacity becomes operational.

Google plans to cover the full costs associated with its operations and support energy efficiency programmes within local communities.

To achieve this, Google has confirmed a new US$30m Energy Impact Fund designed to accelerate community energy projects.

This fund is paired with more than 6,200MW of new energy generation secured through power purchase agreements with energy developers.

In a direct example of this synergy, one of the new data centres in Haskell County is situated next to a solar and battery storage plant.

This colocation is designed to support daily operations and enhance power stability.

According to Google, energy abundance, grid stability and cost discipline are key components of the planning model for all its Texas campuses, supported by off-site renewables, storage and long-term agreements.

You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we publish many (but not all) of our forecasts a few days afterward online. Here’s the latest...

Now that the federal tax credit has expired, what is the outlook for electric vehicles in the U.S.? Sales surged as buyers rushed to cash in on the credit before it expired on September 30, then crashed. Here’s how we see the EV market in the longer term.

Once a novelty, EVs are here to stay. But they will occupy a much smaller share of the market in the coming months and beyond, now that the $7,500 federal tax credit is no more. (Note that some states offer tax credits of their own.) Early this year, before talk of Congress axing the credit influenced buyers, EVs accounted for 7.9% of car sales. For the time being, we see that level dropping to 5-6% or so, as demand finds its natural, unsubsidized level.

Surveys show many consumers are interested in electric cars, even if they’re not ready to buy one. Manufacturers will keep building them, but in reduced numbers. Some existing EVs are already getting canceled, along with future models that automakers are now rethinking. Vehicle lineups that were supposed to transition to mostly or all EV in a few years now appear likely to stay mostly gas.

The good news for EV-curious consumers: There will be cheap used models hitting the market in the next few years. EV leasing soared after the Biden era made it easier to qualify for the federal tax credit that way. That flood of used vehicles will be returning to the market, giving value-minded shoppers lots of potential deals.

Cheaper, low-mileage used EVs may be the ticket to convincing wary buyers to consider going electric, now that demand from early adopters has been satisfied. Many drivers won’t be lured, either because an EV doesn’t meet their specific needs or a simple preference for gas. But a decent number of folks appear to be on the fence and may try a used electric model, if the financial math pencils out.

That being said, assuring potential buyers that used EVs’ batteries are sound will be key. Replacing EV batteries costs thousands, even tens of thousands, of dollars. Automakers and dealers will tout new “state of health” certifications showing the useful capacity an EV battery has. They may be rolled into automakers’ certified pre-owned programs, which inspect and vouch for quality used cars, and come with an extended warranty.

More public charging stations will also help, eventually. As of August, the U.S. had 229,000 public charging ports, though they tend to cluster around urban areas, vary in charging capacity and can be prone to failure. More and faster ones are needed. For now, EVs’ lost market share will likely be gobbled up by hybrid models. Consumers are really warming up to them as a compromise that keeps the familiarity and advantages of gas, with fuel efficiency boosted by batteries and electric motors. They’ll likely account for 15% of new car sales soon as more models come as hybrids.

Republican and Democratic leaders are particularly hoping to make up ground on permitting reform legislation. There could be a markup vote in the coming days.

“We have a lot of business to do, as you all know, and we will be working in earnest,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said last week. “There will be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.”

The shutdown and Johnson’s decision to keep House members in their districts for most of the past two months have created a pileup of pending legislation. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) said last week that of all the bills that have advanced out of committee this year, 150 are awaiting potential floor votes.

“These people have been missing in action, absent without official leave, running scared. But they can no longer hide,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).

The House is poised to vote on a resolution to compel the release of documents associated with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There could also be votes on legislation focused on lawmaker stock trading, cryptocurrency and other issues.

In December, the Senate will vote on a Democratic-backed bill to extend soon-to-expire premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.

Some Republican leaders have floated the potential for a second reconciliation bill, which would allow the majority to pass certain health care policies without Democratic buy-in.

Meanwhile, Armed Services Committee leaders are negotiating the annual defense policy bill with the goal of voting on a compromise version in December. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act lean heavily into advanced nuclear energy and environmental cleanups.

Congress will look to make headway on various bipartisan packages that the shutdown stalled, including a bill to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency and legislation to reauthorize pipeline safety programs. A bipartisan highway bill is also in the works.

Funding fights

It took the House and Senate more than three months to negotiate the package of three fiscal 2026 spending bills that Congress passed last week as part of the deal to reopen the government.

Now, Congress will race to pass nine more spending bills before government funding runs out Jan. 31. Senate leaders have already lined up a package of at least three more bills for bipartisan, bicameral negotiations: Defense, Labor-HHS-Education and Transportation-HUD.

Two more spending bills — Interior-Environment and Commerce-Justice-Science — are also in the mix, but those have been mired by appropriators’ disagreements about policy riders and funding levels. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has objections about top lines in the bill that funds the Department of the Interior and EPA.

Lawmakers are eager to avoid another shutdown, but Democrats have not telegraphed how they might respond if appropriations bills don’t pass on time, if the Trump administration continues its unilateral funding cuts or if the health care issue is not resolved.

“We’re going to try to take that weapon out of their hand,” Johnson said Friday on Fox Business, referring to Democrats’ recent attempt to use a shutdown for leverage.

“What I mean by that is over these next several intense days, these next couple months, we’ll be working around the clock to make sure we get more of these appropriations bills through the process,” Johnson said.

Lawmakers have their work cut out for them. The House has not passed most of its fiscal 2026 bills on the floor. The Senate is even further behind; the chamber has yet to release and mark up four of its spending bills.

Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), chair of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, said he expects his bill to hit the House floor for a vote as soon as this week. From there, it would enter informal negotiations with Senate appropriators.

“We need to move on ours so we can go to conference,” Simpson said. “There’s always differences, and that’s OK. That’s what conferences are all about.”

The Energy-Water bill remains stuck. It passed the House by one vote earlier this year, but the Senate has not yet finalized its own version.

Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Kennedy, the chair of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, are at an impasse over funding levels in the bill. Kennedy wants his bill to reduce spending on renewable energy and other programs while maintaining funding for the Army Corps of Engineers and the nuclear stockpile.

Kennedy has said his version of the bill has a discretionary top line 1 percent below the currently enacted level and is ready for a markup. However, committee leaders have not released it.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member on the Energy-Water Subcommittee, indicated that the dispute over the bill’s top line had been elevated to Collins. Murray said she is “waiting for Sen. Collins to do something” about it. A spokesperson for Collins said they did not have an update on the bill’s status.

“I’m going with my bill, and if the Appropriations Committee or the chairwoman or the vice chairwoman don’t like it, I respect their opinion, but they got one vote and I got one vote, and mine is the only bill that reduces spending,” Kennedy said.

“I know that is a new experience for everybody on the committee,” he added, “but I’m not backing down, and that’s kind of where I am.”

Permitting reform

One discussion that didn’t grind to a halt even as the government shuttered? Permitting.

As the longest government shutdown in history delayed much legislative progress, lawmakers in both chambers continued to meet with each other and with energy industry and tech lobbyists who have showed up to the Capitol to press members to advance legislation intended to boost energy supply.

“The shutdown has given us a lot of time to review the legislation, to work with other members,” House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) said last week just before voting to end the shutdown. “I think we’re really tying the legislation up and have a real high-quality piece of legislation.”

He’s gearing up to hold a markup as early as this week on his bipartisan bill, H.R. 4776, the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” to amend the National Environmental Policy Act process to set firmer deadlines and reduce the judicial review period.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) is a co-sponsor, and Westerman said their teams are taking input from other committee Democrats who “had some issues.”

Across the Capitol, key senators have been trading draft proposals on a larger package that — to get Democratic buy-in — would include transmission infrastructure, a net reduction in emissions and safeguards for permitted projects. Democrats are also demanding that the Trump administration must stop attacking clean energy projects.

But Westerman does not necessarily see the “SPEED Act” as part of a bipartisan trade, and he was not eager to talk about transmission, saying it’s not part of his committee’s jurisdiction.

“I’m not pushing for that,” he said. “What I’m pushing for is to keep the SPEED Act clean. Because if we start tacking stuff onto it, the line would be across the Capitol from people who want carve-outs.”

At the same time, he acknowledged any piece of legislation could grow in order to get it on the president’s desk.

“I think what people have to realize is NEPA reform helps everything,” he said. “It helps electrical transmission. It helps pipelines. It helps traditional energy sources. It helps new energy sources. It helps transportation and infrastructure projects. So if all we pass — and I hate to say if all — but if only NEPA passes, everybody wins.”

NDAA nearing completion

House and Senate negotiators are getting close to finalizing the fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. It is likely to carry a number of provisions on nuclear energy, critical minerals and environmental cleanups.

Armed Services Committee leaders plan to unveil a compromise NDAA by Thanksgiving, with the goal of having the House and Senate vote on it by mid-December.

There are some differences between the bills, but lawmakers involved say they are not far from a final deal. They have been working on bridging the $32 billion gulf between the House and Senate bills’ funding authorizations and will likely remove most of the culture-war provisions House lawmakers added to their version.

“We’re in a better position on this NDAA than we have been for the last two or three years, as far as the narrow number of issues that were still outstanding,” House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) told reporters Wednesday.

Negotiators are having to sort out differences on energy and environment policies. For example, in October, the Senate added a major nuclear energy bill to its version, as well as language to crack down on illegal fishing and to expand efforts to map reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements.

The Senate bill includes a bipartisan housing bill that contains a number of provisions on environmental reviews and disaster recovery.

Both bills have similar language promoting the Pentagon’s embrace of advanced nuclear energy. They would require the Department of Defense to establish advanced nuclear energy working groups.

They also contain provisions dedicated to promoting resilience on military installations and addressing contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

Reconciliation 2.0?

President Donald Trump earlier this month called on Senate Republicans to scrap the legislative filibuster in order to reopen the government without Democratic votes. While Republican leaders opted not to take that route, there is some interest in finding other ways to get around Democratic opposition.

Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he is meeting with other Republicans about the possibility of passing a second reconciliation bill this Congress, following up on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“I want us to look at what a reconciliation package, a new one, would look like,” Graham told POLITICO earlier this month. “We could do some things on health care. We can do some things on policy, taxes and spending.”

The GOP accomplished much of its legislative agenda with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A second party-line bill would take up a significant amount of committee time and energy, and many Republicans are not eager to do it all again.

House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) told POLITICO’s E&E News earlier this year that he does not think there are many energy-related policies left to pursue in a potential second reconciliation bill. Other committee leaders also cast doubt on using reconciliation to pass more energy and natural resources policies.

Westerman said earlier this year that he had been having discussions to prepare for another effort, but his committee has not produced any formal proposals.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ae/7c/acc77baf485b852ab6499fc8f48f/u-s-congress-29295.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 11:08:16.126382

Tesla is requiring suppliers to eliminate China-made components from vehicles built in its U.S. factories.

Tariffs and geopolitical tensions have pushed the company to accelerate its supply chain shift.

Tesla is expanding non-China sourcing, including new battery production efforts in the United States.

Tesla is pushing suppliers to eliminate China-made components from vehicles built in its U.S. factories, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The effort marks one of the automaker’s strongest moves yet to separate its American production from China and reflects the growing impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on global automotive supply chains.

Tesla and its suppliers have already replaced several China-made parts, and the company plans to complete a full transition to non-China components within the next one to two years. The shift affects parts used across Tesla’s U.S. manufacturing operations at a time when fluctuating tariffs and geopolitical disputes have made planning and pricing strategies more difficult. The Journal reported that the company intensified its sourcing changes this year after President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imports from China.

The push to diversify suppliers follows years of growing dependence on China. Tesla’s Shanghai plant uses a supply base of about 400 Chinese direct suppliers, and more than 60 of them have previously supported production at Tesla factories worldwide. While Shanghai-built models are shipped to Asia and Europe, they are not exported to the United States.

Automakers across the industry are reevaluating their reliance on China due to rare-earth restrictions, semiconductor shortages and rising political friction. Tesla executives have faced repeated supply disruptions, including chip shortages tied to a conflict between China and the Netherlands that limited exports from a Dutch semiconductor firm whose packaging is done in China. The situation renewed internal discussions about accelerating diversification efforts.

Other manufacturers have made similar moves. General Motors recently instructed thousands of suppliers to remove China-made components from their supply chains. Trade actions by both governments have created widespread concern across the sector as automakers work to secure essential inputs ranging from batteries to magnets to electronic components.

Tesla has been encouraging longtime China-based suppliers to relocate production to Mexico and Southeast Asia. The company also stopped selling U.S. vehicles with China-made lithium-iron-phosphate batteries last year because of tariff implications and ineligibility for EV tax credits. Tesla is now building LFP batteries for its energy-storage products in Nevada, with operations expected to begin in early 2026.

The United States remains Tesla’s largest market, and the company is working to expand domestic and non-China sourcing to stabilize its U.S. production. While building a fully diversified supply chain will take time, it is essential given the ongoing rise in geopolitical risks.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11172025-Tesla-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 07:58:27.016041

That unity lasted about a week. On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro helped tear it back open.

The Democratic rising star cut a deal to end his state’s four-month budget stalemate: In exchange for Republicans supporting about $2 billion in additional spending, Pennsylvania would drop its yearslong effort to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the cap-and-trade system covering the electricity sectors of 10 states.

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged on the trail to reduce Virginians’ electric bills and support local energy production.

The energy mix should include offshore wind development, she said in campaign materials, as well as solar projects in “commonsense locations” like abandoned mines and former industrial sites. While the document didn’t mention natural gas, Spanberger in August said that the fuel is going to “be part of the energy mix into the future.”

“She really does believe the energy demands that you see on the horizon in the commonwealth require all forms of energy, including gas,” said Bruce McKay, chair of the Natural Gas Coalition of Virginia.

McKay — who said the new coalition isn’t “anti-anything” — said natural gas sits “right at the intersection of reliability and affordability” and can be a “workhorse” along with other energy sources to address rising electricity demand. Environmental critics point to the fuel’s climate-warming emissions, even though it burns more cleanly than coal. They also emphasize projections of rising natural gas prices.

Spanberger’s campaign did not return a request for comment on the future of natural gas in Virginia.

During her campaign, she didn’t take a stand against natural gas or indicate that certain pipeline projects need to be stopped, according to analysts at strategy firm Capstone said.

Jack Buckley, a senior associate on Capstone’s energy team, said he didn’t think Spanberger’s administration would “really limit or disadvantage existing or new natural gas pipeline infrastructure” in Virginia.

“Given the demands of data centers, especially in Northern Virginia, where there’s a high concentration, and the subsequent affordability concerns that are spurred by this, I think that she will have to accept natural gas infrastructure given the significant energy needs of the state,” he said.

But environmental groups dispute the gas industry’s stance that more gas pipelines and plants would make energy more affordable.

Lee Francis, chief program and communications officer at the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, referenced recent analyses — including from the Department of Energy’s statistical arm — projecting an increase in natural gas prices.

“This election was won in part on promises to lower energy costs for Virginians, and I think building or approving lots of new gas infrastructure would be counter to that,” Francis said. “I think that’s how you raise people’s bills and keep them high for years to come.”

Spanberger’s victory comes more than five years after former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) into law that calls for major electricity providers to be carbon-free by 2045 and 2050, and mandating the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade system for the power sector.

Francis said Spanberger’s comments on gas are aligned with Virginia’s existing energy laws.

“The thing I’m optimistic about is a Spanberger administration that actually wants to get serious about increasing renewables, instead of standing in the way — which is what we’ve seen in the past four years as electric bills have gotten higher,” Francis said.

The governor of Virginia is in charge of key appointments — such as the director of the Virginia Department of Energy and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which oversee energy initiatives and permitting.

Jay Jones, the newly elected Democratic attorney general of Virginia, also ran on a pledge to lower electricity costs. Staff in the attorney general’s office argue rate cases and other utility issues at the Virginia State Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities.

But former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, said in a statement that Spanberger’s “understanding of the importance of natural gas” — working with renewables — “will serve as a foundation for Virginia’s continuing economic growth and keep utility prices affordable for businesses and families.”

Landrieu is co-chair of Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a natural gas advocacy group.

Power generation

With Election Day in the review mirror, Spanberger is now facing calls to revisit the 2020 law and adopt a more pro-natural gas stance as she prepares to take office in January.

Spanberger has said she’s “fine with keeping existing natural gas infrastructure — she’s a little skeptical of new infrastructure — but reality is going to come to her and show her that we need new natural gas infrastructure,” said Gabriella Hoffman, director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at the Independent Women’s Forum, a conservative nonprofit.

Even with its clean energy law and RGGI, Virginia hasn’t seen mass wind and solar adoption, she said.

Natural gas already accounted for more than 60 percent of electricity generation in Virginia in August, federal data shows, with nuclear power coming in a distance second at 24 percent of the mix.

While energy demand in the state stayed flat between 2006 and 2020, “unconstrained demand for power in Virginia is expected to double within the next 10 years, driven primarily by the data center industry’s growth,” a Virginia legislative commission said in a December 2024 report to the governor and the state’s General Assembly.

Northern Virginia is the world’s biggest data center market, the report said, and was home to some 13 percent of global data center capacity.

Utilities across the Southeast are pursuing natural gas projects as energy demand rises. In March, for example, Dominion Energy filed an application with a Virginia state agency to build a nearly one gigawatt gas-fired power plant in Chesterfield County, south of Richmond.

In a recent integrated resource plan update last month, Dominion said that under its preferred plan for the next 20 years it would build 17.5 gigawatts of solar, 2 GW of storage, six small modular reactors, 3.4 GW of offshore wind, and 8.5 GW of gas-fired assets.

“Tech companies, lawmakers, stakeholders — everyone across Virginia, regardless of politics or the political background — has said that we need to have natural gas in the equation, not only to meet this rising demand from [artificial intelligence] data centers, but because right now existing natural gas especially still is overwhelmingly cheaper,” Hoffman said.

Still, in its latest monthly report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said the U.S. benchmark gas natural price is expected to average $4 per million British thermal units in 2026, up over 14 percent from the estimated average of $3.50 for 2025, due to increased liquefied natural gas exports and plateaued production.

Higher natural gas prices have pushed up renewable and coal-fueled electricity production in the U.S.

Natural gas affects households and small businesses in two ways: through utility services for heating and cooking, and the fuel’s role in power generation, said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program.

People are using natural gas as a fuel for power plants and in homes at the same time the U.S. is exporting record levels of LNG — forcing up demand and prices as EIA noted, Slocum said.

The more exposure Virginia has to natural gas, he said, the more expensive that energy bills will become.

“Gas is only going to get more expensive going forward,” Slocum said. “You can build more pipelines in Virginia or anywhere else, but that extra natural gas is still going to be competing with folks in Berlin and Beijing for access to the U.S. gas.”

In a statement, Landrieu said prices rise when supply is constricted.

“If we want to meet the growing energy needs in Virginia and other states across the country, the answer is more natural gas infrastructure to move more energy supplies where it’s needed to address this record demand impacting residents and businesses,” Landrieu said.

McKay with the Natural Gas Coalition of Virginia said his group is focused on ensuring that the “additional gas that might be needed for power [generation] can get where it is needed, when it is needed, to support that piece.”

Spanberger will take steps to start address the state’s energy crisis even before she gets into office, McKay said.

“It’s a high priority and my guess is she’ll get after it, probably before she’s sworn into office,” he said.

Pipeline plans

Another focus for the oil and gas sector is tying the answer to energy affordability to more natural gas pipelines.

And like Virginia, New Jersey recently elected a Democrat to be its next governor — Rep. Mikie Sherrill — with energy issues on the table.

“The governors-elect in both New Jersey and Virginia identified natural gas as critical to a more affordable energy future,” Amy Andryszak, CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a statement. “But to deliver on that promise, we will need more pipelines and infrastructure to deliver the fuel to homes and businesses.”

In May 2023, Spanberger joined fellow House Democrats from Virginia in submitting an amendment to the House Rules Committee that sought to strip out a provision expediting approvals for the Mountain Valley pipeline from a debt ceiling law.

In a news release at the time, the lawmakers said permitting for the line had “nothing to do with our nation’s spending” and that green-lighting Mountain Valley “undermines our efforts to accelerate the deployment of clean-energy technologies and curb harmful greenhouse gas emissions.”

Still, the provision stayed in the measure that became law and the Mountain Valley pipeline began operating last year. It transports natural gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia.

Mountain Valley is actively working to extend the 303-mile pipeline with the Southgate amendment project, which would add 31 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline. Last week, a North Carolina agency approved a water quality certification for the project.

In a post-election analysis, Capstone said the Spanberger administration could “pose headwinds to new natural gas infrastructure projects” in Virginia, while adding that she “has campaigned on an energy platform that supports continued use of natural gas.”

“I think when it comes to new natural gas infrastructure, that’s where we really need to be focused and sort of thinking carefully about the lifespan of those projects and whether indeed they are the most cost-effective solution,” Spanberger told Inside Climate News earlier this year.

Still, last month, the Virginia Department of Energy announced a new energy industry partnership to undertake a “comprehensive study identifying opportunities” to increase natural gas power generation, including identifying locations in southwest Virginia “where new natural gas pipeline infrastructure can support new power generation facilities.”

And potential pipelines are on the drawing board for Virginia.

The proposed MVP Southgate and Southeast Supply Enhancement projects would cut through Virginia to North Carolina, which Francis said is doubling down on gas.

The pipeline projects would each involve laying new pipe in sections of both states.

“The fossil fuel developers are fighting with each other on how to get into that market, and Virginia is really kind of a sacrificial lamb in the energy race to get to North Carolina,” said Francis of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters. “That’s what’s been going on with a lot of these pipeline projects.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/43/10/2e6630724a46b1344e67f6c5b388/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2242481038,N,,2025-11-17 07:59:17.595035

The announcement recharges the state’s electrical vehicle charging network project, supported by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program.
NEVI, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law signed by then-President Joe Biden, provides grants to states to build more charging stations.
Wisconsin’s plan calls for charging stations along 15 major interstate, U.S. and state highway corridors that cross the state.
“By expanding our network of charging stations, we hope to see that number continue to climb,” Beld said.","A program to expand electric vehicle charging stations in Wisconsin is getting a $14 million jolt with plans to build 26 more stations across the state.

Gov. Tony Evers and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation announced the expansion plan Monday.

The announcement recharges the state’s electrical vehicle charging network project, supported by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. NEVI, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law signed by then-President Joe Biden, provides grants to states to build more charging stations.

“Transportation is evolving, and departments of transportation and states have to adapt with that evolution,” said John DesRivieres, WisDOT’s communications director. “As the market and the number of folks who are driving electric vehicles grows, EV infrastructure is needed.”

NEVI funding paused after President Donald Trump took office, and Wisconsin was one of 15 states along with the District of Columbia to sue the Trump administration in May for cutting off money for the program. A federal judge blocked the administration in June from defunding NEVI, and the Wisconsin DOT subsequently restarted its program.

The $14 million in federal funds for Wisconsin’s new round of charging stations will go to projects in communities throughout the state, from Superior in the northwest to East Troy in the southeast. They include 11 locations at Kwik Trip service stations, six locations at hotels or resorts, six locations at other service station brands and a handful of other businesses.

“My administration and I have prioritized ensuring our state’s infrastructure meets the needs of the 21st Century since Day One because expanding our clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure helps create jobs and bolster our economy, and it’s good for our planet, too,” Evers said. “Thanks to our actions to get the Trump Administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve.”

The transportation department chose projects based on their location, their potential for future development, and the business site’s hours. Extended hours were given preference to accommodate longer refueling times, according to WisDOT.

Wisconsin’s plan calls for charging stations along 15 major interstate, U.S. and state highway corridors that cross the state. A WisDOT EV charging station dashboard shows the locations for all planned chargers in the state.

With the round of grants announced Monday, Wisconsin has invested a total of $36.4 million in federal funds for 78 projects.

The first round, announced in May 2024, invested $22.4 million to build 52 stations. Of those, 11 are operational, 16 have been authorized for construction and the rest are in pre-construction phases.

A federal tax credit for electric vehicles that was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act abruptly ended, effective Sept. 30, under the Republican tax-cut and spending mega-bill enacted in July.

“There are already 37,000 EVs on the road today, and we saw that number spike as people raced to purchase EVs before the federal tax credit expired,” said Alex Beld, communications director for Renew Wisconsin, a nonprofit that promotes policies and programs to expand solar, wind and hydropower along with building electrification, energy storage and electric vehicles.

“By expanding our network of charging stations, we hope to see that number continue to climb,” Beld said. “Through this transition away from gas-powered vehicles, we can reduce emissions and support our state’s economy.”

An analysis by SRI International published in 2023 for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. concluded that “there is a tremendous opportunity for Wisconsin to develop a globally competitive cluster centered on the manufacturing of EVs and EV-related equipment, which in turn can help revitalize Wisconsin’s automotive manufacturing industry and drive statewide economic development.”

Beld said that jobs related to clean energy grew four times faster than the rest of Wisconsin’s economy in 2024.

“If this funding had been clawed back permanently, I think we would have still seen progress,” Beld said. “It would have certainly been slower and would have likely cost the state jobs.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-99/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kwik-trip-charge-station-1024x5761763380160.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=QIbQc1yg,N,,2025-11-17 07:59:31.515851

Last week at the Crain’s “Powering Illinois’ Future” event in Chicago, I introduced a group of business and industry leaders to ComEd’s new Long-Range Strategy.
Currently, structural market issues are inhibiting power supply growth, causing it to fall well off the pace of demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing and increasing electrification.
ComEd’s Energy Efficiency programs, first launched in 2008, have produced $12 billion in customer savings.
But ComEd’s new long-range strategy, along with the statewide spirit of collaboration, fills me with optimism about the future of ComEd, our region and our state.","Projections of future power demand are rising faster than new power supply is coming online. That’s the mismatch driving up electricity prices for customers – and there needs to be a plan to tackle this and other energy challenges the future has in store.

Last week at the Crain’s “Powering Illinois’ Future” event in Chicago, I introduced a group of business and industry leaders to ComEd’s new Long-Range Strategy. I’d like to give readers a brief overview today.

First, some important context on affordability: While ComEd’s name is on the bills customers receive, our company is only responsible for the delivery of power to customers – not the supply. ComEd does not generate power. We do not profit from the increase in supply costs that has been the biggest driver of bill hikes.

Currently, structural market issues are inhibiting power supply growth, causing it to fall well off the pace of demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing and increasing electrification.

A regional transmission organization, PJM, manages the supply market in northern Illinois and a dozen states to the east. Unfortunately, PJM’s reforms have not come fast enough, and they have not gone far enough.

At ComEd, we’re pulling every lever within reach to keep prices from rising further:

We’ve introduced tariffs that would protect customers from bearing the cost burden of data centers and other large load projects if they fail to materialize.

We’ve helped customers install over 1,300 megawatts of solar across our territory, and we’ve interconnected over 5,000 megawatts of utility-scale wind power – new supply that helps balance the uptick in demand.

ComEd’s Energy Efficiency programs, first launched in 2008, have produced $12 billion in customer savings.

Since ComEd’s smart grid improvements in 2012, we’ve enhanced overall reliability by more than 57 percent, helping customers avoid nearly 24.7 million customer interruptions and save more than $4.3 billion in outage-related costs.

We’ve connected 140,000 of our most vulnerable customers to over $72 million in financial assistance, just in the first nine months of 2025 alone.

The new ComEd Long-Range Strategy will build on this record of success. It is designed around three P’s. The first is People.

We will expand and improve programs that allow ComEd customers to make simple, smart energy choices that deliver value and affordability, while positioning people in our communities to benefit from opportunities created by the global move toward a more electrified future.

The second “P” is for Power. It means ComEd will deepen its investments in modernizing the grid, creating a “digital twin” of the grid that gives us visibility and data insights that improve efficiency. The grid will be more AI-enabled, able to prevent more outages.

The grid is the oxygen of today’s modern economy, and it will only become more vital to the economy of tomorrow.

The third “P” is for Progress. This means advancing Illinois’ vision for clean energy investments that enable economic development. So ComEd will continue to support growth in electric vehicles and renewable energy; we will continue to train workers for careers in clean energy infrastructure; and all of this will help us deliver on state policy goals, including a grid with 100% clean energy.

The passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is a step forward for Illinois and is aligned with key aspects of ComEd’s new strategy, especially managing load growth and lowering costs for customers.

Of course, more work must be done, and more challenges are surely ahead. But ComEd’s new long-range strategy, along with the statewide spirit of collaboration, fills me with optimism about the future of ComEd, our region and our state.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/ComEd%20TLR%20hero%20first%20option.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:00:32.109599

Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president.
The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.
But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.
During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.","WASHINGTON (AP) — More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data — a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.

Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.

Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.

“There’s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they’re falling behind,” Margetta Morgan said.

Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.

These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living.

Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year’s midterm elections.

Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills — meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.

The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration’s reputation.

“In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems,”

Nearly 6 million households have utility debt “so severe” that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation’s analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel.

During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.

“Voters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it’s causing their power bills to go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, which contributed to the analysis. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that’s its choice.”

Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.

The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.

“Electricity prices are a state problem,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. “There are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.”

The Century Foundation analysis counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs “by impeding renewable energy generation” including solar and wind power.

While the new analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures.

The New York Federal Reserve has said delinquency rates of 90 days or more for mortgages, auto loans and student debt have each increased over the past 12 months, though it said mortgage delinquencies are “relatively low.” An analysis of debit and credit card spending by the Bank of America Institute showed that consumers’ “overall financial health looks sound.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/preview-1212.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:02:28.298083

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalysed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution centre in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centres in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment” added Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labour income.

This links environmental management performance with employee performance, encouraging deep participation in environmental protection actions across the company.
In 2024 alone, the company invested approximately 370 million RMB in environmental protection, achieving a record of zero environmental pollution incidents.
The Amazon is a key area for global biodiversity conservation.
This also confirms LONGi's solemn commitment to ""driving a just global energy transition through technological innovation.""","BELÉM, Brazil, November 15 – LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (""LONGi"") released its first Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) report during the 30th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This report, following the joint biodiversity protection initiative launched by LONGi and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2024, is the company's first TNFD report. It aims to systematically review the company's practices and management actions concerning nature-related issues throughout 2024.

In 2025, LONGi has become a TNFD Adopter. The report strictly adheres to the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) analytical framework recommended by the TNFD to identify, assess, and manage various nature-related risks and opportunities. It clearly states long-term goals to achieve ""Net Zero Loss"" of biodiversity and ""Zero Deforestation"" by 2050. This commitment reflects LONGi's high regard for biodiversity protection and climate action, aligning with global sustainable development trends. Through this pledge, LONGi demonstrates the responsibility and accountability of an industry leader, injecting Chinese strength into global ecosystem protection and climate action.

As early as the COP29 Conference in 2024, LONGi collaborated with the IUCN to jointly release the ""Initiative of Advancing Climate Action and Biodiversity Conservation with Photovoltaic."" This initiative called on more companies to formulate and implement climate and biodiversity protection measures based on international Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and global standards, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UNFCCC, and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). It advocated for adhering to global best practices to ensure all activities meet global climate and biodiversity requirements, adopting environmentally friendly methods in the design, construction, and operation of renewable energy projects, improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of clean energy, fostering a corporate culture of biodiversity protection, and promoting international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and dissemination of global best practices through partnerships.

LONGi has long engaged in capacity-building exchanges on biodiversity with the IUCN, benchmarking against leading international standards to effectively enhance the company's ability to integrate biodiversity conservation into its medium and long-term strategic planning. At the event, Li Zhenguo shared the story of how green photovoltaic power is improving the living conditions of indigenous people in the Amazon rainforest, showcasing LONGi's numerous practices and explorations in deeply integrating biodiversity protection into its core business. Furthermore, the company proposed a nature-positive pathway of ""Prevention First, Ecological Empowerment, and Collaborative Transformation,"" demonstrating a shift from ""impact mitigation"" to ""active contribution.""

Starting from COP15 Conference of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity held in Kunming, China, in 2021, LONGi has continuously focused on how photovoltaic technology can promote biodiversity conservation and has actively engaged in practical exploration. During COP28 Conference, LONGi announced its ""Zero-Carbon Life Plan for Pandas,"" which included donating a distributed photovoltaic power station to the Qinling Panda Foping Rescue and Breeding Research Center in China, permanently adopting a Qinling giant panda, and providing photovoltaic products and off-grid technology to support field monitoring equipment in the reserve. Earlier, in 2022, LONGi donated PV modules to the Aquila Wildlife Protection Base in South Africa, providing not only daily electricity for the reserve but also enabling a clean water supply for wildlife, offering more possibilities for the ecological management of Aquila.

In terms of corporate operations and management, LONGi has established the ""E20 Environmental Standardization Management Method,"" implementing a three-tier management model from the group level to individual bases. This links environmental management performance with employee performance, encouraging deep participation in environmental protection actions across the company. In 2024 alone, the company invested approximately 370 million RMB in environmental protection, achieving a record of zero environmental pollution incidents. At the operational level, it reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 37% year-on-year, decreased water consumption per unit by 24.8%, and achieved a harmless waste recycling rate of 82.7%.

The Amazon is a key area for global biodiversity conservation. However, in recent years, it has faced a series of serious threats such as deforestation, illegal mining, and land occupation. In 2024 November, LONGi, in partnership with a key customer and prestigious NGOs, installed 35 off grid intermittent energy systems in residential houses, schools, health stations, and community centers in Pykany village, located within the Kayapó Menkragnoti Indigenous Territory in Brazil, completely replacing the heavily polluting diesel generators, effectively reducing carbon emissions, and decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. The construction of renewable power systems has significantly reduced health hazards for tribal residents and greatly improved the quality of life for women and children. After getting rid of time-consuming and labor-intensive fuel collection work (such as firewood cutting and carrying), local women are able to make handicrafts at night and rest more during the day, forming a sustainable source of income. Male villagers have also reduced their hunting and fishing time due to the circulation of electricity, and have opened up new economic income generating projects. By reducing carbon emissions and minimizing energy-related disturbances to the rainforest ecosystem, the project supports both community development and environmental conservation, bringing green energy to foster biodiversity protection and sustainable development in the Amazon rainforest.

By bringing light and hope to the tribal communities with its high-efficiency photovoltaic technology and products, LONGi profoundly embodies the core SDG objectives of using clean energy as an engine to promote global health equity, economic empowerment, and ecological protection. This also confirms LONGi's solemn commitment to ""driving a just global energy transition through technological innovation."" The release of this report not only represents LONGi's latest progress in the field of sustainable development but also provides an important reference for how green energy can advance global biodiversity conservation and climate action.

Li Zhenguo stated that in the future, the company will systematically identify, assess, and manage nature-related risks and opportunities by strictly following the TNFD framework, exploring more actionable and cutting-edge practices for corporate biodiversity protection and sustainable development.

Independent power producer Terra-Gen has announced the commissioning of the Monte Cristo I wind farm in Hidalgo County, Texas. With an installed capacity of 238.5 megawatts (MW), the facility will generate over 850 gigawatt-hours annually, equivalent to the electricity consumption of 81,000 households. Two corporations have secured the site’s electricity output through long-term power purchase agreements.

A strategic location with local economic impact

This development marks Terra-Gen’s second wind project in Texas, following the Big Spring facility. The company’s total power generation capacity in the state now stands at 273 MW. Monte Cristo I is part of a growth strategy focused on high wind potential areas.

During the construction phase, approximately 280 jobs were created at peak activity. The works recorded over 490,000 hours without a lost-time incident, according to company data. The project also delivered upgrades to local infrastructure, including more than 11 miles of Texas Department of Transportation roads and 25 miles of county roads.

Financial returns for the region

Local authorities welcomed the project’s economic benefits. Monte Cristo I is expected to generate over $100mn during its operational life through property taxes, landowner payments, and local contributions. These financial flows will support public services and infrastructure development.

Terra-Gen, jointly owned by Masdar and Igneo Infrastructure Partners, is also planning a second phase for the Monte Cristo project, which has already received permitting. Development activities are ongoing, though no commissioning timeline has been announced.

In the rural parishes of Calcasieu, Cameron, and Vermillion, the so-called Southwest Coastal Louisiana Home Elevation Project allocates more than $400 million to raise the heights of residents’ homes by placing them on stilts or laying thicker foundations.

The cost of insurance in Louisiana is 44% higher than the national average because of the state’s high flood risk, according to a 2025 LendingTree analysis.","Louisiana’s land is disappearing for many reasons: rising sea levels, erosion, wetland degradation, and more frequent severe storms all contributed to a loss of more than 2,000 square miles of coastline between 1932 and 2015, according to estimates from the state’s government.

These risks are expected to increase over the next 25 years. A Climate Central analysis showed the likelihood of coastal flooding in the U.S. will increase tenfold by 2050, affecting an estimated 2.5 million people. Louisiana ranked fourth in the analysis’ list of states with the most people at risk, but tops the list for the amount of land it is expected to lose to flooding by 2050, at about 9,200 square miles.

Cities like New Orleans have built structural protections called levees to abate the land loss, but some flood-prone rural areas have been left to weather the coming storms without such protection.

A new home-elevation project led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is an attempt to change this — if they can get the rural communities on board.

In the rural parishes of Calcasieu, Cameron, and Vermillion, the so-called Southwest Coastal Louisiana Home Elevation Project allocates more than $400 million to raise the heights of residents’ homes by placing them on stilts or laying thicker foundations. About 3,900 properties have been identified in the three parishes to have a severe risk of flooding and could potentially qualify for the program.

The Corps broke ground on the first home in October of 2024, but since then community participation in the project has been much lower than anticipated — even though it comes at no cost to approved applicants.

To understand why this is, the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund conducted focus groups of residents from the three parishes. The reasons they found ranged from high levels of skepticism and distrust of the project to a history of abandonment by the state and federal governments during past hurricane seasons.

In 2020, after Hurricane Laura made landfall in southwestern Louisiana on top of Cameron Parish, some communities in the region had to wait a year or longer to receive disaster aid. Many homes required significant repairs, making people less willing to go through yet another construction project.

“A good amount of these residents expressed that they have had really bad experiences with contractors that have come and done work on their homes,” said Allie Olsonoski, project manager of climate resilient coasts and watersheds for the Environmental Defense Fund.

Olsonoksi was at the focus groups as they happened and wrote a report on the key takeaways. Among them, she found that homeowners want assurance that they won’t be held liable if something goes wrong with the construction.

“There is a level of distrust of government intervention in the first place,” Olsonoski said. “‘Mr. Federal Government’ coming in and changing communities, people are weary of that.”

There were also questions about how the project could affect participants’ homeowners insurance. The cost of insurance in Louisiana is 44% higher than the national average because of the state’s high flood risk, according to a 2025 LendingTree analysis.

While the project does not require applicants to have flood insurance, some residents have wondered if their participation in the program could help lower their flood insurance premiums. But there are also questions about how their homeowners insurance could be affected by factors like wind if their homes are higher in the air.

So far, no one involved in the project’s rollout is comfortable answering these questions, according to Olsonoski.

“There are just question marks around that that no one is able to answer at this moment in time, but hopefully as homes are elevated, that becomes illuminated,” she said.

Even with the concerns people had, Olsonoski said there was still hope from many of the residents about the project’s potential to help them “adapt in place” to a changing climate.

“If there is an opportunity for them to make their homes safer into the future so that they may be passed down to their kids and grandchildren, like those homes were passed down to them, that’s a really, really important and exciting opportunity,” she said.

“This [project] allows them to be in the same spot down the block from their neighbors, their friends, their family.” More information about the project and how to apply can be found here.

There’s an old climate joke that goes, “You may not believe in climate change, but your insurance company does.” If you’re in the market for new environmental humor — and really, who isn’t? — you can now update this to say, “You may not believe in climate change, but the stock market does.”

For much of this year, the S&P Global Clean Energy Index has outpaced the S&P 500 Index, the Nasdaq 100 Index and the MSCI World Index, Bloomberg News noted recently as part of a report about Jefferies analysts unexpectedly declaring these the “glory days” for green tech.

Anyone who’s been following the news would be forgiven for assuming these are not salad days for clean energy. Dog-food days, more like it. Whatever-this-is days. The White House and an eager Congress have shredded environmental regulations and cleantech subsidies, thrown up roadblocks to new wind and solar projects and generally tried to make life as comfortable as possible for the fossil-fuel industry currently running the government and as uncomfortable as possible for that industry’s upstart rivals.

And yet! Those same clean-energy sources that have been banished to America’s political wilderness are also in hot demand at home and around the world, thanks in part to President Donald Trump’s determination to put energy-hungry AI everywhere all at once.

As Bloomberg News notes, many of the stocks leading the boom in the S&P clean-energy index also have ties to the boom in AI. In other words, this may not be entirely a bet on a net-zero future but partly people seeing a gold rush and buying shovel makers. If the robot-industrial complex is a bubble just waiting to pop, then green tech’s lofty roost could be precarious.

Then again, both the S&P and the Nasdaq 100 also look like AI-rich souffles these days, making cleantech’s outperformance all the more notable. While the use case for AI is still in flux — will it save humanity or just stupefy it with slop? — the need for reliable energy has been clear for centuries.

And other stocks related to climate change are also beating the broader market. Bloomberg’s Prepare and Repair Index, made up of companies that benefit from the rise in expensive climate-fueled disasters, has absolutely trounced the S&P over the past five years, more than doubling its return, Bloomberg Green noted recently. These are almost the opposite of AI stocks: stuff like hardware stores, insurers and waste managers.

The clean-energy and prepare-repair indexes represent two sides of the climate-change coin: mitigation and adaptation. Though billionaire Bill Gates has somewhat fatalistically suggested the world lean into the latter, he is also still investing money in the former. His Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of a group of more than a dozen venture capitalists, called the All Aboard Coalition, trying to raise $300 million to invest in clean tech. Investors pumped $56 billion into such companies in the first three quarters of 2025, more than in all of 2024, according to BloombergNEF.

For every dollar lost to climate disasters last year, $1.47 was invested in the energy transition that will help prevent future damage, according to BNEF. Two decades ago, just 12 cents were spent for each dollar lost to climate disasters.

Total global investment in the energy transition from planet-heating fossil fuels hit $2.1 trillion last year, according to BNEF, a record that could be broken this year. Investments in wind, solar and other renewable-energy sources alone hit a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, with a 36 percent pullback in the U.S. from the second half of 2024 more than offset by a 63 percent jump in Europe.

Mainland China, meanwhile, has accounted for half of the world’s investment in renewables so far this year. As much as Trump crows about energy dominance, his crusade against wind and solar is ceding global energy dominance to China, and geopolitical influence along with it. While Gates muses about raising living standards in developing Africa with AI-enabled phones and GMO seeds, China is already doing it with inexpensive solar panels.

It behooves me to point out that coal-mining stocks have also boomed in the past five years. For all its green spending, China still relies too much on coal and shows no sign of losing its appetite. But the costs of running coal power plants keep rising, while solar and wind get cheaper.

Little wonder that, for the first time ever, renewables generated more of the world’s electricity than coal in the first half of 2025, according to the think tank Ember. If climate concerns aren’t enough to kill coal in the long run, then economics will.

Niall Smith, a quantitative researcher at Bloomberg, recently split some risk-premium atoms and discovered that companies with higher climate exposure also had higher capital costs. This may not be as splashy as the index charts above, but it’s still more evidence that, for all the climate-change denialism in our discourse these days, markets are still grounded in reality.

The move comes as the company plans to reduce reliance on components produced in China amid deteriorating US–China ties.

According to sources, Tesla decided earlier this year to stop using China-based suppliers for US-assembled cars.

Some China-made parts have already been replaced with components manufactured in other countries, and Tesla plans to move remaining components off China-origin supply within the next two years, the sources said.

The shift follows disruptions that began with the Covid-19 pandemic, which exposed vulnerabilities in parts flows from China.

Several China-based suppliers were prompted to relocate production to other countries, including Mexico.

The approach picked up pace this year after US President Donald Trump imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, increasing uncertainty.

Recent geopolitical frictions have further complicated access to certain items.

In particular, tensions between China and the Netherlands led to fresh disruptions in chip supplies, and earlier in the year China imposed export restrictions on some rare earths and magnets used in vehicles.

Tesla’s global production footprint is split.

Vehicles for the US market are built at its US factories using local supply chains, while cars produced at its Shanghai plant rely primarily on locally made parts.

Shanghai-manufactured cars are shipped within China and to markets in Asia and Europe, except the US.

Many Chinese vendors have supplied parts to Tesla assembly plants beyond China.

The Shanghai factory alone worked with roughly 400 direct Chinese suppliers, over 60 of which provided components for Tesla’s global production.

Known substitution challenges remain. Lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) have been an important input.

Tesla sold US vehicles with Chinese-produced LFP batteries until last year, but those batteries are no longer qualified for specific EV tax credits and were subject to US tariffs, prompting the company to stop using them in US cars.

Tesla is pursuing domestic LFP production for its energy-storage business and has said it anticipates a Nevada facility to begin making such battery products in the first quarter of 2026.

In April, Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said that the company is working to produce LFP cells in the US and to secure additional suppliers outside China, while acknowledging the transition “will take time.”",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/11/JA-shutterstock_2608036743.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 06:59:24.109962

This investment is one of the company’s largest state-level investment commitments to date. The investment highlights Google’s long-term confidence in Texas as a major hub for technology, clean energy, and data infrastructure.

Google’s CEO said that Google has proudly considered Texas a home for more than 15 years. This new expansion shows how important the state has become in Google’s broader strategy, especially as demand for artificial intelligence and cloud services continues to surge worldwide.

New Data Centers Across the State:

A major portion of the investment from Google will going towards building three new data center campuses. These new facilities will power Google’s growing AI operations, store enormous amounts of data, and handle advanced computing tasks.

The new campuses will be spread across different Texas counties and are expected to play a key role in building the next generation of AI applications. With AI models becoming larger and more complex, Google says adding new data centers is essential to ensuring reliable and fast services for users across the U.S.

Focus on Clean Energy and Local Workforce:

Google’s investment in Texas will not limited to technology infrastructure. The company is also committing funds toward clean energy projects and skills development programs within Texas.

Moreover, a major part of the investment plan includes support for new solar and battery storage initiatives to help power the data centers sustainably. This move shows Google’s broader goal of operating all of its facilities on clean energy in the coming years.

Google is also partnering with training organizations to support the development of more electricians and technical workers in Texas. By 2030, Google aims to help train more than a thousand electrical apprentices, strengthening the local workforce and preparing it for jobs in the fast-growing tech energy sector.

Why Texas?

Texas has emerged as a preferred destination for major tech companies not only Google in recent times. This is because of its large land availability, strong energy resources, and business-friendly environment. The state’s rapid growth in technology and clean energy makes it an ideal location for companies investing in next-generation infrastructure.

A Step Toward America’s AI Future:

Google’s 40 billion dollar plan shows how critical Texas will be in shaping the future of cloud computing and artificial intelligence in the United States.

After decades of stagnant consumption, U.S. energy demand is accelerating, and wind and solar continue to outperform gas and coal on cost. However, ideal land for solar installations often overlaps with active farmland, creating land-use challenges in many rural regions.

Agrivoltaics Offers Dual Benefits

Agrivoltaics, the dual-use model that pairs solar generation with active farming on the same land, presents a solution that benefits multiple stakeholders:

-Landowners gain predictable revenue while keeping farmland productive.

-Developers secure viable solar sites with fewer permitting conflicts.

-Communities retain agricultural activity while benefiting from tax revenue and local investment.

“Agrivoltaics demonstrates that agricultural production and solar development can be complementary rather than competing options for land use,” said Asher Salkin, former research intern at IEEFA and author of the report. “Our research shows that using agrivoltaics in agricultural settings increases crop yields in water-stressed regions, which not only lowers operating costs but also improves soil and ecosystem health.”

Market Growth and Potential

Although still emerging, agrivoltaics deployment in the U.S. has expanded significantly. Installed capacity has grown from 4.5 GW across 27,000 acres in 2020 to 10 GW across more than 62,000 acres in 2024, enough to power 1.5 million homes.

IEEFA notes that with the right policy support, agrivoltaics could:

-Aid small and midsize farmers

-Help meet rising national electricity demand

-Broaden rural participation in the clean energy transition

With U.S. power needs increasing and the economics of renewables remaining strong, agrivoltaics offers a path that aligns agricultural productivity with clean energy expansion.

“Large-scale battery energy storage has emerged as the most immediate … solution to enable AI factory deployment.”","RIDGEVILLE — A Lowcountry recycling plant described as South Carolina's single-largest economic development deal is powering up.

Redwoods Materials announced that an undisclosed number of workers have started extracting cobalt, copper, nickel and other critical minerals from discarded lithium-ion batteries at its 600-acre tract near the Volvo Cars factory in lower Berkeley County.

""This is a small but significant start toward what will become one of the world’s largest recovery, refining, and manufacturing campuses,"" the Nevada-based company said in a written statement.

Redwood plans to invest $3.5 billion and eventually create 1,500 jobs at its emerging Ridgeville site. It broke ground in early 2024, stating at the time that it ""will continue building and expanding the campus over the next decade.""

The company's overarching goal is to displace China as the go-to domestic supplier of minerals and materials the U.S. companies need to build electric vehicles and other products.

Redwood said it took in about 90 percent of all lithium-ion batteries processed in North America at its Nevada location last year, yielding more than 60,000 metric tons of reusable metals.

The East Coast operation in Camp Hall Commerce Park is expected to increase that figure by about a third.

The new plant originally was set to make anode copper foil. one of the main components in a battery cell, but Redwood has scuttled the idea, according to a Nov. 6 report by Bloomberg News.

The privately held company was launched in 2017 by JB Straubel, a Tesla co-founder and its former chief technology officer.

He's struck partnership deals with some of the biggest names in the automotive and battery businesses, including Ford Motor Co., Toyota and Panasonic.

Straubel and Redwood have been pivoting this year by seeking customers beyond the EV industry for its recycled minerals. The change is tied to the slowdown in sales, which accelerated after the Trump administration stopped offering federal tax credits to electric-vehicle buyers in September.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel told Bloomberg.

The defense industry is one likely key customer, along with data-center builders and electric utilities.

""The same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure,"" Redwood said in its statement last week. ""Nickel and cobalt are also essential for aerospace and defense alloys, while copper forms the backbone of industrial wiring and power transmission.""

At the same time, Redwood is extending its reach into the large-scale energy-storage field as the artificial-intelligence craze and a proliferation of power-hungry server farms test U.S. electric grids. It recently raised $350 million to grow the new business from backers that include AI chip-making titan Nvidia.

Ever since he moved to the city, he’s noticed an oddly large presence of a plant that is thousands of miles away from its native, tropical home — bamboo.

“There's a large thicket within walking distance of where I live. And then I've also noticed that in people's backyards, especially in the older neighborhoods, they have bamboo,"" Salim said. ""I go to somebody's house, go out back and there's a bunch of bamboo. So the question is, why is there so much bamboo in High Point?”

For this edition of Carolina Curious, WFDD’s Amy Diaz spoke with Margaret Fields, with the North Carolina chapter of the Nature Conservancy, to find the answer.

Landscaping trends

It makes sense that Salim is bewildered by the amount of bamboo in High Point. The plant is mostly native to Asia, so how did it get all the way to North Carolina?

Fields says bamboo was introduced to the United States over a long period of time, largely for commercial and decorative purposes. And it’s actually found all over the country.

“In the 20th century, there got to be a lot more plants being imported for use in people's landscaping. I had a bamboo ... in my yard that was planted there in the '50s,"" Fields said. ""So I feel like there are eras where it's in style to plant something. Like in the 80s, planting Bradford Pears and then figuring out over time, ‘This is a tree that doesn't last. And it also seeds out into the woods.' You can see in landscaping, kind of trends like that. And I think of bamboo as a '50s trend.”

That might explain why Salim notices so much bamboo in the historic neighborhoods. But bamboo doesn’t just stay where it’s planted. Fields says it's an invasive species, and spreads incredibly quickly.

Invasive species

“If they're not in a container, they will send out runners, send out rhizomes, and they can grow and spread 15 feet a year if we have a rainy summer,"" Fields said. ""And so people will plant these as a screen between them and their neighbor or them and the busy road, and if they don't put in a root barrier that goes down at least 18 inches, then the bamboo will just keep spreading.”

It also outcompetes the other native plants, which displaces them. And once it starts spreading, Fields says it’s really hard to stop.

“You have to basically devote a lot of resources to cutting it down, getting it to a mowable stage, where you can mow it and you can treat it with chemical but you mainly need to starve it of that sunlight,"" Fields said. ""And so it eventually will die, but that is years of managing it and chopping it and mowing it. It is doable. But it takes a commitment beyond just getting a landscaping crew to go out once and chop it down.”

Finding a native alternative

Fields deals with invasive species issues as part of her job with The Nature Conservancy. She’s also on the board of the North Carolina Invasive Plant Council.

She says people should research the plants they’re interested in buying before sticking them in the ground and potentially making an invasive species problem worse.

“You know, we've got the legacy of things like English ivy and things that are still sold in nurseries, and now we have them in the woods,"" Fields said. ""So it's good to educate yourself about what you want in the yard and seek out knowledgeable folks to get the plants from.”

But if you like the look of bamboo, Fields says there’s a native option. It's called giant cane, or river cane.

Peter Aldhous contributed data analysis for this story.

For 15 years, Debrah Linn and her children have raised chickens, miniature donkeys, pet geese, and, more recently, longhorn cattle on what she’d considered an idyllic and peaceful farmette near the village of Elysian Fields.

Her kids ride horses on their shady lane, a 4.3-mile-long country road that undulates through woods filled with standing water that feeds Sacogee Creek and, in summer, waving blossoms of Black-eyed Susans.

A few doors down, Bonnie and Robert Arbuckle, a couple from Shreveport, Louisiana, have kept busy over the last year roughing out their own do-it-yourself retirement dream house on pastureland with a pond stocked with catfish and bass. Waskom-Elysian Fields Road in Harrison County, deep in Northeast Texas, is so quiet that it’s long been used for training by cross-country runners from the high school near its point of origin.

So it attracted curiosity—and concern—when what initially seemed like an oversize pond grew into an enormous wall of dirt on a patch of wetlands across from the Arbuckles’ place. Unbeknownst to them and other locals, the Texas Railroad Commission had already issued a permit to allow the largest oil and gas waste disposal site in the region to be erected on their country road.

Soon, the Arbuckles could see mounds rising and hear the roars of a fleet of dump trucks, cranes, and other heavy construction equipment on that previously undeveloped acreage. And when Bonnie, a U.S. Army vet who knows a thing or two about excavation, introduced herself to the acting site supervisor, she got no answers. “He was friendly and came over,” she recalled. “But then when we started asking questions about what the operation was, it was just closed lips.”

The developer of this massive oilfield waste disposal site sent notices only to adjacent landowners—mostly unoccupied land with absentee owners, including the Texas General Land Office. A legal ad in a nearby small newspaper offered no details and didn’t mention Elysian Fields. These were the only notices required by the Railroad Commission, the state agency that regulates Texas’ oil and gas activities, including its toxic waste disposal.

Linn and others learned of the project only after the fact when Harrison County Judge Chad Sims, an Elysian Fields native, gathered locals at the village’s volunteer fire department in January.

Records show that a company called M2T, LLC., with a mailing address in faraway Montana, had initially applied for a Railroad Commission permit in January 2022 to handle what is described as “nonhazardous” oil and gas wastes on the 187-acre site. It had been approved in 2023 with no hearing and no local comments.

But Sims told residents who gathered inside the village fire department that he had recently learned that the out-of-state developer was tied to a Longview, Texas, company called McBride Operating LLC, which had already drawn scrutiny and complaints over its existing waste-handling operations in the nearby town of Waskom. Residents were shocked to learn from Sims that the Railroad Commission had, before anyone knew enough to formally protest, already approved this large new waste site on the same Waskom-Elysian Fields road where Sims’ daughter and other high school cross-country runners regularly practiced.

In 2019, McBride Operating had obtained a five-year permit from the Railroad Commission to operate the waste-handling center in Waskom, on an industrial site on the frontage road along Interstate 20, about 5 miles north of the Elysian Fields construction site. McBride Operating’s permit for Waskom expired in mid-2024. The commission staff then declined to renew it this February—a rare action by the pro-business agency. The denial came, records show, after the company had ignored instructions by agency employees and committed dozens of violations of state rules, including unauthorized construction and expansion, unauthorized waste disposal, and evidence of ongoing groundwater contamination.

McBride Operating never stopped running the Waskom site, even after the commission pulled its permit in February. It was able to do so because the company appealed.

Earlier this year, Linn began regularly driving her trusty Suburban SUV by the existing McBride waste site in Waskom to survey what might be coming to Elysian Fields. She worried even more about the excavation on her road after hearing Waskom residents complain that they could smell the operation from as far as 2 miles away. “Now the people that live closer, they have been complaining of headaches, nausea, things like that,” she said during one recent visit. “So that’s what my big worry is because my daughter has asthma and she struggles a lot with that. And I don’t want to be run out of my home by someone who doesn’t … play by the rules.”

Some complained about the odors to the Railroad Commission. McBride’s operations manager, Carrie Dowden, admitted as part of a deposition in a lawsuit filed by an employee who was overcome by chemical fumes that the company “can’t control the smell.” In a response to this report, a company spokesperson noted that McBride has never been fined for odors and that other businesses contribute to smells in the town.

Even as McBride Operating negotiated to stay open in Waskom, and pursued its options in Elysian Fields, the company had been simultaneously fighting other local opponents to secure a permit for another oilfield waste landfill 50 miles south near the town of Paxton, on a proposed site near wells that supply public drinking water.

But the massive Elysian Fields project would be McBride’s largest yet.

Linn soon found herself joining a growing and eclectic group of East Texans—including folks who consider themselves pro-oil and gas—who banded together to fight McBride’s expansions in Elysian Fields and Paxton and its efforts to continue in Waskom. Her allies included local teachers, a pastor who doubles as a rural water official, and a pair of ranchers.

Cattleman Terry Allen was fighting a court battle to halt McBride’s plans for Paxton. In Waskom, an octogenarian rancher named Jerry Cargill was pursuing all legal avenues to get McBride shut down. Both men traveled back and forth to Austin to appeal to the Railroad Commission, state legislators, and anyone who might listen.

Linn, tied down by family obligations and the need to tend farm animals, got on her computer and used her considerable research skills to dig—discovering quickly that McBride had racked up many more violations than other active oil and gas waste pit operators in East Texas. She wondered why there were so many waste pits in her area, right along the Louisiana state line.

Everyone worried that the litany of violations at Waskom, a site that had previously been an industrial area, would be repeated on pristine flood-prone acreage in Paxton and Elysian Fields. But their concerns gained little traction with decision-makers in Austin, and some were shocked when the only elected Railroad Commissioner from East Texas, Wayne Christian, who’d initially seemed friendly to their arguments, began advocating for McBride.

Christian defended McBride, stating that more waste disposal capacity was urgently needed in Northeast Texas, part of the Haynesville-Bossier Shale, which runs into northwest Louisiana. It follows the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and the Permian Basin in West Texas as the third-most-productive natural gas basin in the country.

But Linn and others swear they spotted many trucks with Louisiana plates unloading fracking waste at McBride’s facility—and fear their rural communities were becoming dumping grounds for the neighboring state. Linn figured it was no coincidence that two new proposed pits in Paxton and Elysian Fields were only minutes from the state line. “If we didn’t have the Louisiana business, would these [facilities] even be here?” Linn said. “I don’t think they would.”

Oil and gas wells produce prodigious amounts of waste. One horizontal well generates upwards of 8,000 barrels—or 336,000 gallons—of waste during the drilling and completion process, according to the Texas company Milestone Environmental. As oil and gas production soared to record highs in Texas, the industry needed more capacity to dispose of all the waste. Disposal wells and landfills opened and expanded from the Permian Basin to the Haynesville Shale.

As of August 2025, there were 86 commercial surface waste disposal facilities permitted by the Railroad Commission. Six of those are in the agency’s East Texas District 6, headquartered in Henderson. Some facilities, like the one in Waskom, separate solid and liquid waste. Much of the liquid waste is injected underground in disposal wells. The solid waste, which includes drill cuttings and muds, is permanently buried in pits or commercial landfills.

That waste can contain benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and other harmful constituents. But industry lobbyists succeeded in classifying this waste as nonhazardous under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

McBride’s Waskom facility currently separates and sends solid waste to an industrial landfill in Mount Pleasant. The liquid waste is injected into a disposal well on-site. The McBride landfills planned for Paxton and Elysian Fields could accept the waste that is currently sent to Mount Pleasant.

By the time Linn and others first learned about the company’s permitted plans for Elysian Fields in early 2025, Cargill had already been fighting McBride’s Waskom facility in the Railroad Commission’s administrative law courts for years.

Cargill, 82, grew up 20 miles away in Marshall, the county seat, while making frequent visits to the ranch his grandparents owned outside Waskom. In the 1980s, he bought out his relatives to become the sole owner of the 600-plus-acre property. After retiring from a long career in beverage sales, Cargill now lives on the ranch. He took notice of McBride soon after the site in Waskom opened, in 2020.

Cargill watched with concern as heavy trucks barreled down the highway to McBride, where they loaded and unloaded wastewater and solids. Cargill had flown drones over the site and observed how heavy rainfall would wash runoff from the waste stored on-site toward his property. He worried that two nearby creeks—Big Sis and Little Sis—could become conduits for pollution to reach his land. Cargill declined to be interviewed for this story but made his sentiments clear in statements to the commission and in documents filed by his attorneys.

For years, McBride accumulated violations during Railroad Commission inspections. Regulators issued 68 violations during the company’s first five years of operations in Waskom (2020 through 2024). Many violations were for disposal of solid oil and gas waste in pits that McBride built but were not authorized in its permit, and failure to comply with the permit. The facility was also added to the commission’s Operator Cleanup Program, which manages complex environmental remediation cases, after groundwater contamination was found on-site. Inspection reports found leaking tanks of produced water and waste piled on the ground outside the pits.

Despite dozens of violations, the Railroad Commission fined McBride only once in this five-year period: a $668 penalty issued in November 2024 for a spill that occurred in 2023. Inspectors found that the spill of extremely salty produced water had traveled more than 300 feet in the direction of a creek.

Company spokesperson Charlie Rose said that many of these violations of “unpermitted” disposal fell under a “catchall” category in the Railroad Commission rules that “includes any violation of a permit provision under which a commercial waste management facility operates.

“Of the referenced violations, all but one were resolved immediately upon reinspection. The single exception occurred during our first year of operation and involved a spill incident that required follow-up,” Rose said. “In every case, we responded promptly and effectively.”

Railroad Commission spokesperson Bryce Dubee said that McBride, like other operators, is given an opportunity to address violations before it is referred to legal enforcement.

Meanwhile, other government regulators were uncovering problems at McBride.

On the night of February 6, 2024, Pedro Julian Garcia died in a workplace accident at McBride’s Waskom site. Garcia, a 26-year-old father of two, was fixing a leaking pump when the valve blew off, fatally striking him in the chest. McBride had no written procedures for repairing hazardous electrical equipment, like the pump, and its employees had no training to perform such tasks, according to an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation.

OSHA, the federal agency that enforces workplace safety laws, had never previously inspected the McBride site. It ultimately fined the company $32,264 for 12 violations. McBride later settled a lawsuit with Garcia’s family.

A lawsuit filed by Jaire Jackson, a worker injured in 2021 while cleaning one of McBride’s tanks, uncovered other issues at the site. In a 2022 deposition, Dowden, the operations manager, said that she’d previously worked as a bartender and had no prior oilfield experience when she was hired as a supervisor. She described her office as a “mess,” said workers were not provided with protective gear, and claimed she did not know if there was any operating manual for the site.

Rose said that the company’s safety program has been expanded in recent years and that every employee undergoes extensive training.

Cargill formally protested McBride’s permit renewal when the application was filed in 2024. Evidence to support the protest would come later. First, the Railroad Commission would have to determine whether Cargill had legal standing to protest the permit. If he was found to have standing, a full hearing would be scheduled before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge.

In February 2025, Cargill filed a separate complaint with the Railroad Commission, asking for a hearing in which McBride would have to show why its permit should be renewed and not canceled. The complaint filing contended that McBride had consistently violated statewide rules for oil and gas waste, that groundwater had been contaminated at the site, and that contamination had not been remediated.

“Mr. Cargill’s claims are part of a seemingly coordinated effort that has now expanded to the media,” Rose said when asked about those complaints.

Cargill was not the only party to protest renewal when McBride’s first five-year permit was set to expire, on July 30, 2024. Other local landowners and the City of Waskom filed their own protests too. In February 2025, it seemed as though they’d won a victory: A letter from the commission’s technical permitting division laid out numerous ways McBride had violated the terms of its first permit, denied the permit renewal, and ordered the facility to shut down.

“Commission staff has attempted to work with the operator to address these concerns,” Railroad Commission engineer Alisa Patterson wrote. “However, after several meetings and a series of request[s] for additional data (RAD) letters, staff concludes that the amendment and renewal permit application cannot be approved.”

Cargill, still building his case against McBride, thought his concerns were finally being heard.

But McBride’s attorney, John Hicks, appealed the permit rejection, which, under commission rules, allowed McBride to continue its operations while the appeals process proceeded. During a June visit, its truckers’ lounge and loading docks were bustling with activity, as rumbling trucks came and went from the stretch of Interstate 20 that leads to Louisiana, only a few minutes east of the site.

Both sides prepared for a July 31 prehearing before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge to hear the merits of Cargill’s permit protest and complaint. Cargill’s lawyers would argue why he should be granted standing to protest the permit renewal. Hicks would argue why the facility should stay open and why Cargill was undeserving of standing in the administrative court.

Then, less than 24 hours before the prehearing was set to begin, a Railroad Commission lawyer notified the legal teams that the agency had settled with McBride. The two-paragraph notice retracted the denial and gave McBride 90 days to submit engineering plans to resolve the outstanding problems and continue operating.

Nonetheless, the legal teams arrived at the Railroad Commission hearing room in Austin the next morning. Attorneys George Neale and Charles Zhang, representing Cargill, argued that McBride had already been given more than enough time to resolve the numerous rule violations. They pointed out that after the site was added to the Railroad Commission’s cleanup program in 2021, it took McBride four years to submit a cleanup plan.

“[McBride] is one of, if not the worst, operators in the state of Texas,” Zhang said. “They’ve had four years of second chances.”

But Hicks argued that Cargill’s complaints were “entirely inappropriate” and circumvented the Railroad Commission’s existing protocols.

Cargill watched the proceedings with anxious attentiveness, nervously clicking a pen. He took the stand after lunch and implored the Railroad Commission to rein in McBride, saying he felt a duty to report the violations he had observed. He told the judge that he thought Joseph McBride, the Longview entrepreneur who formed McBride Operating in 2013, was “stalling because he wants to open his next landfill,” echoing a theory posited by other East Texans.

“This isn’t the way to run a business. … They’re playing games with our environment,” Cargill said. “If someone does something wrong, why would you give him five years to fix that?”

Given that the Railroad Commission had reached a settlement the day before, Cargill knew the agency would reconsider the permit application and the progress he had achieved could slip away. He had driven five hours from his ranch to Austin. On the way home, he would stop at a Dallas doctor’s office for a heart checkup.

His lawyers withdrew the complaint asking for a “show cause” hearing in September. At that time, the administrative law judge had not yet ruled on whether Cargill would be given standing to protest the permit renewal.

In September, Rose said the company had already submitted “preliminary proposals” as part of the settlement and is “working through finalizing the detailed engineering documents.” He said the company cannot disclose the specifics but is “committed to full transparency and compliance.”

In an email, Dubee, the Railroad Commission spokesperson, said that if agency staff is not “satisfied these remedies will be implemented,” the matter can be denied and the permit sent back again for another hearing.

Cargill and Linn both fretted that McBride was simply using lawyers to buy time until the Elysian Fields facility could open. The Railroad Commission staff had already found McBride’s stormwater plans in Waskom to be insufficient to protect ground and surface water. In the low-lying Elysian Fields construction site, Linn foresaw worse problems. The construction site, part of the headwaters of Sacogee Creek, was full of standing water when a local television crew went out to film in January. Residents worry that once the pits are filled with heaping piles of chemical-laden waste, runoff or flooding could contaminate local waterways.

In responses for this story, Rose said the company has designed a stormwater system for the site’s specific terrain that includes elevated containment and retention features that would prevent water from the site from reaching nearby estuaries.

Environmental advocates point to how pollution from oilfield waste landfills in areas like Western Pennsylvania have fouled local creeks and raised health concerns among residents. “When you dispose of drill cuttings in a landfill and it rains, it’s going to take all of the contaminants and soak through the whole landfill like a tea,” said Matt Kelso, of the nonprofit organization FracTracker Alliance, based in Pennsylvania.

The Paxton, Elysian Fields, and Waskom sites are all in low-lying areas minutes from the Louisiana state line. Though East Texas produces plenty of its own oil and gas waste, records show that many of the pits in the region have been profiting by accepting chemicals, mud, and other byproducts from Louisiana oil and gas operators.

Louisiana does not have any solid oilfield waste disposal facilities in the Haynesville-Bossier Shale, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Louisiana also has stronger regulations for injection wells that accept liquid waste from oil and gas fields. Louisiana requires that the waste be tested and logs recorded for injection well sites. In Texas, oilfield waste sites must certify only that they do not accept waste containing naturally occurring radioactive material, which can be present in some fracking waste. (Additional testing is required only for substances not exempted from federal hazardous waste rules.)

The Texas Railroad Commission itself does not track what proportion of waste comes from out of state. For this story, Inside Climate News analyzed quarterly reports made to the Railroad Commission by five waste facilities in East Texas between 2022 and 2024. Three reported accepting waste from Louisiana. Charles Holston, Inc., in Center, Texas, reported that three-quarters of the waste it accepted came from Louisiana. More than half the waste processed at the Top Cat Truck Wash in Panola County came from Louisiana. Across the state, in the Permian Basin, waste sites are known to accept drilling waste from neighboring New Mexico.

McBride’s quarterly reports from that period indicate waste arriving at the Waskom facility came from Texas. But Rose noted that those reports do not include liquid waste directly injected into two wells there. He said that both the Waskom and Elysian Fields facilities can accept waste from any operator that meets Texas regulations, including Louisiana sites.

“New Mexico and Louisiana have recognized the danger of this waste,” said Terry Allen, the cattleman who’s fighting another McBride project in the town of Paxton. “They’re making Texas the dumping ground.”

For more than four years, McBride’s proposal to build yet another waste pit 50 miles south of Waskom near the village of Paxton was blocked—temporarily at least—by the Railroad Commission. Two different administrative law judges ruled that the application should be denied in part because of evidence provided by Allen and by a rural water company that the site could compromise wells only 1,200 feet away that provide a significant amount of the county’s water supply.

“This is our aquifer. This is where we get our drinking water from,” said Eric Garrett, who runs Paxton Water. For him, the risks of even a tiny bit of poison seeping into those wells was too high.

But ultimately, the final decision would go to a vote by the three railroad commissioners, who are all elected Republicans. Paxton community members hoped that Christian, a former state representative from Center, would listen to the concerns of his Shelby County neighbors and oppose the permit.

When the vote came in January 2025, Commissioner Jim Wright, who owns oilfield waste companies, and Commissioner Christian voted to issue the permit. They overruled Commissioner Christi Craddick, the sole vote in opposition. All three commissioners have accepted campaign contributions. From 2020 to 2025, McBride and McBride Operating contributed more than $90,000 to the three commissioners, including recent contributions to Craddick’s campaign for state comptroller. At the same time, the company plowed between $336,000 and $778,000 into lobbying, records show.

In an emailed statement, Wright said that feedback received through the hearings resulted in additional safeguards to address local residents’ concerns. He also said there is a “significant lack” of permitted oilfield waste disposal in East Texas.

In a statement for this story, Christian said the project would bring “real paychecks, tax revenue for our schools and roads, and a chance to bring life back to communities that have been left behind.

“Rural Texas has been losing jobs and families for decades, and we can’t afford to turn away investment,” he added.

Christian previously wrote a letter to the Light and Champion newspaper in Center to explain his vote. “The idea that this project could have simply been blocked because it is in my local county is a misunderstanding of the law,” he wrote. “If a company meets the legal requirements, we cannot arbitrarily deny a permit.”

He also claimed that opposition to the permit was pushed by outside groups with “radical, anti-energy policies.” Much of the opposition “around this permit hasn’t come from landowners—it’s been manufactured by professional activist groups from outside our region,” he wrote.

Garrett, of Paxton Water, had a different view. “What is totally baffling to me is that despite the recommendations of their own people, Commissioner Wright and Commissioner Christian felt like they knew better than their own staff,” he told the Observer. “How do you explain that?”

Linn wrote her own letter to the paper. She argued that the only outside interests involved were the Louisiana oil and gas companies that would get to dump their waste in Texas. “The protection of our water is non-negotiable and not a partisan issue,” she wrote. “Why are Texas taxpayers liable for other states’ toxic waste?”

Allen is relieved that, for now, McBride has not started construction in his town, but he has continued to fight the company on other fronts.

It’s possible that all that waste will now arrive in Elysian Fields, where some local residents and the village’s high school and elementary school depend on groundwater wells within a few miles of the landfill, according to the county judge and other local residents.

McBride’s spokesperson said that construction at Elysian Fields is “nearing completion” and that the site will begin accepting waste “once every safety and environmental measure is fully in place.”

By September, Linn said she’d already seen more trucks making deliveries to the site, where plastic pieces of what look like a liner have been lying out in the sun for months. In an email, Rose confirmed that a liner had been delivered but said operations have not yet begun. He said there’s no estimated construction date for Paxton.

Allen’s experience challenging the permit has motivated him, along with Linn and others, to advocate for changes to Texas laws governing oilfield waste. Allen traveled to the state Capitol in April to testify before the House Energy Resources Committee on two bills that would, respectively, require companies to notify landowners before burying oil and gas waste and demonstrate the necessity of a commercial oil and gas landfill when applying for a permit. He urged lawmakers to consider the compliance history of operators that are applying for new permits.

State Representative Jay Dean, whose district includes Waskom and Longview, responded to Allen’s comments and said that McBride has a way of “eluding” regulators. “If you’re going to be in that business—the rules, regulations, processes—you need to follow them, and nobody should get an exception,” he said.

Linn and Allen are working to found an organization called Texas Legacy Defense to assist communities, so far with members from Shelby, Panola, Harrison counties. “Because no one is listening,” Linn said. They like to say the group began when a “retired banker, a pastor, an editor, and a nurse walked into a room. It might sound like the setup to a joke, but that’s actually how Texas Legacy Defense began—in the fellowship room of a little country church.”

Allen bristles at the suggestion that outside interest groups are backing the movement against McBride. “I can tell you unequivocally that there have been no outside funds from any outside interests,” he said. “It’s all from people who are concerned that our groundwater, our land, and our air will be contaminated from this rogue operator.”

To drive home the point, Allen paid to hang banners in Shelby County calling Christian and Wright “Proven Liars.” In an email, Wright’s spokesperson disagreed: “Chairman Wright may be a lot of things, but a liar isn’t one of them.”

The East Texas waste dumps remain flash points for the growing number of Texans voicing their discontent with the Railroad Commission. Commissioner Wright is up for reelection in 2026. One of the first contenders to announce a campaign was Hawkins “Hawk” Dunlap, himself a native of East Texas and a longtime oilfield firefighter.

While nuclear power does produce waste, it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.
“Today, we get some 40 per cent electricity from nuclear, but we also currently get another 40 per cent from coal.
Opposition to nuclear energy While atomic energy enjoys public support, sceptical voices can be heard at home and abroad.
The Dukovany and Temelín plants are located near the border with Austria, which abandoned nuclear energy after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion.","The eight huge cooling towers of the Dukovany power plant overlook a construction site for two more reactors as Czechia pushes ahead with plans to expand its reliance on nuclear energy.

Mobile drilling rigs have been extracting samples 140 metres below ground for a geological survey to make sure the site is suitable for a $19 billion (€16.4 billion) project as part of the expansion that should eventually at least double the country’s nuclear output and cement its place among Europe’s most nuclear-dependent nations.

South Korea’s KHNP beat France’s EDF in a tender to construct a new plant whose two reactors will have an output of over 1,000 megawatts each. After becoming operational in the second half 2030s, they will complement Dukovany’s four 512-MW reactors that date from the 1980s.

The KHNP deal gives the Czechs an option to have two more units built at the other nuclear plant in Temelín, which currently has two 1,000-megawatt reactors.

Then, they are set to follow up with small modular nuclear reactors.

“Nuclear will generate between 50 per cent and 60 per cent (of energy) around 2050 in the Czechia, or maybe slightly more,"" Petr Závodský, chief executive of the Dukovany project, told The Associated Press in an interview.

The nuclear expansion is needed to help the country wean itself off fossil fuels, secure steady, reliable supplies at a reasonable price, meet low-emission requirements, and enable robust demand for electricity expected in the coming years to power data centres and electric cars, Závodský said.

Europe’s nuclear revival

The Czech expansion comes at a time when surging energy demand and looming deadlines by countries and companies to sharply cut carbon pollution are helping to revive interest in nuclear technology.

While nuclear power does produce waste, it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

The European Union has accepted nuclear energy by including it in the classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities, opening the door to financing. That has been a boost for Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and France — the continent’s nuclear leader — that have heavily relied on nuclear.

Belgium and Sweden recently scrapped plans to phase out nuclear power. Denmark and Italy are reconsidering their use, while Poland is set to join a club of 12 nuclear-friendly nations in the European Union after signing a deal with US-based Westinghouse to build three nuclear units.

The EU generated 24 per cent of its electricity from nuclear electricity in 2024.

Britain signed a cooperation deal with the United States in September that Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said would lead to “a golden age of nuclear in this country.”

It will also invest £14.2 billion (€16.1 billion) to build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, the first in the UK since 1995.

CEZ, the dominant Czech power company in which the government holds a 70 per cent stake, and Britain’s Rolls-Royce SMR have agreed on a strategic partnership to develop and deploy small modular nuclear reactors.

Money matters

The cost of the Dukovany project is estimated at over €16 billion, with the government agreeing to acquire an 80 per cent majority in the new plant.

The government will secure a loan for the new units that CEZ will repay over 30 years. The state will also guarantee a stable income from the electricity production for CEZ for 40 years. Approval is expected to be granted by the EU, which aims to become “climate-neutral” by 2050.

“We’re in a good position to argue that we won’t be able to do without new nuclear units,” Závodský said.

“Today, we get some 40 per cent electricity from nuclear, but we also currently get another 40 per cent from coal. It’s clear we have to replace the coal.”

Czechia is looking to phase out coal by 2033.

Uncertainty over financing has caused a significant delay in the nuclear expansion, however. In 2014, CEZ cancelled a tender to build two reactors at the existing Temelin nuclear plant after the government refused to provide financial guarantees.

Russia’s energy giant Rosatom and China’s CNG were excluded from the Dukovany tender on security grounds following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.

CEZ signed a deal with Westinghouse and France’s Framatome to supply nuclear fuel for its two nuclear plants, eliminating the country’s dependence on Russia. The contract with KHNP secures fuel supplies for 10 years.

Opposition to nuclear energy

While atomic energy enjoys public support, sceptical voices can be heard at home and abroad.

The Friends of the Earth say it is too costly, and the money could be better used for improving the industry. The country also still does not have a permanent storage facility for spent fuel.

While most people are still nervous about their own cars being fully self-driving, many Americans seem comfortable with driverless taxis.

Waymo has taken note, announcing it will bring autonomous cabs to Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego in 2026. That will bring the company to 12 cities with operational taxis.

Fast chargers are much more available than we think

We have more public chargers than ever, and yet Americans are still living with the fear of not being able to plug in when needed.

The new financing brings Harbinger’s total capital raised to $358m.

Alongside the investment, FedEx has placed an initial order for 53 Harbinger vehicles.

The order covers Class 5 and Class 6 models intended to support the company’s higher-capacity pickup and delivery needs and its ongoing network modernisation.

Harbinger said it plans to begin shipping chassis ready for body upfit before the end of the calendar year.

FedEx safety and transportation senior vice president Paul Melander said: “As we work toward a goal to electrify the entire FedEx pickup and delivery fleet by 2040, this trifecta of performance, price, and operational resilience is what we need to be able to continue to scale.

“We look forward to bringing these Class 5 and 6 units into our fleet and seeing electric medium-duty trucking options—like what Harbinger is offering—become more accessible in the marketplace for commercial fleets of all sizes.”

Harbinger co-founder and CEO John Harris said: “Harbinger is driving the next generation of medium-duty electric vehicles with a clean-sheet platform designed for optimised fleet performance.

“The level of investor support we’ve received reflects strong belief in the practicality of our platform, and our order from FedEx demonstrates that this vision is already taking shape in the market.”

Harbinger develops an in-house “EV stripped chassis” platform in the US, integrating core vehicle systems to support a vertically integrated manufacturing approach that the company says helps manage costs.

The trucks are designed with a focus on suspension, handling and safety, and feature advanced driver assistance systems including dynamic-trajectory backup cameras, virtual bumpers and acoustic vehicle alerting systems.

The platform’s modular design supports battery configurations tailored to operational requirements, offering ranges from around 225km to more than 321km.

The company highlights acquisition costs positioned against comparable internal combustion models, as well as acceleration and steering suited to urban environments.

The counterargument from data centers Data-center companies and utilities are not happy about mandatory power cutoffs for new computing facilities, however — and their arguments have so far carried the day at PJM.
But groups arguing for mandatory restrictions say these alternatives may not take effect quickly enough to prevent data-center growth from outpacing the capacity of PJM’s grid.
Meanwhile, PJM’s grid is only just beginning to feel the pressures of data-center expansion.","The data-center boom is pushing electricity costs to the breaking point for PJM Interconnection — the country’s biggest grid operator, serving more than 65 million people from the mid-Atlantic coast to Illinois — and that’s fueling a popular backlash.

Democratic gubernatorial candidates pledging to combat rising utility bills just won landslide victories in New Jersey and Virginia, two states bearing much of the brunt of data-center-driven cost increases. Congress members along with state governors and lawmakers are demanding that PJM take action.

PJM is poised to make a key decision this week on a fast-track process to get data centers online quickly while mitigating the impact of the facilities, which can use as much power as small cities. But a conflict has emerged over how far the grid operator can go. It boils down to this: Can PJM force data centers to stop using electricity at moments when demand for power peaks?

Data-center trade groups say no. But a growing number of politicians and environmental and consumer advocates say that requiring data centers to be the first to get disconnected from power during grid emergencies is the only surefire way to protect customers.

Last week, a bipartisan coalition of state legislators representing many of the 13 states served by PJM submitted its Protecting Ratepayers Proposal, which argues for data centers to be allowed to connect to PJM’s grid with the stipulation that they will be “‘interrupted’ during grid emergencies until they bring their own new supply.”

“We have a responsibility to ensure that technological growth doesn’t push vulnerable residents into financial hardship or enable a massive transfer of wealth from ratepayers to data centers,” said Maryland state Sen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat and organizer of the coalition, in a press release introducing the proposal.

“This proposal is about fairness and responsibility,” added Illinois state Sen. Rachel Ventura, also a Democrat. ​“We’re making sure data centers carry the cost of their own energy demands instead of passing it on to the public.”

That’s a salient concern, because the peak power needs of data centers are what’s driving electricity costs through the roof in PJM territory.

The grid operator must secure enough capacity from power plants and other resources to serve its peak loads. The prices of securing that capacity have skyrocketed in the past two years, from $2.2 billion in 2023 to $14.7 billion in 2024 and to $16.1 billion in PJM’s latest capacity auction this summer.

Growing demand forecasts of yet-to-be-built data centers are the primary culprit for these price spikes, and constitute the ​“core reliability issue facing PJM markets at present,” according to an August report from Monitoring Analytics, the company tasked with tracking PJM’s markets. ​“There is still time to address the issue but failure to do so will result in very high costs for other PJM customers,” the report warns.

Utility bills are rising across much of the U.S. due to a combination of factors, including volatile fossil-gas prices and the expense of repairing and expanding power grids. Data-center growth is not directly increasing costs in most regions yet, but in PJM, utility customers’ bills already reflect the capacity cost increases tied to serving future data centers.

Groups including consumer advocates in Maryland and the Natural Resources Defense Council agree that requiring new data centers to get cut off first during grid emergencies is a vital backstop to the suite of interventions PJM is considering for its fast-track process.

“We’re proposing to allow data centers to join PJM’s grid as fast as they want, but not guarantee them firm service, so they’ll be given interruptible service until they bring their own capacity,” Claire Lang-Ree, clean-energy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council and coauthor of the environmental group’s proposal, explained during an Oct. 22 webinar. ​“We think that’ll solve both the cost and reliability problem, because by removing all these large loads out of the capacity market until they bring their own supply, … capacity prices might go back down to historic levels.”

PJM’s Members Committee is expected to vote Wednesday on a final advisory recommendation to send to the grid operator’s board of managers. PJM has said it intends to file a proposal in December with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in hopes of gaining approval to institute changes in 2026.

The counterargument from data centers

Data-center companies and utilities are not happy about mandatory power cutoffs for new computing facilities, however — and their arguments have so far carried the day at PJM.

In August, PJM issued a ​“conceptual proposal” that included a ​“non-capacity-backed load” (NCBL) structure. The approach would force loads of 50 megawatts or larger to curtail power use to forestall grid emergencies as a precondition to interconnection.

That proposal was lambasted by the Data Center Coalition, a trade group that includes Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and dozens of other companies that own, operate, or lease data-center capacity. In comments to PJM, the coalition warned that by imposing NCBL status on data centers, the grid operator ​“risks exceeding its jurisdictional authority” over customer interconnection and interruptibility status, which are generally managed by utilities regulated at the state level.

“PJM has not provided a defensible rationale for creating this new class of service, and on its face the proposal is unduly discriminatory,” the coalition wrote.

PJM responded by pulling the NCBL concept from its next round of proposals, instead offering new data centers a voluntary method to commit to curtailing their peak power use through tweaks to a structure called ​“price-responsive demand,” or PRD.

As PJM explained in an October update, ​“With these changes, PRD becomes similar to voluntary NCBL,” since data centers that opt in would be exempt from paying for capacity but be obligated to ​“reduce demand during stressed system conditions.”

The big question is if data-center developers will choose to act at the scale required to ​“move the needle,” as analytics firm ClearView Energy Partners put it in a November research note. The authors wrote that, according to their observations in recent PJM meetings, ​“it’s far from clear whether new large load[s] would take service via this voluntary program.”

Consumer advocates aren’t happy with the data-center industry’s resistance to mandatory controls. Clara Summers, campaign manager for the Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois-based consumer-advocacy group, told Canary Media that the Data Center Coalition’s positions ​“are generally disappointing, given how some individual members of the DCC have shown a willingness to hammer out decent solutions that actually take responsibility for their own costs.”

Summers is referring to a handful of efforts by tech giants and data-center developers to use their own capacity resources to reduce their grid impacts. One such rare example is an agreement Google reached in August with PJM utility Indiana Michigan Power that commits the tech giant to bringing additional new capacity online and lowering power use during times of peak demand to alleviate the impacts of expanding a massive data center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Running out of time

Most of the groups submitting proposals to PJM agree that its new rules should enable data centers to fast-track development by paying for generation and other capacity resources to serve their own needs. Stakeholders also agree that data centers that can use less power during times of peak demand should be rewarded for the relief that would provide to PJM’s system.

The Data Center Coalition has also won backing from the governors of Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, four states in PJM territory courting data centers for economic development. Those governors joined the coalition in submitting a proposal for the fast-track process that would task state regulators with expediting interconnection for data centers that can add enough new generation capacity to the grid to cover their energy demand at the time they are connected.

But groups arguing for mandatory restrictions say these alternatives may not take effect quickly enough to prevent data-center growth from outpacing the capacity of PJM’s grid.

PJM’s notoriously backlogged interconnection queue is impeding the addition of new power plants to the system. The grid operator’s efforts to fast-track new generation resources have yielded only a handful of projects expected to come online before 2030.

PJM is still in the early stages of developing options to add capacity to existing generators, such as pairing batteries with solar and wind farms. And proposals that let data-center developers tap into the flexibility of virtual power plants remain a work in progress.

Meanwhile, PJM’s grid is only just beginning to feel the pressures of data-center expansion. The latest forecasts of large-load growth across PJM territory show 32 gigawatts of additional demand by 2028 and about 60 gigawatts by 2030, or a 37% increase from PJM’s peak load today, according to the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, the state’s consumer advocate.

The sheer scale of proposed data-center construction beggars belief. To meet that projected demand, ​“by 2028, [developers] would have to be investing about $1 trillion within PJM in the next three to four years,” David Lapp, who leads the Maryland office, said during a press conference last month. ​“That’s an insane amount of money.”

Forged through the leadership of two no-nonsense politicians – President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi – the clear-eyed agreement abandons more than a decade of energy uncertainty that was marked by unpredictable supply chains, unrealistic net-zero pledges and overreliance on unreliable wind and solar energy. This rightly places energy and industrial strategy at the heart of protecting national sovereignty.

Facing the weaponization of supply chains by Beijing, which controls over 90% of processed rare earths, America’s deal with Japan makes priorities of access to materials and technology, strategic resilience and economic growth and leverages an existing $550 billion investment package between the two countries.

According to a White House fact sheet, Japan and various Japanese companies will invest up to $332 billion in U.S. energy infrastructure, including nuclear reactors, plus up to $50 billion in power equipment through deals involving both U.S. and Japanese companies. Japan reportedly is to have increased access to U.S. markets for technology sales and favorable tariff treatment.

These investments are not for more bird-slicing wind turbines or desert-smothering solar panels, but for practical, reliable electric-generating capability.

The U.S. is to spend $75 billion on data-center infrastructure from three Japanese companies: Mitsubishi Electric, for supply power station systems and equipment; TDK Corp., advanced electronic power components; and Fujikura, Ltd., optical fiber cables.

The U.S.-Japan agreement also includes a multi-year deal valued at over $100 million between Global Coal Sales Group and Tohoku Electric Power for American thermal coal. This is a rational decision by an advanced industrial nation to secure affordable, reliable electricity for its people. Coal remains an indispensable energy source for nations that refuse to sacrifice economic growth at the altar of “decarbonization” dogma.

The deal calls for a Japanese investment of up to $3 billion to construct an ammonia and urea fertilizer manufacturing facility in the United States and another $2 billion to construct a copper smelting and refining plant in the American West.

On the other side of the Pacific, Japan will bolster energy supplies by importing 66 million metric tons of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) each year, making it the second-largest LNG buyer after China.

Still, Japan would be well served to add further to provisions of the deal – such as JERA Co.’s $1.5 billion stake in natural gas assets in Louisiana's Haynesville shale deposits and Tokyo Gas's purchase of Alaska LNG – which help to replace strategically risky Russian supplies that account for 9% of Japan's gas needs.

As for nuclear power, Japan's political cowardice following the Fukushima disaster in 2011 has left it with only 14 of the country’s 54 pre-accident nuclear reactors restarted. Japan needs to exorcise the Fukushima ghosts that have frozen policymakers for 14 years and reclaim its edge in a field now dominated by China, France, South Korea and Russia.

Fortunately for Japan and others, America’s Trump administration has bulldozed a path for vigorous development of resources by ditching the Paris Accord's chains and axing funds for global climate polices that enforce energy poverty.

The U.S.-Japanese framework hammers home strategic resilience through partnerships with major firms like Mitsubishi and Toshiba embedding in American projects, engendering employment and trade and defying minimalist “green” delusions.

Both powers now stand armored against disruptions, their economies roaring on a bedrock of hydrocarbons and atomic might, proving that real strength comes from embracing what works, not cowering before fabricated crises.

""If I was buying a home and saw that natural gas was installed then I would pay to remove it,"" another Redditor shared.","Cities working to ditch dirty energy in new buildings are celebrating a big win. A federal judge recently upheld a New York City law that bans the use of methane gas in new construction.

In a Reddit post to r/Energy, one social media user shared a Grist article detailing the clean energy ruling.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed trade groups' lawsuit claiming that gas restrictions violated federal law. Pro-climate groups are hopeful that this case will reinvigorate local climate action by enforcing strict pollution limits from fuel burned in new buildings.

Laws like the one in New York could effectively ban gas stoves, gas water heaters, and gas furnaces. Therefore, developers would need to equip and install clean energy alternatives such as heat pumps and induction cooktops.

With this legal precedent, other cities and states have a new motivation to move forward with building electrification projects that reduce pollution in their communities. There are already similar legal challenges underway in other places, including Denver, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.

Fortunately, clean energy solutions are becoming more affordable and cost-effective as technology improves and public education increases.

For example, induction stoves are an effective way to avoid the dangers of gas stoves and cook with greater precision in a kitchen without toxic fumes.

Many homeowners have been able to upgrade their old gas stoves to induction ones with federal tax incentives of up to $840 through the Inflation Reduction Act. However, it's crucial to act quickly to take advantage of these cost savings because they're set to expire at the end of the year.

Even if you can't afford a major kitchen upgrade, affordable plug-in induction burners start at just $50.

Fellow Reddit users were encouraged by the news in New York and shared their feedback in support of cleaner, healthier new buildings.

""This is a basic safety issue,"" one Reddit user commented. ""Natural gas regularly blows up homes and kills people. … Additionally, natural gas stoves are awful for health, causing huge amounts of asthma in kids.""

Most significantly, the proposed changes seek to exempt imported articles from the reporting requirement. According to EPA, the proposed rule aims to make PFAS reporting under TSCA more practical and easier to implement by reducing unnecessary or duplicative requirements for businesses, while ensuring EPA continues to receive essential information on PFAS use and safety.

In October 2023, EPA finalized a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping regulation requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products between 2011 and 2022 to report certain data to EPA. The rule aimed to improve EPA's understanding of PFAS use and exposure, and potential environmental and health effects. The previous rule did not include traditional TSCA exemptions, raising concerns among regulated entities about significant compliance costs, implementation challenges, and impacts on small businesses—particularly importers of finished products containing PFAS.

Under the proposed rule, EPA now seeks to add key reporting exemptions including: (1) mixtures or articles containing PFAS in concentrations less than 0.1%; (2) PFAS imported as part of an article; (3) certain PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance; (4) PFAS that are impurities; (5) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes; and (6) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates.

In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule. The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026. EPA is proposing to alter the deadline for reporting, by having the submission period begin 60 days after the rule is finalized and to run for three months. Thus, if the rule is finalized after May 2026, this would result in an extension of the reporting rule's deadline.

Businesses and stakeholders impacted by the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate how the proposed changes might affect their reporting obligations. Companies that prepared for reporting under the 2023 rule might need to revisit compliance strategies and internal recordkeeping. It is also important to monitor regulatory developments, as the final rule could significantly alter reporting requirements and associated costs. Finally, businesses and stakeholders should consider participating in the 45-day comment period to provide input on the proposed changes. EPA will accept public comments for 45 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register. EPA's press release on the proposed rule can be found here.

As Africa’s energy demand surges, balancing decarbonisation with energy security has never been more critical. New data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) underscores a pivotal role for both renewable energy and natural gas in driving a sustainable, yet reliable, power future for the continent.

Key findings & context

Electricity demand Is exploding

The IEA projects Africa’s electricity demand will rise by 4.1% in 2025.

To meet this demand sustainably, the IEA report forecasts that over 60 TWh of new generation (2023–2025) will come from renewables, increasing their share of total generation from about 24% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2025

At the same time, natural gas capacity is expected to grow: Africa’s gas-fired electricity is projected to increase by ~30 TWh by 2025, reaching almost 400 TWh.

Shift in investment flows

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, private-sector clean energy investment in Africa has nearly tripled, rising from ~US$ 17 billion in 2019 to almost US$ 40 billion in 2024.

However, public and DFI (development finance institution) funding has declined sharply — falling by about one‑third over the past decade to reach US$ 20 billion in 2024.

Much of this drop is linked to reduced commitments from some development partners, including Chinese DFIs.

Natural gas as a transition fuel

While fossil fuel investment is declining globally, natural gas remains an important transitional fuel in Africa’s energy mix: several analyses highlight that gas-especially in combined cycle power plants-offers flexible capacity that complements variable renewables.

In parts of Africa, natural gas already accounts for a significant share of the energy mix.

According to the Department of Mineral Resources in South Africa, natural gas makes up 41% of its power generation mix, underscoring its role in just transition strategies.

Just transition imperative

While renewables are growing, energy planners and policymakers must manage the transition in a way that preserves affordability, reliability, and social equity.

A just energy transition in Africa will require strategic use of gas to ensure firm dispatchability, while also scaling up renewables, and ensuring local communities benefit.

What the Africa Energy Indaba will do

At this year’s Africa Energy Indaba, stakeholders will come together to:

Explore best‑practice case studies where African countries have successfully integrated gas and renewables to maintain grid stability while reducing carbon emissions.

Facilitate high-level discussions on how to mobilise public and private capital for green infrastructure, with innovative financing models that account for risk, social impacts, and just transition.

Highlight policy frameworks that support a balanced energy mix: enabling regulators to incentivize renewables growth while using natural gas strategically as a bridging fuel.

Promote technology and capacity-building, including in firm-dispatchable generation (gas, hybrids), storage, and grid flexibility, to ensure reliable power as renewables scale.

Expected impact

Accelerate the pipeline of bankable energy projects that combine clean energy ambition with reliability.

Attract blended finance from DFIs, private investors, and governments to unlock the dual promise of decarbonisation and energy security.

Strengthen African energy institutions’ capacity to manage integrated energy systems, reducing risk and increasing resilience.

Support equitable growth through just-transition frameworks that safeguard communities and create green jobs.

“Our energy future in Africa is not just about reducing emissions – it’s about keeping the lights on, driving industrial growth, and ensuring no one is left behind. Renewables give us decarbonisation; gas gives us security – together, they enable a just transition.” commented Liz Hart, Managing Director of the Africa Energy Indaba. “At the Africa Energy Indaba, we have a unique opportunity to build bridges across sectors – finance, government, developers – and create real, investable energy projects that are both green and reliable.”

Dallas News reports Google’s investment includes AI and energy infrastructure, potentially reshaping Texas’s tech ecosystem.","In a bold move underscoring the relentless march of artificial intelligence, Alphabet Inc.’s Google has unveiled plans to pour $40 billion into three new data centers in Texas, aiming to supercharge its AI capabilities amid fierce competition from rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic. Announced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, this investment through 2027 marks the company’s largest in any single U.S. state, positioning Texas as a pivotal hub in the global AI infrastructure race. The facilities, including one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County, are set to bolster computing power for AI initiatives, creating thousands of jobs and injecting economic vitality into rural areas.

Yet, this massive influx of capital comes at a time when AI’s voracious energy demands are raising alarms about grid stability. Texas, already a magnet for tech investments due to its abundant renewable energy and business-friendly policies, has seen similar commitments from Microsoft and others, but experts warn that the cumulative strain could overwhelm the state’s power infrastructure. According to Bloomberg, Google’s push is part of a broader effort to expand AI capacity, with the company highlighting Texas’s role in American innovation in a blog post.

The AI Infrastructure Gold Rush

The decision to invest heavily in Texas reflects a strategic pivot toward regions with robust energy resources, particularly wind power, which dominates the state’s renewable sector. Reuters reports that the investment will fund not only data centers but also energy programs and workforce training, potentially making Texas home to more Google facilities than anywhere else globally, as noted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during the announcement. This aligns with a surge in AI-driven investments, where tech giants are racing to build out infrastructure capable of handling advanced machine learning models.

Industry insiders point to the exponential growth in AI computing needs, with data centers projected to consume vast amounts of electricity. A post on X from Dividend Talks highlights that U.S. data center power use could quadruple by 2030, from 147 TWh to 606 TWh, driven by every AI query and cloud operation. This echoes sentiments in SiliconANGLE, which details Google’s $40 billion commitment to Texas infrastructure, emphasizing the scale required for AI expansion.

Energy Grid Under Pressure

Concerns about energy consumption are not abstract; Texas’s grid, managed by ERCOT, has faced repeated strains from extreme weather and rising demand. Posts on X, including one from Doc Pete Chambers, call for a moratorium on new data centers, citing unassessed vulnerabilities and strains on energy resources. Similarly, a CBS News report shared on X warns of surging U.S. energy demands hitting record highs, fueled by AI and data centers.

The water footprint is equally daunting. Disclose.tv on X notes that AI data centers in Texas, including projects like Microsoft and OpenAI’s Stargate, could consume 399 billion gallons of water by 2030—enough for over 600,000 Olympic-sized pools. This mirrors findings in The Texas Tribune, which describes Google’s investment as the latest in a string of multibillion-dollar bets on AI infrastructure, but with growing scrutiny on resource use.

Global Spending Spree and Economic Ripples

Google’s Texas play is a slice of a larger pie: global tech spending on AI infrastructure is poised to exceed $1 trillion, encompassing data centers, chips, and energy solutions. Fox Business reports Pichai’s announcement as a major AI push, with the $40 billion earmarked for cloud, AI, and energy initiatives. This investment dovetails with projections of explosive growth in connected TV (CTV) and digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising, expected to surge 23.7% as AI enhances targeted marketing, per industry analyses.

Economic benefits are tangible—Google’s plans promise thousands of jobs and community grants, as outlined in the Houston Chronicle. However, critics on X, such as user totinho, decry the ‘energy vampire’ effect, arguing that these centers drain grids while spiking utility bills for residents. The Amarillo Globe-News specifies the Armstrong County campus, underscoring local impacts in the Texas Panhandle.

Balancing Innovation and Sustainability

To mitigate concerns, Google emphasizes sustainable practices, including partnerships for renewable energy. The company’s blog post details commitments to clean energy and workforce development, aiming to offset the environmental toll. Yet, as Joe Allen notes on X, data centers in states like Wyoming are already projected to outpace residential power use, with similar patterns emerging in Texas.

Broader implications extend to national policy. With AI demands straining grids nationwide, as per a CBS News feature on X, regulators may impose stricter guidelines. Finance Yahoo confirms the $40 billion timeline through 2027, positioning Google at the forefront of this transformation.

Competitive Landscape and Future Horizons

Rivals are not idle; OpenAI’s Stargate project in Texas, as mentioned in X posts by Steve Hou, requires over 3 GW of power, illustrating the arms race. Dallas News reports Google’s investment includes AI and energy infrastructure, potentially reshaping Texas’s tech ecosystem.

As AI integrates deeper into daily life—from ad tech growth in CTV and DOOH to computational breakthroughs—the Texas investments signal a new era. However, sustaining this growth demands innovative energy solutions, lest grid strains eclipse the benefits, as echoed in multiple X discussions and reports from Bloomberg and Reuters.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-1438-1763363737.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 02:58:47.562373

Lafitte Solar is also expected to generate around $32 million in regional tax revenue over its operating lifetime, supporting public schools, law enforcement, and emergency services. Construction was carried out in partnership with RWE’s EPC partner McCarthy, creating over 150 full-time jobs at the project’s peak. Local businesses and restaurants also benefited during construction, as workers engaged with area stores and services, further amplifying the project’s economic impact.

Joe Holyfield, President of the Ouachita Industrial Development Board, noted that Lafitte Solar brought significant jobs and investment to Ouachita Parish at a critical time, benefiting local businesses and contributing to the region’s long-term growth. Amanda Yang, Head of Clean and Renewable Energy at Meta, expressed enthusiasm for the project, emphasizing that Lafitte Solar adds clean energy to the grid while supporting local employment and the community.

RWE has also taken steps to support local schools and families. The company partnered with Roy Neal Shelling, Sr. Elementary School to provide donations for classroom resources, while McCarthy contributed toys during the holiday season. Together, RWE and McCarthy funded a new playground at Tanglewood Community Park and made one of the largest holiday food donations ever received by the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, benefiting families across Monroe.

The project’s design emphasizes sustainable land use. Natural and native vegetation around the site promotes biodiversity and protects surrounding farmland. Additionally, Lafitte Solar will implement agrivoltaics by using a flock of over 600 sheep to manage vegetation on site. This practice supports local agriculture while maintaining healthy ecosystems, demonstrating how renewable energy development can coexist with farming and contribute positively to the local community.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/28-1.png,N,,2025-11-17 02:59:13.886026

The company achieved commercial-scale production of high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide at its White Mesa Mill in 2024 and is piloting heavy rare earth separation, positioning to become America's first commercial producer of dysprosium and terbium oxides by Q4 2026.

The White Mesa Mill in Utah represents the only conventional uranium processing facility in the United States and the only U.S. facility capable of processing monazite into separated rare earth oxides, providing unmatched processing flexibility.

Through its Toliara (Madagascar), Donald (Australia), and Bahia (Brazil) heavy mineral sands projects, Energy Fuels is securing low-cost monazite feedstock with potential combined production exceeding 40,000 tonnes annually, containing approximately 5,381 tonnes of NdPr oxide.

The company maintains over $253 million in working capital with zero debt as of June 30, 2025, providing financial flexibility to advance multiple development projects while uranium prices remain structurally supported above $80 per pound.

Introduction: Critical Minerals at the Intersection of Energy Security and Technology Advancement

The global uranium market reached $80.00 per pound at the end of October 2025, reflecting structural demand growth driven by nuclear energy expansion and supply constraints. This price level, substantially higher than the March 2025 low of $64.23 per pound, underscores the fundamental shift occurring in nuclear fuel markets as governments worldwide accelerate reactor construction and capacity additions. Within this context, Energy Fuels Inc. has emerged as America's preeminent domestic producer of uranium and rare earth elements, operating the strategic White Mesa Mill in Utah.

The investment case for Energy Fuels extends beyond traditional uranium fundamentals to encompass the company's pioneering role in establishing domestic rare earth processing capabilities and developing an innovative, capital-efficient supply chain centered on monazite concentrate byproducts from heavy mineral sands operations. The company's diversified portfolio spans uranium production, rare earth oxide separation, and heavy mineral sands development, positioning it uniquely to capitalize on the convergence of clean energy demand and critical mineral supply security.

DataM Intelligence projects the global uranium market will reach $13.59 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4.86 percent for 2025-2032. Energy Fuels stands positioned to capture substantial market share within this expanding landscape through its integrated production capabilities and strategic asset portfolio.

Company Overview: Building America's Critical Minerals Infrastructure

Energy Fuels operates as the leading U.S. producer of uranium concentrate (U3O8), with current production from conventional mines in Arizona and Utah feeding its wholly-owned White Mesa Mill. The facility, located in southeastern Utah, represents more than four decades of operational expertise and holds licensed capacity to produce over 8 million pounds of U3O8 annually. Beyond uranium, the company has systematically expanded into rare earth element processing, achieving a significant milestone in 2024 with commercial-scale production of separated neodymium-praseodymium oxide at specifications suitable for magnet manufacturing.

This vertical integration leverages the White Mesa Mill's existing solvent extraction infrastructure and regulatory licenses to process monazite, a superior rare earth mineral concentrate naturally containing uranium alongside high concentrations of valuable rare earth oxides. The company's asset portfolio includes currently producing uranium mines at Pinyon Plain in Arizona and the La Sal Complex in Utah, standby operations at Nichols Ranch ISR facility in Wyoming, and three major development-stage uranium projects containing combined resources approaching 70 million pounds of U3O8.

Internationally, Energy Fuels has positioned itself in the heavy mineral sands sector through ownership or joint venture interests in the Toliara Project in Madagascar, Donald Project in Australia, and Bahia Project in Brazil. This diversified asset base provides operational flexibility, multiple growth vectors, and strategic optionality as commodity markets evolve.

Key Development: Uranium Production Scaling & Cost Reduction

Energy Fuels mined approximately 665,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in ore during the second quarter of 2025 from its Pinyon Plain, La Sal, and Pandora mines, stockpiling material for mill processing beginning in Q4 2025. Full-year 2025 mine production guidance ranges between 875,000 and 1,435,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in 55,000 to 80,000 tons of ore, establishing the company as the dominant U.S. producer. The Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona has delivered results significantly exceeding original estimates, with mined ore grades ranging between 33 percent and 100 percent higher than previous resource models in numerous mining areas.

""Energy Fuels mined approximately 635,000 pounds of U3O8 during the 3 months ended June 30, 2025. Mined ore grades ranging between 33% to 100% higher than previous estimates in numerous areas.""

This positive reconciliation indicates substantially more uranium will be recovered from the Main Ore Body than initially projected, while underground drilling has identified additional high-grade zones in the nearby Juniper Ore Body.

These higher grades translate directly into improved project economics. The company expects combined mining, transportation, and processing operating costs to range between $23 and $30 per pound of U3O8 recovered beginning in Q4 2025, when Pinyon Plain ore enters the mill circuit. This cost structure positions Energy Fuels among the lowest-cost uranium producers globally, with significant margin potential at current uranium prices above $80 per pound.

Strategic Significance: Rare Earth Processing Capabilities & Market Positioning

Energy Fuels' development of domestic rare earth processing represents a strategic inflection point with national security implications. The White Mesa Mill currently processes monazite concentrate to produce mixed rare earth carbonate, which undergoes further separation into individual rare earth oxides including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, elements critical to permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, advanced manufacturing, and defense applications. The company achieved commercial-scale production of high-purity NdPr oxide in 2024, with material currently undergoing validation by rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturers.

Piloting efforts have successfully produced 1 kilogram of 99.5 percent pure dysprosium oxide in August 2025, with plans to produce 15 kilograms in October 2025 and 1 kilogram of terbium oxide in November 2025. Commercial production of heavy rare earth oxides could commence as early as Q4 2026 with minor modifications to the existing solvent extraction circuit. This timeline would position Energy Fuels as the first commercial-scale producer of separated heavy rare earth oxides in the United States, addressing critical supply chain vulnerabilities in materials where China currently controls over 90 percent of global processing capacity.

The company's structural advantage stems from its focus on monazite as feedstock. This mineral concentrate contains 50-60 percent total rare earth oxides, substantially higher than alternative materials, with superior concentrations of neodymium-praseodymium and heavy rare earths. Monazite occurs as a low-cost byproduct of heavy mineral sands mining, where the primary revenue derives from titanium and zirconium minerals, making it economically attractive compared to primary rare earth mining operations.

Heavy Mineral Sands Pipeline: Securing Long-Term Feedstock Supply

Energy Fuels has assembled a portfolio of three world-scale heavy mineral sands projects designed to provide decades of low-cost monazite feedstock to the White Mesa Mill. The Toliara Project in Madagascar, acquired through the October 2024 purchase of Base Resources, represents the company's most advanced international development asset. Toliara holds potential to produce 26,000 tonnes of monazite annually from a 39-year mine life, containing approximately 2,600 tonnes per year of NdPr oxide plus significant quantities of dysprosium and terbium.

The Donald Project in Australia, operated as a joint venture with Astron Corporation where Energy Fuels can earn up to 49 percent ownership while securing 100 percent of monazite offtake, is fully permitted and considered shovel-ready. Phase 1 development contemplates 7,000 tonnes of monazite production annually, expandable to 14,000 tonnes in Phase 2, with final investment decision possible in the second half of 2025. The Donald deposit contains exceptional concentrations of heavy rare earths, providing world-leading feedstock quality.

In Brazil, the Bahia Project represents an earlier-stage opportunity with several exploration and mining permits in place covering well-defined heavy mineral sands mineralization. Combined with existing offtake from Chemours Company providing 500-1,000 tonnes of monazite annually, these projects position Energy Fuels to control 40,900 tonnes of monazite feedstock, establishing a globally significant rare earth supply chain centered in the United States.

Financial Position & Market Context

Energy Fuels maintained working capital of $253.23 million as of June 30, 2025, with zero debt. This liquidity position comprises $71.49 million of cash and cash equivalents, $126.41 million of marketable securities, $7.79 million of trade receivables, and $76.50 million of inventory. Finished product inventory includes 725,000 pounds of U3O8, 905,000 pounds of V2O5, 9,000 kilograms of high-purity mixed rare earth carbonate, and 37,000 kilograms of separated NdPr oxide.

The company reported a net loss of $21.81 million in the second quarter of 2025, reflecting its strategic decision to limit uranium sales during temporarily weaker prices, combined with ongoing development expenditures. Energy Fuels' strong balance sheet provides flexibility to advance multiple development projects simultaneously without immediate capital markets dependence. The company holds four long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear utilities featuring fixed and market-linked price components, with contract deliveries totaling 300,000 pounds in 2025, increasing to 620,000-880,000 pounds in 2026.

Rare earth oxide markets have experienced significant price appreciation, particularly for heavy rare earths. NdPr oxide prices increased 19.5 percent in the past month from $61.89 to $73.93 per kilogram, while dysprosium oxide prices in Europe have surged 348 percent and terbium oxide has appreciated 367 percent, reflecting acute supply constraints outside Chinese-controlled supply chains.

The Investment Thesis for Energy Fuels

Establish core positions in U.S. uranium producers before enrichment capacity expansions materialize in 2026-2027, creating incremental domestic feedstock demand

Diversify critical minerals exposure through companies with integrated rare earth processing to mitigate single-commodity price volatility

Monitor quarterly production reconciliation reports from Pinyon Plain for resource expansion potential that could materially extend mine life beyond current estimates

Evaluate heavy mineral sands project financing announcements from Donald and Toliara as de-risking catalysts that validate economic models

Consider position sizing increases if Energy Fuels secures commercial rare earth offtake agreements with automotive OEMs or defense contractors

Track U.S. government critical minerals programs and potential Energy Fuels participation in uranium reserve purchases or stockpiling initiatives

Energy Fuels represents a unique investment opportunity at the convergence of nuclear energy resurgence, rare earth supply chain restructuring, and domestic critical minerals security. The company's ownership of irreplaceable processing infrastructure at the White Mesa Mill, combined with low-cost uranium production and pioneering rare earth capabilities, creates multiple paths to value creation. Near-term catalysts include declining uranium production costs as Pinyon Plain ore enters the mill circuit in Q4 2025, potential achievement of commercial heavy rare earth production by Q4 2026, and investment decisions on world-scale heavy mineral sands projects.

The strengthening uranium price environment, with long-term contract levels above $85 per pound, provides revenue visibility while rare earth market dynamics offer significant margin expansion potential. The combination of America's leading uranium production platform, breakthrough rare earth processing capabilities, and a global heavy mineral sands pipeline positions Energy Fuels to capture substantial value as critical minerals markets continue structural evolution.

TL;DR

‍Energy Fuels is positioned as America's dominant uranium producer with expanding rare earth oxide capabilities, leveraging its White Mesa Mill to build a vertically integrated critical minerals supply chain while uranium prices hold above $80/lb and REE markets strengthen.

On its face, this suggests the clean-mobility dream is coming true. But a deeper look reveals emerging cracks. The boom may be less about broad-based demand and more about premium segments and state incentives. If the policy architecture fails to keep pace, the risk is a slowdown that wastes India’s manufacturing thrust and undermines energy-security goals.

According to recent data, India’s electric four-wheeler registrations in Apr-Oct 2025 doubled year-on-year and reached 4.6 % of passenger vehicle share. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in October-2025 hit a new monthly peak of 2.34 lakh units—with two-wheelers still dominant. These numbers show growth. Yet they also hide structural stress.

READ | Blockchain regulation: Why India must see beyond crypto

Much of the surge is concentrated in urban pockets, premium segments and states with strong incentives. At the same time, the price-gap between EVs and internal-combustion engine (ICE) vehicles has narrowed because of GST cuts and import code changes. That reduces the differential advantage and thus the consumer trigger for many buyers. Supply-chain constraints—especially around battery inputs and magnets—remain unresolved.

EV adoption: Why the risk of plateau looms

The transition logic for EVs rests on four pillars: affordability, charging infrastructure, supply-chain stability, and compelling total cost-of-ownership (TCO). If any pillar falters, momentum stalls.

First, affordability remains an issue. Even with subsidies, many EVs cost significantly more upfront than ICE alternatives. Second, charging infrastructure is patchy in many states. Rural and semi-urban areas remain poorly served. Third, supply-chain risks are real: raw-material shortages and import dependencies raise cost risks and hinder mass-market rollout. Fourth, demand is as important as supply. A model driven by premium buyers may reach its ceiling sooner than a model built on mass adoption.

In short, while the one million plus number is promising, it is not yet an inflection point for a full-scale mobility shift. Without deeper structural fixes, India may see growth flatten out rather than accelerate.

Why this matters for India

India has set ambitious targets: 30 % EV sales by 2030, 500 GW non-fossil energy and a large domestic manufacturing ecosystem. If the EV transition stalls, these ambitions are at risk. Manufacturing plants under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme may operate below capacity. Job creation will be lower. Imports of petrol and diesel will remain elevated, undermining energy-security and emissions goals.

For households the implications are mixed. Early adopters in urban metros may enjoy lower lifecycle cost. But if subsidies fade, charging remains unreliable and residual values are weak, mid-income buyers may feel apprehensive. For states the risk is stranded infrastructure and subsidies that no longer catalyse demand.

Where the policy gaps are widening

India’s policy architecture has many strengths—FAME-II, state EV policies, PLI for batteries, and tax incentives. Yet gaps persist.

Many state incentives are now being rolled back or capped just when markets are maturing. Some states are seeing adoption stagnate. For example, one report found that a major southern state mustered just 1.8 % EV share in five years. This level of heterogeneity undermines the notion of a uniformly advancing mobility transition.

Infrastructure remains uneven. While metros may boast fast-chargers and network maps, most towns lack reliable public charging. Without this backbone, range-anxiety remains real.

Supply chains are globally contested. India still imports large fractions of cell chemistry, magnets and assembly lines. Without decisive localisation, the manufacturing push remains vulnerable to external shocks and cost escalation. Add to this the fall in GST on ICE vehicles and the narrowing of the differential price advantage for EVs. That undermines the value proposition.

What needs to happen for the transition to regain pace

If India is to turn momentum into mass movement, policy must shift beyond incentives and volume headlines.

First, the focus must move from incentive-driven demand to fundamental affordability and TCO improvement. Lower barrier pricing, credible residual-value frameworks, battery-swapping models, and financing innovations must all come together. Second, charging infrastructure must become as standard as fuel stations. Rural and semi-urban deployment, interoperability across states, and integration with grid-management are critical.

Third, supply-chain resilience must be built—cells, battery manufacturing, magnet recovery, recycling. India cannot afford to import its way to green mobility at scale. Fourth, states must adopt stable, long-term policies rather than short-cycle incentives. A one-year subsidy expansion followed by rollback disrupts investor and buyer confidence.

Equally important is consumer education and transparency. Many buyers remain uncertain about warranty, resale value, charging habits and servicing availability. Without addressing such anxiety, growth may slow.

Momentum is no guarantee of breakthrough

India’s EV numbers are clearly heading in the right direction. The growth in vehicle registration, the manufacturing announcements, the policy framework—all look promising. But what is not yet apparent is the full ecosystem shift: affordability for the many, reliable charging for the accessible, supply chains for the scalable, policy stability for the sustainable.

If India continues on the current trajectory without recalibrating these pillars, the risk is a growth plateau. Instead of a rapid leap to electric mobility, the economy may slip into a prolonged and uneven transition. For a nation with high stakes in climate goals, manufacturing ambition and energy-security, that outcome would be a missed opportunity.

India can still convert momentum into mastery. But only if the next stage of policy is crafted not for those who bought the first wave of EVs, but for those who will buy in the next decade.",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EVSS-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 03:57:41.863075

To empower future generations of Longhorns, we should strive to not only normalize understanding how architecture affects students’ productivity but also shape academic space design by students’ needs.","From the original Forty Acres to the current 431 acres, UT has consistently made campus revitalization efforts a top priority. As academic buildings undergo constant renovations, student spaces should also be improved to bridge physical space design and mental well-being.

The psychology of physical space, which investigates how people’s surroundings influence their emotions and behavior, has determined that areas meant to increase students’ motivation can take many forms. Therefore, it’s critical to have environments catered to diverse psychological needs.

“When I go (to) study, the things I look for (are) generally areas that are quieter, … places with a more open environment and natural lighting,” biochemistry freshman Hannah Truong said.

When studying, students typically seek an area that motivates them to achieve a specific result. Situational characteristics, such as warmth and moderate brightness within a space can enhance people’s memory, while the absence of natural light in an academic setting has short-term negative effects on intellectual performance.

“The one I go to a lot is (Perry-Castañeda Library) … I started going less because although it has pretty good natural lighting, sometimes it’s a bit dreary,” Truong said.

Although some preferred characteristics of a study space vary among individuals, factors like control and variety determine the benefits of flexible learning spaces for students. A student’s control in a space, such as their ability to shift table layouts or alter a room’s temperature, plays a significant role in their comfortability. It isn’t feasible to cater to all individual preferences in architectural design, but having a variety of academic areas that support privacy and collaboration allows students to explore what spaces are most beneficial for their goals.

Although students’ autonomy within student-centered spaces may initially seem obvious, how can we be expected to advocate for our needs in spaces that fail to uplift us mentally?

“I was very surprised to find out how little (students) felt like they could do within a space,” said Tamie Glass, associate professor of the department of design in the College of Fine Arts. “There’s a discrepancy between sometimes (how) faculty, or maybe leadership, … perceives a space versus how students do.”

If more academic environments considered student spatial experiences as they differ from faculty, students could feel greater comfortability to advocate for their needs among campus leadership. Beyond mere aesthetics and utility, UT’s architecture plays a vital role in supporting students’ mental health.

Dr. Samuel Gosling, professor of psychology in the College of Liberal Arts, specializes in the psychology of physical space and how personality is shown in everyday environments. Gosling recognizes that if architecture were seen as a helping profession, one prioritizing well-being as opposed to artistry, buildings would be largely more effective at helping people.

“It seems to me that all architecture students should be required to take not just basic psychology, but probably quite a lot of psychology,” Gosling said. “Shouldn’t you know something about the individuals you’re building these spaces for?”

Similar to how doctors and social workers learn human psychology to adequately provide diverse support, architects should use physical space psychology to maximize the emotional and psychological fulfillment of their designs. With more recognition of this field and attention to student experiences, campus architects can boost student well-being into a larger landscape of importance.

Deep subprime households who are already financially vulnerable are being hit the hardest, with past-due utility balances jumping from $643 to $834—debts that can mushroom through interest and penalties

Millions are facing severe utility debt heading into the winter months. Nearly one in twenty households—equivalent to roughly 14 million Americans—have utility debt so severe that it was sent or soon will be sent to collections. The rates are nearly twice as high in parts of the South and Appalachia. These consumers live in states with harsher collection practices that drive one in twelve households to face added strain on family budgets and credit.

In the first six months of President Trump’s second term, we estimate that the number of households with severely overdue utility debt increased by roughly 117,000—a 3.8 percent rise.

Across the Atlantic coast and in parts of the Midwest, overdue utility balances total more than $1,500 on average.

Utility prices are on the rise across the country. Comparing twelve-month moving averages from March 2022 to June 2025 (to adjust for seasonality), monthly energy costs (in the part of the sample that reports on-time payments of bills relating to home electricity, gas, and other fuels) nationwide rose from $196 to $265—a 35 percent jump, or nearly three times overall inflation during that period.

No corner of the country is immune from energy price hikes: while states in the Northeast face the highest average utility bills of $300 or more, states such as Arizona ($289), California ($303), and Texas ($269) are also hit with punishingly high prices, likely due to heavy cooling demands.

Energy and utility bills are not luxury goods; they are core expenses in a family’s budget. Keeping the lights on is fundamental to one’s ability to live a healthy, stable life. The sharp spike in monthly utility bills and overdue balances serves as a warning sign that a growing number of households cannot keep up with basic necessities and are falling into debt as a result. For older Americans, particularly those with fixed incomes, rising utility bills pose outsized risks—jeopardizing seniors’ access to safe, stable housing and increasing economic insecurity more broadly.

Unfortunately, this energy cost crisis is likely to get worse. Electricity markets today are broken, with poorly regulated monopolies overcharging customers to the tune of $5 billion a year. Federal regulations allow utilities to earn profits based on what they build, rather than on the reliability of performance—leading to underinvestment in any efficiency improvements in electricity transmission that could lower costs. Moreover, the explosion of AI data centers, and the growing demand for energy they require, is driving up the cost of energy, sending household utility bills through the roof. And the Trump administration has added fuel to the fire, taking actions that directly contribute to rising utility costs by impeding renewable energy generation while simultaneously dismantling the support systems in place to protect low-income Americans from utility debt.

The energy cost crisis is not sustainable. Working families are already on the brink—with millions forced to skip meals, dip into their savings, and turn to credit cards and other risky financial products and practices just to get by. For many Americans, higher heating costs this winter could be the tipping point.

Monthly Energy Bills Are Rising Across the Country

Our analysis shows that from March 2022 to June 2025, average monthly energy bills rose from $196 to $265—a 35 percent jump, or nearly three times overall inflation during that period (see Figure 1). What’s worrisome is that the trend is getting worse since the start of the year: nearly one-fourth of that three-year increase came in the past two quarters alone. According to our data and the consumer price index, home energy prices are surging past other costs, with the average family getting an annual price hike of over $800 for these bills.

FIGURE 1

No corner of the country is safe from rising energy costs. While states in the Northeast face some of the highest average monthly bills of $300 or more, heavy demand for cooling elsewhere means that families in states such as Arizona ($289), California ($303), Texas ($269), and across the Southeast are also getting hit with punishingly high energy costs (see Figures 2 and 3). Because our analysis (through June 2025) precedes peak summer temperatures, it is safe to assume that millions of families today are facing even higher costs than what is shown here.

FIGURE 2

FIGURE 3

A Tipping Point: For Millions, Energy Debt Is Severe

For millions of families, rising energy bills and past-due balances represent a crisis. As of June 2025, we find that nearly one in twenty households—or roughly 14 million Americans—have debt so severe it was sent to collections or in arrears. This figure climbs to roughly one in twelve in parts of the South and Appalachia, nearly twice the rates as the national average (see Figure 4).

FIGURE 4

Across the Atlantic coast and in parts of the Midwest, overdue utility balances total more than $1,500, driven in part by colder climates, older housing, and pricier heating fuels (see Figure 5). Many of these states also limit winter shutoffs, which allow unpaid balances to carry through the cold months. Yet, lower past-due balances in other states do not necessarily mean less hardship, as they can reflect faster escalation to disconnection and collection. In these regions, families struggling to pay utility bills are likely being sent to collections much earlier, putting them on a faster path to financial ruin.

FIGURE 5

Many families today are on the brink of having their power shut off. In the first six months of President Trump’s second term, we estimate that the number of households with severely overdue utility debt increased by roughly 117,000—a 3.8 percent rise.

As alarming as these findings are, they represent a fraction of the true crisis, since many utility companies report overdue accounts only after households become severely delinquent—often 120 days or more past due—and have been sold to a collection agency. Therefore, this data captures only the most extreme cases of financial distress, long after a family has fallen deep into debt.

Higher Energy Bills Are Pushing Families Deeper Into Debt

Families simply can’t keep up with rising energy costs. Since 2022, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789—a 32 percent increase, or 2.7 times overall inflation (see Figure 6).

FIGURE 6

The burden of this utility debt is not felt equally, falling hardest on households that were already financially vulnerable. As of June 2025, 10.8 percent of Black households carry an overdue utility balance, which is roughly three times the rate for white households (3.6 percent). Among those with past-due bills, Black and Asian consumers carry the highest overdue utility balances, approaching $900, compared to $750 for white consumers (see Figure 7). Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance.

FIGURE 7

For deep subprime households—those with credit scores below 580—the average past-due balance climbed from $643 in 2022 to $834 by June 2025, a 30 percent jump (see Figure 8). While the data set does not have individual income, it does show that deep subprime households disproportionately reside in low-income and urban neighborhoods and are thus more likely to have low income. These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation—and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill. Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.

FIGURE 8

One might expect super-prime borrowers from more affluent households to spend more on home energy, and that trend was evident at the start of the period analyzed. But in recent quarters, utility bills have converged among credit scores, with deep subprime households actually paying more than individuals with better credit scores (see Figure 9). That’s because the fixed costs of delivering electricity to households are one of the fastest rising parts of energy bills, as companies pass along spending on transmission to households.

FIGURE 9

Conclusion

Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt. Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.

Americans want leaders to confront these high prices head-on and take steps to limit how utility companies use their monopoly power to rip off consumers. The utility industry has been rife with mega-mergers (that have consolidated eighty-three companies into only thirteen) that have led to windfall profits for investors by stifling competition with little benefit to consumers. It leads to a consistent pattern of higher bills and poorer service.

Yet, instead of addressing these root causes of energy inflation, the Trump administration has made the problem worse—stymying the development of abundant renewable energy and threatening the assistance that families need to get through the winter. When millions of Americans cannot afford to keep the lights on, it is a fundamental failure of economic policy that demands a renewed commitment to bring down the price of energy and confront the crisis of utility debt.

Appendix: Data and Methodology

TCF and Protect Borrowers’ analysis uses individual-level longitudinal records from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel (UC-CCP), a 2 percent, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with credit files. Within this panel, utility obligations appear on credit reports in two forms: (1) seriously past-due debts and (2) active (noncollection) utility accounts.

Identification of Past-Due Utility Debt

We define past-due utility debt as tradelines showing severe delinquency, captured in two groups: (1) accounts that have been sent to a third-party for collections, which constitute the vast majority (over 95 percent) of these observations; (2) accounts that are ninety or more days delinquent but have not yet been transferred to a collection agency. We isolate these records using original-creditor classification codes for “utilities.” This bucket includes electric, gas, water, and sewer providers. We can explicitly exclude only cable (Internet) and cellular utility accounts. Because energy bills are typically larger than nonenergy utilities, this approach provides a strong proxy for past-due energy debt; any residual inclusion of nonenergy utilities (with generally lower balances) likely makes our average-balance estimates lower than what they would be if we could disaggregate further.

Identification of Active Utility Tradelines and Monthly Payments

We also analyze active, noncollection utility tradelines furnished directly to the credit bureaus. Empirically, these look like open, pay-in-full accounts:

Account current, no credit limit, and zero amount past due.

AI-driven data centers are accelerating electricity demand and stressing NJ’s power grid

Rising energy costs and grid congestion threaten industrial projects, especially cold storage facilities

Developers must treat electricity as core infrastructure, writer says

Small Modular Reactors and AI-enabled efficiency systems offer promising near-term solutions

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last month secured a Department of Energy study examining how AI-driven data centers are driving up electricity costs and straining grid reliability. The fact that Congress is pressing for such a review for consumers underscores what industrial developers have long understood: the cost and availability of power is rapidly becoming one of the defining constraints of this decade.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects record electricity consumption of 4,179 billion kWh in 2025, with demand rising by 20% by 2030 and a whopping 78% by 2050, according to technology consulting firm ICF International. This surge will be driven by electrified transportation, industrial automation investments, and expanding data center workloads.

In the PJM grid serving New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and 11 other states, forecasts indicate 30 gigawatts of new demand will be added by 2030, with nearly all of it coming from data centers.

With rising demand comes rising costs. PJM capacity auction prices have jumped nearly tenfold in two years, and analysts expect household electricity bills in the Mid-Atlantic to climb more than 60% by 2030. For industrial tenants already squeezed by taxes and insurance, volatile energy costs are a growing concern.

Nowhere is this more evident than in cold storage, where power consumption is significantly higher than in dry warehouses. Refrigeration systems operate 24/7, supported by advanced energy management and humidity control systems. The result is extraordinary demand: 25-to-30 kilowatt-hours per square foot annually. Not surprisingly, these facilities rely on redundant backup systems, including generators and UPS [uninterruptible power supply] units, because a brief outage risks millions of dollars in spoiled goods.

At New Jersey’s current rate of approximately 18.38¢ per kilowatt-hour for commercial users, cold-storage facilities can face up to $15.60 per square foot in electricity costs annually.

The hard truth

While New Jersey’s grid remains reliable, it was not designed for the surge of AI-driven logistics, electrified truck fleets, and expanded manufacturing. The PJM interconnection queue is already congested, with projects waiting extended periods for approvals to tie into the grid.

For industrial developers, this can mean delays, cost overruns, and in some cases, project cancellations. Some operators are experimenting with thermal energy storage and other innovations to blunt peak loads and qualify for clean energy incentives. Others face the hard truth: securing enough power capacity at a site can be as daunting as raising capital or obtaining entitlements.

This is why developers must now treat electricity as core infrastructure. That starts with engaging utilities early in the entitlement process to align project timelines with grid upgrades. It also means embedding resilience into design, including onsite generation, battery storage, and microgrids that shield tenants from volatility. Even lease structures are evolving, with some indexed to demand charges or incorporating efficiency standards to balance costs and incentivize conservation.

[D]evelopers must now treat electricity as core infrastructure.

Innovation offers further promise. AI-enabled cooling systems and demand-aware scheduling are already demonstrating measurable reductions in peak loads and operating costs. The most forward-looking projects are addressing energy constraints head-on, gaining a competitive edge by delivering reliable, cost-stable power alongside traditional locational advantages.

Near-term solutions

Unfortunately, creating new sources of generation takes a decade or more, and businesses in New Jersey are increasingly concerned these challenges will not be resolved before we enter a critical period of unmet demand. However, several near-term solutions are gaining momentum.

For one, Small Modular Reactors, or compact nuclear fission reactors that can be assembled on smaller site footprints. These are drawing interest from New Jersey businesses as a timely solution until longer-term power sources such as nuclear become viable.

Already, numerous SMRs are expected to be approved in the 2030s, guaranteeing reliable, carbon-free, and siting-flexible alternatives for large campuses and microgrids.

But New Jersey cannot afford to watch from the sidelines, especially when new generation takes a decade to come online. The choices our leaders make today will determine whether power is a long-term constraint in the state and across the country, or a catalyst for industrial growth and innovation.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/11/Electric-Grid.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 01:57:28.608807

Over this same timeframe, annual EV sales increased by a factor of 12.
In 2015, both automakers offered only three EV models; by 2025, GM and Hyundai offered 14 and 15 EV models, respectively.
The automakers’ EV sales have grown significantly alongside the number of available models.
These shifts demonstrate manufacturers’ strategies to continue their EV sales momentum absent federal incentives, but also highlight the challenge of sustaining growth as federal incentives wane.","This is the exact wrong moment for automakers to lose their nerve in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). A decade of consistent growth has culminated in record-breaking EV sales. More than 1.2 million new light-duty EVs were sold through the first three quarters of 2025, higher than any prior year; the EV sales share reached nearly 12% in the third quarter. More broadly, over 7 million EVs were sold from 2015 to September 2025, with more than half occurring in the past 3 years.

American drivers want EVs, and the data prove it. Yet several U.S. manufacturers have backtracked on their commitment to the EV transition. If these automakers retreat now, European, Chinese, and South Korean manufacturers will eagerly fill the gap. The decisions made by automakers and policymakers today will determine who leads the next era of clean vehicles—and who gets left behind.

A key driver of this growth is expanded EV model availability, and in particular more affordable options. In 2015, only VW offered at least five different EV models across its brands; by 2025, 10 automakers offered five or more EV models, with seven automakers offering 10 or more. Over this same timeframe, annual EV sales increased by a factor of 12. In 2015, there were 19 car, zero pickup, and six crossover/SUV EV models on the U.S. market. In 2025, there are 28 car, 6 pickup, and 79 SUV EV models available. Many of these models start below $50,000—and buyers have responded. Through September 2025, 68% of BEV sales were of models starting under that threshold. Diversification has opened new market segments and attracted a wider range of consumers, resulting in record sales and market shares.

Sales data from GM and Hyundai bear out this trend. In 2015, both automakers offered only three EV models; by 2025, GM and Hyundai offered 14 and 15 EV models, respectively. The automakers’ EV sales have grown significantly alongside the number of available models. GM’s EV sales have grown more than 7 times since 2015, and Hyundai’s more than 100 times.

The removal of tax incentives will hurt but not halt the EV transition

The expiration and reduction of federal tax credits for EVs have effectively increased the upfront cost of electric vehicles in the United States. But the economics still favor EVs: drivers save thousands in fuel and maintenance over the lifetime of a battery electric vehicle—savings that more than offset the higher purchase price and result in lower total cost of ownership even without incentives. As battery prices continue to fall due to global competition and economies of scale, EVs are on pace to soon reach cost parity with conventional vehicles, making the economic advantage even more compelling.

In response to changes in federal incentives, some automakers have taken proactive steps to maintain momentum. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y. GM brought back the Bolt and introduced lower-priced Equinox EV versions. Ford adjusted pricing and released new, more affordable trims of the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. These shifts demonstrate manufacturers’ strategies to continue their EV sales momentum absent federal incentives, but also highlight the challenge of sustaining growth as federal incentives wane. Automakers that bring affordable EVs to market and adapt to the policy changes are likely to have higher EV sales, and to be in a leadership position in the longer term.

Recognizing the limitations of federal support, states have stepped in with innovative policies and incentive programs. Colorado recently increased rebates for qualifying new EVs to $9,000. California’s ZEV Forward report recently offered recommendations for spurring zero-emission vehicle sales, which included streamlined permitting, expanded rebates, and EV requirements to accelerate adoption. Cap-and-invest programs in California channel proceeds into EV infrastructure and rebates for low- and moderate-income households. Meanwhile, the U.S. Climate Alliance launched the Affordable Clean Cars coalition, helping states share best practices and coordinate incentives. States are expected to continue to fill gaps in federal support to sustain momentum.

Early data from fall 2025 illustrate the underlying strength of EV demand despite near-term disruptions. Preliminary October sales figures show BEV sales dropped about 25% compared to October 2024, as the federal consumer purchase incentive expired. However, September BEV sales surged more than 40% year-over-year, suggesting strong consumer interest drove many buyers to act before the incentive ended. While the market may experience a brief adjustment period, the fundamentals remain solid: expanded model availability, improving economics, and proactive industry and state responses position the EV market for continued growth. As new models launch and consumers adapt to the post-incentive landscape, we expect EV sales momentum to recover.

Whoever navigates the EV transition wins the race

The U.S. electric vehicle market stands at a crossroads. Record sales, expanding model lineups, and strong consumer demand point to a bright future—if industry and policymakers resist nearsighted backtracking. As nations vie for EV leadership, American manufacturers that maintain or intensify their EV strategies stand to win big, at home and abroad. Conversely, those that retreat risk ceding ground to European, Chinese, and South Korean automakers, which are doubling down on electrification.

Going forward, full commitment to electrification will be a prerequisite for relevance in the global automotive market. Automakers that stay the course, investing in new models and manufacturing capacity, are poised to reap the rewards of global competitiveness and domestic market leadership. Policymakers can support American automakers with innovative policy, ensuring incentives and infrastructure keep pace with evolving technology and consumer needs. The winners will be those that seize the opportunity, act boldly despite near-term challenges, and lead the charge into the electrified future.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2166290007.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:58:46.251740

In a 2023 Christmas message, he claimed “All Electric Vehicle Lunacy” thugs, among others, were “looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL.” And even though he did end up buying an EV from his political mega-donor Elon Musk, Trump has tried to quash the American electric vehicle market, from halting funding for chargers to waiving fines for fuel efficiency violations.

But here’s the question: Are we getting to the point where EVs make sense even without the government? Electric vehicles are no longer the niche novelty they once were, and sales worldwide have been exploding since Trump last left office. In some countries new EVs are as common as gas cars—if not more. In China, EVs make up roughly 50% of new car sales. In Norway it’s nearly 90%.

So are we at a tipping point on EVs? Is the world just going to pick up momentum and leave the US in the dust? Or is there still a window in which Trump can slam on the brakes?

Throwing up Roadblocks

1. No more carrots. If you want EVs to take over, you need people to buy them. And one of the things that had been sweetening the deal for US car buyers was a hefty tax credit from the federal government—up to $7,500 on new electric vehicles. But that credit, which was supposed to go through 2032, got axed as part of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” And when it officially expired at the end of September, as experts were predicting, sales of electric vehicles subsequently plummeted. Estimates put their market share going from 12% to only 5% that month.

2. And no more sticks. Another way governments have tried to get more EVs on the road is targeting manufacturers. California, for example, had strict rules around air pollution, which required auto manufacturers to sell an increasing number of exhaust-free electric vehicles, up to 100% by 2035. But the Trump administration has now decreed that states can’t set their own rules on car emissions anymore. California sued, of course, but in the meantime Trump is trying to revoke the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas car emissions entirely. This all may make car makers look twice at whether they need to switch to EVs, or whether they can keep pumping out gas guzzlers.

3. The “Meh”-ing of America. There are signs that electric cars were already hitting some speed bumps. Polling last year suggested that, even before Trump took office, Americans were cooling on electric cars. Pew Research Center found that in 2024 only 29% of Americans said they would seriously consider an electric car for their next vehicle, down 9% compared to the previous year. One reason might be concern about the availability of charging stations. Another may be a sudden drop in confidence that EVs are actually better for the environment than gas cars: 20 percentage points since 2020! That’s a huge drop. Pew doesn’t get into why this drop happened, but it may have to do with worries about the harms of battery manufacturing. Yet the data doesn’t bear this out: EVs still handily beat gas engines in terms of climate impact over the course of their lifetime.

• • •

Not Slowing Down

1. The price is (nearly) right. So the loss of that $7,500 tax credit definitely hurts. But new electric vehicles have been getting cheaper over time, even without it. In fact, we’re now at the point where they may already be cheaper than gas cars when you add in the cost of fuel and wear-and-tear over the car’s lifetime. And we may be right at the start of what Forbes called a “perfect storm” of cheap raw materials, price wars, and a flood of affordable EV’s now coming out of China. If electric cars really reach a 1:1 buying price with gas cars (which may already be happening for some categories and countries, like SUVs in China), government tax incentives may not be needed for them to take over.

2. Out for delivery. Also, while personal EVs get most of the attention, they’re not the only kind of electric vehicle on the road. Many big companies like Amazon have switched at least part of their vehicle fleet over to electric, purchasing over $1 billion worth of Rivian vehicles in 2024 alone. And if battery prices continue to drop, it may make sense for even some heavy-duty tractor trailer operators to switch over. If these companies push for EVs, they have so much cash and weight behind them that the infrastructure and rest of the market may follow, even if individual consumers are still unsure.

3. The US is not the only market—and it’s not the biggest. While it looks as though U.S. auto makers are now walking back from visions of an all-electric future, they’re not closing up shop. In August, Ford announced they were investing a further $5 billion into electric vehicle production. Part of the logic might be that, while the U.S. is a major market, it’s not the only one. And even if the US cools down, the world at large is still pushing ahead. Globally, around 1-in-5 new cars sold is now electric. In China, that number is nearly 1-in-2. If U.S. automakers want to tap into those markets, they’ll need to be prepared to meet the demand.

• • •

What to Keep An Eye On

1. Battery tech. Batteries are the heart of electric vehicles, so any changes or breakthroughs in battery technology (like China’s all-solid-state battery, battery-swapping stations, or something more experimental) has the potential to really shake-up the EV market.

2. Chip shortages. While batteries are important, another component worth keeping an eye on are computer chips. Modern cars (both electric and gas to be fair) rely on a bevy of internal computers to function. In some ways, they have as much in common with a computer network as a steam engine. Shortages or supply chain issues around semiconductor chips could slow down production.

3. Changes to the electrical grid. If electric vehicles do take over, how will that change our electrical grid? We’ll need more chargers, for sure, but some experts are investigating even more interesting changes, as Anthropocene covered in September. One idea is whether we could use electric vehicles as on-grid energy storage (imagine an agreement to let the power company tap your car battery during high demand hours in exchange for lower rates later, for instance, or being able to power your house or even an entire neighborhood off car batteries during a blackout).",https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EV-momentum-final.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:58:49.672453

Key contributors to this 9M/2025 performance included the hydropower plants in Lao PDR, the San Buenaventura power plant in the Philippines, the Paju ES power plant in South Korea, and the U.S. power plants.","Electricity Generating Public Company Limited (SET: EGCO or EGCO Group), reported operating results for both the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2025, supported by strong cash flow and steady financial growth.

The performance was mainly driven by the outstanding operation of its hydropower plants in Lao PDR, an infrastructure solutions company “CDI Group” in Indonesia, and successful investments in the United States – collectively demonstrating EGCO Group’s effective asset management. Looking ahead, the company will continue expanding its portfolio of natural gas-fired and renewable power plants both domestically and internationally, reinforcing long-term growth and enhancing energy security throughout the energy transition.

Mr. Tawatchai Sumranwanich, President of EGCO Group, said, “The operating performance in the third quarter and the nine months of this year clearly underscores EGCO Group’s efficiency in managing our assets and investment portfolio, as well as our ability to strengthen our financial position amid numerous challenges in both domestic and international power and energy markets. During this period, EGCO Group has continued to make significant strategic moves, including the completion of a 49% acquisition of the 125 MW Wheatsborough Solar power plant in Ohio, the United States which is the second of two clean energy projects in the Pinnacle II Portfolio acquired by EGCO Group. In addition, EGCO Group has increased its stake in Linden Cogeneration, a 980 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, to 38%. This reinforces EGCO Group’s strategic presence in the U.S. power market.”

In Q3/2025, EGCO Group recognized a total revenue of THB 6,928 million, an operating profit of THB 844 million, and a net loss of THB 656 million. Key contributors of the operating profit were the strong performance of the two hydropower plants in Lao PDR – Nam Theun 2 and Xayaburi -supported by high water levels during the rainy season. Additional positive contributions came from international power plants, including Linden Cogen and Compass Portfolio in the United States, Paju ES in South Korea, San Buenaventura in the Philippines, as well as the infrastructure solutions company “CDI Group” in Indonesia. However, several factors significantly affected Q3/2025 results. These include the scheduled outage maintenance of the Quezon power plant in the Philippines in preparation for its commercial operation date (COD) on 26 October 2025, under the new Power Supply Agreement (PSA). The third quarter’s performance was also impacted by the effects of fair value measurement of financial instruments and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which are accounting-related items that are specific to the period and do not affect the long-term return generating potential.

For the nine-month period of 2025, EGCO Group posted a total revenue of THB 29,126 million, an operating profit of THB 4,348 million, and a net profit of THB 5,078 million. Key contributors to this 9M/2025 performance included the hydropower plants in Lao PDR, the San Buenaventura power plant in the Philippines, the Paju ES power plant in South Korea, and the U.S. power plants. The company also recognized gain from the divestment of its investments in the RISEC power plant in the United States and the Boco Rock Wind Farm in Australia. These divestments align with EGCO Group’s asset recycling strategy, under which assets are sold at an appropriate time and the proceeds reinvested in new projects to enhance value creation and support long-term growth.

Mr. Tawatchai added, “The outlook of the total operating performance in 2025 will be supported by revenue contributions from international projects in which the company has invested, including the Pinnacle II Portfolio with a combined capacity of 251 MW and the increased ownership interest in the Linden Cogen to 38%. The company also anticipates that its U.S. power assets will benefit from rising electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centers and AI-related industries, alongside generally positive electricity market conditions in the United States.”

In terms of new investments, EGCO Group continues to pursue strategic initiatives, including seeking investment opportunities within its core power business. The company is focusing on high-quality natural gas-fired and renewable energy projects that support its Net Zero emissions target. This includes investments through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as greenfield developments in markets where the company already operates and has strong local partners – particularly in the United States, a major strategic hub where EGCO Group has steadily expanded its presence over the past five years.

For domestic investments, the company is awaiting the results of the second round of the RE Big Lot, in which EGCO Group has been shortlisted for 11 projects with a combined installed capacity of 448 MW. The company is also exploring the feasibility of the direct PPA policy, which allows private-sector entities to purchase electricity directly from clean energy producers. This policy is expected to attract substantial investment from data center and AI businesses that require reliable and clean power.",https://www.kaohooninternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EGCO_2025-11-17_news.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 22:58:37.282825

In 2013, he founded Bernhard Capital Partners with Jenkins and a handful his former top executives from The Shaw Group.
“He provided opportunities to me and many others that changed the trajectories of our lives,” said Barfield, who went on to head CSRS in Baton Rouge.
The Shaw Group contributed $4 million to help fund the building's construction.","Jim Bernhard, a Baton Rouge-based business executive and civic leader who created and grew some of the most successful companies to come out of Louisiana, died Sunday after a brief illness, his family confirmed. He was 71.

During a career that spanned more than four decades, Bernhard was perhaps best known for founding and growing The Shaw Group from a pipe fabrication company into a publicly traded, industrial services powerhouse with a global footprint and a spot on the Fortune 500 list.

After selling the company in 2013, he founded Bernhard Capital Partners, a private equity firm that is now one of the largest in the Gulf South with more than $5.5 billion in assets under management and 21 companies across the country in the energy services, industrial and utilities sector.

Along the way, Bernhard played a prominent role in state Democratic Party politics, engaged in south Louisiana civic and charitable causes and was involved in the lives of his five children and grandchildren.

""We are heartbroken by the unexpected passing of Jim Bernhard,"" said Jeff Jenkins, who co-founded Bernhard Capital Partners and worked with Jim Bernhard for 27 years. ""Jim changed the business landscape of Louisiana like no one else. He created jobs, built companies and opened doors for families across our state in ways that will be felt for generations.""

Jenkins added: ""He was also one of the most generous people I have ever known, always helping others, without any desire for attention or recognition.""

Gov. Jeff Landry remembered Bernhard as one of Louisiana's ""most dynamic and visionary business leaders.""

""His hard work built companies that created jobs, strengthened our economy, and showcased the very best of Louisiana,"" Landry said in a statement. ""Louisiana has lost a giant, but I know his legacy will endure for generations.""

'Tough to sell'

James Mitchell Bernhard Jr. was born April 9, 1954, in Baton Rouge but raised in Lafayette, where his grandfather had started Bernhard Mechanical in 1919. Years later the company would become one of Bernhard Capital’s portfolio assets.

He graduated from LSU in 1976 with a degree in construction management and joined Sunland Services, a pipe fabrication company.

In 1987, he ventured out on his own, acquiring the assets of a pipe fabrication company out of bankruptcy and founding The Shaw Group. Known for his tireless work ethic, he grew the company over the next 25 years into one of Louisiana’s largest and best-known, taking it public in the early 2000s.

At the time of its sale to CB&I in 2013, The Shaw Group had $5.9 billion in revenues and 27,000 employees, including 4,000 in Louisiana.

The Shaw Group was one of Louisiana’s few Fortune 500 companies at the time — today it has even fewer — and in the early 2000s, Bernhard built a gleaming corporate headquarters tower on Essen Lane in Baton Rouge, visible from Interstate 10, which became a point of pride for Baton Rouge and the state.

During a 2018 radio interview on Talk Louisiana, host Jim Engster asked Bernhard whether it was tough for him to sell the Shaw Group, a company he started with two others and $50,000.

“In a public arena, when someone offers you a 75% premium over the value, you either sell the company to them or they get a new CEO.” Nonetheless, he added, “It was tough to sell.”

As significant as The Shaw Group was for Louisiana’s economy and reputation, Bernhard’s more recent venture has been equally important. In 2013, he founded Bernhard Capital Partners with Jenkins and a handful his former top executives from The Shaw Group. The firm began with a single investment fund and four companies focused narrowly on industrial services.

In the years since, Bernhard Capital has launched four additional funds that have raised $5.5 billion from large, institutional investors and created dozens of other companies, some of which it has since sold, in the energy services, industrial, environmental services and utility sector.

It currently has 21 companies under management and is the largest private equity firm between Houston and Atlanta. It has been listed among the largest private equity firms in the world and has some of the highest returns in the U.S.

Tim Barfield, who worked under Bernhard at The Shaw Group in the early 2000s, remembered him as a powerful force in the lives of many business leaders today.

“He provided opportunities to me and many others that changed the trajectories of our lives,” said Barfield, who went on to head CSRS in Baton Rouge. “He was so generous to our community and state. May he rest in peace.”

'Baton Rouge proud, Louisiana committed'

While the owner of a major business, Bernhard chaired Kathleen Blanco’s gubernatorial campaign in 2003 and became chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party in January 2005 while she was governor.

He resigned nine months later after Hurricane Katrina devastated metro New Orleans. Shaw secured contracts to become an important player in the rebuilding effort.

Still, he remained an active force in Louisiana Democratic politics and toyed with running for governor in 2015 and 2019. He deferred to fellow Democrat John Bel Edwards, who won both elections.

In a Talk Louisiana interview in 2018, Bernhard said people often asked him to run for governor, saying he was “the perfect candidate” because he had the ability to fund the campaign himself.

He didn’t describe his political approach in partisan terms. Instead, he said, “We need to work to solve problems, to solve issues. Let’s work together, compromise and move the ball forward.”

Bernhard said he had plenty of offers to set up shop outside of Baton Rouge but said he stayed because he loved the city and LSU, his alma mater.

He said his philosophy was “Baton Rouge proud and Louisiana committed.”

Philanthropy

Bernhard was known for his philanthropy across the state, though much of it was behind the scenes. One prominent exception was The Shaw Center for the Arts in Baton Rouge, a transformative project that helped revitalize the state capital's downtown two decades ago. The Shaw Group contributed $4 million to help fund the building's construction.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/e8/ae8934ad-4298-5489-b9e4-0b01373e126c/5e9d0a546cd62.image.jpg?crop=1211%2C636%2C0%2C389&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-16 22:00:27.548670

By Moses Akaigwe

More stakeholders in the domestic auto industry have lent their voices to the flurry of commendations that have been going to the Senate for the Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025 which recently scaled through the second reading in the Red Chamber.

Sponsored by the Senator representing Abia North, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, the bill is being commended as a piece of legislation that would guide Nigeria’s journey towards a greener, electrified mobility.

In the latest appreciation, Cedric Masters, Kia Motors Nigeria and Jet Motor Company, last week joined the growing number of automakers to thank the federal lawmakers for the initiative, even as some of the stakeholders also described electric vehicles as the future of mobility, especially in Nigeria and the African continent in general.

Congratulating the Senate and Senator Orji Kalu on the successful second reading of the bill, KIA Motors Nigeria stated that the draft law is in line with President Bola Tinubu’s green mobility initiative

Kia Motors’ commendation was contained in a press statement on Thursday in which the company observed that the bill is a transformative step that aligns perfectly with the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda and the nation’s transition toward sustainable mobility.

The press statement disclosed that as one of Nigeria’s foremost automobile and electric vehicle manufacturers, KIA Motors Nigeria has long anticipated the coming of a legal framework which the bill would lead to.

The automaker assured that with its vehicle assembly plant and commitment to over 70 percent local content production and inclusivity, the company is strategically positioned to support the country’s shift to cleaner, greener transportation.

According to the company, the Electric Vehicle bill would not only create thousands of skilled jobs but also stimulate local manufacturing, reduce the cost of electric vehicles, and power economic growth through sustainable innovation.

The Chief Executive Officer of KIA Motors Nigeria, Jacky Hathiramani. highlighted the likely impact of the legislation, saying,”This bill reflects a decisive commitment by the government of President Tinubu to secure Nigeria’s future through clean energy and industrial growth.

“KIA is fully aligned with this vision and remains ready to collaborate with government agencies, investors, and partners to accelerate the transition to electric mobility.”

”We also extend our deep appreciation to Dr Orji Uzor Kalu for championing the bill and to President Tinubu for his forward-thinking leadership and reaffirm our capacity and readiness to support the government’s implementation efforts, ensuring that Nigerians benefit from affordable, high-quality electric cars, buses and commercial vehicles assembled locally.”

The press statement further assured that with Kia Motors’ proven record of innovation, strong local workforce, and commitment to environmental sustainability, the company stands ready to drive the next chapter of Nigeria’s automotive revolution — one powered by clean energy, local talent, and the Renewed Hope Agenda.

Like Kia Motors, the management of Cedric Masters Group, which owns a Lagos- based auto assembly plant,, also lauded the introduction of the bill.

The Chairman of Cedric Masters Group, Chief Anselm Ilekuba, who is also the National Coordinator of ALCMAN (Automotive Local Content Manufacturers Association of Nigeria), eulogised the Senators for conceiving a legal compass for electric mobility in Nigeria.

Through ALCMAN, Chief Ilekuba has been in the vanguard of the efforts to boost auto parts manufacturing for vehicle production in Nigeria, while at the same time using Celtic Masters to contribute to driving the domestic auto industry towards developing electric vehicle technology.

The industrialist further remarked that it was heartwarming to note that the federal lawmakers were taking steps to encourage the efforts of investors in Nigeria’s auto sector who defy a very challenging atmosphere to operate

He was hopeful that supportive initiatives by the Federal Government, such as the bill by the Senate, would help investments like Cedric Masters’ assembly plant in the Lekki area of Lagos, where the JIM-ISUZU brand of vehicles are produced.

Apart from the rugged 2.4 litre JIM ISUZU Re-Max 4×4 pick-up which has already started making a mark in the light commercial vehicles market as a reliable work horse, Cedric Masters is also ushering into the Nigerian market the Leapmotor brand known for its affordable and tech-focused new energy vehicles (NEVs).

The company is also introducing in the local market the Voyah brand of luxury electric vehicles.

The Cedric Masters Group Chairman also stated, “Our subsidiary, Cedric Clean Energy Solution, which has an electric charge station assembly plant in Lekki, Lagos State, sees this bill as a wonderful development and calls for greater stakeholder involvement, especially with NADDC and ALCMAN.”

“I commend Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for this laudable bill which shows vision and will serve as a cursor to the long-awaited Nigerian Automotive Industry Development Programme.”

The Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025 was also analysed by Engr. Derek Ewelukwa, the Managing Director of Jet Motor Company, Nigeria’s first electric bus assembler with a plant also in Lekki, Lagos.

Ewelukwa, commended Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for being very thoughtful,, and called for all hands to be on deck to ensure that the draft is passed and signed into law (an act) at the end of the normal process.

He listed the areas in which the act would impact on the industry, including encouraging domestic production and assembly of electric vehicles, which would in turn generate employment opportunities and decrease reliance on imports; as well as speed up the uptake of electric vehicles by private citizens, companies, and public institutions.

The implementation would also lead to the building of a countrywide network of charging stations that incorporate renewable energy sources, in addition to cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric pollution, and dependence on petroleum-based fuels.

The Jet Motor MD, said: “Overall, if the purpose of this bill is achieved, and the shift to EV adoption happens successfully amongst the citizens, it would be a significant relief to the cost of transportation.

“The long term cost of owning and using an EV is significantly lower than that of a comparable ICE vehicle.

“The only immediate drawback I see is that its success hinges on stable electricity supply and affordability of EVs. Without robust financing options, adoption may remain low.

“This is where the Federal Government and its agencies will have to come in and spur up the space by injecting substantial cash into charging infrastructure development as well as tax holidays, subsidies, and waivers for EV businesses. These savings will in turn be passed on to potential EV owners.”

Recalling his personal experience with electric vehicles back in the US in 2021 when he switched his Tesla vehicles from consuming fossil fuel to full battery EV,, Engr. Ewelukwa said he has been “a big advocate of EVs from day one.”

He gleefully remarked, “In my opinion, EVs are the future of the auto industry. Since relocating back to Nigeria, I found it difficult and unsustainable to drive ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. So much so that I had to bring back one of my Tesla vehicles to Nigeria. I currently use this vehicle comfortably in Abuja.”

When the proposed legislation had its second reading on Wednesday, November 5, 2025, at the Senate,the lawmakers overwhelmingly supported Senator Orji Kalu, describing the initiative as a necessary step to diversify the economy and align with global clean energy trends.

The bill targets to provide tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, and subsidies for electric vehicle users and investors; and make it mandatory for all fuel stations to install charging points

When it becomes an act, it would require foreign automakers seeking to sell electric vehicles in Nigeria to partner with licensed local assemblers and establish domestic assembly plants within three years.

It also aims to compel companies to source at least 30 percent of their components locally by 2030, while violations could attract fines of up to 250 million naira per breach, even as unlicensed importers risk penalties of 500 million naira and confiscation of goods.

The act which is expected to position Nigeria as a potential hub for electric vehicles production in Africa, would incentivise investors who establish charging infrastructure by availing them with government grants and tax credits.",https://d1jcea4y7xhp7l.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1002019882.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 22:58:32.227156

House Republicans won’t stop fighting to unleash American energy and keep the U.S. energy dominant by cutting Biden-era energy-crushing and job-killing regulations.","Keeping Violent Criminals Off D.C.’s Streets

Currently, the District of Columbia has a cashless bail policy that prohibits using cash bail as a condition for pre-trial release. This reckless policy allows soft-on-crime progressive judges to release dangerous criminals onto the streets of D.C. with only a promise to not re-offend and show up for their future court date, resulting in multiple arrests and putting public safety at risk.

We cannot allow dangerous criminals to roam the streets freely and threaten the safety of everyone in our nation’s capital while they await trial. It’s past time for D.C. to abandon its soft-on-crime policies and make sure those charged with committing violent crimes remain behind bars to ensure the safety of law-abidding Americans.

This week, House Republicans are continuing our fight to make D.C. safe for visitors and residents by bringing forward legislation that keeps violent and dangerous criminals off our streets.

Our bill would amend the current D.C. Code to mandate the detention of individuals charged with violent and dangerous offenses and implement cash bail for crimes that threaten public safety, such as aggravated assault and obstruction of justice. This legislation codifies Executive Action taken by President Trump to clean up D.C. crime and make our nation’s capital safe again.

Rep. Elise Stefanik’s legislation, H.R. 5214, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, amends D.C.’s pre-trial release and detention processes to require mandatory pre-trial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes and for cash bail or bail bonds for defendants charged with certain crimes concerning public safety and order.

Our nation’s capital should set the standard on combatting crime and be safely accessible to the American people – House Republicans are working with President Trump to ensure that’s the case.

Supporting Police Officers and Cleaning Up our Nation’s Capital

While crime skyrocketed in our nation’s capital, Democrats went after the police working to protect the community instead of the criminals putting Americans at risk. In 2022, the D.C. Council passed their Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022, imposing harmful restrictions and requirements on the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) rather than supporting our men and women in uniform.

The D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 allows police officers to be targeted by protestors, bans officers from watching body-camera footage when writing initial incident reports, demands a jury to consider if an officer consulted with mental health, behavioral health, or social workers prior to the use of deadly force, dismisses officers and police union representatives from the Police Complaints Board, and strips officers of collective bargaining rights regarding discipline.

Under the D.C. Council’s emergency legislative powers, these harmful policies have been in place since 2020; meanwhile, D.C. police staffing reached the half-century low as homicides rose to their highest number since 1997. Additionally, juvenile crime in the District has reached historic levels while truancy grows.

Congress has a duty to oversee the governance of D.C. and make sure the MPD is able to effectively fight crime and keep Washingtonians and visitors safe. President Trump has taken significant strides to clean up D.C. streets and make our capital safe again, and House Republicans are likewise committed to restoring law and order in the District. This week, we are bringing forward legislation to reverse dangerous anti-police measures in the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 to deliver the support our law enforcement needs.

Rep. Andrew Clyde’s legislation, H.R. 5107, the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC (CLEAN DC) Act, repeals the D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 which placed harmful and burdensome requirements on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

House Republicans will always stand with our men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe. Who will Democrats stand with: the police or the criminals?

Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism

Socialism is one of the most destructive ideologies in world history, time and time again proving itself to be a failed experiment that only leads to communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships.

More than 100 million people have been killed as a result of the mass murders and famines that accompany failed socialist states. For example, tens of millions of people died during the Bolshevik Revolution, between 15 and 55 million people died of starvation in the wake of famine caused by China’s Great Leap Forward, over one million people were brutally murdered in Cambodia’s killing fields as a result of their socialist experiment, at least 3.5 million people have starved in North Korea, and more.

Despite the proven dangers of socialism, America is seeing a troubling rise in the harmful ideology, especially with our youth – most recently culminating in the election of radical socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City.

Since 2016, more Democrats have held positive views of socialism than of capitalism, with 66 percent of Democrats now viewing socialism favorably, while only 42 percent view capitalism favorably. Additionally, socialism has seen a rebirth with American youth: 62 percent of Americans between the ages 18 to 29 hold a favorable view of socialism, and 34 percent of communism.

Socialism and the abuses it leads to go against everything our Founding Fathers stood for. We cannot allow history to be ignored and the threat of socialism to grow unchallenged in America. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that denounces the horrors of socialism and reaffirms our commitment to uphold the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness.

H. Con. Res. 58, introduced by Congresswoman Maria Salazar, describes the horrors perpetrated by socialist regimes, denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.

Every member of the House of Representatives should unequivocally condemn socialism in all its forms – will Democrats stand up for American values or cave to the radicals in their base?

Streamlining Permitting for LNG Exports and Facilitating American Energy Dominance

In January 2024, the Biden Administration announced they would be halting approvals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, despite previous studies showing that American LNG exports create net public benefits, protect global energy security, create American jobs, and reduce emissions.

This disastrous decision was a blatant political ploy to satisfy radical climate activists dead set on shutting down American energy production, even though banning LNG exports only increases our dependency on hostile foreign adversaries. It also severely harms our national security, discouraging foreign investment in American LNG production and empowering Russia and Iran to influence LNG prices on the global stage.

Thankfully, the Trump Administration has been working to undo the damage done by the Biden Administration, issuing at least three final LNG export authorizations, and U.S. developers have made final investment decisions on six LNG export projects worth more than $70 billion.

Currently, anyone wanting to import or export U.S. natural gas must get multiple permits, obtaining first approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct, operate, and expand the LNG facility, and second authorization from the Department of Energy (DOE) to import or export natural gas to non-free trade agreement (non-FTA) countries.

We must continue encouraging American energy production and providing our allies with a secure energy source, not making it harder to export American energy with burdensome bureaucracy. House Republicans are bringing legislation to streamline the export permitting process, unleash domestic production and exports, and protect our national security.

Rep. August Pfluger’s legislation, H.R. 1949, the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act, lifts restrictions on the import and export of natural gas and streamlines the permitting process by getting rid of the requirement for the DOE to authorize exports and giving FERC total authority over the approval process, facilitating American energy dominance and lowering costs.

Will Democrats once again put radical climate activists above the energy security and economic prosperity of the American people, or will they stand with us in our fight to lower energy costs for workers and families?

Expanding U.S. Refinery Capacity and Shoring Up Energy Security

Global demand for liquid fuels is increasing, with demand expected to rise by about 20 million barrels per day by 2050 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). However, under the Biden Administration’s anti-American energy policies and crushing regulations, refineries and America’s refining capacity have suffered.

From 2020 to 2022, the number of U.S. refineries – which are crucial for American energy security, converting crude oil into vital petroleum products and fueling our nation – declined from 135 to 128 and refinery capacity decreased by more than one million barrels of fuel per day. This has resulted in increased refining dependency on foreign nations.

We cannot continue to rely on foreign supplies and risk American energy and national security to appease radical environmentalists. U.S. refineries are vital to our energy independence and to providing the fuels that power America.

House Republicans are bringing legislation to require the National Petroleum Council to study and collect essential information on the role petrochemical refineries play in America and examine opportunities to expand our refinery capacity while identifying risks to refineries.

H.R. 3109, the Researching Efficient Federal Improvements for Necessary Energy Refining (REFINER) Act, introduced by Rep. Bob Latta, bolsters U.S. energy security, reliability, and affordability by requiring the National Petroleum Council to study opportunities and provide recommendations to expand American refining capacity.

House Republicans won’t stop working to bolster America’s energy security by unleashing domestic production and ensuring an abundance of affordable and reliable energy in the U.S.

Reversing Biden’s Lock-Up of National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska

In 2022, Biden’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) replaced a 2020 Trump Administration plan for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) with one that shuts down domestic energy production on the reserve, killing jobs, hurting Alaskan communities, and threatening our energy security.

The Biden BLM’s disastrous 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for NPR-A bars oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve – an area specifically designated by Congress for energy production – leaving only 52 percent open for domestic production.

With this harmful plan, the Biden Administration put their “Green New Scam” agenda before the Alaskan people and the wellbeing of our country, ignoring the views of Alaska Native leaders in the region and imposing federal red-tape that blocks some of the state’s best resource development opportunities. The economic impacts from crushing development will only harm Alaska and hardworking Americans, cutting down on the good paying jobs and economic benefits that come with domestic production.

This week, House Republicans are bringing legislation to reverse this burdensome and damaging Biden-era plan to lock up NPR-A. It’s past time we unlock Alaska’s full potential and unleash its extensive energy resources, safeguarding jobs, shoring up energy security, and lowering costs for Americans.

Sen. Dan Sullivan’s legislation, S.J. Res. 80, reverses the Biden Bureau of Land Management's 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska that blocks oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve, hurting energy production and crushing job creation.

House Republicans continue working to undo the damage the Biden Administration did to our energy sector and, in turn, our national security.

Reversing a Biden-Era RMP Amendment Crushing the Buffalo Coal Industry

Last November, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) Amendment for the Buffalo Field Office located in Buffalo, Wyoming, which guides the management of BLM lands, including land use allocations of areas available for further coal leasing consideration and those that are not.

Staying consistent with their radical ‘Green New Scam’ policies and anti-American energy agenda, the Biden Administration’s RMP Amendment locked up all 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate administered by the Buffalo Field Office, allocating ZERO acres of BLM administered coal as available and making 48.12 billion short tons of coal unavailable for leasing consideration.

Wyoming produces around 40 percent of the nation’s coal, and the industry supports over 4,000 jobs in rural Wyoming, $1.9 billion in labor output through 2048, and millions of dollars in state revenue used to fund public education. This radical RMP Amendment essentially ended coal leasing in the area with the BLM accepting no new coal lease applications – crushing domestic energy production, endangering access to affordable, reliable American energy, killing jobs, and harming the economy in Wyoming.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to overturn the Biden BLM’s disastrous RMP Amendment that crushes domestic production in Wyoming, unleashing American energy development, keeping energy prices affordable and reliable, and protecting Wyoming jobs and economy.

H.J. Res. 130, introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, reverses the rule submitted by Biden’s Bureau of Land Management relating to “Buffalo Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment” that threatens Americans’ access to affordable and reliable energy by locking up 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate, preventing future coal leasing, and blocking access to 48 billion short-tons of coal in Wyoming.

Energy security is national security. House Republicans won’t stop fighting to unleash American energy and keep the U.S. energy dominant by cutting Biden-era energy-crushing and job-killing regulations.",https://www.majorityleader.gov/images/majorityleader-meta.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 02:59:05.574271

That's why many investment disclosures warn that past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns.

Tesla (TSLA +0.59%) is one such stock. Potential shareholders no doubt look at its returns of 2,900% over the past decade and wonder, ""What if?""

But there are signs that the electric vehicle dominance Tesla once enjoyed has come to an end, and falling earnings coupled with rising costs could hamper the company's growth. That said, Tesla is pursuing new opportunities -- including autonomous systems and robotics -- that have lots of potential

Here's how Tesla is positioning itself for the future and why buying the stock probably won't set you up for life.

Tesla is making big bets on its future

While Tesla's core business is selling electric vehicles, Elon Musk has said that the company's future will be focused on autonomous vehicles (AVs) and humanoid robotics. There's some logic to this bet considering that the global robotaxi industry could reach an estimated $1.4 trillion by 2040 and humanoid robotics are expected to be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050.

The company has already made some progress on these fronts. Tesla has some semi-autonomous capabilities in its vehicles, and the company has a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with human safety drivers in the vehicles. Musk recently stated that safety drivers will be removed in certain parts of Austin in the coming months, and the service will be operational in eight to 10 cities by the end of this year.

What's more, Tesla is already working on the third version of its humanoid robot, called Optimus, which will begin production toward the end of 2026. The company only has hundreds of Optimus bots right now, but one goal that's part of Musk's massive trillion-dollar pay package requires delivering over 1 million bots over the next decade.

It's these prospects that have some investors hoping Tesla's best days might be ahead of it.

Achieving its goals is going to be very expensive

But Tesla is currently facing an uphill battle on multiple fronts. First, the company's earnings declined significantly in the third quarter, with non-GAAP earnings per share falling 31% to $0.50 per share. Its operating margin also dropped dramatically from 10.8% in the year-ago quarter to just 5.8% now.

While the company got a temporary boost in vehicle sales as customers rushed to buy electric vehicles before the EV tax credits expired, the EV industry is now under tremendous pressure now that they're gone. That's coming at a very bad time for Tesla as it ramps up spending to invest in AVs and robotics.

For example, Tesla's research and development costs rose dramatically by 57% to $1.6 billion in the most recent quarter. And there will likely be much more spending if Tesla wants to accomplish its goals of expanding AVs to new cities and building millions of humanoid robots.

It will take billions of dollars more in investments in the coming years for Tesla to make progress on its goals, and if history is an indicator, the company will likely take longer to achieve them than initially planned.

Why Tesla stock probably won't set you up for life

Tesla could achieve its AV and robotics goals, but it will burn through substantial cash to do so, and there's certainly no guarantee of success. Most importantly, it's betting on these two new markets at a time when the company's profitability is declining and the EV industry is facing significant hurdles due to the loss of EV credits.

It's also worth mentioning that Tesla's stock is currently extremely expensive. Its shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 297, which is far above the S&P 500's average P/E ratio of approximately 31.

SOMMER: Insurance is a key motivation, she says, for incentivizing fire-prone communities to prevent disasters.","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

California is no stranger to extreme weather. This weekend, the state was hit by a huge storm system, forcing evacuations. It's these type of weather events and wildfires in particular that are driving up the prices of home insurance. That's especially true in Northern California's Lake County, where many companies are just canceling policies. Now community leaders are working to reduce the risks from wildfires. But as Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk reports, many of the insurance companies aren't taking note.

LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Penny Sidhu is getting a home makeover, which she feels like she won out of the blue.

PENNY SIDHU: I have no words. I'm just, like, shocked.

SOMMER: But it's not a makeover you'd notice standing in her front yard in Kelseyville, California, surrounded by rolling hills.

SIDHU: There's screens on top of the gutters. So now I have new gutters with screens on them so the debris can't get in.

SOMMER: Sidhu's house has been made over to protect against wildfires. She's part of a new California program to make homes less likely to burn. After evacuating from fires three times in the last nine years, Sidhu got concerned about overgrown brush between her and her neighbor's house.

SIDHU: You couldn't even see her roof. Like, it was like our houses were connected. There was huge trees and bushes.

SOMMER: She found out she was eligible for the Lake County Home Hardening Program, which uses state and federal funding. Deanna Fernweh, the program manager, set up an inspection to look for vulnerabilities like those bushes.

DEANNA FERNWEH: So if those were to combust, it would catch both of their roofs on fire. And so we removed all of the vegetation.

SOMMER: It's about protecting the house from embers - tiny bits of burning debris carried by the wind far from a wildfire itself.

FERNWEH: More than 90% of homes catch on fire due to embers, not direct flame. So that is what we highly focus on.

SOMMER: Fernweh's team removed the bark mulch near the walls of Sidhu's house and put in gravel. She'll get a metal gate in her side yard instead of wood.

SIDHU: I would never have been able to afford this. There's just no way I could do it. Especially I'm by myself. There's just no way.

SOMMER: Many of Sidhu's neighbors are in the same boat. The county has a lot of lower-income households. But some have gotten wildfire improvements too because the state program is focused on this neighborhood. Wildfire risk goes way down when many homes participate together. Sidhu hopes that insurance companies will notice that.

SIDHU: People are having such a hard time getting insurance on their houses right now. My daughter just bought a house in Crescent City, and it was a nightmare to get insurance.

SOMMER: But there are no guarantees that companies will keep insuring Sidhu and her neighbors.

JESSICA PYSKA: This insurance crisis is hitting everywhere.

SOMMER: Jessica Pyska is on the Lake County Board of Supervisors. She says in the last decade, about 70% of Lake County has burned. She lost her own home in 2015. And insurance has become a huge problem. Some residents are seeing rates double or are being dropped by their insurance companies.

PYSKA: I know a lot of people that are just going without insurance right now.

SOMMER: Pyska says the county is trying to reduce the wildfire risk with a range of projects. They've improved evacuation routes. They worked with federal and state agencies to reduce flammable vegetation in the forests around them. And there's the home improvement program.

PYSKA: People are trying to do everything that they possibly can to get their rates lower, but it's really not helping much.

SOMMER: Some insurance companies are offering small discounts - 5- or 10% - for homeowners that make their houses safer, but companies don't have to consider the work a whole community does to reduce their risk.

PYSKA: How do we get to the point where the insurers are saying, there's a much lower risk here community-wide - we'll come back, and we'll lower the rates or maybe not raise the rates quite so much.

SOMMER: That problem comes down to information. Nancy Watkins is a consulting actuary with Milliman, a risk analysis firm.

NANCY WATKINS: To really understand if the risk has been reduced, an insurance company would theoretically need information about what my neighbors had done. That's very difficult for an insurance company to know about or to verify.

SOMMER: It's something Watkins is trying to change. She's helping start the Wildland Urban Interface Data Commons. It would aggregate all the community wildfire projects into a big database, one that insurance companies can use to see where the wildfire risk is getting better. She says there's a lot to figure out about how it will work, like protecting consumer privacy and getting insurance companies on board. But it could help those companies provide discounts where they don't right now.

WATKINS: As long as there's a disconnect between what people and communities do to reduce their risk and what they're experiencing from their insurance companies, if that disconnect persists, there's this bias to do nothing. People think, nothing that I do will matter.

SOMMER: Insurance is a key motivation, she says, for incentivizing fire-prone communities to prevent disasters.

With the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) phasing out at the end of 2025, the market faces a moment of recalibration. This will likely mean a short-term decline, but it’s far from a death knell for the industry. After all, while incentives may fade, energy demand is projected to rise sharply over the next few years and decades. And we simply can’t meet that demand without abundant, affordable, resilient, and transparent clean energy. The challenge now is ensuring that solar remains accessible and economically viable without federal incentives.

COMMENTARY

What Happens When Incentives Disappear

The phase-out of the ITC will be a stress test for the solar industry. Nearly half (45%) of Americans say they could not afford solar without federal incentives, and another 33% say it would be a financial stretch. Together, these findings suggest that roughly three-quarters of households would find solar difficult or impossible to afford without financial support. Income disparities deepen the divide: 39% of low-income households would not consider solar, compared to 13% of households earning more than $100,000 (Aurora Solar, 2025).

Yet, despite being one of the most effective clean energy incentives in U.S. history, 43% of Americans say they have heard of the ITC but don’t understand what it does, and one in three have never heard of it at all (Aurora Solar, 2025). Among those who are aware of the credit, 82% underestimated its 30% value, believing it was less than 20%.

So, for many homeowners, the ITC’s expiration may not feel like a loss because they never realized the benefit existed. For installers and developers, its end marks a shift toward strategies that can sustain adoption without depending on tax policy.

The Economics of a Post-ITC Market

The next chapter of solar has to depend less on subsidies and more on innovation. According to Ohm Analytics, residential solar demand is projected to drop by 26% in 2026, with cash- and loan-based purchases declining by nearly half, while third-party ownership (TPO) rises from 45% of installs in 2025 to nearly 70% in 2026. This shift indicates that consumers are seeking financing options that lower upfront risk and simplify decision-making.

On the installer side, the end of the ITC brings new pressure to control costs. Although hardware prices have declined significantly over the years, soft costs remained stubbornly high. They now account for nearly two-thirds of total project expenses, driven by permitting delays, change orders, and customer cancellations (MIT Energy Initiative). Industry data show that change orders alone can add up to roughly $1,200 per project, or about $200,000 annually for a mid-sized installer. Companies that streamline workflows, increase transparency in quoting, and integrate automation into design processes are positioned to succeed in this leaner, post-incentive environment.

The Policy-Proof Future of Solar

If the past two decades of federal support built the foundation for solar adoption, the next two will test its resilience. And the industry is already adapting to become “policy-proof.”

Installers are adopting AI-powered design tools that cut change orders by up to 90%, expanding point-of-sale financing, and providing clear, validated pricing in proposals. This not only cuts costs, but helps solve a persistent problem: According to the Aurora Solar 2025 Solar Snapshot, 41% of homeowners say it is difficult to find a trustworthy installer. By embracing technology and transparency installers can start to close this trust gap and gain consumer confidence in the years ahead.

Things outside the industry’s control could also lend a hand. We’re still in an era of high interest rates, and solar could benefit if they continue to come down: 67% of Millennials and Gen Z say they would be more likely to purchase or finance solar if rates declined, compared to 47% overall (Aurora Solar, 2025). This points to a larger insight, though. Multiple, innovative financing options and transparent business models that meet younger buyers where they are key to a strong solar industry.

Not Shrinking, But Maturing

As the ITC sunsets, we need to shift our focus from what’s ending to what’s beginning. Demand for electrification, energy storage, and distributed generation continues to grow, ensuring that solar will become even more critical to meeting the U.S.’s energy needs. McKinsey projects that total U.S. electricity demand will rise by nearly 25% by 2030, driven by electric vehicles, heat pumps, and expanded domestic manufacturing. That growth cannot be met without distributed solar.

The ITC may be coming to an end, but the momentum it created endures. The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pexels-rooftop-solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 19:58:23.297167

Red Oak: Google’s second Texas data center campus is now online Google announced its Red Oak data center in 2023—its second in the state.","Google announced its largest-ever investment in any U.S. state on Friday, committing $40 billion to Texas through 2027 to add three new data center campuses and make the Lone Star State a centerpiece of its global AI data center footprint.

The announcement came at Google’s data center facility in Midlothian, where Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai joined Gov. Greg Abbott, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey, and Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy.

“We are making a new $40 billion investment in the Lone Star State,” Pichai said at the event. “This includes plans for three new data center campuses, one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County.”

The investment bundles cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, energy capacity initiatives, continued buildout in North Texas, and workforce training programs.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state,” Abbott said. “Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.” The investment, he said, is “Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.”

Google makes Texas its AI infrastructure anchor

“Texas will be the centerpiece for AI data centers for Google,” said Abbott.

Pichai explained why Texas was selected for the massive investment. “Data centers of that scale require a few things: good, pro-innovation regulatory environments, land, and especially energy,” he said in Midlothian. “Happily, we found all three in Texas.”

Thanking Abbott for “leading the way,” Pichai added, “They say everything is bigger in Texas, and I think that applies to the golden opportunity with AI, the optimism, the talent, the policy environment, and the innovation needed to lead this new era and create immense benefits for everyone.”

The multi-billion-dollar investment will “create thousands of jobs, provide skills training to college students and electrical apprentices, and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas,” he said.

The three new West Texas data centers expand Google’s data center footprint, which already includes Ellis County campuses in Midlothian and Red Oak. Google has maintained a Texas presence for more than 15 years, Pichai said, with thousands of employees across the state and offices in Dallas, Austin, and Houston.

Net-positive power additions to the grid and Google’s “first industrial park”

Energy strategy emerged as a central theme of the announcement, with Google committing to be a net-positive contributor to the Texas grid as it builds out new AI infrastructure.

“When we invest in data centers, part of our core strategy is to invest significantly in new energy capacity, which increases supply and ensures grid abundance for everyone,” Pichai said from the podium. “In Texas, we work with local utility partners to add more than 6,200 megawatts of net new energy generation and capacity to the grid to keep costs low.”

According to Google’s news release, the company has power purchase agreements with energy developers such as AES Corporation, Enel North America, Clearway, ENGIE, Intersect, SB Energy, Ørsted, and X-Elio.

Abbott noted Google has provided a net new addition of five gigawatts of power to the Texas grid so far — and committed to be net positive to the power grid as the build continues, “making sure we have the reliability and the supply that Texas needs to keep the lights on for all of our fellow Texans.”

In terms of energy scale, 5 gigawatts is equivalent to 5,000 megawatts.

One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built directly alongside a new solar and battery energy storage plant. Pichai said Google’s first industrial park, developed through a partnership with Intersect Power, will be co-located at the Haskell data center. “Co-locating energy supply with data center load has some powerful benefits. It can unlock the development of new transmission infrastructure and optimize utilization of the existing grid,” he said.

Google announced its industrial park partnership with Intersect and TPG Rise Climate last year, described as a strategic collaboration to develop “powered land” to allow the data center to run mostly on carbon-free electricity produced nearby.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy on AI’s power demands

James Danly, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy and the second-highest official at the Department of Energy, used the Midlothian announcement to zoom out to the national stakes of AI’s rising power needs.

“We’re going to need 100 gigawatts over the next number of years in order to satisfy the demand as we projected,” he said, noting the investment comes “at the same time as the President’s agenda focuses on ensuring safe, reliable, affordable, secure power for everybody, in abundance.”

In the company’s news release, Danly framed Google’s move as directly tied to that agenda. “This historic investment from Google advances this administration’s goal of winning the AI race,” he said in a statement. “Google is working to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance, economic competitiveness and national security while ensuring that energy remains reliable, affordable and secure.”

Danly also pointed to Texas policy as a key enabler of projects on this scale. “This is a state that has ensured energy abundance for everybody. It has made it possible to deploy new resources rapidly,” he said. “This is a model for how such projects should be done going forward, and the United States is going to be put in a very good position as a result of such projects.”

Pichai also tied the announcement to federal policy and thanked the administration. “We won’t be here without the leadership of President Trump and the White House AI action plan,” he said.

‘We’ve known how great it is’

With the announcement just a few days after Veterans Day, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey opened his remarks by sharing Danly’s service record with the crowd. He reminded them that Danly went to Yale, joined the Army, and that the two men served in Iraq at the same time in 2006, where Danly was in combat and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

Ellzey—a Republican representing Texas’ 6th Congressional District, including Midlothian and the surrounding area—kept his remarks close to home and tied the moment back to the people on stage.

“You’ve come a long way from Madras to Midlothian, and we’re glad that you’re here,” Ellzey told the Google CEO, noting that Pichai took over the company the same year Abbott became governor. “Who knew that today we would be talking about this $40 billion investment in Texas, but also in Midlothian. For many, many years, we’ve known how great it is, and now you guys are seeing it too.”

He also reminded the audience that Abbott’s own story runs through North Texas, pointing out that the governor is from nearby Duncanville and, as a high school senior, was voted “most likely to succeed.”

Ellzey then described the campus for those who hadn’t had a tour. About a year ago, he said, he walked through the buildings behind the stage and was struck by how familiar they felt. “I walked in and said, this looks exactly like an aircraft carrier,” he recalled.

When he asked who the workers were, he was told, “We were nuclear sailors in the United States,” adding that much of the technology is similar to that of a nuclear aircraft carrier. “So you have a very highly skilled, talented group of people working here.”

From there, Ellzey turned to how the project came together and the locals who helped land it.

The congressman named more than a dozen current and former Midlothian mayors and city council members, along with City Manager Chris Dick and others, for supporting the development. “This doesn’t happen without local leaders, citizens, and the employees of Alphabet and Google,” he said. “We all know Midlothian is a great place. Now the rest of the world knows too.”

Then he addressed a question on many minds: How do you power all this?

“A lot of people worry about these data centers. Where is the power going to come from?” he said. “We’re working together with the state, [with Google], and with the Secretary of Energy, to make sure that these places are powered on their own.”

Ellzey summed up what the investment means for residents in a statement released alongside the event. “Google’s investment here in Midlothian is a real boost for our community. It brings good jobs, new opportunities, and steady growth for families across our district,” he said. “Texas keeps showing why it’s the place to build and invest: low taxes, a strong workforce, and a can-do spirit you won’t find anywhere else.”

$30 million energy impact fund for affordability and energy workforce

Beyond the three new data centers, Pichai also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund starting in 2026.

“This fund is designed to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas,” Pichai said. “For the next three years, starting in 2026, we’ll work with community partners and local organizations with a focus on energy costs, weatherization for homes and public schools, and building the energy workforce of the future.”

Google said it will establish a funding application process for community partners and local organizations.

In a news release, the company also detailed water and agriculture commitments tied to the expansion. Once complete, the three new facilities in Armstrong and Haskell counties will use advanced air-cooling technology, limiting water use to site operations such as kitchens, Google said.

Beyond its direct operations, Google is contributing $2.6 million to help Texas Water Trade create and enhance up to 1,000 acres of wetlands along the Trinity–San Jacinto Estuary and deliver approximately 300 million gallons of freshwater annually in southeastern Texas.

Additionally, Google said it is providing more than $2 million to support agriculture in Texas, including a regenerative agriculture program with Indigo Ag in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and an irrigation efficiency project with N-Drip in the Texas High Plains, according to the company.

AI Opportunity Fund: Training 1,700-plus electricians by 2030

The new AI and energy infrastructure will need trained people to build and maintain it, Pichai said.

Google’s workforce development strategy aims to increase the projected pipeline of new electricians in Texas by nearly 110%. “Our data center investments increase the need for electricians to help build that workforce pipeline,” Pichai said. “We are supporting the electrical training ALLIANCE (etA), which will train more than 1,700 new apprentices by 2030.”

That education effort will receive funding from Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund, according to the company. The initiative aims to boost the number of apprentices in Texas, integrate AI tools into the training curriculum, and train both existing electrical workers and apprentices in the state.

“Our country, our world, is going to be hinged to electrons,” Abbott said. The engineers and electricians who will be getting this education, will be needed, “literally, for the rest of their lives,” he added.

Free AI training: Google AI for Education Accelerator

The workforce development builds on the work Google is doing with leading institutions in the state that help prepare students with critical AI and job ready skills, Pichai told attendees.

“We are giving Longhorns, Aggies, Bobcats, and many other Texas-based college students access to Google career certificates and AI training courses at no cost,” he said, adding there’s “no in-state rivalry here.”

According to Google, The University of Texas, Texas A&M, and Texas State University systems, along with Dallas College and South Texas College, are among the universities and colleges in the first cohort of the Google AI for Education Accelerator, giving students, faculty, and staff no-cost access to Google Career Certificates and AI training courses.

Google also committed $7 million in grants to support AI-related initiatives in healthcare, energy, and education across Texas. That includes helping CareMessage enhance rural healthcare access, enabling The University of Texas at Austin and Texas Tech University to address energy challenges, and expanding AI training for Texas educators and students through support to Houston Community College.

To date, Google said it has provided funding to local organizations that have trained more than 1 million residents in digital skills, the company said.

Thousands of construction and permanent jobs

Pichai said the company also supports “countless more jobs” across the state through its work with local businesses. The company’s investments and technologies helped provide more than $50 billion of activity for Texas businesses, nonprofits, publishers, creators, and developers in 2024, according to the company.

Google said it is continuing to invest in its existing Ellis County data centers in Midlothian and Red Oak, as it builds out its three new West Texas facilities. The company’s continued investment in Texas projects over many years will also support thousands of construction jobs, Pichai said.

“This project will do nothing but expand Texas’ lead nationally for new jobs,” Abbott said, noting the state’s continued number one rankings for the most new jobs, the best state for doing business, and the most economic development projects.

“We appreciate all the jobs that you’re bringing here, but equally appreciate the training, the high skilled level training is going to be needed to fulfill these jobs, he said.

Abbott also leaned into the idea of the state as a fast-moving partner.

“Texas is a partner with our businesses, large and small, and we will insist on continuing to move at the speed of business so that you will finish this project ahead of schedule and under budget,” Abbott said.

AI powering everyday Texas businesses

Abbott moved the conversation from megawatts and megaprojects to everyday life.

“Some people are confused about what AI really does, and this term ‘hyperscalers,'” he said. “Your local McDonald’s is going to be using it to better enable their business to function. Your local stores, your local grocery stores, your local HEB, and things like that are all going to be operating better because of AI generated right here in the middle of Texas.”

Pichai connected the same dots from Google’s side of the house, tying the new infrastructure to services people already use.

“Data centers power the Google products people use every day: search, YouTube, maps, and the Gemini app,” he said. “And now they are powering an exciting new era of AI innovation that is leading scientific breakthroughs, including new cancer therapies and drug discoveries.”

Pichai also pointed to other Google-backed services expanding across the state.

“Waymo, the world’s first autonomous ridesharing service is available in Austin, and we plan to expand to Dallas next year. Our growing delivery service, Wing, and Walmart are completing thousands of deliveries each week in the Dallas area,” he said. “Our growing Dallas cloud region delivers high-performance, low-latency services to companies like NRG Energy.”

Google launched its Dallas Cloud Region in 2022 as part of a global network of 42 cloud regions that businesses and organizations use to build and scale AI-powered solutions.

Alphabet’s life science offshoot, Verily, also moved its headquarters from California to Dallas in 2024.

Local officials embrace “generational investment”

Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy and a Texas native, told the audience that in her 10 years at the company, she’s seen how data center projects can affect communities like Midlothian and Red Oak.

Google has a “resolute strategy to ensure that Texas continues to lead the American Revolution,” she said, “through next generation, AI infrastructure, a robust energy and power market, and, most importantly, a future-ready talent pool.” She added that local leaders and community partners are essential to making projects like this possible.

Officials from Armstrong and Haskell counties—the Texas communities set to host Google’s newest data centers—framed the company’s commitment as transformational.

In a statement, Armstrong County Judge Adam Ensey called the announcement of a major Google data center campus a “generational opportunity that puts the West Texas region directly in the forefront of the global digital economy” by powering the future of innovation alongside the community’s farming and ranching heritage.

Haskell County Judge Kenny Thompson added that Google’s investment in his community will transform the quality of life for its citizens and “provide long term stability” for all cities within the county infrastructure, offering “top-tier” employment opportunities for people to remain in the county.

Google’s first Texas data center: Midlothian

As Google looks west to new campuses in Armstrong and Haskell counties, Dallas-Fort Worth leaders say the company’s existing footprint has already reshaped parts of the region.

Midlothian’s data center story dates back to a 375-acre land acquisition in Railport Business Park reported in 2018. Google officially announced its plans to invest $600 million to develop its first Texas data center in 2019, with a groundbreaking ceremony that brought together local leaders and company officials.

Current Midlothian Mayor Justin Coffman said Google’s commitment has extended well beyond the “facility fence line.” The company’s presence is a “catalyst for long-term economic development, not only through capital investment but by attracting the kind of high-tech ecosystem that diversifies our economy and creates sustainable opportunities for the next generation of Midlothian families,” he said in a statement.

Red Oak: Google’s second Texas data center campus is now online

Google announced its Red Oak data center in 2023—its second in the state. On Friday, Goothe company also announced that the first building of the Red Oak campus in Ellis County is now operational.

Red Oak Mayor Mark Stanfill described the project as a partnership built on shared values. Beyond Google’s capital investment in Red Oak, Stanfill said the company has made a commitment to the community with support for the Red Oak Public Schools and the new Maker Space at the Red Oak Public Library.

“These contributions are equipping our students and residents with the high-demand digital skills necessary for the modern workforce, guaranteeing that the jobs created here benefit the people who live here,” Stanfill said.

“Investing in America”

Google said the investment is part of its “Investing in America” initiative, which is “furthering American innovation through major investments in technical infrastructure, research and development, expanded energy capacity for an AI-driven economy, and workforce development to help the U.S. continue to lead the world in AI.”

The move also puts Texas deeper into the national AI infrastructure race.

Last week, Anthropic also announced a $50 billion plan for new U.S. data centers, with initial sites planned for Texas and New York. In October, Meta said it would invest $1.5 billion in a new AI data center in El Paso—its third in Texas—bringing its total data center investment in the state to about $10 billion. OpenAI’s Stargate facility in Abilene—announced at the White House in January in a joint venture with Oracle and Softbank—is set to become the “world’s largest AI supercluster,” with five additional U.S. sites planned.

“We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen,” Abbott said.

November 15, 2025

As generous and readily available as local land grants were, the Roaring Fork Valley was small potatoes compared with enormous public land grants that mark vast Western landscapes today and could foreshadow a similar trend if the political powers that be in Washington take on the directives and intentions of the current Trump administration.

“… a shady world of back-room deals, special interests and cronyism.”

— Erica Rosenberg, Western Lands Project

The future of federal public lands lies in the hands of the U.S. Congress as empowered by the American public. Whatever winds of influence and ideology blow through Washington also stir across vast acreages of American lands in the public domain of the commons.

In Aspen, Pitkin County and the greater Roaring Fork Valley, land giveaways have been many, although nothing near the scale of the decades preceding Aspen’s founding when, throughout the American West, land grants were excessive and often rife with fraud and scandal. By the time Aspen was settled in the 1880s, the outrages of earlier land grants had received pushback by a concerned public and were acted upon by congressional oversight that ended the most egregious giveaways.

Still, plenty of public land was doled out regionally to mining interests, homesteaders, railroads, schools, churches and others for what today seem like absurdly low valuations. An Aspen Journalism analysis conducted by Data Editor Laurine Lassalle of records available through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), General Land Office and Pitkin County turned up 1,175 patents issued in Pitkin County between 1880 and 1900. Information below is based on a further review of 97 of those patents.

For example, Roaring Fork Valley rancher Fred Light (1856-1931) filed for 160 acres of public lands in 1883 and, in 1886, paid $200 when the patent was approved. Light bought the land under a federal provision that invited homesteaders to file for patent under the 1820 Sale Cash Entry Act. The price was $1.25 per acre, about $40 per acre in today’s dollars.

Light’s “Box L Ranch,” in the Capitol Creek Valley, grew by additional acquisitions, including Light’s purchase of his wife’s family’s nearby ranch. A tribute written about Light as a civic leader recounted the profitability and size of his holdings. “Owning and operating with skill and success one of the finest ranches in Pitkin County, which is of ample size, comprising nine hundred and forty acres, and sufficiently fertile and productive to yield abundantly of cereals and hay and liberally support large numbers of cattle and horses. Frederick Light, of near Snow Mass, is so situated that he may laugh adversity to scorn and feel secure of an expanding and substantial prosperity during the remainder of his days.”

Light’s former homestead has, of course, escalated in value since his ownership. Today, the average value per acre in the Capitol Creek Valley is $69,000 for agricultural properties and $171,500 for agricultural/residential, according to an analysis of Pitkin County Assessor’s Office records.

Under a different federal land grant program, mining claims were granted to anyone who could prove that a property was economically viable, a stipulation of the Mining Law of 1872. Under this law, which is still on the books and widely considered antiquated, miners paid $5 per acre for both surface and mineral rights. Filers would often accrue multiple claims, as did a number of local partnerships from the early 1880s in Aspen’s first acquired mineral patents.

In 1884, a partnership of 10 individuals — including Josiah Deane, Aspen’s first lawyer and later patriarch of the T-Lazy-7 Ranch on Maroon Creek — was issued a patent on 4.49 acres for a mineral lode called “Mountain Ranger,” located near Little Annie Basin on the backside of Aspen Mountain. They paid $22.45 on the location claim first filed in 1881, the year the city of Aspen was incorporated with Deane’s legal guidance.

In 1884, a six-way partnership filed for a patent on a 5.85-acre mineral patent claim named “Grand Prize,” for which they paid $29.25. The partnership included David R.C. Brown and Henry “Grandpap” Cowenhoven, two of Aspen’s founding fathers who had arrived here in the summer of 1880 by wagons over Taylor Pass — the first wagons to enter the Roaring Fork Valley.

Brown is recorded in another partnership filed in 1887 with three others for the “Monongahila,” a mineral lode of 8.31 acres for which they paid $41.55. Brown and Cowenhoven partnered again in 1889 with four others on a claim called “Idlewild” of 13.04 acres for which they paid $65.20. Brown and Cowenhoven (sometimes in the name of Cowenhoven’s wife, Margaret, and Brown’s wife, Catherine, the daughter of the Cowenhovens’) appear in numerous entries, attributing to sound investments that made them Aspen’s first self-made millionaires.

Another Aspen namesake, Henry Tourtelotte, also appears in a number of entries, establishing patents on claims named “Tanner,” “Buckhorn,” “Castle” and “Silver Bell.” Many of these claim names are familiar today as mountain peaks, ski runs and campgrounds. Another local mining scion, Horace Augustus Warner (HAW) Tabor, shows up in many records associated with Montezuma Basin and the Montezuma claim, a mine he owned that remains visible today at a nosebleed altitude high above Castle Creek. Tabor, known as “The Silver King of Leadville,” brought his entrepreneurial reputation to Aspen along with an opera singer named Baby Doe with whom he had a notorious love affair.

Prominent founding Aspenites David Hyman and Jerome B. Wheeler are also listed in numerous patent entries as among the earliest investors in Aspen mining claims such as “Mose,” “Little Maggie,” “Dolly Dot,” “Morning Star,” “Little Nell,” “Alaska,” “Siberia” and “Durant.” Hyman and Wheeler represented Eastern capital, which was essential to Aspen’s development and which enabled the nascent city to sustain ore production years before the city’s two railroads ran tracks to Aspen and gave it economic viability. Hyman was a prominent lawyer from Cincinnati and was Aspen’s first major mining investor. Wheeler, for whom the Hotel Jerome and the Wheeler Opera House are named, was married into the Macy family wealth, owners of New York City’s first department store.

The Smuggler Mining Co., whose name still marks the mountain and open space playground bounding Aspen to the east, shows patents that provided access and ownership to one of Aspen’s richest silver mines. It was from the Smuggler Mine in 1893 that the largest-ever nugget of almost-pure silver, weighing more than 1,800 pounds, was broken into three pieces so it could be extracted and paraded on a horse-drawn wagon through the thriving city at the verge of the Silver Crash of 1893 when silver was demonetized and the U.S. currency shifted to the gold standard, abruptly and dramatically curtailing Aspen’s thriving mining industry.

Today, historic patented mining claims hold far-different valuations, not for industrial mining potential, but as real estate valued as high-end properties in Aspen’s resort economy. For what the records show as “mines” in Aspen, the valuation goes from an historic low of $4.50 per acre to $500,000 per acre today.

The Denver & Rio Grande Western (D&RGW) and the Colorado Midland built their tracks to Aspen from Leadville, surmounting the Continental Divide on trestles, through tunnels and around winding switchbacks, the construction of which required monumental physical labor. Those rights-of-way remain public thoroughfares today as the Rio Grande Trail (D&RGW) and Highway 82 (Colorado Midland).

The railroads were granted swaths of public lands as an incentive to build tracks and open the West to resource development. Roaring Fork commerce served silver mining and agriculture for which two competing railroads laid tracks over and through the mountains. Unlike earlier railroad ventures in the U.S. that brought commerce and trade to the nation and received vast land grants, Aspen’s two local railroads were granted only their rights-of-way, which still added up to considerable acreage, albeit linear and confined to specific corridors.

Cashing out the commons

As generous and readily available as local land grants were, the Roaring Fork Valley was small potatoes compared with enormous public land grants that mark vast Western landscapes today and could foreshadow a similar trend if the political powers that be in Washington take on the directives and intentions of the current Trump administration.

In a comprehensive 2009 report published by the Western Lands Project, “Carving Up the Commons: Congress & Our Public Lands,” its author, Janine Blaeloch, lays out the history of public land divestitures and describes the many ways public lands can become privatized, something the Trump administration has been applying as a means of capitalizing on extractive national assets. This is not the first time a Republican administration has attempted to commoditize the commons.

“Ronald Reagan’s Interior Secretary, James Watt, famously proposed during Reagan’s presidency (1981-1989) that public lands be sold to pay down the federal deficit,” Blaeloch wrote. “The Bush administration’s (2001-2009) budget for 2007 called for the sale of $800 million worth of U.S. Forest Service lands over five years and $182 million in public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the same time period.

“These periodic high-profile, sweeping, ideologically driven land disposal schemes gain the public’s attention because they are so over the top. What the public is largely not aware of is the fact that smaller scale disposal schemes are being enacted every day — often by the same politicians who declaim their love for the environment and public land.”

Legislative initiatives are receiving strong encouragement from the current Trump administration to parcel and sell off, trade or otherwise divest national public lands and put them into private hands, severing existing protections, means of preservation and ultimately public access. Although such current directives may lead to a new precedent of commoditization, they are part of a long and controversial history.

On April 23, historian and blog phenomenon Heather Cox Richardson wrote in her daily “Letters From an American” a warning that the Department of Agriculture (which administers the U.S. Forest Service) and the Bureau of Land Management (which is under the Department of the Interior) have been gearing up for a wholesale liquidation of the American commons.

“Today,” wrote Cox Richardson, “the White House under President Donald J. Trump celebrated Earth Day by announcing that the White House champions ‘opening more federal lands and waters for oil, gas and critical mineral extraction.’”

Cox Richardson pointed out that, in fact, public lands already benefit the nation by generating billions of dollars a year for the United States through tourism.

“Since the 1970s,” she wrote, “the right wing has come to see the public ownership of lands as an affront to the idea that individuals should be able to use the resources they believe God has put there for them to use.

“Developers have encouraged that ideology, for privatization of America’s Western lands has always meant that they ended up in the hands of a few wealthy individuals.”

The conservative political agenda outlined in Project 2025, she noted, calls for a giveaway to oil and gas and mining interests by “opening up more of our federal land to energy development, rolling back protections on federal lands, and selling off more land to private developers.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum made it clear in his January confirmation hearings, Cox Richardson wrote, “that he sees selling the public lands as a source of revenue, referring to them as ‘America’s balance sheet.’”

“We’ve got $36 trillion in debt,” Burgum said, as quoted by Cox Richardson, “but we never talk about the assets, and the assets are the land and minerals. The Interior Department has got close to 500 million acres of surface, 700 million acres of subsurface, and over 2 billion acres of offshore. That’s the balance sheet of America. I believe we ought to have a deep inventory of all the assets in America. We ought to understand … what [is] our assets: $100 trillion, $200 trillion? We could be in great shape as a country.”

Bipartisan support for public lands

The Trump-era initiative to monetize public lands hit a roadblock, however, after bipartisan support for public lands overwhelmed the direction Burgum and the Trump administration had fomented both as an ongoing policy directive and as described in the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill, which was voted in by Congress and signed into law by the president July 4.

A draft version of that bill had called for selling 0.5% to 0.75% of U.S. Forest Service and BLM lands in 11 Western states and for selling 0.25% to 0.5% of BLM lands within 5 miles of the border of a U.S. population center.

“A proposal to sell federal public lands,” Caitlyn Kim on Colorado Public Radio News reported June 29, “has officially been taken out of the Republicans’ spending and tax bill after facing strong pushback from hunters, fishermen, outdoor recreation users and, most importantly, Republicans in the U.S. Senate and House.”

U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the chief elected Republican advocate for the sell-off, announced the removal of the public lands divestiture from the bill, blaming the decision on the budget reconciliation process and explaining that he could not get a safeguard to guarantee that the land would be sold only to American families.

CPR News reported that Lee “said he continues to believe the federal government ‘owns far too much land’ that he said is mismanaged and that ‘massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there.’ He indicated that he wasn’t giving up altogether, adding that he would work with President Donald Trump to ‘put underutilized federal land to work for American families.’”

However, according to the CPR report, “the decision [to delete public-land sales] also came after other Senate Republicans from the West said they opposed the idea and would offer an amendment to get it taken out of the bill. Five House Republicans also said they would vote against the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill if it remained in.”

Colorado lawmakers celebrated the removal of public-land sales from the GOP bill as a defining endorsement for the value most Americans feel toward protecting the American commons. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “The American people — and our public lands — have won!”

CPR News reported that Neguse and Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) had issued a joint statement opposing public-land sales in an acknowledgment of unity for protecting a key American legacy that crosses the aisles of Congress. “Republican or Democrat — representing red, purple or blue districts — one sentiment continues to ring true: Public lands are not for sale.”

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “This is a huge victory for Colorado and the West. Thank you to everyone who made their voice heard and fought back against this dangerous provision. America’s public lands belong to all of us.”

“Protecting public lands is the most nonpartisan issue in the country,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited, said in a statement quoted by CPR News. “This is certainly not the first attempt to privatize or transfer our public lands, and it won’t be the last. We must stay vigilant and defend the places we love to fish, hike, hunt and explore.”

Taking a stand on the land

Despite this most recent halt of public land sales, the threat is far from over, warns Blaeloch, whose 20-year advocacy mission before the Western Lands Project ceded its role to Wild Earth Guardians in 2016 was to “scrutinize public land trades, sales, giveaways and any project that would cede public land, and their impacts on habitat and wildlife, natural resources, land use and communities. The goal of Western Lands Project is to keep public lands public.”

“We are about to return to the Golden Age of land acquisitions for private benefit,” Blaeloch said in an Aspen Journalism interview in April. In her focused role as public lands defender, Blaeloch said, “We realized that the Forest Service and BLM conduct hundreds of land deals every year, mostly without public involvement. I like clarity and transparency, and I thought it was unfair that deals were being made without the public interest.”

Erica Rosenberg, a former president of Western Lands Project, concludes in the introduction to Blaeloch’s report: “Congressional processes threaten to trade away, sell or give away our public land heritage — piece by piece — through a shady world of back-room deals, special interests and cronyism.”

So, Blaeloch, digging into her background as a career environmental planner, has pushed back with the goal of making federal land management agencies accountable by tracking land deals, educating the public at the grassroots, and also by educating Congress on what has long been a veiled aspect of American land use on the federal level.

Free land for railroad and lumber industries

Blaeloch’s report for the Western Lands Project stated that the most opportune era in U.S. history for collusion in acquiring public lands dirt cheap or at no cost at all took place from the mid-1800s up to the early 1900s through manipulative deals benefitting large railroad interests and the fast-growing lumber industry.

“Between 1850 and 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the federal government granted 131 million acres of public land to railroad corporations as incentive for westward expansion. These railroad land grants comprised one of the largest categories of public land disposal in U.S. history, after cash sale, homestead grants to individuals, and grants to the states for education and other purposes.”

For example, Blaeloch reports, “the Northern Pacific Railroad, which was to construct its line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Tacoma, Washington, was granted 38.9 million acres, including 9.6 million acres in Washington state. Several other land grants were added to what would more than a century later become the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad, for an additional total of more than 47 million acres.”

These generous railroad land grants were typically given in alternating square miles extending out from the railroad lines and forming a “checkerboard” land-ownership pattern of public/private land that is still visible on many maps and to anyone who chances to gaze out the window of an airplane while flying over the clear-cut forests of the Pacific Northwest.

Land giveaways to railroads were originally intended to encourage Western settlement as the American frontier expanded. It was assumed that land along the railroad lines would become desirable, enabling the railroads and federal government to capitalize by selling their alternating public/private parcels to settlers who would benefit from nearby rail service.

“In fact,” writes Blaeloch, “the railroads kept much of their grant land, and the federal government designated many of its checkerboards as national forest. Nearly all of the railroad land ‘grants’ were in fact intended to be temporary transfers of public land that the railroads were supposed to sell in turn to ‘actual settlers’ to raise money for railroad construction.”

Some railroad companies kept their land grants even though they failed to build, and some transferred former public lands and the wealth they generated to cronies, including elected officials.

“By 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the public had grown disgusted with the scandals and waste flowing from the railroad land grants, and this particular brand of public land giveaway ceased. By this time, too, the public was increasingly concerned about having reached the limits of free land and resources, and there was great controversy around the rapid liquidation of the country’s forests.”

By the end of the 19th century, the debate between forest preservation and utilitarian wise use was at full pitch. Preservation was strongly advocated by Sierra Club founder John Muir and his disciples. Utilitarian wise use was advocated by Gifford Pinchot, the country’s first Forest Service chief under President Theodore Roosevelt. Timber and mining industries actively lobbied for Pinchot’s view of the land as commodity, countering Muir’s view of the natural landscape as a necessary and valid public benefit.

Despoiling the garden

In his 1982 book, “Westward in Eden: The Public Lands and the Conservation Movement,” author William K. Wyant, a former Washington correspondent for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, raises, as a popular conception, the idea of the land as ultimately exploitable: “The American has usually seen real estate as expendable,” he writes. “It is something of which there is assumed to be plenty more … somewhere else.”

When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, writes Wyant, the Republican mandate was to shrink government and its influences, and to cut regulations on industry. This afforded a propitious launch of the Sagebrush Rebellion, which advocated shifting federal lands in the West to the states. “The United States had at the outset an incomparable Garden of Eden to dress and keep, as the Old Testament phrases it,” wrote Wyant. “Its husbandry has been at sometimes profligate, greedy and short-sighted and at other times blessed with extraordinary vision.”

Wyant idealistically describes the continental United States as a vast and pristine wilderness, “a domain of incredible richness — virgin forests, great rivers, the prairies and high plains, the shining Rockies, the arid and sandy wastes and the golden Pacific shore. The early settlers found it majestic and unspoiled, and they plunged into it, defiant of restraints.”

But without restraints, the commons suffered immeasurable abuse and exploitation, as a statement from Pinchot made clear in the early 20th century: “Outside the tropics, American forests were the richest and most productive on Earth, and the best able to repay good management. But nobody had begun to manage any part of them with an eye to the future. On the contrary, the greatest, the swiftest, the most efficient and the most appalling wave of forest destruction in human history was then swelling to its climax in the United States; and the American people were glad of it.”

Rapacious companies such as logging giant Weyerhaeuser saw forested public lands not as cathedrals, as did Muir, but as wood lots. By 1974, cites Wyant, Weyerhaeuser owned outright more than 5.5 million acres, a holding bigger than the state of Massachusetts.

U.S. Sen. Gale McGee (1915-92) who served in Congress from 1959 to 1977 as one of the last Democrats to hail from Wyoming, in testimony in 1971, said, “Today, the once-great forests of our nation have been depleted to the point that would shame Paul

Bunyan. It is time to cease measuring the value of our public forests on the scale of board-feet of timber.”

Vast land giveaways were enabled by the 1862 Railroad Act, writes Wyant, when a number of private railroad companies were allocated $65 million in federal loans and handed a total 110 million acres of public domain. In 1864, an even more generous provision was made when the Northern Pacific Railroad, then building a 2,128-mile line from St. Paul to Tacoma received millions of acres of public lands, including about one-fourth of the state of North Dakota and 15% of Montana.

This largesse was coupled with political influence from railroad magnates who lobbied Congress for more land. Support for outrageous public behests also came from politicians who favored rail subsidies in exchange for locating lines in cities and towns that benefitted their constituents in blatant acts of patronage. Industry and business were in on the take at the expense of the commons.

“All in all,” writes Wyant, “Congress gave to the railroads an area nearly twice the size of Colorado and one-third as large as Alaska.” Another gift of the commons came to the railroads in the Forest Management Act of 1897, which allowed land-holders within newly designated and protected forest reserves to exchange, acre-for-acre, their holdings for lands that were outside the reserves.

Under this act, writes Wyant, rail barons were permitted to swap millions of acres of mountainous, desert, cutover or otherwise useless land for “in lieu” timber acreage of far greater value. The railroads then made deals with lumber companies by not only selling their holdings, but transporting for a profit the timber that was harvested from them. Loggers and railroads latched onto the mutual benefits of collusion in the exploitation of public lands, with no evident moral, ethical or ecological considerations.

After a hue and cry of protest from rising ranks of conservationists, the “in lieu” provision was repealed in 1905. However, eight years of rampant profiteering had already privatized huge chunks of the commons.

“In addition to the scars on the land,” writes Blaeloch, “the behavior pattern, too, was carried forward, and the companies established a paradigm that brought them enormous profits at the expense of the public interest, neatly disguised as ‘win-win’ deals. It is a pattern that shows itself time and again in land deals driven by politics, privilege and greed.”

A regional comparison is necessary to grasp the scale of land acquisitions by logging companies: The White River National Forest covers 2.3 million acres, one of the largest forests in the United States. The Emmerson family, which owns and operates Sierra Pacific Industries, a family legacy company since 1949 that logs usable lumber after forest fires and sells it to lumber retailers, owns 2.4 million acres in three Western states: California, Oregon and Washington. How did one family carve out of the American commons acreage greater than the largest national forest in Colorado? Timber.

Still, Wyant surmises, rising ranks of professional and educated conservationists have achieved national influence in the aftermath of public lands feeding frenzies. “An impressive machinery for the defense of the environment and public lands has been built,” he concludes. “Until it is more firmly in place and has the steady acceptance of the American people, we shall owe a heavy debt to the corporal’s guard of environmental lawyers and professional conservationists who man the ramparts while others sleep.”",https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvczAud3AuY29tXC9pXC9ibGFuay5qcGciLCJ0eHQiOiJDb3lvdGUgR3VsY2giLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImhpZ2h3YXkiLCJmb250IjoiIiwiYmxvZ19pZCI6MjIzNTg4NX0.c9FY6ukBzqqbZLFtzGkgYmc-PXMm5LZtBxVTZM5Qm3UMQ,N,,2025-11-16 21:59:29.234474

The question is: Can our policymakers be as realistic in their assessment of missile defense as the makers of a major Hollywood movie?","The Wrath of the Con Man

Kathryn Bigelow’s new nuclear thriller, A House of Dynamite, has been criticized by some experts for being unrealistic, most notably because it portrays an unlikely scenario in which an adversary chooses to attack the United States with just a single nuclear-armed missile. Such a move would, of course, leave the vast American nuclear arsenal largely intact and so invite a devastating response that would undoubtedly largely destroy the attacker’s nation. But the film is strikingly on target when it comes to one thing: its portrayal of the way one U.S. missile interceptor after another misses its target, despite the confidence of most American war planners that they would be able to destroy any incoming nuclear warhead and save the day.

At one point in the film, a junior official points out that U.S. interceptors have failed almost half their tests, and the secretary of defense responds by bellowing: “That’s what $50 billion buys us?”

In fact, the situation is far worse than that. We taxpayers, whether we know it or not, are betting on a house of dynamite, gambling on the idea that technology will save us in the event of a nuclear attack. The United States has, in fact, spent more than $350 billion on missile defenses since, more than four decades ago, President Ronald Reagan promised to create a leak-proof defense against incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Believe it or not, the Pentagon has yet to even conduct a realistic test of the system, which would involve attempting to intercept hundreds of warheads traveling at 1,500 miles per hour, surrounded by realistic decoys that would make it hard to even know which objects to target.

Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists has pointed out that the dream of a perfect missile defense — the very thing Donald Trump has promised that his cherished new “Golden Dome” system will be — is a “fantasy” of the first order, and that “missile defenses are not a useful or long-term strategy for defending the United States from nuclear weapons.”

Grego is hardly alone in her assessment. A March 2025 report by the American Physical Society found that “creating a reliable and effective defense against even [a] small number of relatively unsophisticated nuclear-armed ICBMs remains a daunting challenge.” Its report also notes that “few of the main challenges involved in developing and deploying a reliable and effective missile defense have been solved, and… many of the hard problems we identified are likely to remain so during and probably beyond” the 15-year time horizon envisioned in their study.

Despite the evidence that it will do next to nothing to defend us, President Trump remains all in on the Golden Dome project. Perhaps what he really has in mind, however, has little to do with actually defending us. So far, Golden Dome seems like a marketing concept designed to enrich arms contractors and burnish Trump’s image rather than a carefully thought-out defense program.

Contrary to both logic and history, Trump has claimed that his supposedly leak-proof system can be produced in a mere three years for $175 billion. While that’s a serious chunk of change, analysts in the field suggest that the cost is likely to be astronomically higher and that the president’s proposed timeline is, politely put, wildly optimistic. Todd Harrison, a respected Pentagon budget analyst currently based at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, estimates that such a system would cost somewhere between $252 billion and $3.6 trillion over 20 years, depending on its design. Harrison’s high-end estimate is more than 20 times the off-hand price tossed out by President Trump.

As for the president’s proposed timeline of three years, it’s wildly out of line with the Pentagon’s experience with other major systems it’s developed. More than three decades after it was proposed as a possible next-generation fighter jet (under the moniker Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF), for example, the F-35, once touted as a “revolution in military procurement,” is still plagued by hundreds of defects, and the planes spend almost half their time in hangars for repair and maintenance.

Proponents of the Golden Dome project argue that it’s now feasible because of new technologies being developed in Silicon Valley, from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. Those claims are, of course, unproven, and past experience suggests that there is no miracle technological solution to complex security threats. AI-driven weapons may be quicker to locate and destroy targets and capable of coordinating complex responses like swarms of drones. But there is no evidence that AI can help solve the problem of blocking hundreds of fast-flying warheads embedded in a cloud of decoys. Worse yet, a missile defense system needs to work perfectly each and every time if it is to provide leak-proof protection against a nuclear catastrophe, an inconceivable standard in the real world of weaponry and defensive systems.

Of course, the weapons contractors salivating at the prospect of a monstrous payday tied to the development of Golden Dome are well aware that the president’s timeline will be quite literally unmeetable. Lockheed Martin has optimistically suggested that it should be able to perform the first test of a space-based interceptor in 2028, three years from now. And such space-based interceptors have been suggested as a central element of the Golden Dome system. In other words, Trump’s pledge to fund contractors to build a viable Golden Dome system in three years is PR or perhaps PF (presidential fantasy), not realistic planning.

Who Will Benefit from the Golden Dome?

The major contractors for Golden Dome may not be revealed for a few months, but we already know enough to be able to take an educated guess about which companies are likely to play central roles in the program.

The administration has said that Golden Dome will be built on existing hardware and the biggest current producers of missile defense hardware are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon (a major part of RTX Corporation). So, count on at least two of the three of them. Emerging military tech firms like SpaceX and Anduril have also been mentioned as possible system integrators. In other words, one or more of them would help coordinate development of the Golden Dome and provide detection and targeting software for it. The final choice for such an extremely lucrative role is less than certain, but as of now Anduril seems to have an inside track.

Even after the breakup of the Donald Trump/Elon Musk bromance, the tech industry still has a strong influence over the administration, starting with Vice President JD Vance. He was, after all, employed and mentored by Peter Thiel of Palantir, the godfather of the recent surge of military research and financing in Silicon Valley. Thiel was also a major donor to his successful 2022 Senate campaign, and Vance was charged with fundraising in Silicon Valley during the 2024 presidential campaign. Emerging military tech moguls like Thiel and Palmer Luckey, along with their financiers like Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, view Vance as their man in the White House.

Other military tech supporters in the Trump administration include Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen Feinberg, whose company, Cerberus Capital, has a long history of investing in military contractors and is already pressing to reduce regulations on weapons firms in line with Silicon Valley’s wish list; Michael Obadal, a senior director at the military tech firm Anduril, who is now deputy secretary of the Army; Gregory Barbaccia, the former head of intelligence and investigations at Palantir, who is now the federal government’s chief information officer; Undersecretary of State Jacob Helberg, a former executive at Palantir; and numerous key members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which took a wrecking ball to civilian bodies like the U.S. Agency for International Development while sparing the Pentagon significant cuts.

Some analysts foresee a funding fight in the offing between those Silicon Valley military tech firms and the Big Five firms (Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and RTX) that now dominate Pentagon contracting. But the Golden Dome project will have room for major players from both factions and may prove one area where the old guard and the Silicon Valley military tech crew join hands to lobby for maximum funding.

The nation’s premier defense firms and missile manufacturers will likely enjoy direct access to Golden Dome, since the project is expected to be headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, the “Pentagon of the South.” That self-described “Rocket City” houses the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and a myriad of defense firms (including Lockheed Martin, RTX, General Dynamics, and Boeing). It will also soon host the new Space Force headquarters.

While Huntsville has been a hub for missile defense since President Ronald Reagan’s failed ICBM defense efforts, what makes this placement particularly likely is the significance of Huntsville’s Republican representatives in Congress, particularly Congressman Dale Strong. “North Alabama has played a key role in every former and current U.S. missile defense program and will undoubtedly be pivotal to the success of Golden Dome,” he explained, having received $337,600 in campaign contributions from the defense sector during the 2023-2024 election cycle and cofounded the House Golden Dome Caucus.

His advocacy for the project dovetails well with the power vested in House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (also from Alabama), who received $535,000 from the defense sector during the 2024 campaign. Senator Tommy Tuberville, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Katie Boyd Britt, a member of the Senate Golden Dome Caucus, round out Alabama’s Republican Senate delegation.

Many of the leading boosters of the Golden Dome represent states like Alabama or districts that stand to benefit from the program. The bicameral congressional Golden Dome caucuses include numerous members from states already enmeshed in missile production, including North Dakota and Montana, which house ICBMs built and maintained by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, among other companies.

Those same weapons companies have long been donating generously to political campaigns. And only recently, to curry favor and prove themselves worthy of Golden Dome’s lucrative contracts, Palantir and Booz Allen Hamilton joined Lockheed Martin in donating millions of dollars to President Trump’s new ballroom that is to replace the White House’s devastated East Wing. And expect further public displays of financial affection from arms companies awaiting the administration’s final verdict on Golden Dome contracts, which will likely be announced in early 2026.

The Gold of the Golden Dome

Golden Dome is already slated to receive nearly $40 billion in the next year when funds from President Trump’s “big beautiful bill” and the administration’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2026 are taken into account. The 2026 request for Golden Dome is more than twice the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and three times the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, essential pillars of any effort to prevent new pandemics or address the challenges of the climate crisis. In addition, Golden Dome will undoubtedly siphon into the military sector significant numbers of scientists and engineers who might otherwise be trying to solve environmental and public health problems, undermining this country’s ability to deal with the greatest threats to our lives and livelihoods to fund a defense system that will never actually be able to defend us.

Worse yet, Golden Dome is likely to be more than just a waste of money. It could also accelerate the nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia, and China. If, as is often the case, U.S. adversaries prepare for worst-case scenarios, they are likely to make their plans based on the idea that Golden Dome just might work, which means they’ll increase their offensive forces to ensure that, in a nuclear confrontation, they are able to overwhelm any new missile defense network. It was precisely this sort of offensive/defensive arms race that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of the era of President Richard Nixon was designed to prevent. That agreement was, however, abandoned by President George W. Bush.

A no less dangerous aspect of any future involving the Golden Dome would be the creation of a new set of space-based interceptors as an integral part of the system. An interceptor in space may not actually be able to block a barrage of nuclear warheads, but it would definitely be capable of taking out civilian and military satellites, which travel in predictable orbits. If the unspoken agreement not to attack such satellites were ever to be lifted, basic functions of the global economy (not to speak of the U.S. military) would be at risk. Not only could attacks on satellites bring the global economy to a grinding halt, but they could also spark a spiral of escalation that might, in the end, lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

Should the Golden Dome system indeed be launched (at a staggering cost to the American taxpayer), its “gold” would further enrich already well-heeled weapons contractors, give us a false sense of security, and let Donald Trump pose as this country’s greatest defender ever. Sadly, fantasies die hard, so job number one in rolling back the Golden Dome boondoggle is simply making it clear that no missile defense system will protect us in the event of a nuclear attack, a point made well by A House of Dynamite. The question is: Can our policymakers be as realistic in their assessment of missile defense as the makers of a major Hollywood movie? Or is that simply too much to ask?

Global disaster losses hit $320 billion in 2024, with only $140 billion insured, underlining a stubborn protection gap, especially in emerging markets where coverage is thin.
With $94 trillion in global infrastructure investment needed by 2040 and $15 trillion still unfunded, designing to historical weather means locking in fragile assets that become liabilities as hazards intensify.
Scaling to the $8.9 trillion global power sector suggests around $23 billion in cumulative avoided losses over two decades.
“By embedding risk analytics across sovereign, multilateral and private investment systems, resilience can move from being underfunded and undervalued to being investable at scale,” Ms. Bharadwaj said, calling for systemic reforms under the Baku-Belém Roadmap.","A new International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) paper released at COP30 said that India’s clean‑energy surge, from 18 GW in 2010 to over 190 GW by September 2025, shows how smart policy can mobilise private capital, and sets out how the same approach can mainstream risk analytics to unlock $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for adaptation and resilience under the Baku-Belém Roadmap.

Authored by Ritu Bharadwaj, director of climate resilience, finance, loss and damage at IIED, and N. Karthikeyan, a development economist, the paper contends that “resilience can be transformed from a perceived cost into an investable asset if risk analytics are embedded across sovereign finance, development bank operations and private portfolios.”

The report is part of IIED’s COP30 publications and has been showcased at side events in Belém focused on resilience finance, debt sustainability and risk‑informed infrastructure. “India’s experience shows that clear policy signals and de-risking tools can mobilise private investment at scale, the same approach can work for resilience,” Mr. Karthikeyan said.

Global disaster losses hit $320 billion in 2024, with only $140 billion insured, underlining a stubborn protection gap, especially in emerging markets where coverage is thin. Swiss Re’s 2023 sigma confirms only about 38–40% of catastrophe losses were insured globally, and that insured losses exceeding $100 billion per year are now “the norm,” the paper said.

The paper traces a vicious cycle: climate disasters widen fiscal deficits and force new borrowing; that contributes to credit downgrades and higher spreads, shrinking fiscal space for prevention and resilience in the next shock. Using a synthetic control method, the authors show Grenada’s rating plunged after Hurricane Ivan while a “no‑disaster” counterfactual stayed stable; Belize and Papua New Guinea show similar patterns. By contrast, Fiji’s preparedness helped its rating track at or above the synthetic control after Cyclone Winston, evidence that prevention preserves credit, Ms. Bharadwaj explained.

Beyond debt and ratings, climate shocks hit the exchange rate. The paper’s regression suggests that a one‑unit rise in climate vulnerability can raise exchange‑rate pressure by approximately 65%; in 2022 alone, average exchange‑related losses reached about $2.4 billion in SIDS and $11.6 billion in LDCs, with cumulative losses since 1991 at $27 billion and $68 billion respectively, money that could otherwise build resilience.

With $94 trillion in global infrastructure investment needed by 2040 and $15 trillion still unfunded, designing to historical weather means locking in fragile assets that become liabilities as hazards intensify. The paper calls for probabilistic, multi‑hazard assessment that captures tail‑risk and cascading impacts across systems, far beyond static maps or qualitative screens.

Insurers’ catastrophe (CAT) models and risk engineering simulate thousands of events by combining hazard probabilities, asset exposure and vulnerability functions to generate loss curves and quantify avoided losses from specific measures. Because these tools already underpin underwriting and solvency, their outputs carry credibility with investors and rating agencies, and can be priced into loans, bonds and portfolios.

In five anonymised power‑plant case studies across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Pacific and Latin America, annual expected losses (AEL) fell from $48.6 million to $9.8 million with resilience upgrades, approximately $10 billion avoided over 20 years; extreme‑event losses dropped by about $177 million per year. Scaling to the $8.9 trillion global power sector suggests around $23 billion in cumulative avoided losses over two decades.

AUDI’s flood safeguards in Germany kept production running in 2021 (the paper does not quantify exact savings), while Chennai’s 2015 floods caused ₹ 1,500 crore (approximately $225 million) in downtime; Madrid’s heat strategy contrasts with Paris 2003 (735 deaths; €13.2 billion losses).

India also appears in an eight‑country comparison with Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Pakistan, Senegal, Uganda. Under a 1‑in‑20‑year shock, 5% loss‑exceedance probability, losses total $21.4 billion; covering them reactively via humanitarian or social protection would cost approximately $93 billion, while early resilience investments deliver equivalent protection for about $4.1 billion, around 80% cheaper. The return on investment across contexts is greater than $5 avoided losses per $1 invested.

The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.
United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.
Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.
“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action - on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more - including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad as it could be.”

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

The program will provide 100 devices, including farm equipment, transport robots, and streetlights, that will be powered by the repurposed batteries in eight rural villages referred to as ""energy-poor.""

Batteries must pass a certification check to ensure they still have at least 60% capacity. Jeju Province is also building a national battery resource center, pending a 13 billion won ($94 million) budget approval from parliament.

South Korea is working to raise its recycling rate for important minerals to 20% by 2030, an important goal as officials project an increase in retired EV batteries by the same year (from 8,300 to 107,000 units).

Repurposing and recycling EV batteries is important because the metals and minerals that go into them, like nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese, require invasive mining.

These resources are also often located in regions that have ongoing human rights issues, like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, per the BBC. Recycling these materials means less mining could be required, cutting down on the negative human and environmental impacts.

For the average driver, improved recycling for EV batteries will help with long-term costs, making new batteries more affordable. It also prevents them from ending up in landfills, where they can release harmful pollutants into the water, air, and soil.

EVs are cleaner to drive in general.

The United States — the world’s biggest economy, top oil and gas producer and second-largest climate polluter — is pursuing a fossil fuel renaissance while forsaking plans to shift toward renewables.
The developed world is continuing to move in the wrong direction on fossil fuels, climate activists say.
“We know that the world’s richest countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas development,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist who founded Climate Analytics, a policy group.
At last year’s climate talks in Azerbaijan, they upped the ante to $300 billion per year by 2035.","Days after the gathering started last week, nations were still sorting out what to do with contentious issues that have typically held up the annual negotiations. As the talks opened, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the world must “fight” efforts to deny the reality of climate change — decades after scientists concluded that people are making the Earth hotter.

That led one official to offer a grim assessment of global efforts to tackle climate change, 10 years after an earlier summit produced the sweeping Paris Agreement.

“We have miserably failed to accomplish the objective of this convention, which is the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama’s climate envoy and lead negotiator, during an interview at the conference site in Belém, Brazil.

“Additional promises mean nothing if you didn’t achieve or fulfill your previous promises,” he added.

It hasn’t helped that the U.S. is skipping the summit for the first time, or that President Donald Trump dismisses climate change as a hoax and urged the world to abandon efforts to fix it. But Trump isn’t the only reason for stalled action. Economic uncertainty, infighting and political backsliding have stymied green measures in both North America and Europe.

In other parts of the world, countries are embracing the economic opportunities that the green transition offers. Many officials in Belém point to signs that progress is underway, including the rapid growth of renewables and electric vehicles and a broader understanding of both the world’s challenges and the means to address them.

“Now we talk about solar panels, electric cars, regenerative agriculture, stopping deforestation, as if we have always talked about those things,” said Ana Toni, the summit’s executive director. “Just in one decade, the topic changed totally. But we still need to speed up the process.”

Still, analysts say it’s become inevitable that the world’s warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius since the dawn of the industrial era, breaching the target at the heart of the Paris Agreement. With that in mind, countries are huddling at this month’s summit, known as COP30, with the hope of finding greater alignment on how to slow rising temperatures.

But how credible would any promises reached in Brazil be? Here are five pledges achieved at past climate summits — and where they stand now:

Moving away from fossil fuels

The historic 2023 agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels, made at the COP28 talks in Dubai, was the first time that nearly 200 countries agreed to wind down their use of oil, natural gas and coal. Though nonbinding, that commitment was even more striking because the talks were overseen by the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company.

Just two years later, fossil fuel consumption is on the rise, despite rapid growth of wind and solar, and many of the world’s largest oil and gas producers plan to drill even more. The United States — the world’s biggest economy, top oil and gas producer and second-largest climate polluter — is pursuing a fossil fuel renaissance while forsaking plans to shift toward renewables.

The president of the Dubai summit, Sultan al-Jaber, said at a recent energy conference that while wind and solar would expand, so too would oil and gas, in part to meet soaring demand for data centers. Liquefied natural gas would grow 65 percent by 2050, and oil will continue to be used as a feedstock for plastic, he said.

“The exponential growth of AI is also creating a power surge that no one anticipated 18 months ago,” he said in a press release from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., where he remains managing director and group CEO.

The developed world is continuing to move in the wrong direction on fossil fuels, climate activists say.

“We know that the world’s richest countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas development,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist who founded Climate Analytics, a policy group. “This simply should not be happening.”

The Paris-based International Energy Agency said last week that oil and gas demand could grow for decades to come. That statement marked a reversal from the group’s previous forecast that oil use would peak in 2030 as clean energy takes hold. Trump’s policies are one reason for the pivot.

Still, renewables such as wind and solar power are soaring in many countries, leading analysts to believe that nations will continue to shift away from fossil fuels. How quickly that will happen is unknown.

“The transition is underway but not yet at the pace or scale required,” said a U.N. report on global climate action released last week. It pointed to large gaps in efforts to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and abate methane pollution.

Lula opened this year’s climate conference by calling for a “road map” to cut fossil fuels globally. It has earned support from countries such as Colombia, Germany, Kenya and the United Kingdom. But it’s not part of the official agenda at these talks, and many poorer countries say what they really need is funding and support to make the shift.

Triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency

This call also emerged from the 2023 summit, and was considered a tangible measure of countries’ progress toward achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets.

Countries are on track to meet the pledge to triple their renewable energy capacity by 2030, thanks largely to a record surge in solar power, according to energy think tank Ember.

It estimates that the world is set to add around 793 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2025, up from 717 gigawatts in 2024, driven mainly by China.

“If this pace continues, annual additions now only need to grow by around 12 percent a year from 2026 to 2030 to reach tripling, compared with 21 percent originally needed,” said Dave Jones, Ember’s chief analyst. “But governments will need to strengthen commitments to lock this in.”

The pledge to double the world’s energy efficiency by 2030, by contrast, is a long way behind. While efficiency improvements would need to grow by 4 percent a year to reach that target, they hit only 1 percent in 2024.

‘Loss and damage’ fund

When the landmark fund for victims of climate disasters was established at the 2022 talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, it offered promise that billions of dollars would someday flow to nations slammed by hurricanes, droughts or rising seas.

Three years later, it has less than $800 million — only a little more than it had in 2023.

Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, excoriated leaders this month for not providing more. Her rebuke came little more than a week after Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever seen in the Atlantic, swept across the Caribbean.

“All of us should hold our heads down in shame, because having established this fund a few years ago in Sharm El-Sheikh, its capital base is still under $800 million while Jamaica reels from damage in excess of $7 billion, not to mention Cuba or the Bahamas,” she said.

Last week, the fund announced it was allocating $250 million for financial requests to help less-wealthy nations grapple with “damage from slow onset and extreme climate-induced events.” The fund’s executive director, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, said the call for contributions was significant but also a reminder that the fund needs much more money.

Richard Muyungi, chair for the African Group of Negotiators and Tanzania’s climate envoy, said he expects additional funds will come from this summit, though not the billions needed.

“There is a chance that the fund will run out of money by next year, year after next, before it even is given a chance to replenish itself,” said Michai Robertson, a senior finance adviser for the Alliance of Small Island States.

Global Methane Pledge

Backed by the U.S. and European Union, this pledge to cut global methane emissions 30 percent by 2030 was launched four years ago at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, sparking a wave of talk about the benefits of cutting methane, a greenhouse gas with a relatively short shelf life but much greater warming potential than carbon dioxide.

“The Global Methane Pledge has been instrumental in catalyzing attention to the issue of methane, because it has moved from a niche issue to one of the critical elements of the climate planning discussions,” said Giulia Ferrini, head of the U.N. Environment Program’s International Methane Emissions Observatory.

“All the tools are there,” she added. “It’s just a question of political will.”

Methane emissions from the oil and gas sector remain stubbornly high, despite the economic benefits of bringing them down, according to the IEA. The group’s latest methane tracker shows that energy-based methane pollution was around 120 million tons in 2024, roughly the same as a year earlier.

Despite more than 150 nations joining the Global Methane Pledge, few countries or companies have devised plans to meet their commitments, “and even fewer have demonstrated verifiable emissions reductions,” the IEA said.

The European Union’s methane regulation requires all oil and gas operators to measure, report and verify their emissions, including importers. And countries and companies are becoming more diligent about complying with an international satellite program that notifies companies and countries of methane leaks so they can repair them. Responses went from just 1 percent of alerts last year to 12 percent so far in 2025.

More work is needed to achieve the 2030 goal, the U.N. says. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have pressured the EU to rethink its methane curbs.

Barbados and several other countries are calling for a binding methane pact similar to the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 agreement that’s widely credited with saving the ozone layer by phasing out the use of harmful pollutants.

That’s something Paris Agreement architect Laurence Tubiana hopes could happen.

“I’m just in favor of tackling this very seriously, because the pledge doesn’t work [well] enough,” she said.

Climate finance

In 2009, wealthy countries agreed to provide $100 billion annually until 2025 to help poorer nations deal with rising temperatures. At last year’s climate talks in Azerbaijan, they upped the ante to $300 billion per year by 2035.

But those countries delivered the $100 billion two years late, and many nations viewed the new $300 billion commitment with disappointment. India, which expressed particular ire about last year’s outcome, is pushing for new discussions in Brazil to get that money flowing.

“Finance really is at the core of everything that we do,” Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s climate envoy, told POLITICO’s E&E News. But he also recognizes that governments alone are not the answer. “We cannot say finance must only come from the public sector.”

Last year’s pledge included a call for companies and multilateral development banks to contribute a sum exceeding $1 trillion by 2035, but much of that would be juiced by donor nations — and more countries would need to contribute.

That is more important now, said Jake Werksman, the EU’s lead negotiator.

“As you know, one of the larger contributors to this process, the U.S., has essentially shut down all development flows from the U.S. budget, and no other party, including the EU, can make up for that gap,” he said during a press conference.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5b%2Fed%2Fc5e2173d4eabb3f1f32786d47230%2Fclimate-cop30-92558.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:38.103452

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohioapproved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is“disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocatejointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency.

One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

That’s the vision V2G proponents have been describing for years, and projects like Redwood Coast Airport are making it real.
The missing piece is widespread deployment—and that’s exactly what projects like Redwood Coast Airport are helping to enable.","A groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid project at California’s Redwood Coast Airport is demonstrating how electric vehicles can serve as more than just transportation—they’re becoming mobile power plants that strengthen grid resilience and reduce costs.

PG&E, Nissan, Fermata Energy, and the Schatz Energy Research Center at Cal Poly Humboldt have successfully integrated two previous-generation Nissan Leaf electric vehicles into the airport’s existing microgrid infrastructure in McKinleyville, California, reports ARS Technica. The 2020 and 2021 Leaf models, equipped with CHAdeMO quick charge ports, connect to four bidirectional FE-20 charging stations that can both charge the vehicles and draw power from their batteries.

How the V2G System Works

The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid, which has been operating since 2021, already features a 2.2 MW solar array and 8.9 MWh of battery storage, along with a 300 kW net-metered solar system. The two-vehicle Nissan Leaf fleet adds another layer of flexibility and capacity to this sophisticated energy system.

When county staff aren’t using the Leafs for work activities, the vehicles plug into Fermata Energy’s FE-20 bidirectional chargers. These specialized units can charge at 20 kW and discharge at the same rate, transforming the EVs into distributed energy resources. The system uses Fermata’s intelligent V2X platform to optimize when to charge, discharge, or hold battery capacity based on grid conditions and electricity prices.

“Integrating bidirectional chargers and EVs at the Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid is an innovative solution that will expand the capacity of the site, extending the capability for powering the airport during local grid outages and providing another clean energy resource for ensuring statewide grid stability,” said Mike Delaney, Vice President of Utility Partnerships and Innovation at PG&E.

Real-World Performance and Revenue Generation

The vehicles serve multiple purposes beyond basic transportation. During normal operations, they participate in California’s Emergency Load Reduction Program, generating revenue for Humboldt County by responding to grid stress events. When electricity prices are high during peak demand periods, the system can draw power from the parked EVs’ batteries, helping to reduce the county’s utility bills through strategic energy management.

When the microgrid operates in “island mode”—disconnected from the main grid during outages—the Nissan Leafs respond to changes in grid frequency, either injecting power when needed or absorbing excess solar energy depending on their battery levels. This automatic frequency response is crucial for maintaining stable power delivery to the airport and adjacent U.S. Coast Guard Air Station.

The Coast Guard facility oversees search and rescue operations for 250 miles of rural coastline, from the Mendocino-Sonoma county line to the California-Oregon border. Since roads into Humboldt County are frequently closed by fires and landslides, maintaining airport operations during emergencies is literally a matter of life and death.

Battle-Tested Technology

The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid has already proven its worth under extreme conditions. On December 20, 2022, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake knocked out power to more than 70,000 electric customers in Humboldt County. The microgrid automatically disconnected from the grid and provided power to the airport and Coast Guard station for nearly 15 hours—despite facing worst-case conditions.

The earthquake struck at the winter solstice after the batteries had discharged during evening peak demand, leaving them at their lowest charge level. Weather conditions were overcast and rainy, limiting solar generation. Despite these challenges, the system performed flawlessly, allowing the Coast Guard to conduct rescue operations while most of the county remained in the dark.

Since then, the microgrid has been called into service multiple times during winter storm outages, sometimes running for less than 30 minutes and other times operating for eight hours or more. The addition of the bidirectional EV charging capability further enhances this proven resilience.

Industry Leadership in V2G Technology

The FE-20 bidirectional chargers represent the latest generation of Fermata Energy’s technology. The predecessor FE-15 model helped reduce electricity bills by more than $9,450 over four years at Nissan’s Americas Headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee—averaging nearly $2,000 in annual savings. The enhanced FE-20 is expected to deliver even better performance.

“At Fermata Energy, we see a real opportunity to transform electric vehicles from simple modes of transportation into critical energy assets,” said Hamza Lemsaddek, Chief Operating Officer of Fermata Energy. “By integrating our intelligent V2X platform and bidirectional chargers, we are delivering measurable cost savings, valuable grid services and enhanced local energy resilience.”

Nissan has been a pioneer in bidirectional charging capability. The Leaf became the first fully bidirectional-capable electric vehicle launched in the U.S. when it debuted with CHAdeMO V2G capability in 2013. All Nissan Leaf vehicles from model year 2013 and later are compatible with bidirectional charging, though the infrastructure to support V2G has been slow to develop.

There are currently over 30 proven V2G installations across the United States using Fermata Energy chargers and Nissan Leaf vehicles, aimed at helping fleets and dealerships optimize energy usage and reduce costs.

Technical Innovation and Future Implications

The Redwood Coast Airport project is jointly operated by PG&E and the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, Humboldt County’s local Community Choice Aggregator. The collaboration required developing new operating agreements and tariff structures that have informed PG&E’s Community Microgrid Enablement Program—a framework that could serve as a blueprint for similar projects across California and beyond.

“We are proud to have led the technical integration of this important pilot project that advances local resiliency and deep decarbonization and can play an important role in the community microgrids that are being developed across California’s rural north coast and beyond,” said David Carter, principal engineer at the Schatz Energy Research Center at Cal Poly Humboldt.

The project demonstrates that V2G technology is not just a concept for the future—it’s operational today and providing tangible benefits. The system shows how older EV models can contribute to grid stability and energy resilience, extending their utility beyond personal transportation.

For Humboldt County, the technology offers multiple advantages: reduced electricity costs, backup power during emergencies, participation in grid services that generate revenue, and enhanced community resilience. The county staff can use the vehicles normally for work activities, then plug them in to serve as energy assets when parked.

The CHAdeMO Advantage and Limitation

The project relies on CHAdeMO, the Japanese DC fast charging standard that includes native V2G capability in its protocol specification. While CHAdeMO has become less common as CCS (Combined Charging System) has gained market dominance in North America and Europe, it remains the only charging standard with widespread bidirectional capability deployed in production vehicles.

This presents both an opportunity and a challenge. On one hand, hundreds of thousands of Nissan Leafs on the road today (model year 2013 and later) could theoretically participate in V2G programs with the right infrastructure. On the other hand, most new EVs are moving to CCS connectors, which will require updated standards and vehicle hardware to enable widespread bidirectional charging.

The Nissan Leaf, despite being an older design that has been surpassed by newer EVs in range and features, continues to hold unique value precisely because of its bidirectional charging capability. As battery costs continue to fall and EV adoption accelerates, the ability to use parked vehicles as distributed energy storage could become increasingly valuable for grid management.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

The V2G integration at Redwood Coast Airport offers a glimpse into a possible future where millions of electric vehicles contribute to grid stability and renewable energy integration. During the day, excess solar power can charge vehicle batteries. In the evening, when solar generation drops but electricity demand peaks, those same batteries can discharge to meet demand—reducing reliance on fossil fuel “peaker” plants that utilities typically fire up during high-demand periods.

This time-shifting of renewable energy helps address one of the key challenges of solar power: its generation doesn’t always align with when people need electricity. Battery storage solves this problem, and parked EVs represent an enormous potential storage resource. With an average EV battery capacity of 60-100 kWh, even a small fleet can provide meaningful energy storage capacity.

The economic model is compelling. Humboldt County receives both transportation vehicles and energy storage capacity from the same assets. During grid stress events, they earn revenue by participating in demand response programs. They save money through strategic charging and discharging based on time-of-use electricity rates. And they gain energy resilience that has already proven lifesaving during natural disasters.

Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges

Despite the proven success at Redwood Coast Airport, V2G faces significant barriers to widespread adoption. Utility interconnection processes can be complicated and time-consuming. Building codes and local regulations often weren’t written with bidirectional charging in mind. Insurance and liability questions remain partially unresolved.

Most significantly, automakers have been slow to embrace bidirectional charging beyond Nissan. Ford’s F-150 Lightning offers vehicle-to-home capability but requires proprietary equipment. GM has announced plans for V2G capability but hasn’t delivered production systems yet. Tesla, despite early promises, has yet to enable bidirectional charging in any of its vehicles.

The charging infrastructure also needs to expand dramatically. While unidirectional DC fast chargers are becoming more common, bidirectional chargers remain rare and expensive. Standardization efforts are underway, but the industry hasn’t yet coalesced around a single approach for CCS-based V2G systems.

California’s regulatory environment, however, provides some advantages. The state has been progressive in creating programs and tariff structures that allow V2G participation. The California Public Utilities Commission has explored various mechanisms to compensate EV owners for providing grid services. And programs like the Emergency Load Reduction Program create revenue opportunities for V2G participants.

What This Means for the Future

The Redwood Coast Airport project serves as a proof of concept that could inform much larger deployments. If the model can work for two Nissan Leafs at a rural airport, it could potentially scale to fleet vehicles at businesses, school buses, delivery vans, or even residential EVs.

Imagine a future where your parked EV at home helps stabilize the local grid, earns you a few dollars per month, and serves as backup power during outages—all while remaining fully charged and ready to drive whenever you need it. That’s the vision V2G proponents have been describing for years, and projects like Redwood Coast Airport are making it real.

For California, which has aggressive renewable energy and EV adoption targets, V2G technology could prove essential for grid management. As more solar and wind power comes online, and as millions of EVs start charging regularly, the grid will need flexible resources that can balance supply and demand. Parked EVs could fill that role, turning a potential grid challenge into a solution.

The technology is proven. The economics are increasingly favorable. The regulatory frameworks are developing. The missing piece is widespread deployment—and that’s exactly what projects like Redwood Coast Airport are helping to enable.

EVXL’s Take

The Redwood Coast Airport V2G project represents exactly the kind of practical innovation that could accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation and energy systems. While we’ve covered Nissan’s involvement in V2G initiatives before—including when they joined ChargeScape as an equal investor alongside BMW, Ford, and Honda in October 2024—seeing the technology deployed at critical infrastructure like an airport demonstrates its real-world viability.

The timing of this project is particularly noteworthy given the challenges facing EV adoption and grid infrastructure. With concerns about grid capacity to handle widespread EV charging, bidirectional technology flips the script: EVs become part of the solution rather than just another demand on the system. The fact that this is working with older Nissan Leaf models rather than cutting-edge new vehicles also sends an important message about the value proposition of existing EV fleets.

What’s especially compelling about the Redwood Coast implementation is its performance during the December 2022 earthquake. When 70,000 customers lost power, this system kept the airport and Coast Guard station operational under worst-case conditions—low battery charge, minimal solar generation, and winter weather. That’s not a lab demonstration or theoretical model; it’s proven resilience when lives were on the line.

The broader implications for EVXL readers are significant. As automakers continue to introduce more EVs with bidirectional capability, and as companies like ChargeScape build out the platform infrastructure to manage V2G systems, we’re likely to see much wider deployment of this technology. In fact, ChargeScape is already enabling EV owners to earn money while they sleep through smart charging programs—with some drivers potentially earning up to $3,000 per year through bidirectional power-sharing.

Fleet operators, in particular, should be paying close attention—school buses, delivery vehicles, and other fleets that sit parked for significant portions of the day could generate additional revenue and provide community benefits through V2G participation.

The CHAdeMO limitation is worth noting. As the industry moves toward CCS connectors, the bidirectional capabilities that make Nissan Leafs valuable for V2G will need to be replicated in the new standard. The good news is that work is underway, with multiple automakers committing to bidirectional charging in future models. But for now, those older Leafs—often dismissed as outdated compared to newer EVs with longer range—offer a capability that most modern EVs can’t match.

California’s regulatory leadership continues to be crucial. The state’s willingness to develop new tariff structures, operating agreements, and compensation mechanisms for V2G participants creates a model that other jurisdictions can follow. PG&E’s Community Microgrid Enablement Program, informed by projects like this one, could standardize the process for integrating V2G into utility operations.

For the EV industry, the message is clear: vehicles are becoming more than just transportation. They’re mobile energy storage units that can provide grid services, backup power, and revenue opportunities. This adds another dimension to the total cost of ownership calculations that potential EV buyers consider. A vehicle that can reduce your electricity bills, power your home during outages, and earn money when parked offers value beyond its driving capabilities.

We’ll be watching closely as ChargeScape and similar platforms work to scale this technology beyond pilot projects. The Redwood Coast Airport demonstration proves the technology works; now the challenge is making it accessible to millions of EV owners rather than just specialized fleet applications. If successful, V2G could become one of those infrastructure innovations that seems obvious in retrospect—of course our parked vehicles should be helping to stabilize the grid and integrate renewable energy. The only question is how quickly we can make that vision a reality.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_0102.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:29.725986

Good Sunday afternoon. Garrett Ross here. With the Commanders drawing the early time slot today in the latest installment of the NFL’s expanded international slate, it does make me wonder whether there’s something to be said for knowing your team’s result one way or another by lunchtime, so that you can get on with your day. Let me know your thoughts.

DRIVING THE DAY

ON MESSAGE: If you’re trying to deliver a message directly to President Donald Trump, the best arena might just be an interview on Fox News.

So one might imagine, as one of the biggest intraparty blowups among Republicans unravels, that the subject of Trump’s ire would appear on the airwaves of Fox News.

But Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene — once among the president’s staunchest defenders in Congress and now a subject of Trump’s scorn following her push to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — was on her own messaging mission this morning. Though her comments centered on the president, he didn’t appear to be her primary audience: Greene gave her first TV interview since the public spat with Trump to Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” — perhaps an unintentionally well-named venue for the swirling saga that is set to dominate headlines for at least a few more days.

So what was the reason for the split? “Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files, and that is shocking,” Greene told Bash, underscoring her belief that the country “deserves transparency” with regard to the files and vowing to continue pushing for their full release.

Greene said she still supports Trump and the majority of his agenda — but cracks continue to emerge, with the Georgia Republican maintaining that Trump should focus on cost-of-living issues more and cut back on foreign affairs. And she acknowledged that Trump’s comments this week have been “hurtful.”

“The most hurtful thing he said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a ‘traitor.’ And that is so extremely wrong. And those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” Greene said.

Pressed by Bash, she acknowledged it was “fair criticism” to say that she has stayed silent on other occasions when Trump has attacked political opponents.

“I am committed, and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” Greene said, noting that she’s wanted to move away from “toxic politics” since the killing of Charlie Kirk. “I’m leading the way with my own example. And I hope that President Trump can do the same.”

While Greene may be undergoing some changes, others in her party are following familiar patterns. One person who did make an appearance over on “Fox News Sunday” this morning was Speaker Mike Johnson. With the House set to vote on the release of the Epstein files on Tuesday, Johnson waved off the idea that Trump is sweating it.

“He’s not worried about it. I talk to him all the time. He has nothing to do with this,” Johnson said. “He’s frustrated that they are turning him into a political issue, and it’s not surprising because the Democrats have nothing else to talk about.”

But it’s not just Democrats talking about the Epstein files.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who teamed up with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to deliver the discharge petition that forced the House vote this week, was on ABC’s “This Week” to tout his efforts.

“Dogs don’t bark at parked cars, and we are winning,” Massie said.

“I am not tired of winning yet,” he said, likely a cheeky nod to a Trumpian phrase, “but we are winning. And not only the speaker, but the attorney general, the FBI director and the president himself and the vice president, they are taking a big loss this week because after months of fighting I am winning this week with Ro Khanna. We are forcing this vote and it will happen.”

As for the vote itself, he predicted a “deluge” of Republicans will join in voting for the release of the files — but his aim is much higher.

“I hope we get a veto-proof majority on this legislation,” Massie said, noting that the path forward in the Senate is far from clear.

“I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,” Massie said of the Senate majority leader. “But the pressure is going to be there if we get a big vote in the House.”

And he’s got a message for his colleagues who are still deciding how they’ll vote come Tuesday.

“Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement. But in 2030, he’s not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don’t vote to release these files,” he warned. “And the president can’t protect you then. This vote — the record of this vote — will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency.”

SUNDAY BEST …

— Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on the coming HHS advisory vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, on CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “I’m very concerned about this. … The vaccine is safe … and these ingredients they’re speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don’t understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we’ve been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I’m a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. … I want to make America healthy, and you don’t start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.”

— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on U.S.-China trade talks, on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”: “We haven’t even finished the agreement, which we hope to have done by Thanksgiving, and I am confident that post-our meeting in Korea between the two leaders — President Trump, President Xi [Jinping] — that China will honor their agreements.”

— National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on the cost of coffee, bananas, beef and other goods after tariffs are removed, on ABC’s “This Week”: “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs, so —” Jonathan Karl: “So they might not come down.” Hassett: “And so the prices will go down, of course.” Karl: “Because the tariffs have been taken off, right?” Hassett: “Right, well because the supply of goods into the U.S. is going to increase.”

— Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave his quiet blessing for Kaine to vote to end the shutdown, on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Absolutely not. … He would have preferred that I not voted the way that I did. But he knows that U.S. senators are going to do what’s in the interest of their constituents. And my 320,000 federal workers and their families are a powerful, powerful part of who I represent. And when I could get important protections for them after a year of being kicked around by Donald Trump, I said, ‘I’m ready to sign on.’ … Some folks like [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] may think that’s nothing. Virginians think it’s an awful lot.”

— Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on GOP changes to Obamacare, on “Fox News Sunday”: “We’re not going to repeal Obamacare. We’re going to fix Obamacare … You do have to protect pre-existing conditions, you have to make sure that it’s a fair system to everybody. So this is all doable. There’s no reason health care costs what it costs. We should not give money directly to the insurance companies.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. THE CRACKDOWN: The federal immigration crackdown has arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina. In Trump’s latest urban target — which has seen huge recent population growth from Latin American immigrants — masked Border Patrol agents commenced operations yesterday and into today, arresting people in sometimes violent encounters and triggering protests, as the Charlotte Observer reports. In one high-profile incident, agents smashed through the window of a U.S. citizen’s truck. Immigrant advocates condemned the dozens of arrests already, while Border Patrol leader Gregory Bovino celebrated “a record day today!!!!!”

The fallout unfolded similarly to the previous crackdowns in LA and Chicago: Businesses closed and streets emptied out in areas with large immigrant populations. Democratic and Republican elected officials feuded over the crackdown. It’s not clear how long Border Patrol’s operations in the city, dubbed “Charlotte’s Web,” will last. Republicans have targeted crime in Charlotte since the random killing of a woman on a train in August.

Up next: After Charlotte, Border Patrol plans to take on New Orleans as its next target, as CBS’ Camilo Montoya-Galvez scooped. That operation will be called “Catahoula Crunch.”

Standing down: Some 400 federalized National Guard troops who were sent to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago from out of state are heading back home, after court fights prevented them from ever deploying on the streets, ABC’s Luis Martinez reports. Though the troops from California and Texas are leaving, 200 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in Chicago, as will half of the 200 Oregon National Guard troops in Portland.

2. BIG INVESTIGATION: “The Department of Deportation,” by NYT’s Nicholas Nehamas and colleagues: “The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from President Trump … A national security probe into the black market for Iranian oil sold to finance terrorism has been slowed down for months because of the shift to immigration work, allowing tanker ships and money to disappear. And federal efforts to combat human smuggling and sex trafficking have languished …

“Homeland security investigators worked approximately 33 percent fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February through April compared to their average in prior years … Administration officials defended Mr. Trump’s approach, saying the immigration crackdown was paramount to protecting public safety and national security. They also disputed that the intensified focus on immigration had undermined D.H.S.’s work. … Roughly 8 percent of those arrested had been convicted of a violent crime.”

3. THE SUBSIDIES: If Congress ends up extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies but makes policy changes to secure Republican votes, the 20 state Obamacare exchanges would have to race to update their systems accordingly, POLITICO’s Robert King reports. Implementing a clean extension would be pretty feasible, but big changes could take the state exchanges a lot of time to update premiums and communicate to consumers.

The politics: As Democrats increasingly focus on health care ahead of the midterms, some believe they can win over voters by decrying HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine views and actions, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. And they’ll seek to win over a public facing the largest contraction of the social safety net in decades. Even as SNAP comes back online following the government shutdown, Republicans’ cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are expected to force millions of people off food stamps in the next few months, along with Medicaid cuts and other changes, POLITICO’s Marcia Brown notes.

Annals of influence: Health insurance companies faced off with Trump to try to secure the subsidy extensions. Pharmaceutical companies tried to win him over and strike deals to forestall tariffs. The divergent outcomes — with pharma so far coming out ahead — were “a case study for lobbyists trying to figure out how to handle the mercurial president and his populist approach to politics,” POLITICO’s Amanda Chu reports. “Currying favor helps, fighting is risky business.”

4. SURVEY SAYS: Americans agree that Republicans won the government shutdown, saying by a margin of 55 percent to 6 percent that the GOP got more of what they wanted, according to a new CBS poll. Relatedly, Republicans are largely satisfied with their leaders’ level of compromise, while a majority of Democrats think their party gave in too much. But the standoff did raise the salience of health care: Nearly two-thirds of the country expects that health insurance premiums are going up in the months to come.

5. STAT OF THE DAY: “Trump buys at least $82 million in bonds since late August, disclosures show,” by Reuters’ Nandita Bose: “According to the forms released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Trump carried out more than 175 financial purchases … Most of the assets listed in Saturday’s disclosures consist of bonds issued by municipalities, states, counties, school districts and other entities with ties to public agencies. Trump’s new bond investments span several industries, including sectors that have already benefited, or are benefiting, from his administration’s policy changes … The administration has said before that … neither he nor his family has a role in running the portfolio.”

6. PARDON ME: Ed Martin announced that Trump has pardoned two more people for crimes that arose from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, per NYT’s Alan Feuer. One, Daniel Wilson, had been convicted for having illegal weapons and ammunition discovered as part of an investigation into his separate Jan. 6 crimes. The other, Suzanne Kaye, was sentenced for threatening FBI agents with violence. The pardons “were part of Mr. Trump’s continuing efforts to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,” the Times writes.

7. MAKING A LIST: “Trump recasts foreign terror list to focus on ‘antifa,’ cartels,” by WaPo’s Adam Taylor: “The Trump administration is pursuing an unprecedented expansion of the U.S. government’s list of foreign terrorist organizations, adding left-wing groups in Europe along with Latin American drug-trafficking organizations … [E]xperts said the targeting of groups linked to antifa … was a highly unusual move, particularly as those targeted this week do not directly threaten the United States or have a record of committing deadly attacks.”

8. MYSTERY SOLVED? Newly released financial disclosures show that Adriana Kugler’s surprise departure from the Fed in August came as she was being investigated for breaking ethics rules, per Bloomberg. Kugler had traded individual stocks, against Fed rules. The central bank’s IG is still investigating. Kugler had asked for a waiver and been denied by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the documents reveal. She declined to comment.

9. AN UNORTHODOX CANDIDATE: “Bravo star Dr. Heavenly Kimes wins reality TV fights. Can she win a run for Congress?” by USA Today’s Jay Stahl: “Cosmetic dentist Dr. Heavenly Kimes has been throwing shade with a smile for over a decade on Bravo’s ‘Married to Medicine’ … Now, Kimes, 54, is running in a crowded Democratic primary as she seeks to unseat Rep. David Scott, the 80-year-old incumbent in Georgia’s 13th congressional district … Kimes was demoted from main cast member and has less airtime this season – a move some believe Bravo made due to her congressional hopes – but she was allowed to film while running for office.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

Nicolás Maduro sang “Imagine” at a rally against Donald Trump’s pressure campaign.

Tina Brown thinks it’s “wonderful” that NYC’s plutocrats are “terrified” by Zohran Mamdani: “We have been so bullied by the super-rich.”

John Fetterman is back home after 20 stitches and some gnarly facial injuries.

Brian Glenn posted love and support for his girlfriend, Marjorie Taylor Greene, as Trump feuds with her. George Conway responded: “Seriously, it must be nice to have someone you care for stick up for you when you stand up to Trump.”

OUT AND ABOUT — At the ModSquad retreat yesterday in Charlottesville, Virginia, Rahm Emanuel was the keynote speaker, weighing in on the government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader “Chuck Schumer is not the problem, Donald Trump is and the Republicans,” Emanuel said. “They don’t come out of this really well … Do not underestimate what it meant for a president of the United States, who’s already got some preconceived negatives, to be going to the Supreme Court to deny people food, to be so cruel that he was willing to fire people because he wanted to hurt them, shut down bridges. … The contrast of that picture is cutting the food stamps and doing a ‘Great Gatsby’ party.”

Samson Signori, campaign manager for Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, also spoke at the retreat about lessons for Democrats from their victory. Signori said the campaign was laser-focused on costs and safety — and the effects of Trump’s policies, like DOGE’s civil service cuts, rather than the man himself. “It was only invoking Trump when it was having a direct impact on Trump’s economy,” Signori said.

— SPOTTED at the Belgian Embassy’s King’s Day reception Friday night: Belgian Ambassador Frédéric Bernard, USTR Jamieson Greer, Italian Ambassador Marco Peronaci, Liechtenstein Ambassador Georg Sparber, Egyptian Ambassador Motaz Zahran, Burundian Ambassador Jean Bosco Barege, Congolese Ambassador Yvette Kapinga Ngandu, Spanish Ambassador Ángeles Moreno Bau, Michael Gordon, Vera Bergengruen, Sam Skove, Olivia Gazis and Eric Martin.

— More than 1,000 Iranian-Americans gathered at the Hyatt Regency yesterday for the National Council of Resistance of Iran’s “Free Iran” convention, where speakers included Mike Pompeo, Carla Sands, Patrick Kennedy, John Bercow and Guy Benson. Pompeo called for the Abraham Accords to keep growing and said Iran’s government “is weak and more isolated than ever. Fear is its only tool.”

— The National Portrait Gallery held its Portrait of a Nation awards and fundraiser gala last night at Union Station, with honors going to Jamie Dimon, Temple Grandin, Joy Harjo and Steven Spielberg. Presenters included Jeff Bezos, Claire Danes, Emily Gerson Saines, Sandra Cisneros and Amy Sherald. The four honorees will have their portraits hanging at the gallery for roughly the next year.

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin says the move aims to ensure public safety. Local officials including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles are criticizing the arrests, saying they cause unnecessary fear.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine is working on a prisoner exchange with Russia

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia, potentially bringing home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced this on Sunday, following progress in negotiations. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Secretary, said Saturday that talks mediated by Turkey and the UAE focused on activating agreements brokered in Istanbul. These agreements set rules for large swaps. Meanwhile, Russian drone strikes damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region overnight into Sunday. Ukraine’s air force reported shooting down 139 drones. Ukrainian forces also struck a major oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region.

Trump says stopping suspected drug boats doesn't work. But the US reports record cocaine seizures

MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump has justified American military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs by saying the longtime U.S. strategy of interdicting such vessels has been a major failure. Trump’s comments came around the same time that the U.S. Coast Guard announced a record year for cocaine seizures. That milestone, however, hasn't stopped the Republican president from upending decades of U.S. counternarcotics policy with a series of military strikes in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Veterans of the drug war say U.S. resources would be better spent doubling down on the traditional approach of interdicting drug boats.

Trump, like Biden before him, finds there's no quick fix on inflation

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s problems with fixing the high cost of living might be giving voters a feeling of déjà vu. Just like President Joe Biden, Trump says lower prices are just around the corner. But Biden-era officials say that argument doesn't work with impatient voters. Republicans pushed the case that Biden’s policies made inflation worse. Democrats are using that same framing today. They say Trump's tariffs are getting passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and that mass deportations have made the construction of homes more expensive. Trump says Republicans need to do a better job explaining his policies. But he also blames Biden for the economic problems.

Voters in Virginia and New Jersey send a message: It's Trump's economy now

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — The economy and rising prices were high on the minds of voters on Election Day, and those concerns contributed to a Democratic sweep of statewide offices in Virginia and New Jersey. The voting pattern in two traditionally Republican counties in each state is evidence of how strongly Democrats campaigned on pocketbook issues. Spotsylvania County in Virginia and Morris County in New Jersey backed Donald Trump and Republican candidates for governor in earlier elections. This month, voters in those counties went with Democrats up and down the ballot. With congressional midterm elections in 2026, the November results have sent a message to conservatives who hold power in Washington.

First strong winter rains soak Gaza's makeshift shelters

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Parts of Gaza's huge Muwasi tent camp are struggling after winter's first major rainfall. Residents faced flooding and damaged infrastructure on Saturday after two years of war. They tried to dig trenches to keep water out of their tents while rain soaked their belongings. Strong winds can also topple tents and make it hard to gather food and supplies. The United Nations earlier this year said Muwasi was sheltering up to 425,000 displaced Palestinians. The Israeli defense body says it is allowing in winterization materials, but aid organizations warn these efforts are insufficient. Some people tried to shelter in destroyed buildings at risk of collapse.

The unpopular and politically weak 90-year-old Palestinian leader struggles for a role in Gaza

CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas turns 90 on Saturday, still holding power in parts of the West Bank but weakened and unpopular. Critics say his long tenure without elections has left Palestinians leaderless during an existential crisis. Hopes for a Palestinian state, central to Abbas' agenda, seem dimmer than ever. Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza is seen by many as genocide, a claim Israel denies. Abbas' Palestinian Authority is sidelined in Gaza, and critics fear Palestinians will have little voice in their future. An October poll found 80% of Palestinians want Abbas to resign.

Trump pardons Jan. 6 rioter for gun offense and woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has issued two pardons related to the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, including for a woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents who were investigating a tip that she may have been at the Capitol. In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms. It’s the latest example of Trump’s willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration’s massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to charges against more than 1,500 defendants.

Ho remembered her as a funny person and humorous writer who wanted people with disabilities to have independence and a voice for themselves.

Homeland Security agents surge into North Carolina's largest city. Here's what to know

U.S. immigration agents are targeting North Carolina’s largest city over objections from local leaders, prompting activists, elected officials and community groups to monitor any sweeps and support vulnerable Charlotte residents. President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in Charlotte had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations. It’s the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of some of America’s largest cities run by Democrats. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who don’t have legal status in the U.S., and sparked a number of lawsuits.",https://baytobaynews.com/images/favicons/favicon-v2.ico,N,,2025-11-16 17:59:38.069308

Google data centers totaling $40 billion coming to Texas, Texas Tribune

As I wrote about this week, ERCOT hired Aurora Energy Research to run models of strategies to reduce the likelihood of rolling outages in a 2023-like heat wave or 2022-like winter storm.

There was one scenario that had zero rolling outages: high demand growth from data centers with high levels of flexibility.

The same week the report came out, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Governor Abbott appeared on a stage together to announce $40 billion in investment including 6.2 gigawatts of incremental supply and a fund for energy efficiency, which was highlighted in Governor Abbott’s statement:

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott wrote in a statement. “Google’s $40 billion investment makes Texas Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state. We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen.”

When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts | The Wall Street Journal (gift link)

Texas will clearly be a major destination for data centers. The WSJ had a great piece breaking down the realities of supply constraints facing AI developers:

The rate at which tech companies and startups are investing in AI shows no signs of slowing. In their latest financial reports, all of the big spenders revealed that their current investments had grown significantly, and projected that this trend would continue.

There is effectively “infinite” money available right now to build out new data centers, says Jim Schneider, a senior research analyst at Goldman Sachs. All this investment has translated into record spending on the stuff that goes into data centers—aka “AI supercomputers”—all those chips, servers, HVAC systems, transformers, gas turbines, power lines and power plants.

Today’s record number of data centers at the planning stage is indicative of what Raymond James managing director Frank Louthan calls “kind of a gold rush mentality.” Connecting these planned data centers to power and fiber, and finding a buyer or tenant who wants one, in that particular location is another matter.

As the chart shows below there’s about 70 gigawatts of planned power capacity in 2025 alone. Next year will almost certainly be even bigger.

The high load growth scenario modeled by Aurora was for 22 gigawatts in Texas over the next five years.

The Colorado Energy Office and the governor’s office announced in a joint news release on Thursday that homeowners could be eligible for up to $14,000 in rebates for heat pumps, electric stoves and other appliances and upgrades.

The funding was made available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law passed under former President Joe Biden that directed hundreds of billions of dollars toward clean energy and climate-related programs.

That included $140.3 million in rebates for Colorado, which are now being passed down to residents as part of the state’s Home Energy Rebate Program .

Here’s what homeowners could be eligible for:

Up to $8,000 for a cold climate heat pump for space heating or cooling

Up to $4,000 for a breaker box upgrade

Up to $2,500 for electric wiring

Up to $1,750 for a heat pump water heater

Up to $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation

Up to $840 for an electric stove, cooktop, oven or heat pump clothes dryer

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funds run out. These benefits are different from the federal clean energy tax credits that were also passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, some of which have already been phased out . Credits for electric vehicles ended in September, while credits for home appliances and solar installation expire on Dec. 31.

For the rebate program, homeowners must work with a registered contractor to receive the benefit. More than 55 contractors across Colorado have already begun the registration process, and the state will continue to add to the list of approved contractors over the coming weeks as more contractors complete the process.

Just days after announcing plans for a third Oklahoma data center, Google confirmed another major investment in renewable energy infrastructure—this time in Arkansas.

Arkansas Business reports the company will be the exclusive buyer of power from the $123 million Redfield Solar Farm in Grant County, located in southeast Arkansas.

The facility, owned and operated by Treaty Oak Clean Energy of Austin, Texas, spans more than 1,000 acres of solar panels and is designed to generate 100 megawatts (MW) of power—enough to supply nearly 18,000 homes.

Operations Expected to Begin in Mid-2026

Power Distributed Through Entergy Arkansas

Construction of the Redfield Solar project began earlier this year, with operations expected to start in the second quarter of 2026.

Power from the site will be transmitted through Entergy Arkansas, serving the grid operator’s 15-state region, which includes Oklahoma. Reports suggest a portion of the power may be used to operate Google’s data centers in Oklahoma, supporting the company’s expanding AI and cloud computing footprint.

A new report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that natural gas prices for utilities will rise by 37% by the end of 2025, driven by surging wholesale market costs.

While consumers are expected to feel the impact, the cost increase for end users will be significantly lower than what utilities themselves will pay.

Wholesale Prices Driving Broad Sector Increases

Electric and Industrial Sectors See Largest Jumps

The EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts that the average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will climb 37%, while prices paid by industrial customers will rise 21% compared with 2024 levels.

Smaller increases are expected for commercial and residential customers, both projected at 4% year-over-year.

Each sector’s price is partially influenced by the Henry Hub benchmark, the industry’s key indicator of natural gas spot prices. The report noted that Henry Hub prices have been higher each month compared with the same months in 2024. On an annual basis, the EIA expects the 2025 Henry Hub price to be 58% higher than in 2024.

Industrial and Power Producers Feel the Impact First

Wholesale Price Volatility Hits Major Buyers

The wholesale price of natural gas most directly affects industrial users and power generators, whose retail prices closely mirror shifts in the Henry Hub spot price.

These large-scale consumers often buy gas on a wholesale basis, covering both commodity and transmission costs. As a result, the rise in wholesale market prices will quickly translate into higher costs for utilities and industrial plants.

Retail Prices for Smaller Consumers Rise More Slowly

Regulation and Billing Cycles Moderate Increases

For residential, commercial, and small industrial customers, natural gas prices do not track wholesale spikes as closely, because utilities typically adjust rates gradually through billing cycles.

These adjustments often occur under state regulatory oversight, which can limit rapid price increases and smooth out volatility.

EIA noted that customer charges and fixed distribution fees also dilute the direct impact of wholesale fluctuations on household and small-business bills.

It seems like a day doesn’t go by without Waymo making some kind of expansion announcement. Detroit, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the cities the company plans to bring its robotaxi to in the coming months. But as I have argued in this newsletter before, there is another “expansion” I think is more important.

Freeways.

And now after years of testing and development, the company’s commercial robotaxi service is using freeways around the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.

This is a critical expansion for the company. It’s the concrete and asphalt connective tissue in sprawling metro areas like the Bay Area. This new freeway access is fueling Waymo’s expansion in that region, which is now 260 square miles and encompasses Silicon Valley and San Francisco.

Robotaxi rides can have more efficient routes too. Waymo told me it will reduce ride times by up to 50%.

And using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in.

That freeway-to-airport moment will be the big unlock for Waymo. But will it be enough to help push it in the black? Until someone over there slides me their balance sheet, I can’t say. It will certainly be a popular option for travelers. That doesn’t mean the economics will pencil out.

A little bird

It’s been nearly nine months since Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson abruptly resigned, leaving the company without a permanent replacement. That may be about to change, though.

A few little birds told us Lucid Motors has zeroed in on a candidate for the top role. It’s expected to be someone outside the organization, which is perhaps no surprise; in August, we shared here that the company and the executive hiring firm it’s using had cast a very wide net and was even cold-calling some candidates. This would likely mean that Marc Winterhoff, who’s been serving as interim CEO, would slide back to the COO role he occupied before Rawlinson left.

Deals!

Another SPAC has entered the AV world! Mergers with special acquisition companies may not be officially “back,” but they are certainly popular among autonomous vehicle companies.

Einride, the Swedish electric and autonomous truck startup, plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, just six weeks after it raised $100 million from investors. The SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp. values Einride at $1.8 billion in pre-money equity.

Einride does generate revenue, which may sound obvious but there have been plenty of pre-revenue transportation companies that have SPAC’d in recent years.

For now, its primary source of revenue is coming from its software-as-a-service product and a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks used by companies like Heineken and PepsiCo. Its unusual-looking autonomous podlike trucks are still in pilot mode.

The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with Einride making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Forterra, a company developing autonomous tech for defense, raised $238 million in equity and debt funding. Moore Strategic Ventures led the equity piece of the funding, while Crescent Cove provided the debt financing.

Gopuff, the rapid-delivery startup, raised $250 million in a round led by Eldridge Industries and Valor Equity Partners. Baillie Gifford, Robinhood, Equalis Capital, George Ruan, Yakir Gabay, and Gopuff’s co-founders. The funding put its valuation at $8.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, a significant markdown from its last raise in 2021.

Harbinger, the Los Angeles-based electric truck startup, raised $160 million in a Series C funding round co-led by FedEx. As part of the investment, FedEx ordered 53 of Harbinger’s electric truck chassis.

Octopus Electric Vehicles, a U.K.-based electric vehicle-leasing business, has struck a deal with lenders, including Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Agricole, to take its total funding line to £2 billion ($2.6 billion), Sky News reported.

Teradar, a Boston-based startup developing a solid-state sensor, raised $150 million in a Series B funding round from investors Capricorn Investment Group, Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, mobility-focused firm Ibex Investors, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.

Upway, an e-bike refurbishment startup, raised $60 million in a Series C funding round led by A.P. Moller. Galvanize, Ora Global, and Sequoia Capital also participated. The company has raised more than $125 million since its founding in 2021.

Vay, a German startup that remotely pilots rental cars to customers, announced a $60 million investment from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year.”

The ride-hailing company is also seeking more premium customers through new efforts like Uber Ski, which lets riders schedule a vehicle in advance to nearly 40 popular ski destinations in North America and Europe, including Vail in Colorado and Park City in Utah.

Via had its first earnings since it became a publicly traded company, and, welp, it lost money. The tech transit software company reported a loss of $36.9 million in its third quarter, a 73% increase since the same period last year. Its revenue grew to $713 million, an 11% increase YoY.

One more thing …

Remember the poll in last week’s newsletter? I asked which product goal is Tesla most likely to achieve by 2035? The options are based on real goals laid out in Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package:

20 million Tesla vehicles delivered

10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions

1 million robots delivered

1 million robotaxis in commercial operation

None of these will be reached

And y’all are split between two options: Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles, which received 34.7% of the vote, and “None of these will be reached,” which received 32% of the vote.

The one item you seem to agree on is that Tesla is unlikely to deliver on the other three goals. About 9.5% of readers picked the 1 million robots option, 12.6% chose 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 10.5% picked 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation within 10 years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SF_WAYMO-FREEWAY_FRONT.jpg?resize=1200,801",N,,2025-11-16 13:59:52.312774

UK Gov’t Taps Rolls-Royce for Three 480 MW PWRs at Wylfa

North Wales site chosen ahead of Oldbury in England for three Rolls-Royce reactors

(NucNet contributed to this report ) The UK has chosen the island of Anglesey off the Welsh coast to host Britain’s first small modular reactors, designed by Rolls-Royce. Each PWR type unit can produce 480 MWe of power for a total of 1,440 MW or nearly the equivalent of one of the 1,650 MW EPRs being built by EDF at the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C sites.

Roll-Royce said that most of the reactor’s components will be built in “factory production” environments. According to the firm, they will be assembled into the completed reactor on-site. The effects of these plans will be to significantly reduce project risk and shorten build schedules. The Rolls-Royce SMR is expected to have a 60 year service life.

The Wylfa decision marks a major step forward for Britain’s nascent SMR industry, which the government hopes can help replace the UK’s fleet of large, ageing nuclear power plants. Nuclear currently supplies about 14% of the UK’s electricity.

In a statement the government said North Wales will become a beacon in the “golden age” of nuclear, delivering the UK’s first three SMRs at the Wylfa nuclear site in the north of the island, choosing it ahead of a rival site at Oldbury in Gloucestershire, southwest England.

The island of Anglesey is located about 90 miles west of Liverpool, U.K.

The government also announced that Great British Energy-Nuclear (GBE-N), the body overseeing new nuclear in the UK, has been tasked with identifying suitable sites that could potentially host new large-scale reactors.

GBE-N will report back by autumn 2026 on potential sites. The energy secretary, Ed Milliband, has requested this includes sites across the UK including Scotland, where the devolved Scottish National Party government is opposed to nuclear.

Any large-scale project would be similar in scale to the Hinkley Point C or Sizewell C projects, with the potential to power the equivalent of six million homes. This implies a requirement for 3.7 GWe of 24×7/365 electrical generation capacity.

The Wylfa decision marks a major step forward for Britain’s nascent SMR industry, which the government hopes can help replace the UK’s fleet of large, ageing nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy currently supplies about 14% of the UK’s electricity.

Decision ‘Rights The Wrongs’ Of Previous Failures

The government said the confirmation of Wylfa as the host site rights the wrongs of previous failure to bring new nuclear power to North Wales.

In March 2024, GBE-N bought the Wylfa and Oldbury sites from Hitachi Ltd for £160 million ($201 million). Both sites house shut-down Magnox nuclear plants and had been intended for deployment of large Hitachi advanced boiling water (BWR)reactor technology by the then Hitachi-subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power.

However, the Horizon Wylfa project was abandoned by Hitachi in early 2019 due to cost pressures and because of corporate concerns about the financial terms offered by the U.K. government. Hitachi wrote off £2.1 billion in the process. Plans for Oldbury were dropped in 2020.

The Wylfa and Oldbury projects were each expected to host twin Hitachi 1,350 MW ABWRs for a total of 5.4 GW of electrical generation capacity or 145% of the combined power expected to be generated by the two EDF reactors now under construction. The cancellation of theses projects revealed fundamental weaknesses in the ability of the UK government to address the nation’s energy security needs.

In March 2024, the government announced that an agreement had been reached to buy the Hitachi-owned sites for new nuclear at Wylfa and at Oldbury-on-Severn in southwest England. At the time, the government said said the two sites were expected to be selected for new nuclear energy projects.

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said, “Bringing nuclear back to Wylfa is a historic moment for Wales and for the UK’s clean energy future. Wylfa’s revival offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver clean, reliable power for decades to come, create thousands of skilled jobs, attract major investment, and revitalize North Wales’s proud industrial heritage.”

Potential for Further Domestic New Builds and Exports

The U.K. government also said in its press statement there is “strong export potential” for small modular reactors, after the UK and Czechia signed a deal to cooperate on civil nuclear. It comes after Rolls-Royce SMR and Czechia’s largest public company, CEZ, agreed last year to partner on SMRs, with CEZ acquiring a 20% stake. Rolls-Royce has said it has proposed building six of its SMRs in that country.

Great British Energy-Nuclear also owns the Oldbury nuclear site near Gloucester. As a site which has previously hosted a nuclear power station, it also has great potential for new nuclear, including the potential to support the privately-led projects being developed by the nuclear industry. Earlier this year the government announced a shake-up of planning rules to allow new nuclear projects including SMRs to be built in a range of sites across England and Wales including Wlyfa and Oldbury.

The Oldbury Nuclear Site, home to two of the UK’s oldest nuclear reactors that were commissoined in 1967, is 131 miles due west of London. The 217 MW Magnox reactors are now shut down and in the hands of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.

Separately, the government said it was planning to develop additional large nuclear power stations like Sizewell and Hinkley Point. The government plans to report on potential sites for gigawatt-scale reactors through Great British Energy in the near future.

Sites under consideration right now include Torness east of Edinburgh and Hunterston west of Glasgow. Westinghouse could position itself as a candidate for these future projects offering its 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR, particularly given the diplomatic pressure from the U.S. (See next story)

Funding Plans and Investors

Rolls-Royce’s SMR deal is subject to final government approvals and contract signature, expected later this year. The government has pledged £2.5 billion of funding for SMRs for the startup phase of the project o help Rolls-Royce develop three 480-MW reactors.

At $9,000/kw, each 480 MW unit would cost $4.3 billion and all three would cost $12.9 billion. The actual costs are still unknown as it will be several years before any of the units pours first concrete.

This is about 20% of the total expected cost of the three SMRs. The 80% of the cost will have to be funded by private investors. Also, Rolls-Royce may able to convince the government to authorize it to use the Regulated Asset Base method (RAB).

Under the RAB model, consumers contribute to the cost of new nuclear power projects during the construction phase – but overall the UK government estimatesconsumers are expected to save more than £30 billion over the project’s lifetime on each new large-scale nuclear power station compared with existing funding mechanisms.

Initial contributions will give private investors greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills.

The New York Times, in its reports about the Rolls Royce decision, noted that the firm has secured investments from the Qatar Investment Authority, the Persian Gulf emirate’s sovereign wealth fund; Constellation, an American utility; and a 20% equity stakje by CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

The RAB model will reduce the UK’s reliance on overseas developers for financing new nuclear projects by substantially increasing the pool of private investors to include British pension funds, insurers and other domestic institutional investors. The UK bought out China’s investment in the Sizewell C reactor project due to “security concerns.”

If the firm completes the licensing process for the SMR in 2026, as currently scheduled. first concrete could be poured as early as 2027. With a four year constuction timeline, the first unit could be in revenue service, providing returns to investors, by 2031.

Licensing the Rolls-Royce SMR in the UK

In 2022 Rolls-Royce began the U.K.’s licensing process, known as the generic design assessment, which is a three step process carried out by the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The firm completed Step 2 of the GDA assessment in July 2024 using the 2019 reactor design data.

Successful completion of the GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and acceptance of an environmental review. Step 3 is expected to be completed in August 2026 for a total duration of 53 months.

The costly and complex process can take three-to-five years to complete depending on how well the applicant is prepared to meet the highly prescriptive requirement of the process. This timeline means that the earliest Roll-Royce could break ground would be the 2028/2029 timeframe. It is unknown what the cost of the reactors are likely to be by then. Rolls-Royce told the BBC it plans to have the first unit in revenue service by the early 2030s. These dates suggest a four-year construction timeline.

Washington Expresses Disappointment Over Selection of Rolls-Royce

The decision to choose Rolls-Royce over its U.S. competitor Westinghouse Electric Company has drawn unusual and sharp criticism from Washington. Warren Stephens, the US Ambassador to the UK, published a statement ahead of the UK announcement expressing his disappointment with the news. The text of the complaint goes far beyond the expected boundaries of diplomatic notes between allies.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location.”

The ambassador’s unprecedented remarks suggested that Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales. What he is focused on its the full size AP1000 at 1,150 MW and not SMRs.

Stephens said: “If you want to get shovels in the ground as soon as possible and take a big step in addressing energy prices and availability, there is a different path, and we look forward to decisions soon on large-scale nuclear projects.”

“As I have repeatedly said, we want the UK to be the strongest possible ally to the United States, and high energy costs are an impediment to that,” Stephens added.

His statement gave no details of alternatives proposed by the US but it given that the Westinghouse offering is the only large reactor, that has been built elsewhere (China and U.S) that could be provided.

The UK announcement awarding the contract to Rolls-Royce appears to have caught Washington off guard, particularly given the nuclear pact the two countries made during Trump’s state visit earlier in the autumn.

The deal focused on cutting red tape in the licensing of both SMRs and full size reactors. Interestingly, that agreement cited X-Energy which is a a U.S. developer of an advanced SMR based on an 80 MW HTGR SMR design that will use TRISO HALEU enriched nuclear fuel.

A U.K. government spokesperson defended the decision to award the contract to Rolls-Royce as the right one for the UK.

“This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR program, producing homegrown clean power with a British company and we have chosen the best site for it,” the source told The Guardian. More to the point, the selection of Rolls-Royce preserves the firm’s capability to manufacture and maintain the Royal Navy’s fleet of nuclear powered submarines and surface ships.

It follows that the UK government selected Rolls-Royce for a combination of reasons having to do with energy security and national security. The US government cannot have been blind to these imperatives. It follows that the ambassador’s comments on UK internal affairs were directed by a White House reaction with an assist from industry lobbying.

Does the Westinghouse AP300 Have a Future in the UK?

It is clear that Ambassador Stephens was referring to the Westinghouse AP1000, an 1,150 MW PWR. However, the firm already has an early stage foothold in the UK for the AP300, its 300 MW SMR, which is a downsized version of the AP1000.

In February 2024 Westinghouse scored a win for its marketing efforts in the UK with an non-binding agreement in principle to build four 300 MW AP300 small modular reactors, for a total of 1.2 GW, in a privately funded project in an industrial region of the UK.

The firm has not publicly disclosed the names of its investors for the project but they are assumed to be industries in the region who want electrical power and are impatient with the glacial pace of government decision making in siting new reactors.

In a press statement the firm said, “Westinghouse Electric Company announced that it has signed an agreement with Community Nuclear Power, Ltd. (CNP) that puts it on track to deploy the UK’s first privately-financed small modular reactor fleet, with the Westinghouse AP300 SMR.”

The new power station will be sited at Seal Sands, a former chemical works. The plant closed on November 2021. Located on the shore of the Tees river, the proposed SMR plant site is adjacent to a Conoco Oil facility and upriver from an ecological reserve.

The North Teesside region of Northeast England, Middlesbrough, is located on England’s North Sea coast, 260 miles due north of London. Iron and steel have dominated the industry of both Middlesbrough and the Teesside area from the 1840s. Teesside had also become one of the major steel centers in the country, and one of the largest worldwide. Industrial decline in recent years has hampered economic development in the region.

Ship building and coal mining have also been major industries in the region. All of these industries would be logical customers in terms of offering robust demand for electricity and decarbonization of power intensive manufacturing processes. New, reliable power sources, which provide carbon free electricity, would be attractive incentives for new industry to move to the region.

Prospects for the AP300 in the U.S., as well as for the U.K., are uncertain due to the development timeline for it extending to 2030. Earlier this year, the project’s Chief Technology Officer, Rita Baranwal, jumped ship to sign on with Radient Nuclear, a developer of a micro reactor. The firm has a deal to deliver one of its units to the US Air Force and was recently named as one of ten micro reactor developers to participate in the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program.

Elsewhere, Westinghose has a non-binding MOU for the selection and deployment of Westinghouse technology for nuclear new build projects in New Brunswick for both grid power and dedicated industrial purposes. In 2023 Westinghouse began discussions with Ukraine to consider its AP300. In August 2024 Westinghouse was approved to submit its AP300 to the Generic Design Assessment process at the UK Office of Nuclear Regulation.

Italy’s Newcleo Shift Gears to Focus on the U.S.Market

It took just nanoseconds for Italian SMR developer NewCleo to read the U.K. tea leaves as the government in London announced it selected Rolls-Royce to build three of its 480 MW SMRs at Wylfa.

Newcleo said in a press statement is has now made a strategic shift with new plans to build 20 SMRs in the UK – a project valued at around $20 billion – in favor of pursuing opportunities in the US. The start-up also recently shifted its headquarters from Britain to France.

At the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris, Newcleo CEO Stefano Buono told the Reuters wire service: “There are a lot of tools that are encouraging investment into the US now.”

A company spokesperson later told Reuters several steps remain before an investment commitment is made. In addition to reactor deployment, NewCleo is positioned as an investor in a joint venture with Oklo to build a $1.68 billion nuclear fuel production plant in Tennessee.

Other European Nuclear Reactor Developers Eye U.S. Nuclear Markets

Newcleo isn’t the only European nuclear energy firm taking aim at the U.S. market. Thorizon, a Franco-Dutch SMR manufacturer, is among other companies that are considering setting up operations in the US due to quicker pathways to market. While the firm has continued to pursue markets in European Union countries, it has not, so far, made any public announcements about prospects in the U.S.

Thorizon’s primary market is currently in Europe, but its focus on using nuclear waste and the development of a unique, cartridge-based molten salt reactor positions it for the future U.S. market, particularly the demand from large-scale industrial users and data centers.

A potential U.S. market strategy for Thorizon could involve:

Forming a strategic joint venture with a U.S. utility or industrial end-user.

Establishing a U.S. presence to begin pre-licensing engagement with the NRC.

Highlighting the circular fuel cycle advantage to U.S. policymakers and the public.

As of March 2025, the firm has raised $43 million in Series A funding. In August 2025 the European Union awarded the firm an additional €10 million ($11.6 million) from the Just Transition Fund (JTF).

The firm is developing a molten salt SMR. The Thorizon One will provide 250MW of industrial heat. It can also be transformed into 100MW electricity, enough to power 250.000 households. It has forged partnerships with Orano for fuel development, Tractebel for engineering, and VDL Groep for prototyping, while collaborating with EPZ for early operator input, and with EDF on R&D.

The firm faces stiff competition in the US from at least a dozen other developers of micro reactors. Additionally, any serious effort to enter the US market would require preparing a regulatory engagement plan with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Any other micro or small modular reactors developer from Europe seeking to enter the US markert would face similar challenges.

Enrichment Firms Expand US Capacity

Reuters reports that French company Orano and multinational Urenco are reportedly planning to set up new enrichment facilities in the US to cater to rising industry demand.

Orano is planning its first overseas enrichment plant near Oak Ridge, TN, for an expected $5 billion investment. Most of the planneed site is undeveloped. (Image right courtesty of Orano)

Depending on federal funding and customers’ support, the facility will produce LEU/LEU+ to fuel existing commercial nuclear energy reactors and, potentially, HALEU to help develop and power advanced reactors.

Orano aims to have its facility operational by 2031 and predicts that the US may soon become its largest market, overtaking its production of nuclear fuel in France.

Urenco currently operates a site in Eunice, NM, with capacity expansions under way. In October Urenco received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to enrich uranium up to up to 10% U235.

Urenco CEO Boris Schucht said: “A lot of customers, especially US customers, are once again supporting us with very long-term contracts for our own capacity program.”

The company’s plant in New Mexico is making about 4.3 million tons of uranium a year, with 700,000 tons of capacity being added incrementally to 2027. The company can add up to 2 million tons in additional capacity if needed, said Schucht.

Oklo Gets DOE Approval of Fuel Fabrication Safety Milestone

Oklo Announces U.S. Department of Energy Approval for Nuclear Safety Design Agreement of Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office has approved the Nuclear Safety Design Agreement (NSDA) for the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), selected to participate in the DOE’s Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Project. The NSDA, the first under the DOE’s Fuel Line Pilot Project, was approved in just under two weeks.

Located at INL’s Materials Fuel Complex, the A3F, on the Arco desert about 25 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID, will fabricate fuel for Oklo’s first commercial-scale powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. Together, these facilities couple fuel production to power delivery for commercial deployment of advanced nuclear energy. Oklo plans to have the Aurora Powerhouse in operation by 2027.

Oklo and Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the Department of Energy’s management and operations contractor for INL, entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) in 2023 for Oklo to use a supply of DOE high- assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for fuel fabrication. This HALEU fuel feedstock is uranium metal recovered from Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) in the Fuel Conditioning Facility under a DOE-funded program.

Oklo was granted access to fuel material through a competitive DOE process launched in 2019. In 2019, the company received both a site-use permit at INL and access to fuel recovered from thec Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II).

The DOE review of the safety basis for nuclear facilities determines whether the safety basis has been developed in a manner that provides reasonable assurance of adequate protection of workers, the public, and the environment from adverse consequences, taking into account the work to be performed and the associated hazards.

“This approval marks clear progress toward demonstrating how we can repurpose used nuclear fuel to power the next generation of clean energy reactors,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo Inc.

“Advanced fuel fabrication and recycling technologies represent a significant unlock for our business, addressing fuel-supply challenges while transforming fuel economics and creating new revenue opportunities.”

“Approval of the NSDA for Oklo’s Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility is an important step forward,” said Robert Boston, Manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office. “We’re excited for companies selected for the Fuel Line Pilot Program to demonstrate how the United States can safely and efficiently scale the next generation of nuclear fuel manufacturing.”

Oklo Expands Collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory

on Advanced Fuels and Materials

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the management and operating contractor for Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to expand collaboration on scientific and technological research and development in areas such as advanced fuel and materials work that are mutually beneficial and support Oklo’s commercial deployment.

The collaboration plans to use Oklo’s first commercial power plant, Aurora-INL. While the Aurora powerhouse is designed for power production, it is also capable of generating fast neutrons and thereby generating valuable data through in-reactor irradiation experiments that can then be analyzed at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC).

This capability enables fast reactor irradiation testing in the US that hasn’t existed in decades. The data collected will support future fuel manufacturing improvements, cost reductions, and Oklo’s recycling efforts. By generating new fast reactor data under commercial operating conditions, Oklo aims to accelerate how it refines and qualifies its fuel and materials by leveraging its vertically integrated approach of product deployment.

Under the MOU, Oklo and INL will collaborate on irradiation of advanced nuclear fuels and materials during Aurora-INL’s operating life which could be examined at INL to better understand how fuel and materials perform in a fast- spectrum reactor environment. The resulting data would help advance U.S. fast reactor capabilities and nuclear fuel manufacturing.

The collaboration was prompted by ongoing work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Fuels Campaign (AFC) as well as a recent project supported under the DOE’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) which helped Oklo and INL test design and logistical strategies that can be incorporated into Oklo’s Aurora Powerhouse for irradiation and subsequent analysis.

LucidCatalyst Study Shows Significant Potential market for SMRs

LucidCatalyst presents a new study, “A new nuclear world: how small modular reactors can power industry.” The study has been published by Urenco, who commissioned LucidCatalyst to produce it to further industry understanding of this evolving market.

The report is supported by World Nuclear Association. It analyzes the energy demands of 11 industries representing 80% of industrial energy use, going beyond data centers to examine where SMRs can make a tangible impact on industrial energy delivery, and quantifies how changes in delivery models and market drivers can expand SMR market access. (Full text of report: PDF file)

The study sets out how the full potential of the SMR market in the industrial energy space can be unlocked, representing a $0.5–1.5 trillion investment opportunity, as energy-intensive sectors face mounting pressure to secure reliable, cost-competitive energy whilst meeting decarbonization commitments.

The key findings of the study include that:

SMRs could reach 700GW of capacity by 2050 (under the Transformation Scenario involving factory style mass manufacturing approaches to constructing SMRs). This sizable opportunity, representing nearly double the current global nuclear capacity, and would expand nuclear capacity beyond the projected goal to triple conventional deployment.

Simultaneous improvements across six areas of delivery would enable this outcome: a ‘product-based’ approach to manufacturing and licensing, freeing up sites for SMRs; stronger policy and financing support, and a more mature reactor developer environment.

The top five industries representing more than 75% of the 700GW opportunity are: synthetic fuels for aviation and maritime, coal repowering, data centers, and chemicals.

Other sectors such as food and beverage (43 GW), iron and steel (33 GW) and district energy (33 GW) also represent sizable opportunities, with district energy demand being more prevalent in Europe. Upstream oil and gas is a more prevalent opportunity in North America.

With improvements to current construction methods alone, 120GW of capacity could still be achieved by 2050 (under the Programmatic scenario, involving enhanced Government support and improved project management).

The study warns that stronger policy and financing support is needed to achieve economic viability.

“Policymakers can identify national SMR market opportunities, signal strategic priorities, and design targeted policies to address critical development bottlenecks,” the study says.

Figure 4 – In the 40 GW pipeline identified in this study, not all projects have the same level of confidence. Around 50% of this pipeline (20 GW) corresponds to projects that are actively progressing and show strong development signals (Figure 4).

These trends are consistent with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) “Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)” projections, 1/ which suggest around 19 GW of SMRs in advanced economies by 2050. These results are encouraging and confirm that the SMR potential to meet industrial energy needs is both substantiated and actively developing. (Image: Lucid Catalyst)

1/: IAEA – The Path to a New Era for Nuclear Energy

High-profile US projects include TerraPower’s construction of a Natrium SMR at a former coal site in Kemmerrer, WY, and plans to deploy four X-Energy 80 MW HTGRs SMRs to provide power for chemical giant Dow’s Seadrift plant in Texas. Amazon has unveiled plans for an SMR facility in the state of Washington, partly to power its data centers. It plans to finance the first four of 12 X-Energy SMRs at the site.

Notably, around 80% of SMR projects are being driven by non-traditional customers, primarily large industrial energy users, indicating a significant shift in the nuclear energy customer base from large publicly traded electric generation utilities.

Responses to the Study

Boris Schucht, Chief Executive of Urenco Group, said: “Decarbonizing industry presents a tremendous challenge that we must all embrace if we are to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner.”

“We believe the new-nuclear SMR market holds one of the solutions to this problem: flexible, adaptable technologies that can produce clean energy consistently and affordably.”

“This study acknowledges that with a strong focus on enabling delivery, SMRs can be maximized to their fullest and most competitive potential, significantly enhancing the ability of the nuclear industry to make an important contribution to energy security and net zero goals.”

Kirsty Gogan, Managing Partner of Lucid Catalyst, said:

“We’re witnessing a transformation in how nuclear energy services can be delivered to industrial customers. The innovations in manufacturing, licensing, and siting that this study identifies as being critical for enabling scale are already emerging in the market. With the right policy support and industry coordination across six critical areas, small modular reactors can provide a net-zero solution for energy-intensive industries requiring highly reliable, competitive, and scalable, emissions-free heat and power.”

King Lee, Head of Policy & Industry Engagement at World Nuclear Association, said:

“This study highlights the scale of opportunity for nuclear energy to support decarbonization of a wide range of industrial sectors. To realise the full potential of nuclear energy would require new regulatory frameworks and production and deployment models to unlock the economy and scale of implementation far beyond current projections.”

Affordable Financing For Nuclear Projects is the Missing Link for Success

(NucNet) Stronger international collaboration is needed in a bid to overcome financing and regulatory barriers facing nuclear energy projects in emerging economies, an event organized by the Paris-based OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) to coincide with the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil.

Speaking at a webinar, ‘Unlocking Climate Finance for Nuclear Energy in Emerging Economies’, senior executives from Africa, Asia and global institutions said access to affordable financing is “the missing link” for nuclear projects.

They said the future of nuclear power depends on collective learning, public trust, and equitable access to climate finance.

NEA director-general William Magwood warned that “financing new nuclear facilities remains one of the toughest challenges” for many developing nations, and that multilateral cooperation – including with the World Bank Group – will be essential to bridge both the financial and technical gaps.

“If we are serious about decarbonization, we must be equally serious about giving every country the tools and financial mechanisms to build reliable, clean nuclear energy.”

Nuclear ‘Vital’ To Kenya’s Long-Term Goals

Justus Wabuyabo, chief executive officer of Kenya’s Nuclear Power & Energy Agency (NuPEA) told the webinar that Kenya views nuclear energy as vital to its long-term economic and environmental goals.

He said Kenya completed phase one of its nuclear power program in 2023, focusing on stakeholder engagement and policy readiness, and is now preparing for phase two, due to be completed by 2027. The country plans to begin construction of its first nuclear power plant by 2034.

“The Kenyan government recognizes that nuclear energy will play a crucial role in powering industrialization and creating jobs,” Wabuyabo said.

“It’s not just about energy; it’s about aligning with our climate strategy and supporting national development.”

However, Wabuyabo acknowledged the public has lingering doubts about nuclear technology.

“We must continue building trust,” he said, noting that partnerships with organizations such as the NEA could help Kenya develop robust safety frameworks and transparent communications with communities.

Loyiso Tyabashe, group chief executive of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (NECSA), said South Africa is extending the life of its existing nuclear reactors by up to two decades while also exploring new build options.

Tyabashe said financial planning must precede vendor negotiations, cautioning against premature commitments before securing sustainable capital.

“Quality is linked to the cost of capital,” he said. “Before we even think about technology vendors, we must address financing models. That’s where institutions like the World Bank can be real trend-setters.”

He said Necsa, a public body that carries out nuclear research and development, supports broader African collaboration on nuclear technology, research and skills development and said shared learning can help reduce project costs and ensure regulatory alignment across borders.

Giovanni Carlo Bacardo, undersecretary at the Department of Energy of the Philippines, said his country’s progress depends on access to climate finance and the inclusion of nuclear energy in green taxonomies – the classifications used by investors and international institutions to define sustainable projects.

“For countries like the Philippines, the recognition of nuclear energy as green energy is key to unlocking financing,” Bacardo said. “We are committed to safety and sustainability, but access to affordable capital remains the missing link.”

World Bank ‘Can Be A Trend-Setter’

Lauren Claire Culver, senior energy specialist at the World Bank, which recently signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to cooperate on the development and financing of nuclear power for developing countries, acknowledged that while the organization recognizes nuclear power’s potential role in the global clean energy transition, it still faces an internal knowledge and experience gap.

“We understand the importance of nuclear in addressing climate change,” Culver said, “but the World Bank has limited practical experience in the sector”.

Culver proposed the creation of an advisory board to strengthen dialogue between the World Bank, nuclear regulators and national agencies in emerging economies. She also suggested introducing grant-based resources to help developing countries borrow for technical assistance, capacity building, and regulatory compliance.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oldbury-site.png,N,,2025-11-16 13:59:43.735070

According to Charged Electric Vehicles Magazine, the process could pump out high-capacity electrodes at a record pace without the use of solvents or ""forever chemicals"" (PFAS).

Powered by Ateios' RaiCure platform, the system can coat electrodes at a speed of 80 meters (262 feet) per minute, nearly three times faster than the standard 30 meters (98 feet) per minute for fluorine-polymer-based electrodes.

Electrode coating is crucial to the battery manufacturing process, as it creates a defect-free surface and directly affects a battery's performance, efficiency, and lifespan. Despite its high speed, the system produces electrodes that work with graphite, lithium cobalt oxide, nickel manganese cobalt, and lithium-iron phosphate battery material.

The fact that the system works with various materials is significant because LFP batteries are made from more abundant materials, which makes them less expensive to manufacture and, presumably, cheaper and more widely available to a broader consumer base.

The manufacturing will take place at Kodak's facility in Rochester, New York. Although the companies state that it will take only two to three months to take a new battery design from lab concept to commercial-scale production, according to Eastman Kodak chief technical officer Terry Taber, the development stage will take a few years, per RochesterFirst.com.

As the world continues to electrify, with EV global sales continuing to rise, it's key that companies such as Ateios can produce quality components at a rate that keeps up with demand.

Innovations such as this could make EVs more affordable. Along with the savings on gas and general maintenance, it could go a long way in convincing consumers to make their next car an EV, reducing the number of gas-powered vehicles on the road and the planet-heating pollution they create.

Home solar is a great way to boost the savings from owning or leasing an EV. EnergySage is a TCD-vetted source that offers tools that allow homeowners to compare quotes from local installers.

The pivot is already showing up in the market. An index tracking Chinese energy stocks rallied 10% in October, and is on track to beat the CSI 300 Index for a second straight month. Seven of the top 10 gainers on the benchmark in the past month are tied to AI infrastructure.

“No power, no AI,” BofA Securities analysts including Matty Zhao wrote in a note dated Oct. 31. They argue that China is better positioned than the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia due to its vast generation capacity, lower power costs, and abundant renewable energy.

By 2030, about one-third of China’s total AI spending will go toward building the supporting facilities, with metals, power, and cooling systems taking the bulk of the outlay, the investment bank estimates.

Here are some of the likely beneficiaries of this boom:

Power Equipment

Power equipment makers are reaping the rewards as data centers drive up electricity demand. UBS Group AG recently doubled its forecast of power demand growth in China to 8% by 2028-2030, citing data centers, exports and electrification as key drivers.

“We prefer local power equipment manufacturers,” said Ken Liu, head of Greater China energy transition & renewables research at a briefing Wednesday, citing the government’s plan to boost energy infrastructure investment in its next five-year plan.

Shares of solar energy equipment maker CSI Solar Co. have jumped 31% this month, while those of electrical component producer TBEA Co. have rallied nearly 21% in the same period. In contrast, the CSI 300 has remained little changed. Even after the rally, the CSI 300 Energy Index trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 13 — well below the multiple of 34 for the index’s information technology sub-gauge.

AI Metals

Metals used to build data centers and other AI facilities — such as servers and energy systems — are another area that’s getting a second look. Prices have been rising, with more analysts now viewing them as affordable ways to invest in the AI boom.

BofA Securities said data centers are becoming a key driver for China’s copper demand, estimating that the metal’s use in these facilities will grow at an average annual rate of 20% through 2030. The brokerage also expects the rally in aluminum stocks to continue.

Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. is among the best performing stocks on the CSI 300 Index over the past month, with around 35% gain, while Shandong Nanshan Aluminum Co. and Yunnan Aluminium Co. have each gained about 30%.

Energy Storage System

Demand for emergency backup equipment is also expected to grow, as data centers seek to maintain uninterrupted power during outages, analysts say.

“This segment is expected to make a significant contribution to A-share listed companies in the future,” said Yishu Yan, a China utilities analyst at UBS Securities.

Citigroup Inc. analysts said the spillover could exceed expectations if the data center growth outlook lines up with rising energy storage demand. That would make renewable energy firms and electric vehicle battery makers likely beneficiaries.

CATL’s Shenzhen-listed shares closed at a new record high on Thursday, after Beijing Hyperstrong Technology said it had locked in an order for 200 gigawatt hours of energy storage batteries from the company. Other battery materials makers also rose, including Shenzhen Capchem Technology, Shenzhen Senior Technology Material, and Eve Energy.

Optical Fibre

Makers of optical transceivers — used to link thousands of advanced chips known as graphics processing units in AI clusters — have also witnessed a sharp rally.

Shares of Zhongji Innolight Co., Eoptolink Technology Inc. and Suzhou TFC Optical Communication Co. have all recorded triple-digit gains this year, making them some of the top performers on China’s onshore equity benchmark.

Those numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.

Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.

There’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.

We also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.

You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.

Kirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.

So to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.

But of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.

Rebecca: I mean, it’s a lot. And a lot of that’s coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.

And another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there’s a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it’s just good business, it’s not because of any environmentally friendly policies.

Kirsten: Redwood Materials’ new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they’re taking the old EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled, and then they’re creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.

The question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.

Anthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they’re not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.

And then, of course, there’s also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are] actually going to get built because there’s definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.

To start with OpenAI, that’s a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act.

I think that this is going to be an effort that’s not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that’s going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-11-16 13:00:39.575278

Data centers are increasing electricity demand in some locations, such as northern Virginia, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago and Atlanta.","By Valerie Thomas / For The Conversation

Countries around the world have been discussing the need to rein in climate change for three decades, yet global greenhouse gas emissions — and global temperatures with them — keep rising.

When it seems like we’re getting nowhere, it’s useful to step back and examine the progress that has been made.

Let’s take a look at the United States, historically the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. Over those three decades, the U.S. population soared by 28 percent and the economy, as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation, more than doubled.

Yet U.S. emissions from many of the activities that produce greenhouse gases — transportation, industry, agriculture, heating and cooling of buildings — have remained about the same over the past 30 years. Transportation is a bit up; industry a bit down. And electricity, once the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, has seen its emissions drop significantly.

Overall, the U.S. is still among the countries with the highest per capita emissions, so there is room for improvement, and its emissions haven’t fallen enough to put the country on track to meet its pledges under the 10-year-old Paris climate agreement. But U.S. emissions are down about 15 percent over the past 10 years.

Here’s how that happened:

U.S electricity emissions have fallen: U.S. electricity use has been rising lately with the shift toward more electrification of cars and heating and cooling and expansion of data centers, yet greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are down by almost 30 percent since 1995.

One of the main reasons for this big drop is that Americans are using less coal and more natural gas to make electricity.

Both coal and natural gas are fossil fuels. Both release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere when they are burned to make electricity, and that carbon dioxide traps heat, raising global temperatures. But power plants can make electricity more efficiently using natural gas compared with coal, so it produces fewer emissions per unit of power.

Why did the U.S. start using more natural gas?

Research and technological innovation in fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed companies to extract more oil and gas at lower cost, making it cheaper to produce electricity from natural gas rather than coal.

As a result, utilities have built more natural gas power plants; especially super-efficient combined-cycle gas power plants, which produce power from gas turbines and also capture waste heat from those turbines to generate more power. More coal plants have been shutting down or running less.

Because natural gas is a more efficient fuel than coal, it has been a win for climate in comparison, even though it’s a fossil fuel. The U.S. has reduced emissions from electricity as a result.

Significant improvements in energy efficiency, from appliances to lighting, have also played a role. Even though tech gadgets seem to be recharging everywhere all the time today, household electricity use, per person, plateaued over the first two decades of the 2000s after rising continuously since the 1940s.

Costs for renewable electricity, batteries fall: U.S. renewable electricity generation, including wind, solar and hydro power, has nearly tripled since 1995, helping to further reduce emissions from electricity generation.

Costs for solar and wind power have fallen so much that they are now cheaper than coal and competitive with natural gas. Fourteen states, including most of the Great Plains, now get at least 30 percent of their power from solar, wind and battery storage.

While wind power has been cost competitive with fossil fuels for at least 20 years, solar photovoltaic power has only been competitive with fossil fuels for about 10 years. So expect deployment of solar PV to continue to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally, even as U.S. federal subsidies disappear.

Both wind and solar provide intermittent power: The sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. There are a number of ways utilities are dealing with this. One way is to use demand management, offering lower prices for power during off-peak periods or discounts for companies that can cut their power use during high demand. Virtual power plants aggregate several kinds of distributed energy resources — solar panels on homes, batteries and even smart thermostats — to manage power supply and demand. The U.S. had an estimated 37.5 gigawatts of virtual power plants in 2024, equivalent to about 37.5 nuclear power reactors.

Another energy management method is battery storage, which is just now beginning to take off. Battery costs have come down enough in the past few years to make utility-scale battery storage cost-effective.

What about driving? In the U.S., gasoline consumption has remained roughly constant but fuel efficiency has generally improved over the decades.

Sales of electric vehicle, which could cut emissions more, have been slow, however. Some of this could be due to the success of fracking: U.S. petroleum production has increased, and gasoline and diesel prices have remained relatively low.

People in other countries are switching to electric vehicles more rapidly than in the U.S. as the cost of EVs has fallen. Chinese consumers can buy an entry-level EV for under $10,000 in China with the help of government subsidies, and the country leads the world in EV sales.

In 2024, people in the U.S. bought 1.6 million EVs, and global sales reached 17 million, up 25 percent from the year before.

The unknowns ahead: What about data centers? The construction of new data centers, in part to serve the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, is drawing a lot of attention to future energy demand and to the uncertainty ahead.

Data centers are increasing electricity demand in some locations, such as northern Virginia, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago and Atlanta. The future electricity demand growth from data centers is still unclear, though, meaning the effects of data centers on electric rates and power system emissions are also uncertain.

However, AI is not the only reason to watch for increased electricity demand: The U.S. can expect growing electricity demand for industrial processes and electric vehicles, as well as the overall transition from using oil and gas for heating and appliances to using electricity that continues across the country.",https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/40798791_web1_TSR-251115-edh-opi-climate-green-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:00:54.299800

Now, reports have emerged that state that the US regulators have approved the planned transmission cable route for the SouthCoast Wind project in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. While the approval is a step in the right direction, a recent court ruling has placed the project in peril and in the crosshairs of the new administration as it aims to roll back permits and policies for the wind power sector in the United States.

The Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board has given its approval for the transmission cable route

The SouthCoast Wind project now has the required approval from the regional regulator for the planned route of the necessary transmission cables for the project. The venture plans to run cables from up the Sakonnet River and across Portsmouth to Mount Hope Bay, connecting the region’s wind power generation at an accelerated pace.

While the approval is a step in the right direction for SouthCoast wind, there have been some new developments that are a cause for concern. Putting aside the current administration’s evident disdain for the wind power sector, a recent ruling by a federal court in DC has raised concerns over the project even being built in the future.

Power purchase agreements for the SouthCoast Wind project are nowhere to be found

Essential to any energy project are the long-term power purchasing agreements that exist between supplier and customer. With the November 1st deadline for PPAs having come and gone, there are no purchasing agreements between the project developer and Massachusetts and Rhode Island utility suppliers. This comes amid growing uncertainty over the wind power sector’s future in Trump’s America.

The Trump administration is rolling back the progress made by the previous President

Biden enacted several measures and policies aimed at shifting the American energy sector towards the renewable energy market. However, a recent request by the Trump administration to roll back permits and review the policies aimed at the wind power sector has been granted by a federal court judge in Washington, DC.

The court’s decision is a major setback for the already struggling project. Despite the approval given for the planned route of transmission cables, the court’s ruling allows the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to establish a new review of potential environmental and economic consequences for the project. Approval for wind projects has been under the spotlight in recent months, not just in the US, but in Australia as well.

“We are currently assessing the implications of the decision and will consider all appropriate next steps, including the pursuit of legal remedies, to ensure the project’s integrity and its long-term contribution to regional and national energy goals.” – Michael Brown, CEO and president for SouthCoast Wind

A clarifying note from COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago is expected today which is anticipated to provide more information on how they intend to resolve outstanding issues in week two. As ministers arrive for the final week of negotiations, answers on how to address the huge shortfall in countries’ emissions reductions commitments, a phaseout of fossil fuels as part of a just transition to a clean energy economy, adaptation, and climate finance are important barometers of progress toward a successful outcome at COP30.

There were some promising bright spots through the week, including growing support for a transition away from fossil fuels, progress on bolstering information integrity to counter climate disinformation and improving synergies between the Rio Conventions to enhance cooperation across international organizations.

Experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) are on the ground in Belém tracking the negotiations and other central issues of importance at COP30.

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.

“The first week of COP30 was marked by generally constructive negotiations, but pressure is building as major breakthroughs on critical topics have yet to materialize. Nations repeatedly lamented the vast gulf in ambition between current emission reduction commitments and what’s needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but a process for how to address that shortfall in an equitable way is still to be decided. Brazil has proposed a roadmap for a transition away from fossil fuels, which is gathering a growing groundswell of support from many countries who recognize the tremendous benefits of renewable energy. Getting the details right will be important to ensure a fair, funded transition and to fend off attacks from fossil fuel interests.

“Securing a strong outcome on climate adaptation is a top issue for climate vulnerable low-income nations and the call has only grown increasingly urgent as climate impacts rapidly worsen around the world. Crucially, a lack of adequate climate finance from richer nations most responsible for the climate crisis remains a festering source of frustration and distrust for lower-income countries.

“It’s up to political leaders to step up to bridge divides between countries in the second week of COP30 and secure a strong outcome that delivers for communities around the world. The stakes are abundantly clear as the world teeters on the brink of breaching 1.5 C of warming and climate change-charged extreme disasters like typhoons and hurricanes take a steep toll on people’s lives and nations’ economies.”

Dr. Cleetus also has a new blog post: As Week One Winds Down at COP30 in Brazil, What’s at Stake and What’s Ahead

Below is a statement by Kate Cell, senior climate campaign manager at UCS and Climate Action Against Disinformation steering committee member and policy working group co-chair.

“This is the first COP where accurate, consistent and reliable information about climate change is on the action agenda. The COP that launched a Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, signaling unprecedented international collaboration to address pernicious disinformation. The ‘COP of Truth.’ After decades of deceit, denial and delay, the fossil fuel industry and their allies are on notice. And while 12 governments have committed to working together for common-sense, human-rights based solutions, many more must take the opportunity to work together for information integrity.

“This initiative requires holding legacy media, social media and search engines to basic, human-rights based standards of transparency, accountability and safety. Governments, the private sector and funders all have important roles to play. In particular, Big Tech is currently amplifying and monetizing disinformation on a range of topics including climate change, and must instead commit to truth over short-term profits.”

UCS will be monitoring nations as they decide whether to support the Declaration in week two.

Below is a statement by Dr. Astrid Caldas, senior climate scientist for community resilience at UCS.

“The interconnectedness of biodiversity and climate change has been brought to the forefront here in Belém. Taking place in the heart of a biodiversity-rich area, the role of forests and Indigenous and local communities in slowing climate change has been a focal point both in negotiations and civil society fora. Indigenous peoples in particular play an integral role in conservation and stewardship of the land and have been a constant presence at this COP, asserting their rights to land and a seat at the negotiations table. This role can be further prioritized through better synergy between the Rio Conventions, a recommendation supported by many countries and non-governmental organizations. Continued discussions aiming to enhance cooperation among the Rio Conventions and other international groups and frameworks are a welcome signal to better addressing climate change, biodiversity and desertification together. Just as these problems are intertwined, so too must be the unified global response to effectively solve them.”

There have been enormous strides in renewable energy use around the world, from Pakistan to Ghana, California to Texas, made possible by everyday people who recognize that using the ball of fire in the sky to power the grid is much more affordable and efficient than fossil fuels and also happens to require no burning, or wars, as environmentalist Bill McKibben has pointed out.

In Illinois, recent legislation will phase out the use of harmful “forever chemicals” in manufacturing, and the number of native gardens surges as more homeowners join the effort to support birds, insects and healthy soil.

Here in Lake County, voters overwhelmingly approved last fall a $155 million bond referendum for the Lake County Forest Preserve District. The district recently issued the first $25 million; the funds will allow us to acquire and restore more land, as well as fund capital projects to increase accessibility for residents throughout the county.

It might seem obvious why we would want to acquire additional open space — more trails to walk, rivers to kayak, beautiful vistas to enjoy. And all of that is true. But healthy open space is also valuable. Some examples:

• Flood control: During the record 2017 floods, LCFPD wetlands held millions of gallons of rainwater. Had those wetlands been paved over, surrounding homes and businesses would have been damaged or destroyed. As more wetlands lose federal protection, it’s imperative for local entities to step up.

• Food production: Pollinators rely on quality habitat and farmers rely on pollinators — honeybee-pollinated commodities alone account for $15 billion in annual U.S. agricultural production, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.

• Workforce attraction: Homebuyers consistently cite open space as a priority. It’s no wonder that Lake County, with its strong tradition of valuing nature, was recently named one of the top 10 counties in the United States for economic development.

• Health care savings: Studies show the closer one lives to green space, the less they spend on health care — by the hundreds of dollars per year — even taking into account variables like age and income.

Depending on who and what is impacted, the value of a restored acre — meaning, land returned to its natural state — is estimated in the thousands to the tens of thousands of dollars per acre, per year.

Every year.

Today, LCFPD manages about 11,000 acres of restored land. That is a value in the tens of millions of dollars in the form of clean air, water, and soil, flood reduction, pollinator support, carbon storage and more. If LCFPD had the operational funds to restore all 31,500 of its acres ...? Well, you do the math.

One thing is clear: nature is a sound investment.

One of our goals with the referendum dollars is to acquire an additional 2,000 acres, a value potential in the millions of dollars every year, year after year — as long as we taxpayers continue to support the maintenance of restored acres. Because as every gardener knows, it takes constant upkeep.

Americans agree on so much. We value clean air in our lungs and clean water flowing through lakes and rivers. We value the shade of an oak and healthy local food powered by pollinators. We value, and depend on, the quality-of-life nature provides.

November 16, 2025

WASHINGTON — We are happy to report the federal opened back up on Wednesday. In addition to articles already covered by Native News Online, here is a roundup of other news released from Washington, D.C. that impacts Indian Country recently.

Rep. Sharice Davids (D-KS), a tribal citizen of the Ho-Chunk Nation, on Wednesday released a statement following the U.S. House’s passage of the latest government funding bill.

""I’ve said for weeks that we’ve got to come together and find a bipartisan compromise to open the government again, but this can’t be at the expense of threatening health care for the more than 160,000 Kansans who rely on ACA credits to afford care and the thousands more who will see skyrocketing health care premiums. While I’m grateful that federal workers will be back on the job and getting paid, I could not support this government funding bill without any commitment from Speaker Johnson to hold a vote to extend health care credits so that costs don’t surge for Kansas families. Kansans are sick of the political gamesmanship in Washington while people in Kansas pay the price. I am committed to keep fighting in every way I can to bring down the cost of care for Kansans.""

Interior Rescinds 2024 Rule on Alaska Petroleum Reserve to Expand Energy Development

The Department of the Interior on Thursday announced a final rule rescinding the 2024 Bureau of Land Management regulation governing the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska, a move officials say will help unlock the energy potential of the roughly 23-million-acre reserve.

""By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,"" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.""

Established in 1923, the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska has long been designated to support U.S. energy security. By reversing the 2024 rule, Interior officials say they are advancing efforts to bolster American energy dominance and reduce reliance on foreign oil.

The final rule implements direction from President Donald J. Trump under Executive Order 14153, issued on his first day in office, and responds to calls from Alaskans — including North Slope leaders — to reinstate the prior regulatory framework. Department officials say the change will allow them to focus on expanding responsible development to support Alaska’s economy, national security, and domestic energy production.

The Bureau of Land Management will now proceed with managing the reserve under new 2025 regulations aligned with those originally established in 1977. Agency officials say reversing the 2024 rule will ease regulatory burdens and position the reserve to deliver broader economic benefits for the nation and North Slope communities.

In a globalized world, South-South Cooperation tackles the urgent development challenges the Global South faces through cross-country collaboration spanning the economic, social, political, and environmental spheres. Since its establishment, South-South cooperation has flourished over the decades, with trade among the developing countries amounting to $5.3 trillion in 2021.

In fact, trade flows between developing countries have surpassed trade flows between developing and developed economies. While trade between developed countries has decreased by almost 15% since 1995, trade among countries in the Global South has increased by 14.1%. Between 2000 and 2021, the loan portfolios of South-led development banks also rose significantly. It went from $7.2 billion to $73.4 billion, a tenfold increase.

Promoting Clean Energy and Job Creation

India’s demonstration of converting unused cotton plant parts into clean energy and creating employment opportunities for participants from African countries is a notable example of South-South cooperation.

As India strode towards clean energy, entrepreneurs began utilising the unwanted parts of crops for renewable energy. Instead of setting the waste on fire, a practice that has led to pollution, India has set up more than 500 briquetting plants. Briquetting is a process of converting unused plant parts into clean fuel by forming pellets or briquettes as a substitute for coal and wood.

UNCTAD report highlighted the untapped potential of briquetting in Zambia, where farmers could earn an additional $3 million each year by processing cotton waste into briquettes. Not just Zambia, but cotton farmers globally could greatly benefit from the production of this renewable energy.

Therefore, in 2019, UNCTAD offered officials from Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe the opportunity to visit India and develop a better understanding of the technology. UNCTAD chose India because its cotton production resembles that of these countries, making the technology and equipment adaptable.

South-South Cooperation and the Pandemic

Over the past few years, the converging effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising global food and energy insecurity, and the climate crisis have had a profound impact on the world. For countries in the Global South that were already vulnerable, the high inflation and slowed economic growth in the post-pandemic period, along with droughts, fires, and floods that the climate emergency has brought about, have made things considerably more difficult. In Southeast Asia, the pandemic pushed 4.7 million people into extreme poverty. It undermined the region’s economic and development progress, leading to millions losing their job during the pandemic’s peak.

While there has been a strong recovery, with a 4.6% increase in GDP growth in 2024, millions still face job insecurity and unemployment. As developing countries grapple with these changes, South-South cooperation fosters more sustainable economic growth by driving collective self-resilience.

Promoting Decent Work

The ILO ProSSCE-ASEAN is a project actively working to counteract the post-COVID economic backsliding in the Global South and to achieve decent work for all, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 8.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the Promoting the Global Development Initiative with a focus on South-South cooperation in Employment in ASEAN project in partnership with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China. In Cambodia, the project has partnered with the government and local organisations to connect close to 150,000 young people and marginalised groups to high-quality jobs since 2023.

In Indonesia, the project launched a four-tiered training program to improve job matching by training more than 3,000 public employment counsellors across the country and implementing labour market programmes that are inclusive and gender-responsive. Following the success of the programme in Indonesia, the ILO is set to expand the four-tiered training to other countries in Southeast Asia.

Strengthening South-South Health Cooperation

The pandemic disproportionately affected women and children, particularly in the developing world. It led to a reversal of progress in maternal health, which is a key indicator of health.

In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) partnered with the Health Development Partnership for Africa and the Caribbean (HeDPAC) to foster South-South health cooperation between the regions. The initiative brought together countries from Africa and the Caribbean to exchange innovative primary health care solutions, with a focus on maternal and child health.

As the world continues to navigate crises, South-South Cooperation provides a strong framework that encourages solidarity, knowledge sharing, and mutual support among developing countries. Its initiatives aim to foster development based on fairness and resilience, creating an inclusive and sustainable world.

Global EV sales are not just holding steady—they’re accelerating. According to the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025, published in May, electric car sales are projected to exceed 20 million units this year, representing more than one in four cars sold worldwide. This comes despite economic headwinds and policy shifts in key markets.

The narrative of a slowdown has been fueled by selective reporting, but industry analysts argue it’s misleading. A recent article from Electrek highlights how, after two years of dire predictions, EV sales continue to rise, defying claims of cooling demand. ‘EV sales keep defying false media narratives that they are dropping, and continue to rise,’ the piece states, pointing to record-breaking figures in multiple regions.

The Myth of Stagnation

Delving deeper, U.S. sales data from CarEdge, updated as of November 14, 2025, shows electric vehicles capturing 7.9% market share in February, with Tesla leading at 45.2%. This is part of a broader trend where Q3 2025 saw 438,000 units sold—a 30% increase—driven by buyers rushing to claim federal tax credits before potential phase-outs, as reported by MotorWatt.

Globally, BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook, released in June, forecasts EVs comprising one in four cars sold in 2025. China remains the powerhouse, but emerging markets are gaining traction. S&P Global Mobility predicts a 30% rise in battery electric passenger vehicle sales to 15.1 million units, underscoring robust growth.

Regional Dynamics Driving Growth

In Europe and the U.S., the electric commercial vehicle maintenance, repair, and overhaul market is booming, projected to reach $8,440.2 million by 2035 at a 24% CAGR, per Industry Today. India’s EV sales surged to 234,191 registrations in October, up from September, according to EVreporter.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect this optimism. Users like Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, noted in May that ‘in 2024, 1 in 5 cars sold worldwide was electric. In 2025, it’s set to be more than 1 in 4.’ Another post from BloombergNEF emphasizes China’s lead and emerging markets’ takeoff.

Policy Shifts and Market Resilience

Despite U.S. policy uncertainties, including potential tax credit changes, sales momentum persists. Virta Global reports that the number of electric vehicles on roads in 2025 continues to climb, with forecasts pointing to sustained expansion. EV-Volumes provides real-time data showing top models and charging network growth, reinforcing market health.

The Electrek article calls out media sensationalism: ‘After two years of headlines begging for failure, EV sales keep defying false media narratives.’ This echoes sentiments in QY Research’s report, which projects the global EV market to hit $1,257.03 billion by 2031 at a 15.9% CAGR, driven by players like Tesla, BYD, and Volkswagen.

Innovation Fueling Adoption

Technological advancements are key. Future Market Insights forecasts U.S. all-electric multipurpose goods vehicle demand at $298.7 million by 2035, growing at 6.1%. Bloomberg Opinion, citing historical projections, notes EV market share could reach 58% by 2040, with Tesla’s dominance growing.

X posts highlight competitive landscapes: One user points out Tesla’s top-selling models globally, while another notes BYD’s expansion overtaking rivals. Marcelo Mena-Carrasco posted that ‘EVs aren’t “stalling” — they’re surging. Global EV sales are on track for ~22M in 2025.’

Challenges Amid the Surge

Not all is smooth—supply chain issues and battery costs remain hurdles. A 2022 X post from Andy Lee warned of lithium prices tripling, impacting costs, yet sales have soared regardless. Car Dealership Guy forecasted in January that 25% of new vehicles in 2025 would be electrified, with gas engines dropping to 75%.

Edmunds, via KESQ, reports Tesla’s 45.2% U.S. share, but competitors like GM’s Chevy Equinox EV are gaining. OpenPR’s analysis sees transformative growth through sustainability and innovation.

Investor Perspectives and Future Outlook

Investors are bullish. Sawyer Merritt’s X post cites S&P Global’s 30% growth prediction. KRoshan’s post details China’s 32% sales increase, capturing over one-third of the market.

Red/ Snow on X references surging 2025 sales data from multiple sources, countering skepticism. Donald E. Thompson notes global sales jumping from 40,000 annually a decade ago to 22 million in 2025.

Strategic Shifts by Automakers

Automakers are adapting. Ford’s pivot to hybrids amid F-150 Lightning challenges is noted in X discussions, while Rivian and Lucid face cash flow issues. Yet, overall, the sector thrives.

The IEA’s report emphasizes that despite uncertainties, EV adoption is breaking records. As Fatih Birol stated, ‘Global sales of electric cars continue to break records.’

Charging Infrastructure and Market Maturity

Infrastructure lags in some areas, but progress is evident. Y∪² on X predicts EVs dominating in five years with better tech and lower prices, possibly needing state aid for remote charging.

Carlos on X highlights Tesla’s lead, with BYD’s profits declining but still competitive. This competitive churn drives innovation, as per BloombergNEF.

Economic Impacts and Global Reach

The economic ripple is vast. OpenPR forecasts EV market growth through emissions reduction and tech innovation. Europe’s MRO market growth signals maturing ecosystems.

In summary of trends, EV sales defy naysayers, propelled by policy, tech, and consumer shifts.

The Hoosiers enter a much-needed bye week with control of their own destiny for the Big Ten championship and a national championship. Here’s the stock report for IU after week 12.

Stock Up

IU Fan Base

Indiana has sold out their last nine conference home games and have created a home field advantage that head coach Curt Cignetti was raving about after the win over Wisconsin.

“Our fans are the best in America. I know everybody says that that’s got it going and packs the house, but I love our fans. I know where we started and where we are now, and they are over the top. I can’t say enough good things about them. We feed off of their energy. I really think that us playing at home is at least a 14-point advantage.” Cignetti said.

On top of that, multiple people challenged the fans to stay and give a final salute to this team as it looks like Saturday was IU’s final home game of the 2025 season. They answered the bell as about 80-percent of the fans gave a loud ovation as the final gun sounded and the game was over (it did help that it was a beautiful day).

Bye Week Excitement

Usually there are grumbles that a bye week is coming during an undefeated season as fans want to see this team play, but IU needs the bye week. I believe fans understand that too. The Hoosiers are banged up after a six-game stretch that included trips to Oregon and Penn State.

It is a lot easier to enjoy a bye week when your team is 11-0 and the second ranked team in the country. There are several games IU fans will be keeping their eye on this week in the Big Ten (USC at Oregon, Rutgers at Ohio State, Michigan at Maryland) while the mighty SEC takes their annual pre-thanksgiving cupcake festival.

Second Half Performance

The first half of Saturday’s game left a lot to be desired. IU allowed Wisconsin to control the clock and play their style of football. IU led 10-7, but allowed 145 yards of offense. The second half was a different story. IU outscored the Badgers 21-0 and held the Badgers to just 23 yards of offense. The defense also scored 14 points off of two Badger turnovers. IU closed out the game on a 24-0 run, something IU fans have been used to seeing under Cignetti.

Stock Down

Offensive Line

The Indiana offensive line is missing Drew Evans and was severely limited because of Kahlil Benson being banged up. IU allowed five sacks and seven tackles for loss. Last week against Penn State, IU surrendered three sacks. While quarterback Fernando Mendoza did hold on to the ball too long on some plays, he is taking too many hits. Eight sacks in the last two games nearly came to a head when Mendoza was a little slow and wobbly getting up in the fourth quarter Saturday.

First Half Tackling

One of the reasons why Indiana started slowly was their issues with tackling again. The Hoosiers struggled on Wisconsin’s first drive, and really the first half, with angles and wrapping up. According to Pro Football Focus, IU missed six tackles yesterday.

“We just came out flat, honestly. We didn’t have a lot of energy. Some guys weren’t ready to go, and I will take the blame for that. I don’t think I was ready to go. I think I could’ve had more energy and been more of a sparkplug for the team. You know, (it’s) something we have got to work on. We can’t have that in a big game. So, we have to eliminate that now, get back to training towards the end of the season. We are looking forward to Purdue and writing that off.” Indiana linebacker Aiden Fisher said.

Injuries

The Hoosiers are more banged up than the official availability says they are. IU was without starters wide receiver Elijah Sarratt and Drew Evans to start the game and then saw starters EJ Williams, Kaelon Black, Kahlil Benson and Mikail Kamara leave the game early as well. IU already lost Lee Beebe, Bryson Bonds and Kellan Wyatt for the season. IU needs to get healthy.

Hold

Undefeated Regular Season

There is one more game to go for 12-0 and it is the Old Oaken Bucket Game. IU has a chance to recover both physically and mentally before heading to West Lafayette on Black Friday. Anything can happen if a rivalry game…Just ask Ohio State.",https://i0.wp.com/hoosierhuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/USATSI_27594273-e1763305811808.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:02:22.516989
