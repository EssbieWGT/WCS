In some ways, it looked like a normal convention. The makers of everything from carbon brushes to boat propellers milled around a large hall, looking at a flying boat, a customizable electric truck, an air taxi and a humanoid robot. But at times, it turned into an urgent and literal call to arms as discussions moved from manufacturing to national security.

“You will help us forge a future where we can build and sustain an industrial base that can deliver the critical weapons we need, fast and at scale,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told the participants in a video message. “Time is short.”

About 1,200 people attended the conference, about twice the number who attended the first gathering last year, said Falon Donohue, an Atomic board member who is also a founder of the conference. Thousands were on the waiting list, she said. More than 16,000 watched the speeches, round tables and fireside chats online.

Titans of industry have been pledging to reindustrialize the United States for decades, but the idea is particularly potent at this moment, when more Americans recognize the nation’s dependence on other countries for everything from electronics to batteries to medicines.

The goal of reviving American manufacturing has been a rare point of agreement between President Trump and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., although they differed strongly on the strategy to bring it about. Mr. Biden successfully pushed for laws that gave subsidies and tax credits to companies that were building factories to make semiconductors, batteries and electric vehicles in the United States, whereas Mr. Trump has threatened to impose large tariffs on foreign nations to boost domestic production.

The conference attracted a large cohort of like-minded tech enthusiasts who spoke of boosting American manufacturing as a solemn patriotic duty, even if they had British or Australian accents. It also managed to make factories glamorous to a jet-setting crowd that to many might seem more at home in Davos than in Detroit.

“It has become high status to invest in manufacturing,” Christian Garrett, a partner on the investment team at 137 Ventures, noted at a fried-chicken-filled after-party downtown. Mr. Garrett said the factories that deals coming out of the conference would build would also create high-tech, “high status” jobs for blue-collar workers.

Speaker after speaker emphasized that military power flows from industrial power, which they said had been eroded by the offshoring of factories and an overemphasis on software, apps and financial products.

Nearly every session waxed nostalgic for World War II, when Detroit’s car plants were quickly converted into munitions factories that helped achieve victory. But today, Americans have fallen behind China in the mass-production of things that would matter in a war, senior administration officials warned.

“In a world where Russia has raw materials, and China dominates manufacturing, an economy centered around McKinsey and DoorDash will not cut it,” Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, told the crowd from the main stage. “We turn to China, the rival that too often no one wants to name, even as they surpass us in industry after industry: shipbuilding, steel, electric vehicles, critical metals.”

Mr. Needham urged his audience of venture capitalists, angel investors and inventors to rekindle “that swashbuckling American spirit that does what must be done and will not take no for an answer” in the race to secure the resources to rebuild the country’s industrial base.

Other Trump administration officials who attended included Kelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration; Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative; John Phelan, the Navy secretary; and unnamed representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency, who held a private round table with industry people.

In his speech, Mr. Phelan spoke bluntly about the dire state of affairs and proposed combining commercial and military shipbuilding abilities to address the shortfall of shipbuilders.

Conference participants from Silicon Valley included Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm, who said the United States was “actually the underdog” when competing with China.

Palmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, a defense contractor, spoke to the crowd remotely through a stiff, humanoid robot dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and mullet wig.

The idea for a Reindustrialize conference sprang from a factory tour of Atomic in March 2024, said Ms. Donohue, the board member. In addition to the tour, Atomic held a discussion with policymakers and investors about how to revitalize manufacturing with tech and new government policies. Ms. Donohue is also a partner at Narya, an investment firm that Vice President JD Vance co-founded in 2019.

Another founder of the conference, Gregory Bernstein, who was a board observer at Atomic in 2024, said some embraced the idea of reindustrialization because of national security, while others saw it as a way to address economic inequality or the climate crisis.

Mr. Bernstein, the chief executive of the New Industrial Corporation, an investment company, said he found the idea of an economy based on building things more compelling than one based on intangible products.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/20/multimedia/20biz-reindustrialize-01-mhfz/20biz-reindustrialize-01-mhfz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 07:00:51.594349

The author argues Zeldin's actions contradict his role of protecting natural resources and endangered species.

The letter urges Zeldin to resign and advocates for clean, sustainable energy.

I was absolutely horrified to read of administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Lee Zeldin’s plan to pollute and destroy the very wilderness he was hired to protect (“I saw a golden future for American manufacturing during Komatsu tour,” July 13).

Because of his detrimental actions against the environment, he is not doing his job. His job is to protect our environment and natural resources — clean air and water — not poison them with toxic chemicals. His job is to strengthen and enforce protection for endangered species, not weaken or dismantle laws, thus threatening hundreds of species with extinction.

His job is to enforce strict laws and regulations that protect vital marine ecosystems, preserve our national parks and public lands and conserve the Arctic wildlife refuge, not develop, drill or mine these wilderness areas. He was hired to protect our environment, not destroy it!

Zeldin is correct on one issue, the US has a growing demand for more energy — but his job is to promote and support clean, sustainable energy, not toxic fossil fuels. He actually used the words “clean coal” when nothing could be further from the truth. Coal creates toxic poisons that are emitted into our air and water, causing irreparable harm to the environment and cardio-respiratory illness in us.

Zeldin needs to step down from his position before he decimates the very environment he was hired to protect. We will all suffer the consequences of this administration’s war on the natural world.

So while green jobs still make up a modest share of the total, their growth is anything but small.
The energy efficiency industry followed, with just over 145,000 full-time positions, while renewables contributed more than 71,000 full-time positions.
But green jobs aren’t just about the industry you work in; they’re also about the role you perform.
With the proper policy support, green industries are poised for even faster growth.","Businesses in sectors such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and recycling are steadily transforming the UK’s workforce. According to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), these industries employed 690,900 full-time equivalent workers in 2023. That’s a 34.6% increase compared to 2015 when the total stood at just over half a million.

To put that into perspective, the UK had 12.5 million full-time equivalent roles across all sectors last year. So while green jobs still make up a modest share of the total, their growth is anything but small.

The ONS classifies the green economy under three main pillars: waste, energy-efficient products, and renewable energy. In 2023, the waste sector led the way, supporting over 158,000 roles. The energy efficiency industry followed, with just over 145,000 full-time positions, while renewables contributed more than 71,000 full-time positions. Each of these categories has seen consistent job growth year after year.

Beyond the core sectors, the ONS also tracks employment in related low-carbon areas, such as transport, equipment repair, and environmental charities. Notably, almost half of the UK’s workforce, around 46%, was employed by companies in the ten industries with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions.

On the other end of the spectrum, only a fraction of UK workers are in the highest-emission industries. Electricity and gas companies make up less than half a per cent of the total workforce. Roles in mining, quarrying, agriculture, forestry, and fishing combined for just 0.9% of jobs in 2023.

Transport and manufacturing, however, stand out as both carbon-intensive and job-heavy. The ONS highlighted that regions like the East Midlands, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber have particularly high concentrations of staff in these high-emission sectors. The need for a fair and inclusive transition in these areas is evident.

But green jobs aren’t just about the industry you work in; they’re also about the role you perform. The ONS takes this into account, tracking green occupations across all sectors. For example, an energy manager at a logistics firm or a sustainability expert at a bank would still count as part of the green economy. This broader definition also includes professionals working in green finance, climate adaptation, and nature restoration.

These roles are clustered in London and the South East. That’s no coincidence. Analysis by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has shown that green economy jobs tend to be both productive and well-paid.

As of December 2024, the surveyed businesses employed approximately 951,000 people, a 10.2% increase from the previous year. The average salary was £43,100 pro rata, roughly £6,000 above the national average. In terms of productivity, each role generated £105,500 in economic value, which is 38% higher than the UK norm.

The CBI was clear in its message. With the proper policy support, green industries are poised for even faster growth. But if the UK misses this window of opportunity, it risks falling behind global competitors and eroding public trust in the transition to a low-carbon economy.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_cadc081fda2741a5936085755877fbae~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_734,h_488,al_c,lg_1,q_80/becc64_cadc081fda2741a5936085755877fbae~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-07-20 07:00:25.574373

Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, has urged energy firms to steer clear of the government’s latest round of green energy contracts, known as Allocation Round 7 (AR7). In a move that’s sparked sharp backlash, Tice’s message to investors was clear: walk away from net zero.

Mr Tice said he had put the companies on “formal notice” that their investments were “politically and commercially unsafe” as a future Reform government would seek to “strike down all contracts signed under AR7”.

Michael Shanks said Reform’s opposition to net zero amounted to a “war on jobs”, saying working people “would lose jobs and opportunities if Farage’s party was ever allowed to impose its anti-jobs, anti-growth ideology on the country”.

Mr Shanks called the letter an “energy surrender plan that would leave bills high for families and businesses, keeping the UK stuck on the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets”.

But that call to retreat hasn’t gone unanswered. Labour has launched a scathing counterattack, warning that Reform’s hardline stance could jeopardise nearly one million jobs tied to the UK’s growing green economy. According to estimates from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the net-zero sector currently supports around 951,000 jobs nationwide. That includes roughly 138,000 roles in the East Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber, both key battlegrounds where Reform has recently seen gains, including in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and Tice’s constituency of Boston and Skegness.

Mr Tice said: “Labour’s reckless net zero fantasies are destroying hundreds of thousands of industrial jobs, costing taxpayers £12 billion a year in renewable subsidies, and leaving us with some of the highest energy bills in the world.

“The OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) confirms that £30 billion of taxpayer money is being poured into net-zero projects. These policies are crippling our economy and driving people out of this country.”

Labour’s energy minister, Alan Shanks, didn’t mince words. “This reckless approach is a direct threat to British jobs, British industry, and Britain’s climate commitments,” he said, describing Reform’s strategy as a political stunt with severe economic consequences.

Adding to the urgency, a recent report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated the annual cost of addressing climate change at £30 billion, primarily due to the loss of revenue from taxes such as fuel duty. But the watchdog made it clear: the price of inaction would be even steeper. Climate damage, rising disaster recovery costs, and long-term economic disruption would pose a far greater fiscal burden in the future.

However, it also warned that failing to act would present a “more significant fiscal cost” due to the damage caused by climate change.

Reform UK, meanwhile, has doubled down on its anti-net-zero rhetoric. Earlier this year, Tice declared he would ""wage war"" on the policy altogether. His ally, Greater Lincolnshire mayor Dame Andrea Jenkyns, went even further, telling Times Radio she doesn’t believe climate change is real. That kind of climate denial, Labour believes, could become Reform’s Achilles’ heel.

Polling suggests that despite heated political rhetoric, net zero still commands broad public support. A survey commissioned by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit ahead of the May local elections found that 54% of Reform voters themselves supported “policies to stop climate change.”

With Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer increasingly positioning Reform as Labour’s actual opponent, particularly in key working-class regions, the net-zero debate is no longer just about energy. It’s about jobs, trust, and the kind of future Britain is willing to fight for.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_007de3718c1648d79fdc004c0cc3960d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_578,h_1000,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_007de3718c1648d79fdc004c0cc3960d~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-20 07:00:28.373515

Delivery of the project, which would be the largest power station in the world if completed, was accelerated after officials convened in Zimbabwe on July 3.

Newsweek contacted the organization responsible for the delivery, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), for more information on the progress via email.

Why It Matters

The Grand Inga Hydropower Project, with a potential capacity of up to 70 gigawatts, is designed as the centerpiece of Africa's Mission 300 initiative, which seeks to connect 300 million Africans to clean energy by 2030. The average household in the U.S. uses just under 11,000 kilowatt-hours a year, meaning that if Grand Inga reaches its projected scale, it could generate enough electricity to power nearly half of all homes in the U.S., though it will be used solely for homes in Africa.

What To Know

The Grand Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) would be a series of seven hydroelectric power stations at Inga Falls in the Congo River.

SADC ministers responsible for energy and water agreed to push forward with the Grand Inga Hydropower Plan and the Congo River Water Transfer Concept at a meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, on July 3.

On June 3, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a $250 million creditas the first phase of a previously announced $1 billion long-term commitment to support preparation and local development efforts for Inga 3, DRC's largest power project to date.

Constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, the Inga I and II provided a foundation, yet both function at about 80 percent capacity. Grand Inga, which would be the third structure at the site, has attracted multiple rounds of international interest, but progress has repeatedly stalled because of high costs, governance concerns and the withdrawal of major partners, such as China's state-owned Three Gorges Corporation.

The projected $80 billion cost of completing the Grand Inga plan remains a huge barrier for the DRC, which is one of the world's poorest countries.

South Africa, Nigeria, Guinea and Angola have expressed formal interest in purchasing power from Grand Inga, tying the project to transnational energy security.

The Grand Inga initiative is part of the Mission 300 program, which aims to supply electricity to 300 million Africans by 2030. World Bank President Ajay Banga called the wider project ""a crucial component"" for economic growth and development across the continent and predicted that it could draw as much as $85 billion in private investment.

What People Are Saying

Bob Mabiala, head of the ADPI-DRC, told the World Bank on June 3: ""The electricity generation potential at the Inga site is one of the largest in the world. The development of Inga 3's hydropower will be transformative for DRC. By increasing access to clean, renewable, and affordable energy for Congolese households and industries, it will serve as a motor for inclusive growth and jobs.""

Albert Zeufack, World Bank division director, in a press release on June 3: ""By supporting DRC's vision for Inga through this program and complementary investments in governance, education, and infrastructure, the World Bank Group, together with partners, can significantly contribute to converting DRC's natural resources into economic growth, jobs, and human development for the Congolese people.""

What Happens Next

The Future of Earth’s Rotational Energy For now, the concept of harnessing Earth’s rotation for electricity remains a tantalizing possibility rather than a practical solution.
Could the energy of Earth’s rotation become a cornerstone of future sustainable energy strategies?","In a groundbreaking development, American researchers have detected a minuscule electrical voltage by harnessing Earth’s magnetic field in its rotational movement. This surprising discovery, although modest in its current form, has reignited a scientific debate that has been ongoing for nearly two centuries. The idea of generating electricity using Earth’s rotation is not new. However, a team led by Christopher Chyba from Princeton University has published astonishing results in Physical Review Research. Their precisely designed experimental setup produced a continuous current of a few microvolts, opening up fascinating new possibilities.

Theoretical Principles Under Scrutiny

Back in the 19th century, Michael Faraday pondered whether Earth’s magnetic field could be used to produce energy. His experiments, grounded in the principle of electromagnetic induction, did not yield any significant results due to the uniform properties of Earth’s magnetic field. In such an environment, the electric forces induced by a conductor’s movement tend to cancel each other out, preventing the generation of continuous current. This theoretical limitation was long seen as an insurmountable barrier.

In 2016, Christopher Chyba and his team reinforced this conclusion by publishing a mathematical proof demonstrating the impossibility of the process. However, upon reexamining their assumptions, they identified an exception: using a specific magnetic material shaped into a hollow cylinder could locally disrupt the magnetic field’s configuration. This peculiarity could prevent the cancellation of electrical charges, allowing a measurable voltage to persist.

Their experiment utilized a tube made from manganese-zinc ferrite, a material chosen for its ability to facilitate magnetic diffusion. Positioned at a precise angle relative to Earth’s magnetic field, the device was placed in a darkened room to eliminate any photovoltaic interference. After ruling out other voltage sources, such as thermoelectric effects, the researchers recorded a signal of 17 microvolts, which they attribute to Earth’s rotation. Although this value is extremely low, it aligns with the theoretical predictions of their revised model.

Results Awaiting Confirmation

While the experiment conducted by Christopher Chyba’s team seems promising from a theoretical standpoint, its practical implications remain largely unproven. The measured voltage of 17 microvolts, although in line with predictions, represents an infinitesimal amount of energy—equivalent to less than one-thousandth of the voltage produced by a button cell battery. This makes it particularly challenging to distinguish between a genuine physical effect and potential experimental artifacts, like stray currents or residual thermal variations.

Several scientists have already expressed doubts about the interpretation of these results. Rinke Wijngaarden, a physicist at the Free University of Amsterdam, notes that his own attempts to replicate the phenomenon in 2018 yielded no conclusive results. To resolve these uncertainties, researchers will need to conduct numerous experimental verifications, including varying test conditions such as latitude, altitude, and time of day, and enhancing the sensitivity of measuring instruments. The scientific community emphasizes the need for independent reproduction by other laboratories, the only guarantee of reliability for such a controversial discovery.

Practical Challenges and Implications

Even assuming the underlying physical principle is valid, its practical application would be far from straightforward. Researchers estimate that the efficiency of the device would need to be drastically increased to produce usable power. However, current equations do not guarantee that this is possible with existing materials. Furthermore, large-scale exploitation raises ethical and environmental concerns: the energy produced would come directly from Earth’s rotation. If we aimed to generate enough electricity to meet global demands, this method could potentially slow Earth’s rotation by approximately 7 milliseconds per century, according to initial calculations.

Given the current state of knowledge, this research direction remains largely theoretical. As Christopher Chyba cautiously acknowledges, “our equations show how such an evolution could be realized, but that is very different from demonstrating its feasibility.” The coming years will determine whether this innovative approach can move beyond scientific curiosity to become a viable alternative energy source, or if it will join the catalog of physically possible but technologically unexploitable ideas.

The Future of Earth’s Rotational Energy

For now, the concept of harnessing Earth’s rotation for electricity remains a tantalizing possibility rather than a practical solution. The potential for a new green energy source is intriguing, but significant hurdles must be overcome to turn theory into reality. Enhanced experimental setups, confirmed independent findings, and groundbreaking material developments are crucial steps in this journey.

As we stand on the brink of a potential energy revolution, questions linger: Can we find a way to make this theoretical energy source practical? Could the energy of Earth’s rotation become a cornerstone of future sustainable energy strategies? The answers may redefine the boundaries of human ingenuity and scientific exploration.

Solar power, coupled with battery storage, offers a solution by providing continuous power during outages, as demonstrated by Babcock Ranch during Hurricane Ian.

Expanding solar energy in Florida through policies like net metering, statewide PACE financing, and mandatory solar on new homes can enhance energy security and create jobs.

We are blessed to live in the Sunshine State, but extreme weather events can leave us without power for days, costing our economy billions and tragically claiming the lives of those dependent on electricity for medical equipment. For elderly residents on oxygen, families with special needs children, or anyone needing refrigerated medications, outages can be fatal.

That's why I'm concerned about losing the 30% federal solar tax credit expiring Dec. 31, 2025, coupled with Florida eliminating renewable energy targets from state law. Solar plus storage is more than sustainability, it's about durability, our economy, and Floridians' safety.

Recent hurricanes prove that centralized power systems can fail when needed most. While hundreds of thousands lost power during Hurricane Ian—with outages alone costing Florida's economy an estimated $5 billion—those with solar panels and battery storage kept lights on, refrigerators running, and medical devices functioning.

The most compelling example is Babcock Ranch, Florida's first solar-powered town. When Ian's 150-mph winds devastated Fort Myers 12 miles away, Babcock's 5,000 residents never lost power. Their 700,000-panel solar array and underground power lines proved that renewable energy hardens infrastructure when centralized systems fail.

This durability creates economic benefits. Florida's solar industry employs approximately 14,000 workers with strong recent growth. Every installation creates local jobs. When power stays on during storms, businesses avoid losses, hospitals maintain operations, and families avoid hotel costs. The economic case for solar durability equals the environmental one.

Smart reliability strategies recognize that distributed energy systems strengthen the entire grid. When homes generate and store power, they reduce strain on infrastructure during peak demand. Solar plus storage homes are lifeboats, keeping families safe while making everyone more secure.

The good news: Florida's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing program allows property owners to finance solar panels, battery backup, and hurricane-resistant improvements with no upfront costs, repaid via property taxes. Funded by private capital, not taxpayer dollars, PACE enables complete durability solutions providing automatic power during outages.

However, PACE operates locally, requiring county-by-county approval, creating uneven availability. Critics worry about costs, but PACE spreads expenses over time while community solar ensures equitable benefits.

Utilities face legitimate challenges adapting to distributed generation. These challenges could be eased by partnering with solar producers through time-of-use rates or virtual power plants, ensuring stability while rewarding homeowners. This is a win-win because National Renewable Energy Laboratory studies show that distributed solar reduces infrastructure costs by decreasing peak demand.

This represents a fundamental choice: Do we want energy security and extreme weather durability, or continued dependence on centralized systems that may fail when families need power most?

Florida lawmakers should:

• Champion solar as essential infrastructure. Protect net metering—which credits solar owners for excess power—streamline permitting and ensure statewide PACE availability.

• Follow California's lead mandating solar on new homes. When builders integrate solar from the beginning, costs drop dramatically, and every house becomes a resilience hub.

With the federal tax credit expiring on Dec. 31, 2025, and disjointed PACE financing availability for solar and battery storage. We need political will to make programs universally accessible.

Florida’s energy security requires leadership embracing our natural advantages. As the Sunshine State, we were born to lead in solar. With proper planning and fair policies balancing utility needs with consumer benefits, we can harvest sunshine to power prosperity and build a stronger, safer future for all Floridians.

Following through could be the hard part for companies that pledged more than $90 billion in investments across the state Tuesday during the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, organized by U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pittsburgh.

At least a quarter of that money is expected to flow into Southwestern Pennsylvania.

From up to $100 million in upgrades at a Charleroi plant that makes power-grid equipment to a $15 billion pledge to buy Pennsylvania natural gas to fire a new power plant in Homer City, turning these lofty plans into reality will take careful coordination of labor, energy and funding needs.

“It’s one thing to announce your intention to do something,” said Jeff Nobers, executive director of the business and labor alliance Pittsburgh Works Together. “It’s another thing to get it funded and then actually move forward with everything you have to do to execute it.”

Pittsburgh Works Together and similar groups are generally bullish on the state’s ability to meet these challenges, as long as permitting doesn’t become too arduous.

They say the payoff could be huge, with Pennsylvania’s vast energy reserves shaping it into a hub for artificial intelligence companies and their power-hungry models.

“Energy is what’s needed to power everything,” said Audrey Russo, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Technology Council. “When we have that and people know that there’s access … that’s attractive to build businesses.”

Getting the green lights

Business interests are acutely aware that most aspects of these projects can’t go forward without the green light from regulators.

“I think the biggest thing in the bottlenecks right now would be certainly our permitting,” Russo said. “Can we be nimble enough?”

The state Department of Environmental Protection reviews all projects that disturb a significant amount of earth or might pose risks to air or water quality. Anything from a large home to a sprawling power plant falls under at least one of these categories.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has gotten kudos from the business community for his efforts to fast-track environmental approvals, even as the overall view on the state’s permitting process remains mixed.

DEP officials say their permit backlog is down 98% since November 2023.

“Nobody is going to turn around a permit on a power plant or data campus in 30 days,” Nobers said. “But it shouldn’t take three years, either.”

Powering up

The data centers that make artificial intelligence models work eat up tons of electricity by running and cooling servers. These facilities consumed about 4% of U.S. power in 2023, and are projected to reach up to 12% by 2028.

Industry boosters claim natural gas is well-suited to meet rising demand.

Pennsylvania is already the second-largest natural gas producing state, and Jim Welty, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, said that supply isn’t running out any time soon.

Fracking to extract natural gas only started in the Marcellus Shale Formation in the mid-2000s. The formation, which covers a majority of Pennsylvania, is one of the largest shale deposits in the world.

More wells can and may need to be drilled.

But the “permitting process,” Welty said, “I think that’s what’s key.”

A tax credit program backed by the governor and under consideration in the state Senate would further incentivize drilling by offering breaks to producers of hydrogen and certain fertilizers, which are both made using natural gas.

EQT and CNX, the two major natural gas players in Southwestern Pennsylvania, did not return requests for comment.

EQT acquired local competitor Olympus Energy earlier this month for $1.8 billion, suggesting the firm sees strong times ahead for the industry.

‘We’re ready to go’

Incoming energy and tech investments promise to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, many of them in the skilled trades.

Building the Homer City plant, in the works prior to the summit, is expected to create 10,000 construction jobs alone.

Darrin Kelly, president of the Allegheny-Fayette Central Labor Council, expects the projects announced at the summit to keep the roughly 30,000 tradespeople he oversees busy for the next 15 to 20 years. He’s confident in the skill and supply of electricians, welders, heating and cooling specialists, and others.

In fact, he anticipates Southwestern Pennsylvania workers will get pulled onto projects across the state.

“We have the most seasoned energy workforce in the country,” Kelly said. “We’re ready to go for anything that comes our way, and everybody is actively recruiting.”

It wasn’t too long ago that Boilermakers Local 154 was turning away the few recruits that walked through its door. It historically sourced much of its work from a dwindling number of coal-fired power plants, but over the past decade saw its ranks plummet from more than 1,500 members to around 700.

“How was I going to take new apprentices?” said Shawn Steffee, business agent for the local. “I can’t put them to work.”

New work has emerged in recent years, a trend that will be turbocharged once the projects announced Tuesday get underway.

The union is in the process of taking on 100 new apprentices.

“It’s just going to be the timing on a lot of these projects,” Steffee said. “If everyone wants to do these major projects at one time, of course it’s going to be a problem on the manpower.”

Funding puzzle

Major energy and tech infrastructure projects rarely have full funding when they’re announced — especially one like Blackstone’s proposed $25 billion data center and energy infrastructure project in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Allegheny Conference on Community Development CEO Stefani Pashman said the further out a groundbreaking is scheduled, the more likely it is that significant financing gaps remain.

Few firm dates were offered at the summit. Westinghouse was one of the only companies to set a timeline, saying it will have 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors under construction by 2030.

While all of the projects announced at last week’s summit were likely in the works before the event was publicly announced in June, companies may have closed deals more quickly than they would have otherwise to capitalize on summit’s fanfare, Pashman said.

To that point, the value of the deals set to be unveiled jumped about $20 billion in the hours preceding the summit.

“If something had occurred that day … I’d imagine the timing is going to take a little longer,” Pashman said.

Amid all the excitement surrounding the announcements, Sean O’Leary, a senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, offered a sobering reminder that capital can be hard to find.

He pointed to the struggling Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub concept, which would concentrate hydrogen production, storage and use in the Appalachian region, as an example of how hype can give way to fiscal reality.

Since the federal government announced funding for the hydrogen hub in 2023, more than a third of related projects have been canceled — in part due to undercapitalization.

“The two problems that have haunted many, many projects in these industries, and this is going to be especially true of data centers, is that many of them won’t be able to find capital to go forward,” O’Leary said. “And the other one is that many of them, if they do go forward, will struggle to find markets.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/07/8691810_web1_ptr-summitpitfalls100-072025.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 05:57:49.380335

Epsilon Advanced Materials aims to partner with companies seeking graphite anode and cathode materials beyond China. This move addresses concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities in the EV sector. Epsilon is investing heavily in manufacturing plants across India, the USA and Finland. The company focuses on R&D and proprietary technology for lithium iron phosphate cathode production.

Battery materials manufacturer Epsilon Advanced Materials is prepared to enter into long-term strategic partnerships with the companies looking to source high-quality graphite anode and cathode materials outside China, a company official said.

EV batteries are made of components like anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator. As of now China commands over 90 per cent of this graphite anode and cathode processing capacity which is used in electric vehicles.

The recent curbs by China on the export of key battery-grade materials and technologies for both graphite anode and cathode (lithium iron phosphate-based) has intensified global concerns over supply chain vulnerabilities in the electric vehicle (EV) sector including in India.

This development comes as India ramps up efforts to build a resilient, localised battery supply chain in the wake of China's tightening export restrictions on critical battery technologies.

""Epsilon is ready to partner with cell manufacturers and Auto OEMs who are eyeing ex-China sourcing to secure long-term supply chain of high-quality anode materials and LFP (lithium iron phosphate) cathode while supporting their localization and sustainability objectives,"" company's Managing Director Vikram Handa said in an interview.

Live Events

China has a good early mover advantage and hence has been dominating the global battery materials supply chain for decades, but the recent export restrictions has shown how critical it is for battery manufacturers and auto OEMs to diversify their sourcing, outside of China, he explained.

""To begin with, our integrated and proprietary synthetic and natural graphite anode materials allow us to provide a secure and consistent supply chain to our customers across geographies. We have strategically invested in R&D facility and commercial plant to ensure customer qualification samples to our customers for sample testing and qualifying them,"" he said.

The company has its own proprietary technology for manufacturing lithium iron phosphate cathode with an R&D facility in Germany which makes them unaffected from the recent Chinese curbs.

Many companies who were dependent on the Chinese LFP cathode technology to manufacture in India are stuck as they will have to now invest in their own R&D which takes 5-6 years to mature.

""We have manufacturing plants in India, USA, and Finland with total capacity of 60,000 tonne by 2027 and 220,000 tonne by 2030 which make us the largest anode material producer outside China and will strengthen the resilience of our supply network.

""The cathode material plant of 100,000 tonne by 2030 in India will make us Atmanirbhar in electric vehicle battery material supply chain. This multi-continent presence gives our international clients more flexibility, localised supply options, and a reduced risk of disruption,"" he explained.

The company is investing Rs 15,350 crore in Karnataka to develop state-of-the-art manufacturing and research facility for electric vehicle battery materials, battery testing and advanced materials R&D.

He might be better off focusing on another cost with which Americans are regularly confronted: electricity bills.

The electricity component of the Consumer Price Index was up 5.8% in June, year over year. This was the third month in a row when electricity came in above the broad inflation rate and marked an acceleration in that trend, rising to more than double the CPI’s 2.7%. Meanwhile, although Trump has a habit of citing fantasy sub-$2 gasoline prices, that inflation component just registered its 13th straight month of year-over-year declines. Looking at energy costs as a share of disposable personal income, gasoline took 1.59% compared with 1.15% for electricity in May (the latest month of available data), the narrowest spread in more than four years. Rather than pump prices, plug prices look more ominous.

In part, this reflects an unusually warm June keeping air conditioners cranked up, plus higher fuel costs. Natural gas-fired generation tends to set the wholesale electricity price, and both gas futures and power plant fuel costs have bounced back from low levels a year ago.

But the big driver of the utility costs that feed into bills is spending on the grid, which tends to be stickier, too. This is all the more salient given Trump’s recent visit to Pennsylvania to tout multibillion-dollar investments in datacenters there. Winning the race for artificial intelligence is a core element of the administration’s focus on “energy dominance.” U.S. power demand is expected to rise quickly after lying flat for most of the past two decades, with datacenters playing a leading role.

Building the necessary generating capacity, and associated grid infrastructure, is expensive. Grids are quasi-socialist, spreading charges more or less evenly across customers with sometimes very different costs of service. Understandably, your average householder is wary of subsidizing the gigawatt-sized ambitions of the likes of Mark Zuckerberg. The AI hype phase we are in recalls the early 2000s internet bubble, with its highly inaccurate associated energy projections. (Guess who gets stuck with stranded costs for grid capacity that’s built and not used.) Andy DeVries, an analyst at CreditSights, notes that projections of power demand in 2030 have stopped growing since the DeepSeek shock in late January reminded everyone about the role of efficiency.

In response, a number of state regulators and utilities have proposed special tariffs for datacenter operators to ensure their deep pockets absorb the costs of hooking up large loads to the grid, including any stranded costs. Hyperscalers are also signing long-term contracts to underwrite new power plants and making preliminary moves to encourage new nuclear power development.

Yet these efforts won’t be sufficient to tamp down costs entirely. The datacenter shock is hitting a grid that was already under strain, in part because of the sort of extreme weather events that climate change will exacerbate, regardless of Republican ambivalence on the topic. Hugh Wynne, an analyst at Sector and Sovereign Research LLC, points out that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation assesses six out of the 13 U.S. regions it tracks as facing reliability risks linked to potential gas outages in severe winter weather. These include large grids like the main one in Texas, which failed for that reason in 2021, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator network covering much of the Midwest, and the huge PJM grid, which includes Pennsylvania.

The structural requirement for grid renewal burst into the open in PJM last summer, when a capacity auction – designed to incentivize power plants to remain open or get built – returned an 833% price increase. These charges, insurance against blackouts essentially, get spread across bills. The latest auction concluded the same day Trump was talking gigawatts in Pennsylvania, with results due next week.

Meanwhile, the anti-renewables bent of Republicans’ recently enacted budget will begin to seriously impact the fastest-growing source of new generation within a few years. (Remember when ‘all-of-the-above’ energy was supposedly a thing?) The beneficiaries will be existing coal plants avoiding retirement as well as new gas plants taking more market share. The losers will be ordinary consumers facing rising bills given existing strains in turbine supply chains (plus higher emissions) as well as the hyperscalers, who value renewables’ speed of deployment for meeting at least some of their energy needs. Skewing investment toward older technologies to power futuristic ones will exacerbate the existing challenge of balancing reliability, affordability and sustainability. While Trump talks up drill-baby-drill, trouble is brewing in the wires that snake through nearly every home in the land.

This controversial action, spearheaded by Governor Jeff Landry, comes amid long-standing discussions, evaluations, and studies that had established the project as a vital component in combating the state's severe coastal erosion and land loss crisis.

The project was designed to address the alarming loss of Gulf Coast land, which has seen more than 2,000 square miles vanish in the last century. It proposed the diversion of sediment-rich water from the Mississippi River to rehabilitate degraded wetlands and combat sea-level rise. Despite being pitched as a data-driven, large-scale ecological solution, the project has faced mounting opposition for the potential impact on Louisiana's cultural and economic fabric, including its vital seafood industry.

Governor Landry expressed significant concerns about the financial and ecological ramifications of the project, highlighting the doubled cost estimate, which had surged past $2 billion since 2016. He emphasized that the project jeopardized Louisiana's shrimp and oyster industries and did not present a viable long-term benefit proportional to its cost. In light of these financial and ecological assessments, the state government is now considering a shift towards a smaller-scale initiative that aims to balance environmental goals with community needs.

While proponents of the original project viewed it as essential for mitigating the catastrophic land loss Louisiana faces, critics pointed to the unsustainable financial burden and potential harms to fisheries. Gov. Landry has maintained that alternative coastal restoration strategies could provide more immediate and cost-effective solutions to protecting Louisiana's coastal communities.

The decision has generated notable backlash from environmental coalitions, such as Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. They argue this cancellation abandons evidence-based environmental strategies that had undergone extensive vetting and public engagement. Coastal advocates stress that sediment diversion remains instrumental in the long-term strategy for land restoration on a scale necessary to tackle the continued and accelerated land loss.

With the state redirecting efforts toward the alternative Myrtle Grove project, questions remain about the path forward in addressing Louisiana's land loss crisis, the redistribution of over $1.5 billion in unspent settlement funds, and the accountability for the $618 million already allocated to the now-defunct project. The environmental and public policy communities continue to urge that future projects be firmly rooted in scientific data and involve transparent public discourse to enhance both ecological and community resilience.

As Louisiana navigates these complexities, the overarching challenge remains: to forge a path that addresses the imminent environmental threats with sustainable, scientifically sound solutions that also protect the cultural and economic lifeblood of its communities. The state's leadership, environmental agencies, and affected communities will need to collaborate closely to sustain the momentum needed to safeguard Louisiana’s unique coastal environment and heritage for future generations.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 03:57:57.656309

The plants are Caithness Energy's Moxie Freedom Energy Centre and BlackRock's Guernsey Power Station. The deal enhances Talen's free cash flow per share by over 40% in 2026 and exceeds 50% through to 2029. The acquisition expands Talen's fleet and increases its annual generation capacity from 40 TWh to 60 TWh, strengthening its capacity to provide reliable low-carbon energy solutions for data centres and large commercial clients.

Houston, July 2, 2025 — Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: TLN), a leading independent power producer, has announced the acquisition of two combined-cycle gas-fired plants (CCGTs) in the United States. The plants, Caithness Energy's Moxie Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and BlackRock's Guernsey Power Station in Ohio, are both located within the PJM power market. The total acquisition price is $3.5 billion after adjusting for estimated tax benefits, or approximately $3.8 billion gross [1].

The acquisition reflects an attractive acquisition multiple of 6.7x 2026 EV/EBITDA for two of the most efficient natural gas plants in PJM, at a material discount to current new-build CCGT costs. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share by over 40% in 2026, and over 50% through 2029 [1].

The acquisition expands Talen's fleet by adding modern, highly efficient baseload H-class CCGTs. The plants have an average heat rate of 6,550 Btu/kWh, resulting in significant energy margin and strong cash flow conversion. Talen's annual generation capacity is expected to increase from approximately 40 TWh to 60 TWh, strengthening its ability to provide reliable low-carbon energy solutions for data centers and large commercial clients [1].

The plants benefit from an advantageous location and reliable access to gas pipeline infrastructure from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, with their rich natural gas reserves and interconnects to primary natural gas pipelines. This access ensures a stable and cost-effective supply of natural gas for the plants [1].

Talen Energy expects to issue approximately $3.8 billion in new debt to fund the acquisitions and refinance target debt, using both secured and unsecured instruments. The transactions are expected to close in Q4 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals [1].

Mac McFarland, Talen President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""This acquisition enhances Talen’s fleet by selectively adding modern, highly efficient baseload H-class CCGTs in Talen’s key markets, where we are an innovator in data center contracting. The transaction is immediately and highly accretive, maintains our balance sheet discipline, and adds more than the equivalent of another Susquehanna nuclear plant to our platform, further enabling large load service"" [1].

The acquisition supports a target of approximately $500 million of annual share repurchases through the 2026 deleveraging period, with an aimed return to capital allocation of 70% of adjusted free cash flow thereafter [1].

The fund, which is part of the North Wales Growth Deal, will provide financial support primarily for businesses and voluntary-sector organisations, wanting to deliver clean energy or decarbonisation projects.

Initially running over a five-year period, the project consist of two key sub-funds for organisations based in North Wales.

A voluntary sector sub-fund led by WCVA – designed for charities, social enterprises, and community-led projects; with UMi delivering on a private sector sub-fund for businesses. A third reserve fund can consider applications from other organisations and alternative funding models.

The funding streams will support projects delivering smart energy solutions including storage, energy efficiency, decarbonisation and renewable energy generation.

It is estimated that the fund will deliver a £100m investment in the region, create up to 150 new jobs, and cut up to 125,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Details of the fund were unveiled at a launch for partners and stakeholders, which was aptly held at Coleg Llandrillo’s Engineering Centre in Rhyl – a transformative development which features a renewable energy technology training facility.

Cllr Gary Pritchard, Lead Member for the Low Carbon Energy Programme, Ambition North Wales and Leader of Isle of Anglesey Council, said: “I was immensely proud to be part of the launch, and now to see the fund up and running.

“It will mean that green energy projects based in North Wales can begin and progress more quickly.

“By supporting innovative businesses and community-driven projects, we are fostering a more sustainable, prosperous future for the region.”

Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning Rebecca Evans, who attended and addressed delegates, said: “The launch of the Clean Energy Fund is fantastic news for North Wales, opening the door to more opportunities for the region’s thriving clean energy sector.

“With its abundant natural resources, skilled workforce, and commitment to sustainability, North Wales is uniquely positioned to lead the way in harnessing renewable energy.

“I look forward to seeing innovative developments that will drive economic growth while advancing our transition to a greener future.”

Wales Office Minister Dame Nia Griffith, who was able to share a video message during the event, said: “The Clean Energy Fund helps to cement North Wales’s growing reputation in the clean energy sector.

“This fund, supported by investment from the UK Government, will ensure the sector continues to flourish and create new well-paid jobs.

“The UK Government has made kickstarting economic growth and making Britain a clean energy superpower the cornerstones of our Plan for Change.

“North Wales is at the heart of our ambitions to secure our energy supply, respond to climate change, reduce household energy bills as well as grow the economy.”

The fund aligns with the North Wales Regional Energy Strategy, aiming to increase the use of renewable energy and establish a strong local ownership of clean energy assets, ensuring long-term benefits for communities and businesses alike.

It fuels power plants, heats homes, drives industry, and—through liquefied natural gas (LNG)—connects continents. The newly released 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy highlights just how indispensable natural gas has become, despite mounting pressure to decarbonize.

Following the previous article on global oil production and consumption trends, let’s dig into the numbers behind the global gas market, with a focus on production, consumption, and the increasingly critical role of LNG exports.

U.S. Still Leads the Pack in Production

In 2024, global natural gas production reached a record-breaking 398.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). The United States alone accounted for 25% of that, producing just under 100 Bcf/d. That marked a slight decline from the record output in 2023, but still more than five times Canada’s output, its closest North American peer. Much of this strength comes from the shale gas revolution that began about 20 years ago, turning the U.S. into both the world’s largest natural gas producer and ultimately the world’s top LNG exporter.

Russia, which the U.S. overtook for first place among gas producers in 2011, remains the world’s second-largest producer, with 60.8 Bcf/d of output in 2024. But that figure remains below its pre-sanction highs as exports to Europe dried up and pipeline projects faced delays. Moscow has attempted to pivot to Asian markets, but logistical and political hurdles have slowed progress.

Other top producers include:

Iran and Qatar, which remain vital players in the Middle East, producing around 25 and 17 Bcf/d, respectively.

China, whose domestic gas output has doubled over the past decade, now stands at 23 Bcf/d—an impressive feat as the country pushes to displace coal with cleaner-burning alternatives.

Australia, at 14 Bcf/d, has carved out a global leadership role in LNG, although future growth may be constrained by aging fields and regulatory pressure.

Africa’s contributions are modest in comparison. Algeria leads the continent with 9.1 Bcf/d, followed by Egypt and Nigeria. Infrastructure bottlenecks and underinvestment have limited the continent’s broader potential.

Notably, over the past decade, more than half of global natural gas production growth has come from OECD countries, albeit production in the EU has declined by two-thirds. This underscores that despite a global push toward renewables, countries continue to seek flexible energy supplies that balance affordability with lower carbon intensity.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/2dd46bed35288b496e5486b5912501ee,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:30.816289

Traditional assets like equities and fixed income have struggled to adapt, with the S&P 500 posting a -10% return in 2025 alone. In this environment, private infrastructure has emerged as a compelling alternative, offering investors a unique combination of inflation protection, stable income, and diversification benefits.

The Inflation-Resilient Nature of Private Infrastructure

Private infrastructure assets—spanning energy grids, transportation networks, and digital infrastructure—have historically outperformed during stagflationary periods. This resilience stems from their operational models. For example, toll roads like the Indiana Toll Road feature contractual rate adjustments tied to inflation indices, ensuring cash flows keep pace with rising costs. Similarly, regulated utilities and power generation facilities often operate under long-term agreements that allow for periodic price adjustments, aligning revenue with inflationary trends.

Data from the KKR 2024 study underscores this point: over 20 years, private infrastructure demonstrated a mere 0.58% correlation with global equities, outperforming traditional inflation hedges like gold and TIPS. In 2025, the StepStone Private Infrastructure Fund (STRUX) delivered a 6.75% return, while the iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IGF) gained 4.92%—a stark contrast to the S&P 500's performance.

Diversification in a Volatile World

Private infrastructure's low correlation with traditional assets makes it a powerful diversifier. Unlike public equities, which are often tied to cyclical industries, infrastructure assets provide essential services with inelastic demand. Whether it's electricity, water, or transportation, these services remain critical regardless of economic conditions. This stability is reinforced by long-term contracts, which provide predictable cash flows even as other asset classes falter.

The energy transition and AI-driven demand for power further amplify infrastructure's diversification benefits. For instance, renewable energy projects and data centers are now integral to global economic activity. The rise of AI has already pushed North American data center capacity demand to 15–20% annual growth, creating a tailwind for infrastructure investors.

Income Generation in a High-Cost Environment

Rising interest rates have made income-focused assets more attractive, and private infrastructure excels in this arena. Many infrastructure assets generate cash flows through user fees, regulated rates, or long-term service agreements. These cash flows are often tax-efficient, with depreciation shields reducing taxable income while maintaining cash flow. For example, a solar farm operator might lock in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) that adjust for inflation, ensuring steady returns even as borrowing costs rise.

Moreover, infrastructure's alignment with long-term trends like the energy transition ensures income streams remain relevant. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has unlocked tax credits for clean energy projects, incentivizing investment in renewables and grid upgrades. This policy tailwind, combined with AI's insatiable appetite for power, positions infrastructure as a durable source of income.

Strategic Allocation in a Shifting Macro Landscape

For investors navigating 2025's economic uncertainties, private infrastructure offers a dual benefit: protection against inflation and a buffer against market volatility. While core infrastructure (e.g., regulated utilities) provides stable income, core-plus and value-add opportunities offer higher growth potential through operational improvements or sector-specific tailwinds.

The asset class's resilience is further supported by its low volatility. Over the past decade, private infrastructure has outperformed all major asset classes except private equity, with annualized returns averaging 8.0% since 2023. As central banks pivot toward rate cuts in 2025, infrastructure's cost of capital is expected to decline, unlocking new investment opportunities.

Conclusion: A Cornerstone for Future-Proof Portfolios

In an era of macroeconomic uncertainty, private infrastructure stands out as a strategic allocation. Its ability to hedge against inflation, generate stable income, and diversify portfolios makes it a cornerstone for investors seeking resilience. With global infrastructure gaps estimated to exceed $150 trillion by 2040, the sector's long-term growth potential is undeniable. For those willing to embrace this asset class, the rewards could be substantial—both in terms of risk mitigation and returns.

As the economic landscape evolves, infrastructure's role as a strategic inflation hedge will only grow. Investors who act now may find themselves positioned to capitalize on one of the most compelling opportunities of the decade.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:42.910267

In addition to slashing federal funding, the nearly 900-page bill eliminated the solar tax credit that homeowners could claim for installing solar panels on their properties.

Here’s what you need to know about the changes to the solar tax credit and how it’ll likely affect everyone — including those without solar panels.

What is the solar tax credit?

The solar tax credit, also known as the residential clean energy credit, reduces homeowners’ taxes if they install qualifying solar equipment. It essentially lets homeowners use money they would have paid in taxes to install solar energy systems. Taxpayers can claim up to 30% of the installation costs for new clean energy systems on their properties.

The incentive often makes the upfront costs of switching to renewable energy more affordable for homeowners, and it has saved Americans a lot of money. In fact, more than 1.2 million taxpayers claimed $6.3 billion with the residential energy tax credit during the 2023 tax year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Rooftop solar electricity systems represented 60% of those claims.

What’s changed for the solar tax credit?

The current version of the solar tax credit was introduced as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which continued a tax break for homeowners who installed solar panels through 2034. The IRS planned to phase out the credit starting in 2033 rather than end it abruptly.

However, Trump’s bill ends the solar tax credit on December 31, 2025 — cutting off nine years of potential savings for consumers who were considering certain renewable energy systems. The end-of-year deadline also drastically reduces the time people have to schedule qualifying installations.

Homeowners who want to claim the solar tax credit for the 2025 tax year need to make a financial transaction before the new December 31 deadline, says Hector Castaneda, a certified professional accountant and president of Castaneda CPA and Associates. That means either paying with cash or financing the purchase ahead of the deadline.

What this means for consumers

Ending the solar tax credit can have far-reaching ramifications for consumers — even those who never planned to switch to solar panels.

More expensive solar installations

The average installation costs for solar panels was $27,720 in early 2025, according to EnergySage, an online solar marketplace. The federal solar tax credit saved homeowners an average of $8,316, dropping the price to $19,404.

But anyone purchasing solar panels for their homes after 2025 will have to rely only on state-based incentives to save money. States vary in what incentives they offer, saving some residents money upfront with sales tax exemptions, or money over time with property tax exemptions. But even combined with local tax credits and rebates for solar installations, state incentives won’t make up for the thousands of dollars in savings homeowners will lose after 2025.

To complicate matters, solar panel costs were already becoming volatile before Trump rang the solar tax credit’s death knell. Tariffs on imported solar components and equipment began affecting the industry earlier this year, creating uncertainty about supply chain reliability and affordability.

Cal Morton, owner of EasTex Solar, a solar installer serving the East Texas region, says the tariffs kicked off a turbulent market for solar companies. “It was already the craziest year that I can think of,” Morton says.

Consumers quickly began to feel the effects of an unstable market. The average cost of residential solar energy systems increased 3% between the first quarters of 2024 and 2025, according to a June 2025 Wood Mackenzie report. Prices are likely to continue to rise, making the solar market more unsteady without the solar tax credit.

Longer payback periods for new systems

Homeowners who purchase solar panels without the benefits of the solar tax credit will likely pay a higher price tag. This translates to a longer gap between solar installation and breaking even with a system’s savings, also known as the payback period.

The average payback period for solar customers was just over seven years in early 2025, according to EnergySage. But homeowners in some areas were already looking at closer to 20 years before breaking even on their purchases. Price hikes and the loss of the tax credit will likely lengthen those payback periods.

Lease, PPA and battery trends

As homeowners back away from solar panel purchases, companies that offer leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are likely to become the major competitors, says Chris Hopper, co-founder and chief executive officer of Aurora Solar, a software platform that streamlines the solar array design process for installers.

Homeowners might be able to still save money after 2025 by leasing solar panels or entering a PPA before July 4, 2026, when solar companies’ tax credits change. These arrangements allow homeowners to generate solar energy without purchasing the equipment, while the companies that own the equipment receive a tax break. If a company passes on that tax break to the consumer, it can lower the overall cost of the system.

Additionally, the deadline changes don’t apply to solar battery purchases. Homeowners who purchase batteries to use as storage systems, such as pairing with a new or existing solar energy system, can claim a tax credit to offset up to 50% of the cost. The credit will begin to phase out in 2034 and end on December 31, 2035.

Less solar power and higher electricity bills

The elimination of the solar tax credit comes at the same time that the U.S. energy market is experiencing a growing demand for power, Hopper says. Solar energy has been helping with that demand. It was responsible for 69% of the new electricity-generating capacity that utility companies added to the U.S. power grid in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Wood Mackenzie report from June 2025.

Although commercial solar projects can continue to see tax benefits longer than residential systems, they tend to take longer to put into operation. The lengthy timeline means less solar energy production to support the growing need for more energy in the meantime.

Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank specializing in energy, climate research and policy analysis, estimates that the loss of that additional energy will raise the cost of electricity for consumers.

Janice DiPietro, chief integration and customer officer at ReVision Energy, a New England-based solar company, agrees. She cites the combination of new tariffs, the loss of the solar tax credit and the increased demand for power as primary factors.

“As a result, electricity rates will increase at a faster than average pace,” DiPietro said by email.",https://www.ketk.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2025/07/solar-panels-e1752866077410.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-20 02:00:01.957658

Hydrogen Tax-Credit Policy Updates: Congressional decisions around extending or phasing out production and investment tax credits for hydrogen projects could materially affect project economics.","Overview

Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) is a pure-play hydrogen solutions provider that designs, manufactures, and services fuel cell systems (GenDrive) for material-handling equipment, stationary backup power (GenSure), and on-road vehicles, alongside electrolyzers and hydrogen refueling infrastructure (GenFuel). The company sells hardware, supplies hydrogen fuel under long-term contracts, and offers maintenance and managed services for its deployed fleet of fuel cell units and production facilities. Operating in the broader clean-energy and decarbonization industry, Plug Power addresses demand from logistics and industrial customers seeking to reduce emissions. It competes with other fuel-cell and hydrogen players such as Bloom Energy, Ballard Power Systems, and FuelCell Energy, as well as industrial-gas companies like Air Products & Chemicals and Air Liquide, and faces indirect competition from battery-electric powertrain suppliers. Plug’s vertically integrated model—covering production, delivery, and end-use of hydrogen—gives it scale advantages, with over 70,000 fuel cell systems and 250 fueling stations deployed globally.

Recent Performance

Over the past 12 months, Plug Power’s stock has plunged roughly 55%, compared with a 13.6% gain for the S&P 500. This underperformance reflects lingering investor skepticism over Plug’s path to profitability amid deep negative margins and substantial share dilution. Political uncertainty also weighed on sentiment: an executive order in early 2025 paused the release of DOE loan guarantee funds, putting its $1.66 billion green-hydrogen loan at risk and prompting cost‐cutting measures. More recently, Plug saw a rally on bipartisan support for extending hydrogen tax credits through 2028, but the broader trend remains one of volatility and downward pressure.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Analysts forecast Plug’s revenue to climb from about $969 million in 2025 to $1.32 billion in 2026, a compound annual increase of roughly 36%. Growth drivers include ongoing orders from anchor customers Amazon and Walmart, rapid expansion of its GenEco electrolyzer business (up 575% year-over-year in Q1), and the commissioning of a 15-ton-per-day hydrogen plant in Louisiana, boosting total U.S. production capacity to ~40 TPD. Plug’s cost-reduction program “Project Quantum Leap” is targeting $150–200 million in annual savings, while a $525 million secured credit facility has strengthened near-term liquidity.

Quality & Moat

Plug remains unprofitable, with a 12-month net loss of ~$2 billion and free cash flow of –$901 million, alongside a gross margin loss of 55% in Q1 2025 versus –132% in Q1 2024. Returns on equity (–1.21%) and invested capital (–65.48%) are deeply negative. However, Plug’s integrated hydrogen ecosystem—covering production, storage, and fuel cells—creates a high barrier to entry, and partnerships with major logistics operators provide a stable demand base. Management has demonstrated capital discipline by refinancing dilutive convertible debt, cutting cash burn in Q1 to $152 million (from $288 million prior year), and committing to no new equity raises in 2025.

Valuation

Plug Power trades at an enterprise value of roughly $3 billion, implying an EV/sales multiple of about 3× on 2025 revenue estimates. Traditional earnings multiples are negative (forward P/E of –0.87×), and price-to-book stands at 0.57×. The average analyst price target of $1.29 suggests a 16% downside from today’s $1.79 share price, underscoring cautious sentiment given execution risks and ongoing losses.

Market Sentiment

Analyst consensus is “Hold” with 19 covering brokers, reflecting mixed views on near-term catalysts and profitability. Insider activity has included CFO Paul Middleton buying 650,000 shares on June 9 and 350,000 on May 16, signaling internal confidence , although the net insider buying/selling ratio of 0.93 indicates overall modest net selling. Short interest is elevated at 25.9% of float (2.4 days to cover), up 23% month over month, pointing to bearish bets. Institutional ownership sits near 43.5%, while retail holds the balance, highlighting a polarized base.

Key Risks

Unprofitable Operations and Cash Burn: Persistent negative gross margins, substantial free cash flow deficits, and a track record of asset impairments raise uncertainty over when Plug will reach sustainable profitability.

Execution and Dilution Risk: Meeting ambitious production and cost-reduction targets under Project Quantum Leap is critical; failure could force new equity raises and further dilute shareholders.

Regulatory and Policy Uncertainty: Shifts in U.S. policy—such as executive orders impacting DOE loan disbursements or future changes to hydrogen tax credits—could disrupt funding and slow project rollouts.

Competitive Pressures: Alternative decarbonization solutions, including battery-electric vehicles and rival fuel-cell technologies from Bloom Energy and Ballard, could limit Plug’s market share gains.

Financial Leverage and Volatility: While Plug holds net cash, its interest coverage is deeply negative (–43×) and its beta is 1.34, indicating high earnings and stock volatility under economic stress.

Bull Case

Rapid Revenue Growth: Analyst projections of mid-30% annual revenue growth driven by large contracts, electrolyzer deployments, and hydrogen plant expansions could deliver material upside.

Margin Turnaround: Gross margins improved from –132% to –55% in Q1; further cost savings and internal hydrogen production could push margins toward break-even and unlock valuation re-rating.

Strong Institutional and Insider Support: Recent debt refinancing reduced dilution risk, and insider purchases combined with anchor customer partnerships (Amazon, Walmart) reinforce confidence in management strategy.

Policy Tailwinds: Extension of clean-hydrogen tax credits through 2028 under recent legislation enhances project economics and potentially accelerates demand for Plug’s solutions.

Valuation Leverage: Trading at ~3× forward EV/sales—below many fast-growing tech peers—offers attractive upside if growth and profitability come through as expected.

Bear Case

Ongoing Losses: Continued negative margins and hefty cash burn strain balance-sheet resilience, risking further dilution if equity capital becomes necessary.

Policy Risk: Uncertain federal support for hydrogen (e.g., DOE funding delays or future tax-credit rollbacks) could derail project timelines and revenue projections.

Competitive Threats: Emerging battery-electric solutions and competing hydrogen technologies may win customers, limiting Plug’s ability to convert market potential into sales.

High Short Interest and Volatility: Elevated bearish positioning (26% of float shorted) increases downside risk if negative news triggers a sell-off and amplifies stock swings.

Execution Complexity: Scaling global manufacturing, supply chains, and plant commissioning is operationally demanding; missteps could erode customer trust and slow deployments.

On Our Radar

Investment Recommendation

Plug Power represents a high-beta, high-risk play on the emerging clean-hydrogen economy. Its rapid revenue growth and improving margins, underpinned by major customer contracts and policy support, point to a potentially significant upside if execution stays on track. However, the company’s long history of losses, execution complexity, and reliance on government funding introduce substantial volatility and dilution risk. A long-term investor with a high risk appetite may view current levels as an attractive entry point to benefit from a hydrogen rebound, while more risk-averse investors might wait for sustained profitability and clearer policy visibility before committing.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-07-20 04:57:54.899580

The One Big Beautiful Bill will reduce the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers.","A bill, which is being discussed and debated in the US these days is President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (also known as OBBBA). Though the bill has finally been passed by the Parliament and approved by the President, in the process, it has definitely broken a friendship that was in the news recently, where Elon Musk was seen as Santa, to President Trump, as he played a significant role in getting him elected to this post. Elon Musk is so upset with this law that he has even formed a new political party. While President Trump claims that his bill will bring more prosperity to the US than ever before, and help make America great again, critics including Elon Musk believe that this bill can wreak havoc on the US economy.

Before passing any judgement on who is right and who is wrong, let’s try to understand what this bill means?

One thing for sure is clear that bill will increase the federal deficit in the coming decade. The US debt is projected to increase by $3.3-$3.9 trillion in the next one decade, from 2025. Currently, (as of 2025) US national debt is over $34 trillion, which is more than 120 percent of its GDP, and is very high even from the perspective of a developed country.

It is clear that the federal debt is already very high, and the interest outgo on increased debt could deteriorate the economic scenario for the US. Interest payments on the existing debt are already the largest federal expenditure, competing with defense and health expenditures, and this scenario could get even worsen in the coming years. Although, this new law will lead to a huge jump in the federal debt, but with the debt increasing from time to time, Americans have realized its inevitability. Perhaps, this is the reason that although those aware of its impact are worried, the general public may not be. This is why Trump has been able to garner support for the bill in the Parliament and among the general public as well.

But the markets are not so kind to Donald Trump, as they are signaling the potential risks from the rising debts. The yield on US government bonds is rising as investors are demanding higher returns for holding the debt. Some experts have also warned of a fiscal crisis if the yield on government debt rises. If the US is unable to control its debt or the world loses confidence in the dollar, the crisis could worsen. Rating agencies such as Fitch have already downgraded US credit rating, citing long-term fiscal challenges.

Another provision that has been controversial, is the provision to phase out the clean energy tax credit. The clean energy tax credit was included under past President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022.

The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a number of tax incentives to promote clean energy, including a variety of tax credits for solar, wind and other renewable energy projects, electric vehicle (EV) taxes, home energy efficiency upgrades, etc.

These credits were designed to promote investment in clean technology, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and speed the transition to a low-carbon economy. The new law will roll back most of these credits over a period of time, usually 2 to 5 years.

The argument for rolling back these tax credits is that they promote unnecessary government intervention and market distortion. These incentives cost hundreds of billions of dollars and add to the national debt. Donald Trump says fossil fuel and traditional industries should be given a level playing field. He says energy policy should focus on affordability and reliability, not just decarbonization.

Opponents say rolling back these credits will slow clean energy deployment and undermine climate action. The move could also discourage private investment in renewable infrastructure and domestic manufacturing, threatening jobs in the growing clean tech sector.

By phasing out the Clean Energy Tax Credit from the Inflation Reduction Act, this law marks a significant shift in US energy and climate policy. While governments all over the world, including India, are making major efforts to promote green energy expansion, this move of the Trump administration is being considered regressive.

Under the new law, a 1 per cent tax will be levied on international remittances in the form of money sent from individuals in the United States to individuals outside the country. It is worth noting that the House version initially proposed a 3.5 per cent tax, but the Senate lowered it.

Other major provisions of the bill

There are hundreds of provisions in the OBBBA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law by President Donald Trump, under which for most income groups, personal income tax rates were reduced and standard deductions were increased, and tax credits for children were doubled. These reliefs were to expire at the end of 2025. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” removes that expiration date, making lower individual tax rates permanent. This means that unless Congress changes the law again, Americans in most income brackets will continue to benefit from lower marginal tax rates, higher standard deductions, higher tax credits for children, and more.

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) increases the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to $2,500 per child (from $2,000 earlier) to provide more financial support to families with children. It’s important to note that a large portion of the credit is refundable, meaning families can receive the money even if they owe little or no income tax.

The One Big Beautiful Bill will reduce the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The Alternative Minimum Tax is a parallel tax system designed to ensure that higher-income earners, who benefit from many deductions and credits still pay a minimum level of tax.

Workers will also find relief in this law. The law specifically introduces new tax deductions for tips and overtime pay, aimed at benefiting hourly employees, especially those working in hospitality, retail, service, etc. Tip-earning workers (such as restaurant servers, bartenders, hotel workers, etc.) can now deduct a portion of their reported tip income from their taxable income. The bill also allows a deduction for income earned from working overtime, typically hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. These measures will increase take-home pay for workers who rely heavily on tips and overtime, encourage hard work, especially for those who put in extra hours, and also help address income volatility in sectors with inconsistent pay.

Although the Trump administration has succeeded in making this law that reduces taxes and increases debt, but due to this political turmoil has increased. America’s increasing debt is now a reality, how will it deal with it? What will be Trump’s plan to deal with the challenges facing the dollar? How will Trump deal with the crisis of inflation for the common man and what will be the fate of America’s regressive policy in view of climate change in the world? All these questions are currently not only before US, but the entire world.",https://organiser.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/screenshot-2025-07-20-023137.webp,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:49.429809

Joshua Nevett

Political reporter

The first schools in England to install what the government described as ""Great British Energy solar panels"" were made in China, the BBC has learned.

The first 11 schools involved in the GB Energy scheme bought solar panels from Aiko and Longi, two Chinese firms.

The government said the scheme was ""the first major project for Great British Energy - a company owned by the British people, for the British people"".

Labour MP Sarah Champion said GB Energy should be buying solar panels from companies in the UK rather than China, where there have been allegations of forced labour in supply chains.

""I'm really excited about the principle of GB Energy,"" she told BBC News.

""But it's taxpayers' money and we should not be supporting slave labour with that money. And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can.""

She added: ""That means that yes, unfortunately, in the short term, solar panels are probably going to be slightly more expensive.

""There are solar panels made around the world in Taiwan, Canada, even in the UK.""

Longi and Aiko both told the BBC they forbid forced labour in their production and supply chains.

China is the world's leading producer of solar panels and the suppliers in the Xinjiang region have been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims.

Earlier this year, the law was changed to ban GB Energy from investing in renewables if there is evidence of modern slavery in their production.

China has dominated the market and, according to the International Energy Agency, the country's global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80%.

Champion, who is chair of the International Development Select Committee, said ""abuse in renewable supply chains is insidious and hard to root out"".

But she urged ministers to exclude known human-rights offenders from winning public contracts.

A GB Energy spokesperson said all of the solar contracts issued under the schools initiative complied with the UK's modern slavery rules.

The Xinjiang challenge

Up to 50% of the world's supply of polysilicon - a key component in solar panels - is estimated to come from the Xinjiang region.

Mark Candlish is the director of GB-Sol, which calls itself the only manufacturer of conventional solar panels in the UK.

He said polysilicon was ""a key social issue facing our industry, with the risk of forced labour in the main mining areas"".

He added: ""The global solar market is so dominated by China that it is difficult to avoid buying Chinese if you want the low cost energy and low carbon benefits of solar PV.""

Many businesses and governments - including the UK's - buy Chinese solar panels because they are cheaper than those made elsewhere.

Two thirds (68%) of the solar panels imported by the UK came from China in 2024, according to HMRC trade data. That's an increase on the figure in 2023, when Chinese products accounted for 61% of UK solar imports.

A report by Sheffield Hallam University in 2023 linked various solar companies to suppliers in the Xinjiang region.

One of the report's authors, Alan Crawford, said the general lack of transparency in the entire solar supply chain was greater now than it was in 2023, when his Over-Exposed report was published.

""Companies that were willing to comment are now silent,"" he said.

'Ethical supply chains'

GB Energy is a state-owned company that was set up by the Labour government to invest in renewables, such as solar power.

In its first big investment, GB Energy is spending about £200m on rooftop solar for 200 schools and NHS hospitals across the country.

The first tranche of this funding has been spent on the Chinese solar panels for the 11 schools.

The Department for Education told the BBC which companies had made the solar panels in response to a freedom of information request.

A GB Energy spokesperson said the company would ""lead the way in ethical supply chains"" and insisted there was ""no place for forced labour or unethical practices in the UK's energy transition"".

The spokesperson added: ""That is why we are introducing a statutory duty on Great British Energy to prevent modern slavery in its supply chains, and reviewing supplier transparency and disclosure standards to ensure confidence in all public-facing renewable programmes.

""All contracts issued under this schools and hospitals solar initiative complied with UK procurement rules, including extensive requirements under the Modern Slavery Act.

""GBE will seek to uphold these requirements in its contracting arrangements and are actively engaging with international partners to raise the bar globally on solar supply chain accountability.""

China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.

In state-sponsored programmes, detainees are forced to produce goods including polysilicon, a core ingredient in solar panels, according to the US Department of Labor.

The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

Longi and Aiko are both members of the Solar Stewardship Initiative, which is a scheme designed to develop confidence in the supply chain and the responsible sourcing of solar panels.

An Aiko spokesperson said the company was ""committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical business conduct and responsible sourcing"".

""We take any concerns related to human rights and labour practices seriously and expect our suppliers to do the same,"" the spokesperson said.

""As part of our ongoing efforts, we engage with suppliers to promote transparency and continuous improvement in line with international guidelines. We are also closely monitoring global supply chain developments and remain committed to working with stakeholders to support a fair and sustainable solar industry.""

Longi said it regretted the findings of the Sheffield Hallam University report and ""categorically affirms that forced labour has no place within our supply chain"".

A company spokesperson said the conclusions in the Over-Exposed report ""may not fully reflect the comprehensive measures Longi has implemented to ensure full compliance with international labour standards"".

""Independent third-party audits play a critical role in verifying compliance and identifying potential risks,"" the spokesperson said.

""While the complexity of global supply chains presents challenges, Longi remains steadfast in its efforts to eliminate any risks associated with forced labour.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04c4/live/619e09a0-650e-11f0-9bd4-3b6cedfeb853.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:29.179173

By vertically integrating its hydrogen supply chain, securing policy-driven tailwinds, and locking in transformative commercial partnerships, Plug Power is positioning itself as a dominant force in a market projected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2050. For investors, the company's strategic execution and alignment with macro trends make it a compelling case study in how to capitalize on the energy transition.

Vertical Integration: Building a Resilient Hydrogen Ecosystem

Plug Power's most distinctive advantage lies in its control over the entire hydrogen value chain—from production and distribution to end-user applications. In 2025, the company operates two flagship green hydrogen plants: a 25-ton-per-day (TPD) facility in Georgia, the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in North America, and a 15-TPD plant in Louisiana. These facilities, combined with a 15-TPD hydrogen hub in Texas powered by wind energy, now produce approximately 45 tons of liquid hydrogen daily. This scale is critical for reducing costs and ensuring supply stability, a key barrier for competitors relying on fragmented supply chains.

The Uline partnership exemplifies the power of this strategy. By supplying hydrogen and deploying GenDrive fuel cells and GenFuel infrastructure across 10 distribution centers, Plug Power has created a closed-loop system where hydrogen production directly fuels industrial demand. Uline's commitment to secure up to 15 TPD of hydrogen through 2030 not only validates Plug's technology but also locks in recurring revenue and operational data to refine efficiency. For context, Uline's logistics footprint represents a microcosm of the broader industrial sector's shift toward decarbonization—a trend Plug is uniquely positioned to monetize.

Policy Tailwinds: Leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act for Scalability

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has transformed the economics of green hydrogen, and Plug Power is leveraging its provisions with precision. Section 45V's Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, which offers up to $3.00 per kilogram of hydrogen for projects with ultra-low carbon intensity, is a game-changer. Plug's use of renewable energy for electrolysis—such as the wind-powered Texas plant—qualifies it for the highest tax credit tiers, directly boosting margins.

The IRA also provides flexibility in sourcing clean energy, including Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) and renewable natural gas (RNG), which Plug is integrating into its supply chain. This adaptability is critical as the company aims to scale to 500 TPD in North America by 2025 and 1,000 TPD globally by 2028. The recent $1.66 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy further de-risks capital expenditures, enabling Plug to expand its production network without diluting shareholder value.

High-Impact Partnerships: Validating Market Demand

Plug's commercial agreements are more than revenue streams—they're proof of concept for hydrogen's role in decarbonizing heavy industry. The Uline partnership, for instance, demonstrates how hydrogen can replace fossil fuels in material handling and logistics, a sector responsible for 8% of global CO₂ emissions. By 2030, Uline's deployment of Plug's infrastructure could reduce carbon emissions by over 100,000 metric tons annually, a figure that underscores the environmental and economic scalability of Plug's solutions.

Equally significant is the confidence of Plug's own leadership. In May and June 2025, CFO Paul Middleton purchased 1 million shares of company stock, a move that signals internal conviction in the company's trajectory. This aligns with broader market sentiment: Plug's stock has gained 120% year-to-date (as of July 2025), outperforming peers in the energy transition space.

Investment Implications: A Maturing Growth Story

Plug Power's journey from a speculative innovator to a commercial validator is nearing a tipping point. With operational plants, policy-driven profitability, and partnerships that scale with demand, the company is transitioning from capital-intensive growth to cash-generative maturity. For investors, this represents a rare opportunity to back a business that is not only riding macro trends but actively shaping them.

The risks, however, remain manageable. While hydrogen infrastructure requires upfront capital, Plug's vertical integration and government support mitigate these costs. Moreover, the company's focus on industrial applications—where carbon pricing and regulatory pressure are most acute—ensures a clear path to profitability.

Conclusion: Positioning for the Hydrogen Economy

Plug Power's strategic positioning in the green hydrogen market is a masterclass in aligning technology, policy, and partnerships. By controlling its supply chain, leveraging IRA incentives, and securing long-term contracts with industry leaders like Uline, Plug is building a business model that transcends the energy transition hype cycle. For investors seeking exposure to the hydrogen economy, Plug Power offers a rare combination of innovation and execution—a compelling case for inclusion in a clean energy portfolio.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:53.690547

The Clean Water Act was intended to ensure the waters of the United States are “fishable, swimmable, and drinkable” for every American.
SB 601 was drafted with the basic goal of maintaining the clean water protections previously ensured through federal law.
Several states, including Wisconsin, Colorado, New Mexico, and Maryland, have beaten the Golden State to the punch in strengthening state clean water protections in response to weaker federal protections.
The Right to Clean Water Act is the fulfillment of a promise made when our state leaders first acknowledged clean water is a human right.","OPINION – If there is one thing the new Trump Administration has proven it’s that our precious democracy can go through great fluctuations depending on who resides in the White House. And thanks to President Trump’s deep reach into the current makeup of the US Supreme Court, sudden shifts in our regulatory environment are creating shockwaves on a wide range of topics that have left state leaders scrambling to retain our safety nets.

For example, federal policy changes are forcing California leaders to get creative to protect our shared natural resources and public health. The Supreme Court’s now-infamous Sackett v. EPA decision dramatically reduced the reach of the Clean Water Act, leaving many formerly protected waterways and wetlands much harder to protect from pollution, especially in the West.

Fortunately, we have leadership in California to ensure this seismic disruption in policy is muted by a response that could expedite how state law will capture the same protections that federal clean water permits once did. SB 601 (Allen), also known as The Right to Clean Water Act, attempts to piece back together the regulatory system established under the federal Clean Water Act over the past five decades. The Clean Water Act was intended to ensure the waters of the United States are “fishable, swimmable, and drinkable” for every American. But recent decisions by the US Supreme Court and related forthcoming regulatory changes made by Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency have severely narrowed the reach of this landmark law. GIS maps developed by the NRDC estimate more than 600,000 miles of California’s streams and up to 96% of our wetlands could lose federal Clean Water Act protections based on changes due to Sackett and further impending moves under Trump’s EPA.

That’s where SB 601 comes in. The bill aims to restore and streamline the permitting process that ensures water pollution is well monitored and controlled in California under the authority of California’s Porter-Cologne Act. With those protections now severely weakened, everything from our coastlines to our drinking water sources lack the protections we’ve all come to expect. SB 601 allows for the retention of a regulatory framework for managing water pollution in the state by expediting the replacement of the now-absent federal regulation with state authority.

SB 601 would strengthen state enforcement options and make it possible to increase penalties on polluters so that state penalties can align with the type of enforcement that was previously possible under federal law. With environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act now narrowed for many types of projects, protecting clean water under SB 601 is even more essential.

SB 601 was drafted with the basic goal of maintaining the clean water protections previously ensured through federal law. But as the bill has made its way through the legislative process, one critical tool for clean water enforcement – the citizen suit provision – has already been scuttled by the Senate.

Citizen enforcement is not just nice to have. State agencies expect and rely on community members to help enforce clean water laws because they lack the resources to pursue every violation. Citizen enforcement is fundamental to ensuring clean water protections in a state where water pollution remains the norm far too often, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. It is essential that legislators reinstate this critical right within SB 601 so that it remains available to every Californian.

SB 601 is essential – but it’s hardly revolutionary. Several states, including Wisconsin, Colorado, New Mexico, and Maryland, have beaten the Golden State to the punch in strengthening state clean water protections in response to weaker federal protections.

The Right to Clean Water Act is the fulfillment of a promise made when our state leaders first acknowledged clean water is a human right. At this moment in time, perhaps more than ever before in our nation’s history, we need California to show the world we mean what we say when it comes to protecting public health and our natural world.

Ed Case (D-Hawaiʻi) voted against two major spending bills in the House Appropriations Committee this week, citing cuts to federal housing, transportation and clean energy programs despite securing key funding for Hawai‘i.

The Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation-Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Energy and Water appropriations bills propose a combined $147 billion in funding—$89.9 billion for HUD and the Department of Transportation, and $57.3 billion for energy and water projects. Both represent reductions from FY 2025 levels, with the HUD bill down $4.5 billion and the Energy and Water bill down nearly $776 million.

“While these measures fund many critical Hawai‘i priorities I requested, I regrettably had to vote against both bills because of massive cuts to federal programs that help everyday Americans with rising housing, transportation and energy costs,” Case said.

Case objected to the elimination of key housing programs, including:

The HOME Investment Partnerships Program, the only federal program dedicated to developing new affordable rental and homeownership options;

The PRO Housing Program, which empowers local governments to address housing shortages; and

Housing counseling assistance.

He warned that the cuts could threaten housing stability for nearly 415,000 households nationwide that rely on HUD support.

Case also opposed the Energy and Water bill for slashing clean energy investments. He said Hawai‘i could lose 31% of its federal clean energy funding.

“Without these federally funded programs and incentives, we risk falling dangerously behind our clean energy goals,” Case said.

Despite voting no, Case secured several Hawai‘i-specific funding priorities across both bills, including seven Member-designated Community Project Funding (CPF) initiatives:

$2 million for repairs to Aloha Tower

$1 million for the Waikīkī Vista Project, converting unused classroom space into emergency shelter and low-income housing

$850,000 for domestic violence survivor housing in Honolulu

$850,000 for a new pedestrian bridge connecting Kūhiō Park Terrace to Kalihi Waena Elementary

$300,000 for Highlands Intermediate School’s media center upgrades

$250,000 for environmental education and wastewater upgrades at the Hawai‘i Nature Center

$250,000 for broadband infrastructure upgrades in local community centers

Case also secured:

$18.3 million for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant

$28 million for the Native Hawaiian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund

$5 million for Native Hawaiian-serving housing research partnerships

$17 billion for project-based rental assistance

$5.6 billion for the Community Development Fund, which includes $3.3 billion for CDBG formula grants

$4 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants

$380 million for the Maritime Security Program

$123 million for the Port Infrastructure Development Program

$23 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, including hiring 2,500 air traffic controllers

$15 billion for the Federal Transit Administration

Hawai‘i-specific wins in the Energy and Water bill include:

$38 million for programs which manage aquatic weeds in public waters

$2 million to study avenues of protection for public infrastructure on small beaches from erosion and damage caused by storms and natural wave currents

$9.5 million for small commercial navigation improvements such as channels and breakwaters

Direction for the US Army Corps of Engineers to update its study of Honolulu Harbor, evaluating impacts of military operations

BP PLC has agreed to divest its onshore wind business in the United States to LS Power Development LLC, toward a goal of $3-4 billion in asset sales this year.

The sale of BP Wind Energy North America Inc. to New York City-based LS Power consists of 1.3 gigawatts (GW) net capacity from 10 projects in operation.

Five of the projects are wholly owned by BP: the 44-megawatt (MW) Flat Ridge I and 470-MW Flat Ridge II in Kansas, the 288-MW Fowler Ridge I and 99-MW Fowler Ridge III in Indiana, and the 25-MW Titan in South Dakota.

In each of the other five, BP owns 50 percent: the 21-MW Auwahi in Hawaii, the 248-MW Cedar Creek II in Colorado, the 200-MW Fowler Ridge II in Indiana, the 125-MW Goshen II in Idaho and the 141-MW Mehoopany in Pennsylvania.

All 10 projects, which can generate up to 1.7 GW gross, are grid-connected and signed to 15 offtakers, according to a joint statement Friday.

To be managed under LS Power’s portfolio company Clearlight Energy, the projects would grow the purchaser’s operating fleet to about 4.3 GW, the statement said.

“LS Power will add bp’s US onshore wind business to an existing fleet of renewable, energy storage, flexible gas and renewable fuels assets, which comprise a 21GW operating portfolio and more than 780 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in operation as well as another 350+ miles currently under construction or development”, it said.

“This is a major milestone on our journey to a 100% clean energy future” said David Hochschild, chairman of the California Energy Commission.
The momentum is profound.” The new record comes as renewable energy is facing several headwinds.
He brags about a 67% clean energy milestone but ignores the real story,” said Steve Hilton, a Republican running for governor in 2026.
Nevertheless, the California Energy Commission last month approved the world’s largest battery solar project, a huge new facility in Fresno County, the Darden Energy Project.","California has hit a new record for clean energy.

Solar, wind, hydropower and other carbon-free sources made up 67% of the state’s retail electricity supply in 2023, the most recent year that data is available, according to new statistics released Monday by the California Energy Commission.

The total is up from 2022, when it was 61%. It exceeds the prior record of 64%, set in 2019.

Under a state law signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 aimed at reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change, California is required to reach 100% renewable and carbon-free electricity by 2045.

Solar, wind, geothermal, large hydropower, biomass and nuclear energy are allowed to count under the law.

“This is a major milestone on our journey to a 100% clean energy future” said David Hochschild, chairman of the California Energy Commission. “Two-thirds clean energy was considered mythology even 10 years ago. Alternative energy is now the wrong word to use for renewables. And we are just getting started. The momentum is profound.”

The new record comes as renewable energy is facing several headwinds.

Earlier this month, Republicans in Congress passed and President Trump signed a bill that removes and reduces many of the tax breaks, federal grants and other incentives that were put in place by President Biden to encourage states, private companies and homeowners to expand renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Trump also signed an executive order on July 7 directing the Treasury Department to review tax subsidies to renewable energy.

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the nation,” Trump wrote.

Gov. Gavin Newsom called that approach, in which Trump continued long-running subsidies for oil and gas, a mistake.

“As the federal government turns its back on innovation and commonsense, California is making our clean energy future a reality,” Newsom said Monday in a statement. “The world’s fourth-largest economy is running on two-thirds clean power – the largest economy on the planet to achieve this milestone.”

California has some of the highest electricity costs of any state. The average retail electricity price in California in April was 31.77 cents a kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, nearly twice the national average of 17.45 cents. Only Hawaii (42.44 cents) and Connecticut (32.28 cents) were more expensive.

“Governor Newsom’s press release is a perfect example of political theater. He brags about a 67% clean energy milestone but ignores the real story,” said Steve Hilton, a Republican running for governor in 2026. “California families and small businesses pay the highest electricity prices in the nation, we have one of the highest poverty rates, and our economy is being choked by overregulation and soaring energy costs.”

Polls show clean energy remains popular. In a poll last year by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California, 66% of California voters said they support the state’s law requiring 100% clean energy by 2045.

Hochschild said part of the reason for high electricity costs is wildfires. State regulators have required utilities like PG&E to bury powerlines in highly flammable areas to reduce fire risk, which can cost millions of dollars a mile.

Frank Wolak, a Stanford University energy economist, noted that clean energy mandates are a big reason Californians pay twice as much for electricity as people in Texas and other states.

“Renewable energy is great,” Wolak said. “But the burden often falls on people who are renting and living in apartment complexes. People who don’t own a house can’t put solar panels on the roof to lower their electricity bills.”

One of the main challenges is that the sun doesn’t shine at night and the wind doesn’t always blow.

To address that, California regulators have pushed utilities and other companies in recent years to build battery storage plants. The plants capture electricity generated by solar farms during hot parts of the day and then release it back onto the power grid at night after the sun goes down.

Battery storage has increased tenfold in the past five years in California, from 1,474 megawatts in 2020 to 15,763 megawatts now, according to the California Energy Commission. A megawatt is enough electricity to run 750 homes. California has been building battery storage faster than anywhere in the world except China.

But a major fire in January at one of the world’s largest battery storage plants, run by Texas-based Vistra in Moss Landing, has raised safety concerns about the technology and given rise to community groups opposing new plants in their neighborhoods.

Nevertheless, the California Energy Commission last month approved the world’s largest battery solar project, a huge new facility in Fresno County, the Darden Energy Project.

Many more will have to be built, Hochschild said. Electricity demand is steadily growing statewide due the growth in electric car sales — 25% of new car sales in California are now electric vehicles, the most of any state — along with the expanded demand from data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The state will need 52,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2045, the energy commission estimates.

Hochschild said the Moss Landing plant was built five years ago using battery chemistry that is now being replaced by safer technology. And the facility was built by stacking thousands of lithium-ion batteries inside an old PG&E concrete building. New standards require each battery unit to be outside, separated from each other with sensors and alarms.

“I don’t believe there are safer battery standards anywhere in the world for what we require here,” Hochschild said. “I have to vote on all these projects. I will never vote to approve a battery storage project or any project that I feel wouldn’t be safe in my community or my house.”",https://www.montereyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EBT-L-WINDPOWER-XXXX-08.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:59.477859

By enabling local fuel production at the pump level, the proposed model could support SATAT’s goals while offering new business opportunities to fuel station owners.","In a move aimed at reducing India’s dependence on imported energy and promoting clean fuel, the All India Petrol Dealers Association (AIPDA) has proposed setting up Compressed Biogas (CBG) units at petrol pumps across the country, reports CNBC TV 18.

Ajay Bansal, President of AIPDA, said the idea is to give fuel station owners a chance to produce their own Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) by converting waste into CBG on-site. He explained that petrol pump owners can use 150–200 square yards of their existing space to set up small-scale CBG units.

“These mini plants will include a compressor, cascade, and dispenser, all in one setup,” Bansal said. “The idea is to make CBG using crop stubble, municipal waste, and household garbage. Each unit would require an investment of ₹5 to ₹6 crore.”

Bansal highlighted the urgency of the shift, pointing out the 8–10% annual rise in fuel consumption while India continues to import 90% of its crude oil. “We must start using waste to generate our own fuel,” he said.

India has ambitious plans to establish 5,000 CBG plants that will produce 15 million tonnes of CBG per year—around 40% of the country’s current CNG consumption. The estimated national potential for CBG production is 62 million metric tonnes (MMT), with the added benefit of generating 370 MMT of organic fertilizer as a by-product.

Biogas is produced by breaking down organic waste such as agricultural residue, cow dung, sugarcane press mud, solid municipal waste, and sewage. When purified and compressed, this biogas becomes CBG—a renewable fuel with properties similar to CNG. It can be used in vehicles and in industrial and commercial sectors, especially considering the vast amount of biomass available in India.

The government launched the SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) initiative on October 1, 2018, to encourage the use of waste as a resource. The program aims to reduce fuel imports, create rural jobs, cut emissions, and limit the burning of farm and organic waste.

Why there’s a special session

During their regular legislative session in the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill that would have banned consumable hemp products like vapes, gummies and drinks that provide a similar high as marijuana. The broad ban would have taken effect in September, if not for Abbott’s veto. He then ordered a special legislative session for lawmakers to regulate the hemp industry and address other bills he vetoed.

The other vetoed bills on Abbott’s agenda range from changes to the criminal justice system to water rights management, but many eyes will be on how lawmakers address a loophole in previous state laws legalizing hemp that allowed the sale of THC products — which spawned an entire new industry across Texas.

Lt. Gov Dan Patrick, who has claimed that THC is driving young people to suicide and altering people’s brains, championed the ban and even threatened to make lawmakers work overtime by preventing other important legislation from advancing if they didn’t approve a ban.

Experts say there are some health concerns, including that THC can be addictive, but they say it doesn’t usually cause widespread psychosis or brain damage.

The hemp industry and its advocates warned the ban could shutter the hemp industry and hinder access to the non-psychoactive CBD and CBG and to medical marijuana for patients in need of pain relief.

Lawmakers did expand the state’s limited medical marijuana program, but medical marijuana dispensaries still hope lawmakers will heavily regulate the hemp industry by putting in place age restrictions and banning synthetic delta-8 THC, which makes up the bulk of consumable hemp products.

A special session lasts up to 30 days, and state lawmakers can only work on the governor’s agenda items.

After facing pressure from President Donald Trump’s political team, Abbott has asked lawmakers to redraw some of Texas’ 38 U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.

He also directed lawmakers to focus on these areas following the deadly Hill Country floods over the July 4 weekend:

Flood warning systems

Emergency communications

Natural disaster preparation

Relief funding for the impacted areas

Abbott also included several high-profile and controversial conservative priorities that didn’t pass during the 140-day regular session, including:

Banning cities and counties from hiring lobbyists to advocate for them at the Capitol

Requiring people to use bathrooms that align with the sex they were assigned at birth

Cracking down on the manufacturing and distribution of abortion pills

During the session, which ran from January through early June, state lawmakers failed to pass a bill that would have established a statewide plan to improve Texas’ disaster response. House Bill 13 called for the plan to include “the use of outdoor warning sirens,” like those used in tornado-prone Texas counties, and develop new emergency alert systems.

State Rep. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, said he would propose legislation to ensure people are alerted with sirens along watersheds instead of notifications on their phones that could be silenced or missed.

How can I participate in the legislative process?

Contact your lawmakers: Texans can share their concerns and personal stories with their elected representatives, which can be the most effective form of advocacy, said Kathy Green, the director of state and federal strategy for AARP Texas who has more than 30 years of experience working in and around state government.

“If you’ve got stories about those actual things that affect your daily life, talk to your legislator about that,” she said. “They need to hear the stories; they need to understand what people back in their districts are facing.”

But it helps to be prepared with knowledge of the legislation, including its impact and possible costs, and about the lawmaker you’re contacting, said state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo. For example, don’t lobby a legislator to support a bill that they authored, she said.

Meeting with the lawmaker’s staff can be just as important as meeting with their boss, Zaffirini added.

“Staff is very important in the process because staff makes the recommendations regarding the bill,” she said. “So by working with a staff, [constituents] prepare the staff to be persuasive with a member.”

Testify at a public hearing: You can register through kiosks at the Capitol or online while using the Capitol Wi-Fi. In the Senate, you may have to fill out a card in person during the hearing to testify. You can find more tips on how to testify here.

During a special session, a Senate committee or subcommittee must post notice of a meeting at least 24 hours before the meeting, according to the state’s legislative guide. House committees or subcommittees must also typically post notice for a public hearing held during a special session at least 24 hours before, unless the rule is suspended by a vote of the members on the House floor.

It is more impactful to succinctly speak about your experience than it is to read written testimony or just cite facts, said Luke Metzger, the executive director of the advocacy group Environment Texas. But you can also submit written testimony or have someone else testify on your behalf.

It can take time for legislation to come up for discussion in a committee hearing, especially if a hearing is scheduled for after a chamber meets for floor debate, so it helps to be prepared to be at the Capitol for a while.

“Planning is critical, and typically plan to spend the day and stay overnight if necessary,” Zaffirini said. It can also help to communicate with staff if you need to leave by a certain time, she said.

Join an advocacy group: If you find an organization that is working on issues that matter to you, they can help you navigate and stay engaged in the legislative process. But it doesn’t take a well-funded organization, said Shera Eichler, a government affairs consultant and former chief of staff for a state representative.

“Maybe there’s a group of parents or a group of your neighbors that share the same common concerns, where you can all meet with the legislator together or send a letter together,” she said.

The outlook for the domestic solar industry has soured alongside the abrupt shift in federal energy policy this year. Nevertheless, some projects continue to slide through. A case in point is a the new 150-megawatt Santa Teresa solar power plant slated for construction in Doña Ana County, in New Mexico. The project is particularly interesting because it is yet another demonstration that the US solar industry can deliver more clean kilowatts, more quickly, than any other available energy resource.

More Clean Kilowatts, More Quickly

The new Santa Teresa project was okayed for construction to begin last week. Along with a 150-megawatt solar array, Santa Teresa includes a battery energy storage system of 600 megawatt-hours. If all goes according to plan, the whole system will be up and running before the end of 2026, which is just around the corner.

Electricity ratepayers in New Mexico won’t be the only ones to benefit from the new solar power project. Santa Teresa comes under the wing of the Texas utility El Paso Electric, which has about 465,000 customers spread out over an area that covers El Paso and other parts of Texas as well as New Mexico.

The 2026 timeline beats new gas power plants by a long shot. Despite efforts by the Trump administration to support more gas power plant construction, a shortage of turbines has contributed to construction delays stretching up to seven years for new gas projects in the US.

More Solar Power For Texas, From Global Investors

In addition to the speedy delivery of clean kilowatts, Santa Teresa is also of interest because it is an interstate electricity project, which is unusual for Texas. Unlike other states, Texas has largely walled itself off from the US regional grid system. With only a few minor exceptions, Texas is dependent on in-state resources, which substantially explains why Texas grid managers and policymakers have a long track record of supporting in-state wind and solar power projects.

That’s all in the past. Today’s Republican-dominated state legislature has the knives out for renewable energy. However, as the Santa Teresa project demonstrates, renewable energy from out-of-state can still trickle in here and there.

“This Project is about more than adding solar power — it’s about delivering lasting value to the communities and businesses we serve,” a spokesperson for El Paso Electric emphasized in a press statement announcing the go-ahead for the Santa Teresa project. “By providing clean energy and added capacity to the entire region, we’re strengthening reliability, supporting sustainability and investing in future economic development growth.”

Follow The Money To A New Solar Power Project

The leading renewable energy firm DESRI is the developer behind the Santa Teresa project, and that’s of interest as well. DESRI illustrates how and why the renewable energy transition is inevitable here in the US, despite recent efforts to prop up fossil power plants. US presidents come and go, but global investment firms can stick around for decades, and the US continues to be ripe territory for solar power investors.

DESRI comes under the umbrella of the DE Shaw Group, which describes itself as “a global investment and technology development firm with more than $60 billion in investment and committed capital as of September 1, 2024.” DE Shaw has offices in Europe and Asia as well as North America. All together, the firm has 70 solar and wind projects under its belt in various stages of development, totaling 9 gigawatts.

DESRI notes that the financing for the new solar power plant in New Mexico was provided by DNB Bank ASA, New York Branch, and National Bank of Canada acting as Joint Coordinating Lead Arrangers, along with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited, New York Branch, and Korea Development Bank. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas also supported the financing as Administrative Agent.

Who Needs Gas When You Have Solar Plus Storage, Plus Geothermal Energy?

The US solar industry lobbied long and hard to convince Republican leadership in Congress that solar power can fulfill the nation’s growing thirst for energy, in combination with energy storage systems. That went over like a lead balloon, but shrinkage in the domestic solar industry is not necessarily going to guarantee long term growth for gas producers in the US.

One fly in the ointment is geothermal energy. Geothermal power plants are currently confined to a few scattered locations in the US, but new systems are emerging to take advantage of geothermal resources in other regions of the US, too.

Although new ESG (Enhanced Geothermal Systems) technologies have yet to crack the mainstream market, they are right on the edge and the timeline is not doing any favors for gas stakeholders.

The US startup XGS, for example, has a two-phase, water-saving, 150-megawatt advanced geothermal project underway in New Mexico. Under a partnership with Meta, the project is expected to be fully operational by 2030. That’s around the same time gas stakeholders expect their projects to crank up to speed — if they can get their hands on the turbines, that is.

The 150-megawatt project is just for starters. A recent report estimates that New Mexico holds about 160 gigawatts worth of geothermal resources within its borders, and state officials are not in a mood to just sit there and twiddle their thumbs about it. In June, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham affirmed the state’s support for the XGS project, emphasizing the potential to attract more data centers to the state with zero-emission energy.

What Will Happen To Solar Power Now?

As for the US solar industry, under normal circumstances, the US Department of Defense could be relied upon to help support the market for solar power. After all, the Air Force in particular was an early adopter of solar during the Obama administration, attracted by the benefits of energy security and resiliency. Now that costs have dropped and the supply chain has matured, the national security case for solar power and other renewables is stronger than ever.

However, these are not normal times. A few modest USAF solar projects have popped up here and there in recent months, and the newly established Space Force has embarked on a solar research project, but today’s DoD is not exactly in hot pursuit of non-fossil fuels.

Again, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the field is clear for new gas power plants. Keep an eye on that geothermal industry. The Air Force recently prequalified a roster of geothermal firms to bid on new Defense Department contracts, with XGS among them.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-power-desri.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:37:08.837126

As the global push for decarbonization intensifies, a promising climate and energy partnership is emerging between India, Taiwan and South Korea — three democracies with complementary strengths, and shared goals and growing strategic interest. The combined efforts of the three could shape Asia’s green future.

India’s energy transition is gaining momentum. It aims for 500 gigawatt (GW) of non-fossil capacity by 2030 and net zero by 2070. Solar and wind are expanding, and more than 50 percent of power capacity now comes from non-fossil sources.

However, coal still dominates, so access to clean, affordable technology is essential to stay on track without slowing development.

Taiwan faces limits due to geography and geopolitics. Dependent on imported fossil fuels, it is investing in solar and offshore wind, while targeting net zero by 2050. A carbon pricing system will launch next year, starting with heavy emitters. Taiwan’s industrial base, especially in semiconductors and energy components, is vital to global supply chain decarbonization.

South Korea also pledges to be net zero by 2050. Seoul’s Korean New Deal promotes green hydrogen, smart grids and carbon-neutral manufacturing. Climate now features in its foreign policy as an economic strategy and soft power.

What links these nations is opportunity.

India brings scale and demand; Taiwan offers industrial know-how; and South Korea contributes innovation and finance. India needs solar technology and battery systems. Taiwan seeks energy diversification and new markets. South Korea looks for hydrogen partners and secure supply chains.

India wants to reduce reliance on Chinese solar imports. Companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co could support domestic manufacturing through joint ventures, helping India expand and giving Taiwan broader market access.

Offshore wind is another shared interest. Taiwan has established a strong regulatory framework and operational projects. South Korea aims for 12GW of offshore wind by 2030. India, with a lot of coastline, is at an early stage. Collaboration on research and development, training and pilot projects could support India’s development.

Hydrogen presents long-term potential. South Korea is investing in green and blue hydrogen, vehicles and export hubs. Taiwan could become a transshipment point for Australian hydrogen. India is building electrolyzer capacity through its National Green Hydrogen Mission. A trilateral effort could advance research, safety standards and cost reduction.

Smart grids and digital energy systems offer further synergy. Taiwan and South Korea are deploying artificial intelligence-based grid management, electric vehicle infrastructure and storage. India’s “One Sun, One World, One Grid” project promotes transnational solar links. Physical integration might not be feasible, but common standards and knowledge-sharing can boost energy resilience.

Finance remains a challenge. South Korea has tested green bonds and blended finance. Taiwan’s upcoming carbon market might inform India’s evolving platform. A trilateral dialogue could explore joint financing models to reduce investment risk and support clean energy growth.

Still, obstacles remain. Taiwan’s international status complicates formal agreements, especially with India, which adheres to the “one China” policy. India is cautious of foreign influence in energy policy and has avoided Just Energy Transition Partnerships — multilateral platforms between developed and emerging economies designed to deliver climate finance that supports developing countries.

South Korea’s regional ties add complexity.

Given the constraints, informal cooperation might be more feasible. Industry bodies, think tanks and universities could drive dialogue and joint research on solar manufacturing, hydrogen standards and green finance. Platforms such as the International Solar Alliance or Clean Energy Ministerial could support engagement without political friction.

For Taiwan, such efforts enhance visibility and energy security. For India, they offer industrial growth and technology access. For South Korea, they enable diversification beyond the US-China dynamic and improve long-term energy security.

In a world increasingly shaped by climate geopolitics, India, Taiwan and South Korea could chart a cooperative low-carbon path.

Indiana Emerges as Midwest Hub for Carbon Capture and Storage Development

By Richard McDonough, U.S. Correspondent

(P&GJ) — “Owing to the supply of CO2 from industrial sources, combined with the presence of multiple reservoirs and caprocks that meet the geological conditions required for injection and storage, Indiana has high potential as a candidate for CCS [carbon capture and storage] projects.”

This summary was one of the statements included in an overview of Carbon Sequestration in Indiana, in the April edition of the Indiana Journal of Earth Sciences. This overview was written by Valerie Beckman-Feller, Rachel Culver, Ashley Douds and Maria Mastalerz, members of the research staff at the Indiana Geological and Water Survey at Indiana University.

“Indiana has a large number of industrial and power facilities that could be suitable for carbon capture and storage under the right technical and economic conditions,” said Ryan Kammer, carbon management research manager at the Great Plains Institute. “Over 99% of CO2 emissions in the state are emitted by the 146 facilities that are eligible for the 45Q tax credit and span a number of industrial and power sectors, including cement, ethanol, and steel facilities, which have CO2 emissions intrinsic to their processes and will likely need carbon capture to fully decarbonize.”

According to a report from the Carbon Capture Coalition, the 45Q tax credit can be claimed when an eligible project has securely stored CO2 in appropriate geologic formations, including saline or other geologic formations or oil and gas fields. The credit can also be claimed when an eligible project has reused the captured CO2 or its precursor carbon monoxide (CO) as a feedstock, to produce low embodied carbon products such as fuels, chemicals and building materials.

These tax credits are an important aspect of CCS activities.

Much of Indiana also has potential for permanent storage in saline geologic formations, as evidenced by a number of Class VI well permits that are under review or already approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—the sixth highest number of any state.

Indiana state agencies and universities have also been a part of several Department of Energy-funded projects, one of which ultimately led to an approved Class VI permit, the third Class VI well to be approved by the EPA.

While technical and economic considerations will be required at the site level, the potential geologic storage available in Indiana could position Indiana as a leader in the Midwest for both carbon capture and carbon storage, Kammer added.

The Class VI permit referenced is a Final Permit issued to Wabash Carbon Services by the EPA, according to the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI Permit Tracker; this database was last updated on May 24.

Rulemaking Process

The rulemaking process is underway in Indiana for carbon sequestration projects. Comments are being considered for proposed rules by the Indiana Natural Resources Commission (NRC). The commission describes itself as “… an autonomous board that addresses issues pertaining to the [Indiana] Department of Natural Resources (DNR).”

Among the regulations being considered are ones for entities seeking to obtain a CO2 transmission pipeline certificate of authority, obtain a carbon sequestration project permit, administrative and procedural items regarding carbon sequestration projects and CO2 transmission pipelines, ongoing responsibilities of a storage operator, and records of a storage operator.

Rule 5, which is being considered by the commission, focuses on CO2 transmission pipelines.

A variety of requirements are included in this specific rule. For example, different levels of liability insurance would be required during the construction as well as during the operation of pipelines depending on the length of the pipelines.

“An applicant for a carbon dioxide transmission pipeline certificate of authority shall illustrate a financial ability to construct, operate and maintain a carbon dioxide transmission pipeline by giving the department documentation proving the applicant obtained the insurance required…” according to the proposed regulations.

For a pipeline not more than 20 mi in length, liability insurance would be required in the amounts of $700,000 for each person and $5 million for each occurrence.

For a pipeline longer than 20 mi in length, liability insurance would be required in the amounts of $700,000 for each person for the first 20 mi plus $12,500 for each additional mile or part of an additional mile for each person and $5 million for each occurrence for the first 20 miles plus $12,500 for each additional mile or part of an additional mile for each occurrence.

In addition to these amounts required, the proposed regulations would require an applicant for a CO2 transmission pipeline certificate of authority to maintain liability insurance while constructing, operating and maintaining a pipeline, including at least $1 million for each person and $5 million in the aggregate, as well as at least $1 million for each occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate.

The proposed regulations would require that the individual designated to manage the construction of a pipeline have minimum levels of education, experience and specific skills in pipeline design or construction, chemicals or refining.

According to the DNR, “No permits or certificates have been issued at this time by the DNR for either carbon sequestration or pipelines. After the first comment period concludes, DNR will publish a summary of the comments and responses to the summarized comments.”

The NRC indicated in a statement that it anticipates final rules will likely become effective in October of this year.

Hickory CCS Hub

Tenaska is involved in developing a CCS hub in Warren County, Indiana, which is located along the state’s border with Illinois and is west of Lafayette, Indiana. Tenaska, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska.

Currently, the Hickory CCS Hub is in early development in western Indiana and has had several discussions with Warren County leaders, as well as with neighbors of the proposed site, according to the company.

“We believe the proposed location has the appropriate geology to support the safe, long-term storage of CO2 — and we intend to prove this out with seismic surveys and related work in support of a Class VI application,” said Bryan Crabb, the Tenaska developer on the project. Right now, our team is focused on aligning the development schedule with customer needs and timelines.”

Permanent Storage

One of the firms most active in the CCS industry in Indiana is Vault 44.01.

The firm, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is focused on permanent geological storage of CO2 deep underground. Key members of Vault’s team have been involved in the design and implementation of CCS projects for more than 20 years, according to a statement from Vault, including projects currently operating in Illinois, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

“Our company works in partnership with industrial emitters across North America to develop CCS projects,” said Hugh Caperton, senior vice president Development of Vault. He added:

Vault is currently working with seven ethanol facilities across Indiana, Ohio and Illinois and expects to begin construction on our first project in early 2026, upon receiving approval from the EPA. We are also working with industrial partners in the power, hydrogen, forest products and cement sectors on earlier-stage CCS projects in the U.S. Midwest, U.S. Southeast and Canada.

He continued: “Vault is backed by a $300 million equity commitment from Grey Rock Investment Partners and invests alongside our industrial partners to bring CCS projects to fruition.” Grey Rock is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Currently, four CCS projects are in process by Vault in Indiana.

Though the firm declined to identify the specific locations in Indiana, publicly available documents indicate the locations as being in Madison County, Montgomery County, Randolph County and Wabash County.

“Since inception, Vault has focused on industrial facilities with high-purity CO2 emission streams that are proximal to viable geology for permanent sequestration,” said Caperton. “This focus on near-site sequestration opportunities, in-house technical expertise, commercial flexibility and a core initiative to educate and inform stakeholders has enabled Vault to secure seven contracted projects with ethanol producers, four of which are in Indiana.”

Vault expects to place the injection wells on the ethanol plant’s property, meaning there will be no pipeline. For the fourth project, Vault plans to construct a pipeline of 3.5 mi (5.6 km) to move the CO2 away from the town.

“Vault’s four initial projects represent about 1.2 mtpa of CO2 sequestration and we anticipate our first project will reach commercial operations in 2026 with the additional facilities following in 2027 and 2028, Caperton said. “Once completed, the projects will improve the competitiveness of our partners’ ethanol plants and enable them to access new markets, benefiting the biofuels and agricultural sectors in Indiana.”

The geology of Indiana is one of the key aspects that beckons the CCS industry to the Hoosier State.

“Indiana’s geologic environment is broadly sound for CO2 sequestration and its supportive regulatory environment creates substantial opportunity for in-state development of CCS projects for Indiana’s industrial base,” Caperton said. “Conversely, despite an excellent geologic resource in Illinois, recently passed state legislation is likely to hamper development of CCS projects in the near term.”

Governmental regulatory activities affect the development of CCS projects throughout North America. Caperton indicated that the regulatory environment is welcoming in Indiana.

Future growth is likely for the CCS industry in Indiana, according to Caperton.

“As ethanol producers and other industries look to increase competitive advantages, Indiana’s early leadership position via business-friendly legislation and opportunities for rural Americans creates a desirable roadmap for many industries, states, and local communities,” he said.

Indiana’s current legislation and rulemaking for CCS provides tools for industry and project developers to develop CCS projects, placing Indiana as a leader in the Midwest for CCS development, and according to Caperton, coupled with sound geology for sequestration, stands at the forefront for both near-site sequestration development and broader scale projects with associated pipelines.

Lastly, Utility-Led Community Solar will provide grants to local utilities to offer shared solar programs to low-income households.","Georgia BRIGHT is just weeks away from launching the first of several initiatives using obligated funding from the federal Solar for All program. Starting August 4, qualifying Georgia homeowners with an income at or below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) for their county and household size will be able to enter a drawing to receive one of approximately 400 fully prepaid solar leases with no upfront, monthly, or ongoing maintenance costs. A second drawing for 400 more systems will be held in the spring of 2026.

“The No-Cost Solar Plan delivers on Solar for All’s goal of making solar energy available to all households, especially those in underserved communities,” said Georgia BRIGHT Director Alicia Brown. “At a time when everything is getting more expensive, this program will deliver significant savings to the households that need it most.” In most cases, participants in this program will save between 50% and 70% on their electricity bill.

On Earth Day 2024, The Georgia BRIGHT Communities Coalition, including lead applicant Capital Good Fund, along with coalition member cities, Atlanta, Savannah, and Decatur and dozens of other Georgia stakeholders, was allocated $156 million from Solar for All to bring solar to thousands of households statewide between summer 2025 and mid-2029.

Other Georgia BRIGHT Solar for All programs are also in the works. Later this summer, Georgia BRIGHT will launch a second residential initiative, the Residential Solar Savings Plan. Qualifying households will receive custom solar installations at no upfront cost, with low monthly payments that guarantee day-one savings of at least 20%, net of monthly payments. Like the No-Cost Solar Plan, the residential lease includes all maintenance as well as the option for battery storage to ensure resilience against severe weather.

Next, Community Benefit Solar will provide a pathway for commercial properties like businesses, houses of worship, and apartment buildings to go solar, if they agree to share the financial benefits (i.e. grocery gift cards, utility assistance, discounted daycare, rental assistance, and more) generated with eligible community members for five years through. Lastly, Utility-Led Community Solar will provide grants to local utilities to offer shared solar programs to low-income households.

In addition to funding solar projects, the Solar for All funding will support programming like community outreach and education, workforce development, and “enabling upgrades,” or repairs needed before a home or commercial property can install solar.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/sports/georgia-bright.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-07-19 23:37:02.153921

The BP wind projects, already supplying power to 15 off-takers, provide immediate revenue visibility and a foundation for future growth.
As the U.S. races to meet its decarbonization goals, companies like LS Power will play a defining role.
The question is not whether renewable energy will prevail but which players will emerge as the sector's leaders.
Clearlight Energy, with its expanded footprint and strategic clarity, is poised to answer that question decisively.","The acquisition of BP's U.S. Onshore Wind Business by LS Power marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the renewable energy sector. By integrating 1,300 MW of operating wind capacity into its portfolio company, Clearlight Energy, LS Power has not only expanded its operational scale but also reinforced its position as a cornerstone of the U.S. clean power transition. This deal, which adds to Clearlight's existing 3,000 MW of wind and solar assets, underscores a strategic alignment with the accelerating demand for reliable, low-carbon energy in an era defined by AI-driven industrial growth and decarbonization mandates.

Strategic Rationale: Diversification and Scale

The BP acquisition is more than a transaction; it is a calculated move to diversify Clearlight Energy's geographic footprint and generation mix. The 10 wind assets—spanning seven states, including Indiana, Kansas, and South Dakota—offer a blend of mature, cash-generating projects and strategic locations adjacent to existing infrastructure. This diversification reduces exposure to regional market volatility and enhances grid reliability, a critical factor as data centers and AI hubs demand 24/7 clean power.

Moreover, the acquisition complements Clearlight's existing portfolio of solar, battery storage, and transmission assets. With LS Power's broader infrastructure network—over 21,000 MW of operating capacity and 780+ miles of high-voltage transmission lines—Clearlight is uniquely positioned to address the “last-mile” challenges of delivering renewable energy to high-demand corridors. The integration of BP's wind assets also accelerates the monetization of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, which favor projects with long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and grid connectivity.

Market Positioning: A Platform for Long-Term Growth

Clearlight Energy's post-acquisition capacity of 4,300 MW places it among the largest renewable operators in North America. This scale is not merely a function of size but of strategic intent. By acquiring operating assets with stable cash flows, LS Power avoids the risks associated with greenfield projects, which often face permitting delays and supply chain bottlenecks. The BP wind projects, already supplying power to 15 off-takers, provide immediate revenue visibility and a foundation for future growth.

The deal also strengthens LS Power's ability to compete in a rapidly evolving market. While solar and wind remain dominant, emerging technologies like green hydrogen and long-duration storage are gaining traction. Clearlight's expanded portfolio offers a platform to integrate these innovations, particularly in regions with high renewable potential. For instance, the South Dakota Titan project (25 MW) could serve as a testbed for hybrid systems combining wind with hydrogen production, leveraging the state's abundant land and low-cost transmission.

Regulatory and Policy Tailwinds

The U.S. clean power sector is being reshaped by policy frameworks that prioritize decarbonization. The IRA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and green bank initiatives have unlocked capital for projects like Clearlight's, while state-level mandates—such as 100% clean energy targets in 17 jurisdictions—create a predictable demand environment. LS Power's ability to leverage these policies is a key differentiator.

However, regulatory uncertainty looms, particularly under the Trump administration, which has signaled a reevaluation of federal incentives. Clearlight's focus on operating assets, which are less reliant on future policy shifts, provides a buffer against such risks. Additionally, the company's emphasis on transmission infrastructure—a historically underappreciated asset class—positions it to benefit from the growing need to connect remote renewables to urban centers.

Investment Implications

For investors, the acquisition represents a rare confluence of strategic execution and macroeconomic tailwinds. LS Power's disciplined approach—prioritizing high-quality assets with long-term PPAs and leveraging its operational expertise—reduces the typical volatility of renewable energy investments. The company's balance sheet, supported by a AAA credit rating, further enhances its ability to fund growth without diluting shareholder value.

A critical metric to monitor is the performance of LS Power's stock relative to broader energy transition indices. shows a steady upward trajectory, reflecting market confidence in its strategic direction. Investors should also track the deployment of IRA-funded projects under Clearlight's REV Renewables platform, which manages over 21 GW of development pipelines.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for the Energy Transition

LS Power's acquisition of BP's U.S. onshore wind business is more than a transaction—it is a blueprint for how large-scale infrastructure firms can navigate the complexities of the energy transition. By combining operational excellence, strategic diversification, and policy alignment, Clearlight Energy is not just participating in the renewable revolution; it is shaping its trajectory. For investors seeking exposure to the clean energy sector, this deal offers a compelling case study in how to build long-term value in an era of rapid change.

As the U.S. races to meet its decarbonization goals, companies like LS Power will play a defining role. The question is not whether renewable energy will prevail but which players will emerge as the sector's leaders.

In addition to slashing federal funding, the nearly 900-page bill eliminated the solar tax credit that homeowners could claim for installing solar panels on their properties.

Here’s what you need to know about the changes to the solar tax credit and how it’ll likely affect everyone — including those without solar panels.

What is the solar tax credit?

The solar tax credit, also known as the residential clean energy credit, reduces homeowners’ taxes if they install qualifying solar equipment. It essentially lets homeowners use money they would have paid in taxes to install solar energy systems. Taxpayers can claim up to 30% of the installation costs for new clean energy systems on their properties.

The incentive often makes the upfront costs of switching to renewable energy more affordable for homeowners, and it has saved Americans a lot of money. In fact, more than 1.2 million taxpayers claimed $6.3 billion with the residential energy tax credit during the 2023 tax year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Rooftop solar electricity systems represented 60% of those claims.

What’s changed for the solar tax credit?

The current version of the solar tax credit was introduced as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which continued a tax break for homeowners who installed solar panels through 2034. The IRS planned to phase out the credit starting in 2033 rather than end it abruptly.

However, Trump’s bill ends the solar tax credit on December 31, 2025 — cutting off nine years of potential savings for consumers who were considering certain renewable energy systems. The end-of-year deadline also drastically reduces the time people have to schedule qualifying installations.

Homeowners who want to claim the solar tax credit for the 2025 tax year need to make a financial transaction before the new December 31 deadline, says Hector Castaneda, a certified professional accountant and president of Castaneda CPA and Associates. That means either paying with cash or financing the purchase ahead of the deadline.

What this means for consumers

Ending the solar tax credit can have far-reaching ramifications for consumers — even those who never planned to switch to solar panels.

More expensive solar installations

The average installation costs for solar panels was $27,720 in early 2025, according to EnergySage, an online solar marketplace. The federal solar tax credit saved homeowners an average of $8,316, dropping the price to $19,404.

But anyone purchasing solar panels for their homes after 2025 will have to rely only on state-based incentives to save money. States vary in what incentives they offer, saving some residents money upfront with sales tax exemptions, or money over time with property tax exemptions. But even combined with local tax credits and rebates for solar installations, state incentives won’t make up for the thousands of dollars in savings homeowners will lose after 2025.

To complicate matters, solar panel costs were already becoming volatile before Trump rang the solar tax credit’s death knell. Tariffs on imported solar components and equipment began affecting the industry earlier this year, creating uncertainty about supply chain reliability and affordability.

Cal Morton, owner of EasTex Solar, a solar installer serving the East Texas region, says the tariffs kicked off a turbulent market for solar companies. “It was already the craziest year that I can think of,” Morton says.

Consumers quickly began to feel the effects of an unstable market. The average cost of residential solar energy systems increased 3% between the first quarters of 2024 and 2025, according to a June 2025 Wood Mackenzie report. Prices are likely to continue to rise, making the solar market more unsteady without the solar tax credit.

Longer payback periods for new systems

Homeowners who purchase solar panels without the benefits of the solar tax credit will likely pay a higher price tag. This translates to a longer gap between solar installation and breaking even with a system’s savings, also known as the payback period.

The average payback period for solar customers was just over seven years in early 2025, according to EnergySage. But homeowners in some areas were already looking at closer to 20 years before breaking even on their purchases. Price hikes and the loss of the tax credit will likely lengthen those payback periods.

Lease, PPA and battery trends

As homeowners back away from solar panel purchases, companies that offer leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are likely to become the major competitors, says Chris Hopper, co-founder and chief executive officer of Aurora Solar, a software platform that streamlines the solar array design process for installers.

Homeowners might be able to still save money after 2025 by leasing solar panels or entering a PPA before July 4, 2026, when solar companies’ tax credits change. These arrangements allow homeowners to generate solar energy without purchasing the equipment, while the companies that own the equipment receive a tax break. If a company passes on that tax break to the consumer, it can lower the overall cost of the system.

Additionally, the deadline changes don’t apply to solar battery purchases. Homeowners who purchase batteries to use as storage systems, such as pairing with a new or existing solar energy system, can claim a tax credit to offset up to 50% of the cost. The credit will begin to phase out in 2034 and end on December 31, 2035.

Less solar power and higher electricity bills

The elimination of the solar tax credit comes at the same time that the U.S. energy market is experiencing a growing demand for power, Hopper says. Solar energy has been helping with that demand. It was responsible for 69% of the new electricity-generating capacity that utility companies added to the U.S. power grid in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Wood Mackenzie report from June 2025.

Although commercial solar projects can continue to see tax benefits longer than residential systems, they tend to take longer to put into operation. The lengthy timeline means less solar energy production to support the growing need for more energy in the meantime.

Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank specializing in energy, climate research and policy analysis, estimates that the loss of that additional energy will raise the cost of electricity for consumers.

Janice DiPietro, chief integration and customer officer at ReVision Energy, a New England-based solar company, agrees. She cites the combination of new tariffs, the loss of the solar tax credit and the increased demand for power as primary factors.

“As a result, electricity rates will increase at a faster-than-average pace,” DiPietro said by email.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/solar-panels-e1752866077410.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-19 23:42:45.055160

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Game For investors, Talen's acquisition represents a rare convergence of macro trends and operational execution.","In the summer of 2025, Talen Energy Corporation made a bold move that underscores a seismic shift in the energy landscape. By acquiring two state-of-the-art natural gas combined-cycle power plants for $3.5 billion, Talen is positioning itself at the intersection of two of the most transformative forces in the global economy: the AI-driven digital revolution and the urgent need for reliable, high-capacity power infrastructure. This acquisition isn't just a bet on energy—it's a calculated alignment with the future of technology and the infrastructure that will fuel it.

The AI-Driven Energy Boom: A New Era of Demand

The exponential growth of AI and hyperscale data centers is reshaping electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers' global electricity consumption is projected to more than double by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for the lion's share of this surge. In the U.S. alone, data centers will drive nearly half of the country's electricity demand growth over the next seven years. The challenge? These facilities require constant, high-volume power—a requirement that renewables like solar and wind, despite their environmental benefits, cannot yet meet on their own.

Gas-fired power plants, with their ability to provide 24/7 baseload power at competitive costs, have emerged as the linchpin of this transition. In Louisiana, for instance, Entergy is investing $3.2 billion in gas plants to support Meta's AI data center, a project that will consume 2 gigawatts of power just for computation. Similar dynamics are playing out across the American South and Midwest, where utilities are prioritizing gas to meet the inflexible energy needs of AI infrastructure.

Talen's Strategic Play: Efficiency, Proximity, and Scalability

Talen's $3.5 billion acquisition of the Moxie Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and the Guernsey Power Station in Ohio is a masterclass in strategic positioning. These plants, part of Caithness Energy's portfolio, are among the most efficient combined-cycle facilities in the PJM Interconnection, a key regional grid operator. The Moxie plant (1,029 MW) and Guernsey (1,875 MW) are equipped with cutting-edge GE 7HA.02 turbines, allowing them to generate power at costs lower than most peers while emitting less CO2 per unit of energy.

What makes this acquisition particularly compelling is its geographic and operational alignment with AI demand. Both plants are located near major data center hubs and have access to abundant natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. This proximity reduces transmission losses and ensures a stable fuel supply—a critical advantage for data centers that cannot afford power interruptions. Moreover, the acquisition expands Talen's annual generation capacity from 40 to 60 terawatt-hours, directly addressing the surging demand from hyperscale operators and large commercial off-takers.

Financials and Strategic Rationale: A Recipe for Outperformance

Talen's management has been transparent about the acquisition's financial upside. The plants are expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow, with over 40% per-share growth in 2026 and more than 50% by 2029. This is no small feat in an industry where capex-heavy projects often take years to justify their costs. The acquisition also complements Talen's existing nuclear and fossil fuel portfolio, creating a diversified energy mix that balances reliability with scalability.

The timing of the deal is equally strategic. It coincides with a $92 billion government initiative to expand AI infrastructure in Pennsylvania, announced just days prior. This aligns Talen with both public and private sector momentum, as tech giants like Amazon and Google increasingly seek long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) to secure stable energy supplies. Talen's recent $650 million sale of a data center to Amazon, paired with its ability to power it via its Susquehanna Nuclear Plant, further demonstrates its unique value proposition: a hybrid energy provider capable of meeting the dual demands of reliability and sustainability.

Risks and the Road Ahead: Navigating the Transition

Critics will point to the environmental risks of gas-fired plants, including methane leaks and long-term carbon lock-in. However, Talen's management is not blind to these concerns. The company has emphasized its commitment to low-carbon solutions, leveraging its nuclear assets to offset the carbon intensity of its gas fleet. Additionally, the acquisition includes provisions for future investments in carbon capture and hydrogen integration—technologies that could extend the life of these plants while reducing their environmental footprint.

The financial structure of the deal also deserves scrutiny. Talen plans to fund the acquisition with $3.8 billion in new debt, raising leverage to 3.5x by 2026. While this increases short-term risk, the projected accretion to free cash flow and the long-term demand from AI data centers provide a strong buffer. The key will be managing debt while maintaining flexibility to adapt to regulatory shifts or technological breakthroughs in renewable energy.

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Game

For investors, Talen's acquisition represents a rare convergence of macro trends and operational execution. The company is not merely reacting to the AI boom—it is proactively building the infrastructure that will power it. Given the projected growth in data center demand, Talen's gas plants are likely to remain in high demand for the next decade, even as the energy transition accelerates.

The stock is currently undervalued relative to its peers, offering a compelling entry point for those with a multi-year horizon. While short-term volatility is possible due to regulatory or environmental policy risks, the long-term fundamentals are robust. Talen's ability to monetize its assets through PPAs with tech giants and utilities provides a stable revenue stream, while its hybrid energy model positions it to weather the transition to a lower-carbon grid.

Conclusion: Powering the Future, One Megawatt at a Time

Talen Energy's $3.5 billion acquisition is more than a financial transaction—it's a statement of intent. By investing in gas-fired plants that are strategically located, highly efficient, and aligned with the AI-driven energy boom, Talen is securing its role as a critical player in the next phase of the digital economy. For investors, this represents an opportunity to back a company that is not only adapting to change but actively shaping it.

In a world where the demand for data is limitless, the infrastructure to power it is the next frontier. And Talen, with its bold move in 2025, is leading the charge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:37:15.105612

A Mercedes-Benz USA spokesperson confirmed the decision and emphasized that the production halt only applies to U.S.-bound vehicles.
Notably, none of the EQ models were eligible for the credit unless leased—a factor that limited their competitiveness in the growing EV market.
A New Strategy: Electric Versions of Familiar Models Mercedes-Benz is now repositioning its EV efforts by moving away from standalone EQ branding.
At the same time, used EQ models have seen sharp price drops, offering compelling value for those open to buying pre-owned.","Mercedes-Benz is temporarily halting production and sales of its EQ-branded electric vehicles in the United States starting September 1, 2025. This move affects all variants of the EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs, including those built at the company’s Tuscaloosa, Alabama plant and imports from Germany.

The automaker has informed dealers that order books for these models are now closed. Vehicles already scheduled for production before the September 1 deadline will still be built and delivered. A Mercedes-Benz USA spokesperson confirmed the decision and emphasized that the production halt only applies to U.S.-bound vehicles.

End of EV Tax Credits a Major Factor

The pause comes as the U.S. prepares to end its federal EV tax credit program on September 30, following new legislation passed under President Donald Trump’s budget plan. Notably, none of the EQ models were eligible for the credit unless leased—a factor that limited their competitiveness in the growing EV market.

Industry analysts expect a dip in electric vehicle sales once the incentives expire, particularly for higher-end models like the EQ lineup, which were already under pressure from more affordable and better-incentivized competitors.

EQ Lineup Struggles to Find Footing in the U.S.

Despite being technological showcases for the brand, the EQE and EQS struggled to resonate with American consumers. Sales of the EQS sedan and SUV dropped 52% in 2024 compared to the previous year. Feedback often centered around their divisive, streamlined styling and interiors that failed to match the luxury feel of their gasoline counterparts like the E-Class and S-Class.

Even Mercedes executives have acknowledged that the designs didn’t carry the signature Mercedes-Benz gravitas. The EQ cars, while efficient and packed with features, seemed disconnected from the brand’s core identity.

A New Strategy: Electric Versions of Familiar Models

Mercedes-Benz is now repositioning its EV efforts by moving away from standalone EQ branding. Future electric offerings will be integrated into existing model lines, reflecting a shift in design and strategy.

The upcoming electric CLA sedan and wagon, as well as a new electric GLC SUV, are expected to embody this approach. Mercedes also recently teased an electric version of the iconic G-Class, which will retain the brand’s signature look and feel while going fully electric.

“Local-for-Local” Production Flexibility Still Key

Despite the pause, Mercedes-Benz says its commitment to U.S. manufacturing remains unchanged. The company continues to rely on its flexible global production network and local-for-local manufacturing model to respond to evolving market conditions.

Final Chance for EQ Buyers?

If you’ve been considering buying a new EQE or EQS, this might be your last opportunity—at least for the foreseeable future. With the production window closing and tax credits expiring, the remaining models could soon become rare finds.

At the same time, used EQ models have seen sharp price drops, offering compelling value for those open to buying pre-owned.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0188.jpeg,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:02.785884

David McCormick this week in Pittsburgh, a state lawmaker is proposing faster permitting for data centers.

State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, R-Washington, is drafting legislation to ensure accelerated permits for data center projects that commit to equal, or higher, environmental performance. Her co-sponsorship memorandum was introduced Thursday in the state Senate, with companion legislation to be introduced in the state House of Representatives. Several Republican House members have already agreed to sponsor the House version of the bill.

“The path is clear, better environmental outcomes can be achieved when developers are empowered to innovate, design and implement advanced techniques to increase field performance,” Bartolotta wrote in her co-sponsorship memorandum. “Engineers, and artificial intelligence, can pre-determine specific air emissions generated from multiple sized power plants. If engineering stamps and site designs meet or exceed federal limits, there is no need to wait for a multi-year DEP review.”

Bartolotta’s push is being prompted by Tuesday’s summit focusing on energy and innovation in Pittsburgh helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick and attended by President Donald Trump. The summit included dozens of top executives from companies aiming to make the city and the state a hot spot for advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. McCormick announced more than $90 billion of investments in the state — spurring tens of thousands of jobs — although some of the projects had already been in progress ahead of the summit.

“I think we have a true golden age for America. And we’ve been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, according to the Associated Press. “I’m honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I’m honored to be in Pittsburgh. And you’re going to see some real action here. So get ready.”

Both the president and senior administration officials on Tuesday framed the investments as part of a race against China for the most advanced deployment of artificial intelligence. Before Trump spoke, his Cabinet members spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the AI race for the sake of economic and national security.

“The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an earlier panel discussion, according to the Associated Press. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.”

Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand-new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects — such as a $15 billion project in central Pennsylvania — while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks.

Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus., Constellation Energy is reopening the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for Microsoft’s data centers.

Bartolotta’s bill will direct the state Department of Environmental Protection to generate approved earthwork, stormwater and air permits to developers who commit to improved environmental outcomes by meeting, or exceeding, design standards. An accelerated permit will enable simultaneous pursuit of additional permits and processes like Highway Occupancy Permits, Environmental Justice Permits, land use approvals and other complicated hurdles in an effort to speed up project approval. If a lawsuit is filed challenging an aspect of a data center project, the associated permit timelines shall be suspended during the legal dispute to ensure permits do not expire because of extended lawfare – something Bartolotta said has led to abandoned projects in the state.

“We need to be faster,” she said.

The Grizzl-E Club introduces a charger-as-a-service model that includes a free Grizzl-E charger, lifetime warranty support, and cash rewards for EV charging.

United said Grizzl-E Club member benefits include:

A free Grizzl-E EV charger;

First year of membership free (valued at $120);

$0.03 cashback per kilowatt-hour of energy delivered;

Lifetime warranty coverage.

In addition to lifetime product support, members gain access to a carbon rebate program. With this, users earn 3 cents per kilowatt-hour charged, which can go toward renewing their membership, purchasing new products, or converting to cash.

Drivers averaging 2,000 kilometers (approx. 1,200 miles) or more per month in all-electric driving can fully offset the annual membership cost using this rebate.

But those incentives are going away now that President Trump signed what he's called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" into law on July 4.

That means in the coming months there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get these government incentives, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America.

""If you want to access them, then really you need to get going,"" he says.

Here's what you need to know about what's happening to federal tax incentives for everything from solar panels to heat pumps to electric vehicles, and how much time you have to get that federal money.

Home solar tax credits end Dec. 31

The country's first major climate policy under the Biden administration secured at least a decade of federal tax incentives for rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, says Sean Gallagher, vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association.

These technologies not only reduce climate pollution, they also make energy bills more affordable.

Scientists say that solar energy plus batteries, as well as energy-efficient appliances, are all reliable technologies that can save households money. Despite the evidence, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote in an email to NPR, ""Instead of subsidizing unreliable energy sources at the expense of hardworking taxpayers, President Trump is unleashing American energy to lower costs to provide further relief for businesses and families.""

The tax credit meant homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of installation or equipment. That tax incentive goes away Dec. 31.

Matusiak suggests that people sign a contract with a contractor and pay for and install the project before the end of the calendar year so that they can secure their eligibility for the tax credit.

Solar project installation can take a few months and some contractors can have long wait times. That's why he suggests talking to a contractor as soon as possible.

Another incentive for heat pumps and insulation ends Dec. 31

In addition to the 30% off investments in things like home solar, a federal incentive called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit will also disappear later this year.

That credit meant up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers on your tax bill. To qualify, appliances must have a high efficiency rating. Some manufacturer websites list tax credit-eligible equipment, as does the Energy Star Product Finder.

The tax credit also offered up to $1,200 off home upgrades like new insulation, doors and windows.

To qualify for this tax credit, it's not enough to just purchase the equipment. They must be ""placed in service"" during the calendar year — another reason Matusiak suggests moving quickly.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles end Sept. 30

Currently, some electric vehicle buyers are eligible for a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for buying or leasing a new EV, and up to $4,000 for a used vehicle. That money is available as a cash rebate at the time of purchase and can be used as a down payment. (Not every buyer and not every vehicle qualifies. You can read more about these credits here.)

The new law ends those credits after Sept. 30, over the protests of auto dealers, who said such a rapid change will be disruptive. Rogers at the White House wrote in an email to NPR that ending the tax incentives will ""lower costs and incentivize Made in America products.""

Dealers are now scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. ""But, of course, that will go away when prices effectively go up when the rebate ends.""

The nonprofit research group Resources for the Future says that its modeling suggests EV sales as a share of the total U.S. market could contract by a third with the end of the credits.

That doesn't mean the end of the EV industry, analysts say. ""Automakers have spent literally billions of dollars building out supply chains,"" says Joseph Yoon of the auto data company Edmunds. ""I don't think it's just going to turn around and say, 'Oh, well, that was a fun little experiment.'"" But it could significantly reduce the pace of EV adoption and, as a result, lock in decades worth of future carbon pollution from the gas-powered vehicles being sold today.

EV tax credits do boost EV sales, but they require a high government expenditure for each additional sale they encourage; some economic research has suggested that putting money toward chargers is a more cost-effective policy approach. The Trump administration has been working to roll back charger funding, too.

The tax-and-spending package will end a credit available to businesses and individuals to help with the costs of installing EV chargers, specifically in low-income or rural areas. That credit, which covers 30% of the installation cost, will end June 30, 2026. Separately, the Trump administration has also frozen funding to build high-speed EV chargers on highways, a move that some states are currently challenging in court.

There's still money available from some states and utilities, for now

Some local utility companies offer incentives for technologies like heat pumps, residential solar, or insulation, so experts suggest checking in with your local utility.

The country's major climate legislation in 2022 gave more than $8.5 billion to states, including Arizona, Georgia, New York and Wisconsin, to help them expand or establish rebate programs for home green technology upgrades. Much of that money is still available.

Rewiring America and another nonprofit called The Switch is On have online tools that can help people, in most states, plug in their ZIP codes and incomes to search for the federal, state, local and utility company incentives for which they're qualified. Consumers can also check for incentives at an online database from the N.C.

This week, the focus is on Sugar Creek Lavender farm, a female-owned, family-run lavender farm north of Lebanon.

At Sugar Creek Lavender Farm, the Lavender family — yes, that’s their real last name! — plants, harvests, and makes products with lavender.

“We started it four years ago,” owner Traci Lavender told News 8’s Daybreak. “My family and I…had an extra acre and we wanted to do something with that acre, so we went with lavender. My husband read about it in a hobby farming magazine and he’s like, ‘I think we can do this, you know?’”

While the farm is not yet open to the public, the Lavender family hopes to offer you-pick sessions, photo shoots, yoga classes, and tours in about two years.

In the meantime, lavender lovers can enjoy a “Learning About Lavender” presentation, sip something sweet at a Lavender Tea Tasting, or sign up for a “Make & Take” class to create their own lavender sugar scrub or lavender Play-Doh.

Sugar Creek Lavender Farm sells a number of lavender-based items on its website, including sugar scrub, body butter, eye pillows, linen spray, dryer bags, and tea blends.

“We also have the baking sugar. You can mix it in coffee or tea or lemonade, but you can also bake with it. I make scones with it, or tea breads,” Lavender explained. “We also have dryer bags. A lot of people don’t like to use lavender because there’s lots of chemicals in some of the dryer sheets. I was reading that people are using lavender, so we have four bags in there that are equivalent to 40 loads of laundry.”

If you’d rather do your shopping in person, several central Indiana shops carry the farm’s products: Indiana Gifts and Tru-Finds Treasures in Lebanon, Shop Small, Shop Handmade in Crawfordsville, and Possibilities: Homes Re-Imagined in Franklin.

This plan follows efforts by other firms, many from Gulf countries, to sign agreements to strengthen Syria’s energy and port infrastructure.
After 14 years of war, Syria’s electricity sector has been severely damaged and currently produces only 1.6 gigawatts of power compared to 9.5 GW before 2011.
In May, Syria signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatari company UCC Holding to develop power projects worth $7 billion, including four combined cycle power plants and a 1,000 MW solar power plant in southern Syria.
In a LinkedIn post on July 17, Syrian Finance Minister Yisr Barnieh announced that three American companies are forming a coalition to invest in Syria and develop the country’s energy sector.","Jonathan Bass, CEO of Argent LNG, announced on July 18 that Hunt Energy, Baker Hughes, and Argent LNG will develop a master plan for the development of Syria’s oil, gas, and energy sectors as part of a partnership aimed at restoring the energy infrastructure devastated by 14 years of civil war.

According to Reuters, this move marks a rapid shift as American companies enter a market previously subject to one of the world’s strictest sanctions regimes, lifted by former US President Donald Trump.

The companies plan to engage in exploration and production of oil and gas, as well as electricity generation to support the economy, as the Syrian government seeks to reintegrate the country into the global arena. This plan follows efforts by other firms, many from Gulf countries, to sign agreements to strengthen Syria’s energy and port infrastructure.

“We are initiating the development of a comprehensive masterplan for energy and power generation in Syria, based on a preliminary assessment of opportunities for near-term improvements in generation capacity and service delivery,” Bass told the agency by phone.

“This includes potential activities across the value chain—from exploration and production to electricity generation, including combined-cycle power plants,” he added, declining to provide further details.

After 14 years of war, Syria’s electricity sector has been severely damaged and currently produces only 1.6 gigawatts of power compared to 9.5 GW before 2011. Restoring the sector requires billions of dollars in investment, and the cash-strapped state is seeking private investors or donors to cover costs.

In May, Syria signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatari company UCC Holding to develop power projects worth $7 billion, including four combined cycle power plants and a 1,000 MW solar power plant in southern Syria.

EV sales are at a record high, while combustion vehicle sales continue to fall.","With recent good news about EVs, we have every right to feel optimistic.

We’re ready to celebrate a tipping point for the dominance of gas cars on the road — as current vehicles are removed from service and the comfort zone with EVs increases, the goal of 30% new EV sales is within reach in Colorado and Washington State by 2026.

Used EVs are forecast to rebuild their resale value, contributing to a more robust EV marketplace.

The average transaction price of a new EV in the US has gone down by 7.4% since January 2023.

EVs have even increased utility revenues more than they have increased utility costs, leading to downward pressure on electric rates for EV-owners and non-EV owners alike.

Clearly, the transition to electric mobility contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution, which is also beneficial for public health and helps to reduce fossil energy consumption. Then why does the future for EVs so tenuous?

Barriers continue to exist that hinder mass consumer understanding and acceptance of EVs, brought to you in the US by Project 2025.

Why EVs are on the Rise in Europe

The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accounts for nearly 45% of global oil demand, primarily due to the widespread use of internal combustion engine vehicles. Passenger cars account for nearly three-quarters of the sector’s emissions.

A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of all major powertrain types, reinforces earlier findings: only battery electric cars can deliver the large-scale emission cuts needed to address Europe’s most polluting transport mode. The study calculates that battery electric cars sold today in Europe emit nearly four times less GHGs over their lifetime than gasoline cars.

The ICCT research reveals that battery electric cars sold today produce 73% less life-cycle GHG emissions than their gasoline counterparts — even when factoring in production. The result is a 24% improvement over original 2021 estimates. In contrast, other powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, show only marginal or no progress in reducing their climate impacts.

That means Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and, with it, the climate advantage of EVs is growing.

Of course, that data emerges from the European automotive marketplace.

US News about EVs Continues to Be Skeptical

Policy support for EVs in the US has changed significantly over the last year. Significantly, elements of the Inflation Reduction Act are being removed or threatened, and California’s ability to set its own emissions standards is weaker than it has been in the last 30 years.

Most debilitating is the sweeping tax and budget legislation approved by the US Congress that will eliminate $7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and a $4,000 used-EV credit by September 30. Those incentives sparked EV sales in recent years, and it will take savvy automobile consumers to take advantage of the credit before it expires. US businesses will suffer as well, since providing production tax credits and then pulling them so quickly afterward infuses instability into the marketplace — factories require incredible amounts of long-term planning and capital investment.

“Throwing that work and investment into the trash will make companies question whether to take a risk in the States again,” muses CleanTechnica editor, Zachary Shahan. “The US is becoming a less predictable, less stable, less trustworthy market for businesses with these coming changes, especially in the EV and solar power sectors.”

So, on one hand, it’s hard to celebrate that, by the end of 2023, thirteen states and Washington, DC had accrued more than 10% of auto sales as electric.

Then again, hope springs eternal.

EVs now draw upon numerous technological advancements made possible over the last decade.

Emissions reduction is a powerful mechanism that is increasingly informing consumer attitudes about and perceptions toward EVs.

The potential impact of the total cost of ownership (TCO) has become an important factor for consumers as they consider an EV for their next vehicle.

EVs technologies and business models are reshaping market structures, technological paradigms, and consumer behavior while markedly reducing environmental impact.

A Clash of Interests in the Automotive Marketplace

Fossil fuel interests, however, continue to loom heavily in the automotive futures background. Differences between efficient prices and retail fuel prices are large and pervasive, says the IMF. For example, 80% of global coal consumption was priced at below half of its efficient level in 2022. Full fossil fuel price reform could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to an estimated 43% below baseline levels in 2030 (in line with keeping global warming to 1.5-2oC), while raising revenues worth 3.6% of global GDP and preventing 1.6 million local air pollution deaths per year.

Of course, the global political will to promote such fossil fuel price reform is nearly nil. Fossil fuel subsidies were $7 trillion in 2022, or 7.1% of GDP. Explicit subsidies (undercharging for supply costs) have more than doubled since 2020 but comprise only 18% of the total subsidy — 60% is due to undercharging for global warming and local air pollution.

As CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley outlines, the Trump administration has freed manufacturers to build cars and trucks that spew more fine particulates, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in their wake. Fracking companies no longer have to worry about turning aquifers into toxic waste because the US has an “energy emergency, which has given the fossil fuel companies a license to run roughshod over any and all environmental restrictions.”

EV adoption rates are influenced by a wide range of factors, including individual level demographics, attitudes, lifestyle preferences, perceptions of EVs capabilities, and infrastructure availability. Military action in the Middle East artificially heightens oil prices, trickling down — as always — to the consumer. High gas prices continues to spark EV consumer interest. Such global confluences have led recent EV analysts to point to five themes evolving for EVs for the remainder of 2025.

EV sales are at a record high, while combustion vehicle sales continue to fall.

EVs are increasingly global.

Low cost charging is a key enabler.

Battery innovation is making EVs increasingly desirable. Leading batteries can charge more than halfway in five minutes, and more progress could be on the horizon with safer long-range solid-state chemistries.

EVs are reducing oil demand at an exponential rate.

More and more charging points are being built, with localized mixes of home, workplace, and public chargers.

Electric buses, trucks, and freight handling equipment have proven to be less expensive to operate and maintain compared to traditional diesel-powered equipment.

The US may seem to be slipping backwards with transportation electrification, but the rest of the world has recognized the benefits of electric power and is embracing the transition to electric vehicles. The EV revolution is happening, with or without the US.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EV-charging-in-city-garage.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:12.303139

China has imposed export restrictions on technologies critical for electric-vehicle battery production to strengthen its global market dominance. The restrictions require a government license for overseas transfers of technologies used in battery manufacturing and lithium processing. The move has created uncertainty for Chinese EV makers' expansion plans, especially in light of tariffs from the EU.

Line 5 stretches from Northwestern Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario, including a 4.5 mile stretch on the lakebed where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. The pipeline transports more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the Great Lakes daily, raising concerns amongst environmental advocates, who warn that an oil spill would carry catastrophic consequences.

Enbridge identified gaps in the pipelines protective coating in 2014, and the pipeline was later dented in three places by an anchor strike in 2018. The pipeline company later reached an agreement with the state to consolidate the dual pipelines currently operating in the Straits of Mackinac into a new segment housed in a concrete-lined tunnel and buried below the lakebed, in hopes of containing any potential oil spills.

In order to move forward with the project, Enbridge needs approval from three agencies, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

While EGLE and the Public Service Commission have both approved permits for the project, a 2024 settlement between Enbridge, EGLE and the Bay Mills Indian Community requires the company to redo its water resources permit using the results of new wetlands surveys.

EGLE opened public comment on the company’s revamped wetlands protection and Great Lakes Submerged Lands permits on July 17, with the comment period to remain open through Aug. 29, 2025.

The department will also host two meetings throughout the public notice period: an information session on Aug. 12 in a Q&A format regarding the application and EGLE’s review process and a formal public hearing on Aug. 19, where comments will be taken for the record. Additional comments can be submitted online.

During this period EGLE said it would review the application and information provided by the applicant, collect and consider public comments, continue tribal consultations and continue coordinating with other agencies and partners.

During the public notice period, EGLE said it’s common for the department to request applicants to consider additional modifications to the project and provide additional information in response to the ongoing review and in coordination with other state agencies and parties.

“Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed,” Enbridge Spokesperson Ryan Duffy said in an email.

“We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions,” he said.

As EGLE opens public comment on the permits, members of the National Wildlife Federation are demanding the department conduct a full review of Enbridge’s proposed drilling area as required by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act, pointing to concerns of tunnel collapse, explosion and pollution during the construction of the Line 5 tunnel.

“The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is in place to safeguard the Great Lakes and our natural resources from unnecessary projects that cause harm,” Beth Wallace, the federation’s Great Lakes climate and energy director said in a statement. “Any attempt to shortcut or narrow their review will only benefit the interest of big oil, could open a wide door for other extractive industries, and would undermine the legal standards meant to protect our public waters.”

Once envisioned as a centerpiece of the state’s coastal defense strategy, the multibillion-dollar effort to reconnect the Mississippi River to its eroding wetlands will now be replaced by a scaled-down approach.

“The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, in its current form, is no longer financially or practically viable,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement. “Since 2016, the cost of this project has doubled and is now expected to exceed the over $2 billion budget. This level of spending is unsustainable.”

The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority has reached an agreement with federal trustees to formally end the project.

As part of the termination process, the project’s authorized budget has been slashed from $2.26 billion to $618.5 million, representing funds already distributed. Those dollars can now only be used to close out the project, according to a resolution signed by the Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group.

CPRA had been leading construction of the diversion and served as the lead implementing trustee for the project under the Natural Resource Damage Assessment program tied to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Federal officials said CPRA’s decision was driven by a mix of legal hurdles, including the suspension of a key permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and ongoing litigation.

Originally approved for funding in 2023, the diversion was meant to rebuild marsh in Plaquemines Parish by diverting sediment-rich water from the Mississippi River into the Barataria Basin.

However, critics argued it would devastate the region’s fisheries by flooding estuaries with fresh water and altering salinity levels vital to shrimp, oysters, and other marine life.

“Beyond the financial concerns, the MBSD threatens Louisiana’s seafood industry, our coastal culture, and the livelihoods of our fishermen — people who have sustained our state for generations,” Landry said. “We cannot continue down this broken path.”

Instead, state officials are eyeing a return to a smaller, earlier version of the project known as Myrtle Grove. That plan envisions a diversion about a quarter the size of the Mid-Barataria proposal, and CPRA has budgeted $1.6 million for its development in the agency’s 2026 annual plan.

The state also plans to construct a large land bridge in the Barataria Basin using dredged sediment, a technique seen as more compatible with existing fisheries and less dependent on uncertain long-term modeling.

“CPRA is now moving forward with another coastal restoration plan — one that balances our environmental goals with the needs of all citizens, businesses, and industries,” Landry said.

A final budget reconciliation will be prepared by CPRA and NOAA, and any remaining funds from the Mid-Barataria project will be made available for future restoration work in Louisiana.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/51/9511e101-c734-4475-84e9-3d63a2abdd89/687a936f6ec53.image.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:46:21.699611

American energy dominance is a phrase we hear often, one we like, and with the right strategy, it is achievable. The strategy in short: America should innovate, make energy here, and sell it globally. To counter China and achieve this dominance, we have to embrace what America already does well—innovate and build—and what we need to do better: permit energy projects and sell globally.

Innovate

America has led the world with the greatest breakthroughs in energy technology. In the 1880s, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was followed by power stations and power lines. In the 1940s, as part of the Manhattan Project, American innovators generated energy from nuclear fission. The hydraulic fracturing success story began with a breakthrough by a Texas entrepreneur in the 1970s, research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) efforts supported by the Department of Energy (DOE), and tax incentives.

Home to 17 national labs, America is the world’s innovation leader. Partnering with amazing private sector developers to commercialize technology and academic institutions that are training some of the best and brightest, and the next generation of energy technology will continue to be developed in the United States, something we should never cede.

Breakthroughs for small modular nuclear reactors, fusion energy, energy storage technologies, enhanced geothermal, and more ways to capture carbon dioxide are extremely close to wide-scale deployment.

But getting these world-class technologies built and commercialized requires federal policy support. You literally can’t untangle government policy and investment with energy—you just can’t. Oil production had accelerated depreciation, and natural gas received production tax credits and US DOE support. The new technologies that make our grid more affordable, reliable, and clean need similar support.

The current DOE, the largest public financier for energy projects, is reevaluating the way it gives loans to and awards projects based on goals and economic viability rather than agendas. And Congress just gave President Donald Trump One Big Beautiful Bill with key tax incentives that allow private sector energy developers to build more.

At ClearPath, we are conservatives who believe in markets over mandates, and successful energy developers must be able to stand on their own two feet. But developing new energy technology isn’t like creating a new app for your iPhone or software in your garage. It’s capital-intensive, requiring lots of gear, concrete, steel and land. There’s an appropriate role for the federal government in supporting these innovations in the early stage, funding for demonstrations, and smart tax incentives to help companies scale from idea to deployment, just like America’s natural gas industry.

Make it Here

Yet, getting the innovation and financing in a better place doesn’t mean projects will be built—America has a world-class apparatus for getting in the way. Today, it takes longer to get an energy permit than it does to earn a college degree. The current permitting system has become a tangled mess across different federal regulatory bodies, state and local governments, and mountains of litigation. There is a big opportunity for Congress to look at how the United States currently operates its permitting system so we can continue to meet rising energy demand while complying with all laws and environmental standards.

In the administration’s energy dominance agenda, they have pushed for expedited permitting and identified permit by rule as a potential solution. That is a good first step, but for a durable solution that lets America build now and well into the future, there will need to be a change in law.

Sell it Globally

Now, let’s imagine we continue our innovation dominance, and we make it simpler for energy to be built. We can drive down costs for American consumers, but what about global energy dominance?

Without a holistic federal strategy, America would not only give China the upper hand, but we could also fritter away trillions of dollars already invested.

China’s strategy includes nuclear, oil and gas infrastructure, coal, renewable energy projects, critical minerals, and others that entrench reliance on their state-backed enterprises. In 2024, China started construction on about 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity, nearly the same as America’s entire nuclear fleet. China also invested $940 billion in clean energy in 2024.

While we won’t, and shouldn’t out-subsidize the Chinese, America has the tools to compete. We just need to use them more effectively.

Right now, the US Development Finance Corporation makes money for the US taxpayer but can only provide up to $1 billion in loans and only $60 billion in total, compared to China’s nearly unlimited state financing. For example, raising these caps would allow the United States to finance bigger projects, like nuclear plants and critical minerals infrastructure.

There is also an opportunity to give the Export-Import Bank (EXIM) a strategic upgrade. EXIM’s existing China and Transformational Exports Program (CTEP) prioritizes strategic projects in areas where Beijing is expanding its reach, but it is overly prescriptive in scope. Creating a National Interest Account would allow EXIM to expand this effort to compete against more countries, such as Russia, in more technologies, such as nuclear energy.

Raising EXIM’s restrictive default rate cap on project financing would put US companies on a stronger competitive footing with Chinese and Russian state-owned firms, and strengthening EXIM’s support for domestic energy manufacturing could boost US supply chains.

As we embrace an energy dominance agenda, the US strategy needs to embrace our innovation engine, let American companies build, and acknowledge today’s geopolitical realities, ensuring American energy producers are competitive in the global market.

One rule, that the Trump administration is exempting about 50 polluters from, would have been expected to reduce cancer risks of people living within 6 miles of a chemical plant by 96 percent.
The Trump administration touted its decision as being supportive of fossil fuels and manufacturing.

On Thursday, the White House announced that it would exempt more than 100 plants from pollution limits established by the Biden administration.

The limits are aimed at reducing the releases of toxic chemicals, including those that cause cancer. One rule, that the Trump administration is exempting about 50 polluters from, would have been expected to reduce cancer risks of people living within 6 miles of a chemical plant by 96 percent.

The Trump administration touted its decision as being supportive of fossil fuels and manufacturing.

“President Trump recognizes that overly restrictive environmental regulations undermine America’s energy reliability, economic vitality, and national security,” said a White House fact sheet.

However, the move also stands in contrast with the administration’s pledge to “Make America Healthy Again.”

“Trump’s action on behalf of big corporate polluters will cause more cancer, more birth defects, and more children to suffer asthma. The country deserves better,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of litigation at Earthjustice’s Healthy Communities Program, in a written statement.

The administration issued four proclamations exempting the total of more than 100 facilities from one of four rules for two years.

One proclamation exempts about 40 medical device sterilizing plants from requirements to reduce 90 percent of their emissions of cancer-causing ethylene oxide.

Another exempts more than 50 chemical manufacturers and oil refineries from requirements to cut emissions of toxic chemicals including ethylene oxide and another cancer-linked chemical called chloroprene.

A third proclamation exempts eight producers of taconite ore, which is used to make steel, from requirements to reduce mercury emissions by about 33 percent. Fetal exposure to mercury is linked to brain and nervous system damage.

The fourth proclamation exempts six coal plants from restrictions on releases of mercury, nickel, arsenic and lead. The Biden-era rule in question was expected to reduce exposure to substances that can cause developmental delays in children, as well as heart attacks and cancer.

The Trump administration has already said that it plans to overturn a wide swath of rules aimed at reducing pollution, and so by the time the two-year exemptions expire, the rules in question may no longer be in place.

This week’s proclamations are the second publicly announced set of exemptions issued by the Trump administration.

Trump previously exempted 66 coal plants from the standard limiting mercury, lead, nickel and arsenic emissions.

The decisions come after a March move from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set up a portal allowing polluters to request exemptions from nine Clean Air Act rules.

At the time, an EPA spokesperson noted that the Biden administration had previously said it would consider exempting facilities from the ethylene oxide rule to prevent disruptions to supply chains for medical devices.

However, critics described the portal as an “invitation” for companies to pollute.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/07/epa_020325gn06_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-19 23:45:01.168290

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries’ long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam’s Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they’ve gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia’s growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia’s sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail

renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace–making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG

math doesn’t add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they’re unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out … But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.lockhaven.com/images/2025/07/18110235/AP25190256970594-753x500.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:46:58.607289

As per Bloomberg, the $200 million facility, located in Soperton, Georgia, was initially scheduled to begin production last year.

Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Samartzis confirmed the revised timeline in an interview, attributing the most recent delay to equipment issues not related to the core technology. “My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating,” he said.

Advt

“The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need.”

Funding and regulatory hurdles

LanzaJet received funding from the US government to develop the plant, which is being watched as a test case for the broader ethanol-to-jet fuel sector.

Although the company imported Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol in 2023 to pilot production, it has not yet sold any of its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the open market.

Production will begin using Brazilian ethanol, despite the company being ineligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Z tax credit.

Under current rules, only SAF made from North American feedstocks qualifies, and the ethanol must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent. Most US corn-based ethanol does not meet this threshold.

“There is only a scant amount of US product that meets the required threshold,” Samartzis said. He added that LanzaJet plans to transition to American feedstocks and is advocating for a lower emissions-reduction requirement of 30 per cent.

(For a comprehensive analysis of the bill, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Trump Signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 3, 2025.) Although few provisions directly reference Tribal governments or their members, several could impact Indian Country. Work also remains because, with the OBBB, Congress failed to address longstanding Tribal tax priorities.

This Holland & Knight alert offers an overview of several provisions included in the OBBB that will likely impact Tribal governments and their members. Following that overview is a brief description of several Tribal tax priorities that remain pending before the U.S. Congress.

Adoption Tax Credit Parity Provision

Section 23 of the Code provides a tax credit to parents for certain adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs and attorney fees (Adoption Tax Credit). Individuals who adopt a child with a special need are often eligible for the full credit even if they pay no adoption expenses that would qualify for the credit. Before the OBBB's passage, only states could determine that a child had a special need. Under the OBBB, Tribal governments now have the same authority to determine that a child has a special need for purposes of the Adoption Tax Credit. This increases access to the full Adoption Tax Credit for taxpayers who adopt a child when a Tribal government has determined that the child has a special need, correcting a longstanding Tribal parity issue in the Code. This provision was included in the Tribal Tax and Investment and Reform Act of 2025 (discussed below) and is the only provision from that bill to be included in the OBBB.

New Tax Deduction for Seniors

Under the OBBB, taxpayers aged 65 and older are entitled to a new deduction of up to $6,000. The new deduction begins phasing down when the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 (or $150,000 in the case of a joint return). This new deduction goes into effect for the 2025 tax year and will sunset at the end of 2028.

Deduction for Tipped Workers and Overtime Pay

The OBBB offers tax relief to many tipped workers and those who earn overtime pay. Under the OBBB, both provisions will sunset at the end of 2028.

Deduction for Tipped Workers

The OBBB created new Section 224 of the Code. Under Section 224, individuals who receive cash tips in an occupation that ""customarily and regularly received tips"" as of the end of 2024 may claim a deduction of up to $25,000. The new law does not provide a definition for occupations that ""customarily and regularly received tips;"" however, it requires that the U.S. Department of the Treasury issue a list of occupations that customarily and regularly received tips as of the end of 2024.

The new deduction for tipped workers begins phasing down when the tipped worker's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 in the case of a joint return). The deduction is only allowed for qualified tips that are included on a W-2 or information statement furnished to the individual by their employer showing the portion of payments reasonably designated as cash tips and the occupation of the person receiving such tips. Employers should take notice of this requirement, as it will require changes to information statements.

To qualify for this deduction, individual taxpayers must have a Social Security number. Additionally, if married, individuals must file their taxes on a joint return.

Given that many Tribal governments employ tipped workers at casinos, restaurants and other establishments, this new law could be very beneficial. However, tribes and their casinos that have tip agreements with the IRS should consider potential implications.

Deduction for Overtime Pay

The OBBB also provides for a new deduction of up to $12,500 (or $25,000 in the case of a joint return) for ""qualified overtime compensation"" received by an individual. New Section 225 of the Code defines ""qualified overtime compensation"" as overtime compensation paid to the individual that is required under Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

Similar to the tipped worker deduction, the overtime pay deduction begins phasing down when an individual's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 in the case of a joint return). For an individual to claim the deduction, his or her employer must also include the portion of any payments that are qualified overtime compensation on a W-2 or information statement furnished to the individual. Additionally, as with the tipped worker deduction, individuals must have a Social Security number and, if married, they must file their taxes on a joint return.

Provisions Affecting the New Markets Tax Credit, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and Opportunity Zones

The OBBB permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit and permanently renews Opportunity Zones. It also increases allocations for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, as well as modifies Opportunity Zones by imposing stricter eligibility requirements and providing enhanced benefits for rural investments. These programs have incentivized investments in economically distressed areas, including many Tribal lands. As such, Tribal governments may wish to consider how the OBBB's provisions related to these programs may benefit Tribal communities.

Rescissions of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Funds

The OBBB additionally repeals unobligated funds from the IRA for a host of federal programs, including the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Under that program, the U.S. Department of Energy secretary could provide loan guarantees to federally recognized tribes for amounts due on loans for energy development projects. The OBBB eliminates funding from numerous other programs funded under the IRA, including grant programs for transmission deployment and siting. Additionally, the OBBB scales back many of the IRA's clean energy tax credits and incentives, which Tribal governments had increasingly explored due to the availability of direct pay.

Further information about these and other similar changes is provided in Holland & Knight's Comprehensive Analysis of the OBBB, as well as Holland & Knight's previous alert on the OBBB's impacts on IRS clean energy tax credits.

Modifications to Gambling Tax Law

The OBBB also reduces the amount of gambling losses individuals may deduct on their annual tax returns. Under previous law, individuals could deduct 100 percent of their gambling losses up to the extent of their gambling winnings. Following the OBBB's passage, individuals may only deduct up to 90 percent of their losses as of the 2026 tax year.

To demonstrate how this change may affect taxpayers, consider, for example, an individual who has $100,000 in gains from gambling and $100,000 in losses from gambling. Previously, under Section 165(d) of the Code, that individual could fully deduct all $100,000 of his or her gambling losses, leaving the individual with a $0 net effect. Beginning in 2026, that same individual is limited to a deduction of $90,000 (90 percent of $100,000), leaving the individual with $10,000 of tax gain from gambling despite having no economic gain. This change may increase taxes on frequent and professional gamblers and could carry with it implications for Tribal casinos.

Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025

As previously discussed, the OBBB included one provision aimed at providing tax parity to Tribal governments related to the Adoption Tax Credit. However, a number of Tribal tax priorities remain unaddressed.

Introduced by Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025 (S. 2022) includes Tribal government parity provisions in the areas of tax-exempt bond financing, excise tax exemptions, employee plan administration, tribal charity funding and child support enforcement, among others. Below is a discussion of three of S. 2022's proposed changes.

Tax-Exempt Bonds

Specifically, the bond reforms would address certain limits on Tribal governments' ability to issue tax-exempt bonds under the Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status Act of 1983 and current Section 7871 of the Code. Essentially, current law prohibits Tribal governments from issuing tax-exempt private activity bonds in most circumstances, and it limits tax-exempt bond status to bonds when ""substantially all"" of the proceeds from their issuance will be issued in the ""exercise of any essential governmental function."" Currently, Section 7871(e) provides that ""essential governmental function(s)"" do not include ""any function which is not customarily performed by State and local governments with general taxing powers.""

2022 would amend Section 7871 to remove many restrictions placed on Tribal governments' ability to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds. It would also eliminate the ""essential government function"" test, providing Tribal governments with increased access to tax-exempt financing opportunities for commercial projects. This would provide additional parity with state and local governments that already have access to these types of tax-exempt financing opportunities.

Pensions

Next, certain pension reforms included in S. 2022 would expand the definition of a ""governmental plan"" to include plans established by entities ""wholly owned or controlled"" by Tribal governments and would eliminate the essential governmental function test currently in Section 414(d) of the Code. This change – and other similar changes proposed in S. 2022 – should help ensure that more types of pension and employee benefits for Tribal entity employees are administered in the same manner as benefits provided to employees of state governments, providing parity for Tribal governments while reducing administrative burdens.

Social Security Benefits

Tribal governments should also take note of the impact this legislation would have on Indian General Welfare Benefits programs. Notably, S. 2022 includes provisions that would impact how these benefits are treated by the Social Security Administration, including for purposes of determining eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If enacted, S. 2022 would exclude Indian General Welfare Benefits from counting as ""income"" for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI, as well as certain Medicaid programs and benefit programs administered by states. Additionally, it would exclude any Indian General Welfare Benefits from counting as ""resources"" for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility for the nine-month period after the General Welfare Benefit is received. Tribal governments with minors' trusts would also benefit, as grantor trusts for which the tribe is the grantor would be excluded from resources for SSI purposes.

Tribal governments should lend their support to S. 2022 as it would have broad implications for their members, help lift up their economies and reduce administrative burdens.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14849_2738.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:40:06.992640

In the end, the tariffs are a catalyst—a forced march toward a more secure, though more expensive, battery supply chain.","The U.S. Commerce Department's imposition of a 93.5% anti-dumping tariff on Chinese graphite—coupled with existing duties—has created an effective 160% barrier for Chinese imports. This aggressive trade action, part of a broader effort to decouple from China's grip on critical minerals, is reshaping the global battery material landscape. For investors, the ripple effects of this policy shift are both immediate and long-term, offering opportunities in North American and global graphite producers as the EV industry scrambles to diversify its supply chains.

The Tariff Shockwave: A 160% Hurdle for Chinese Graphite

Chinese graphite has long dominated the market, with the country controlling over 85% of anode active material production. The U.S., which imports nearly 180,000 metric tons annually (two-thirds from China), now faces a steep cost increase for battery-grade graphite. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that this critical material is among the most exposed to supply risks, and the tariffs are accelerating efforts to diversify sourcing.

The 160% effective tariff—combining anti-dumping, countervailing, and legacy Trump-era duties—has already triggered market volatility. Shares of Syrah Resources Ltd. (SYR.AX), a key Australian graphite producer, surged 38% on the news, while South Korean battery material firm Posco Future M (006390.KS) rose 24%. These moves reflect investor anticipation of reduced Chinese competition and a scramble to secure alternative suppliers.

North American Producers: A New Era of Opportunity

The U.S. lacks domestic natural graphite mining and relies entirely on imports, but the tariffs are catalyzing investment in domestic production. Companies like Westwater Resources Inc. (WSTH) and NOVONIX (NVX.AX) are positioning themselves to fill the gap. Westwater, constructing a 12,500-tonne-per-year plant in Alabama, plans to scale up to 50,000 tonnes by 2028. NOVONIX, already operating the most advanced synthetic graphite facility in North America, is expanding its Tennessee plant to meet surging demand.

Canadian firms are also capitalizing on the shift. Nouveau Monde Graphite (NMG.T) and Northern Graphite (NGC.T) have seen significant stock gains as they position themselves as low-carbon, high-purity alternatives. Canada's geological endowment and existing infrastructure make it a prime candidate for scaling graphite production, particularly as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers tax credits for materials sourced from allied nations.

Global Diversification: Beyond North America

While North America is the primary beneficiary, the tariff-driven reshuffling is also creating opportunities in other regions. Japan's JX Nippon Mining and South Korea's SK On are expanding their refining capabilities to capture a larger share of the U.S. market. African nations like Madagascar and Brazil, with untapped graphite deposits, are also emerging as potential suppliers.

However, challenges remain. U.S. automakers like Tesla (TSLA) and Panasonic (6752.T) argue that domestic producers still lack the capacity to meet quality and volume demands. Tesla's stock dipped 0.7% after the tariff announcement, reflecting investor concerns over near-term costs. The company has warned that establishing a self-sufficient U.S. graphite supply chain could take 5–7 years and require $12–15 billion in investment.

Investment Strategy: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, the key lies in hedging between short-term volatility and long-term structural shifts. Here's how to navigate the opportunities:

Prioritize Producers with Proven Capacity: Companies like NOVONIX and Syrah Resources already have the technology and scale to meet EV-grade requirements. Their expansion timelines align with the 2028–2030 demand forecasts.

Monitor Geopolitical Developments: The final tariff determination in December 2025 could adjust rates, affecting stock valuations. Watch for policy signals from the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Department.

Diversify Regional Exposure: While North American producers are the most obvious beneficiaries, South Korean and Canadian firms offer lower risk due to their established supply chain ties and regulatory alignment with the U.S.

Consider ESG Metrics: The IRA prioritizes sustainable sourcing. Firms like Nouveau Monde Graphite, which emphasize low-carbon processing, are better positioned to qualify for tax credits.

Conclusion: A Resilient Future for the Battery Supply Chain

The U.S. anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese graphite are more than a trade maneuver—they are a strategic pivot toward supply chain resilience. While the immediate costs for EV manufacturers are steep, the long-term goal of reducing reliance on China is clear. Investors who align with this vision will find fertile ground in North American and allied producers, as well as in companies pioneering alternative anode materials. The graphite supply chain is no longer a monoculture; it is evolving into a diversified ecosystem, and those who adapt will thrive.

In the end, the tariffs are a catalyst—a forced march toward a more secure, though more expensive, battery supply chain. For the right investors, this is not a crisis but an opportunity to bet on the next phase of the EV revolution.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:40:11.794312

It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.
Trump’s EPA flags a problem with offshore wind permit issued by Maryland That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.
The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region.
Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs.","The Maryland Department of the Environment is defending the permit it issued to a wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City, after a challenge from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Thursday letter from Maryland Secretary of the Environment Serena McIlwain also said the state would not be reissuing the permit, as the EPA requested, because the state had not made a mistake that needed correcting.

The EPA had contended that when Maryland issued the permit to Baltimore-based company US Wind, it identified the wrong process for citizens to file appeals.

Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, EPA administrator for Region 3, which includes Maryland and other mid-Atlantic states, contended in a July 7 letter that any appeals challenging the air pollution permit issued to US Wind should be filed to the clerk of the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.

But Maryland argues that its permit would need to be appealed through the state courts, which would involve filing a challenge at the appropriate circuit court — in this case in Worcester County.

Notably, the due date for a state court challenge has already passed. It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.

“Long-settled procedure dictates that state-issued permits are appealed under State law, not Federal law,” McIlwain’s letter says.

Trump’s EPA flags a problem with offshore wind permit issued by Maryland

That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.

“MDE will not re-issue the permit and will continue to follow the proper state procedures to consider appeals,” McIlwain concluded, near the end of the roughly two-page letter.

In an emailed response, the EPA stuck to its guns. An EPA spokesperson said the agency had notified MDE that the final permit decision “contains an error, with clear guidance on next steps. But they don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements.”

The MDE website for the US Wind project originally referenced both the state appeals procedure and the EPA process, but McIlwain said that information had been “included at EPA’s request. It has been removed, and language has been added clarifying that the Federal appeals process does not apply.”

Authority to issue Clean Air Act permits like the one for US Wind is delegated to the state from the EPA — the basis of the federal agency’s claim for jurisdiction for appeals. That authority, specifically for permits on the outer continental shelf, was re-certified in early 2024 under the Biden administration.

The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region. The company, which leased the area in 2014, received a key permit from President Joe Biden’s (D) Department of the Interior at the end of 2024.

Final buildout of the project is still years away, but it calls for construction of 121 wind turbines, up to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower, according to the state’s website. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Practically since its inception, the project has faced fierce opposition from local officials in the resort town, who cite concerns that beachgoers would lose a pristine ocean view if the turbines were visible from shore.

Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs. Earlier this week, Trump announced that wind and solar projects would undergo increased scrutiny under his administration. Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” also rescinds tax credits for renewable energy projects that do not begin construction by next July.

In April, Trump appointed Blarcom-Lackey to lead the EPA’s Mid-Atlantic office. She succeeded Marylander Adam Ortiz, who moved to a deputy secretary role at MDE.

Two other companies have offshore leases in the vicinity of Ocean City and the Delaware beaches — Ørsted and Equinor. While Ørsted received its first lease area around the same time as US Wind, Equinor won its auction last year. Neither project have received its federal permits from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

The announcement was made by Albany County’s economic development chief during the July meeting of the county IDA, when Kevin O’Connor told attendees the closeout was formally “funded” with the receipt of Atlas Copco’s administrative fee earlier this month.

This transaction is tied to a necessary legal step whereby Atlas Copco temporarily gives up legal ownership of its property to the IDA, which in turn leases the land back to the company in exchange for substantial tax savings. The arrangement is a typical development-agency transaction.

The deal nets Atlas Copco a little under $2 million in tax benefits.

The project was put on hold in March because of the “election back in November,” O’Connor said during the June meeting of the county IDA, alluding to Donald Trump’s presidency, which he said was followed by the company’s desire “to see how things shaped out.”

The time allowed Atlas Copco to cut “back on some ancillary things,” O’Connor said, which lowered the project cost from $40 million to $32 million.

With costs shrinking, the company’s sales-tax exemption was adjusted from $1,625,625 to $1,375,000, with the real-property-tax exemption decreased from $734,000 to $670,000 — the property tax abatement, $21,000 per $1 million of assessed value, is spread out over 10 years. The company’s annual Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT) over that time will be $221,550.

The downward revision also affected a grant the company received as part of Albany County’s Sustainable Technology and Green Energy (STAGE) program, which went from $500,000 to $475,000.

The company is also eligible to receive back 30 percent of the project’s total cost. This is because of tax credits through the federal Department of Energy, made possible by passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Decarbonization

The expansion of its School Road manufacturing facility will allow Atlas Copco to fill a void in the decarbonization marketplace.

The company’s compressors are used in the carbon-capture and sequestration (CSS) processes employed by American industries such as ethanol production, cement manufacturing, and power generation. With CSS, these industries are able to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gasses by capturing the carbon dioxide emissions and permanently storing it underground.

But the growth of the CCS industry has been hampered by a lack of domestic manufacturing capacity, particularly when it comes to the type of large-scale compressors made by Atlas Copco.

“In the decarbonization, carbon capture, and carbon sequestration markets, these are brand new. They didn’t exist 10 years ago. They didn’t really exist five years ago except in some pilot plants. Now it’s a full-blown industry across the heartlands where ethanol was made,"" Randy Dirlam, Atlas Copco’s Voorheesville general manager, told members of the village planning commission in April of last year.

To meet this demand, the company needed to build a facility not allowed by village code.

The village zoning board in June 2024 approved a variance to allow for an addition to the existing building to be built 20 feet higher than the 40 feet allowed by zoning. The facility’s 101,000-square-foot footprint will expand by 50,000 square feet, where zoning allows only for 20,000 square feet.

Costs

The breakdown of $32,835,000 in costs includes:

— Buildings: $24,500,000;

— Machinery and equipment costs: $7,715,000;

— Utilities, roads, and accessory costs: $270,000; and

— Architects and engineering fees: $350,000.

Per the company’s IDA application, Atlas Copco incurred another $291,000 in costs due to advanced engineering and environmental studies.

The project saw reductions from:

— The acquisition and installation of solar panels being delayed, resulting in an approximate $2 million reduction;

— The equipment budget being reduced from $11.1 million to $7.7 million due to a reduction in overhead cranes; and

— Not updating office spaces, $2 million.

The project, according to Atlas Copco’s IDA application, will add 55 full-time positions with a salary range between $50,000 and $115,000.

The report also links energy policy directly to AI competitiveness, citing projections that U.S. data centers will consume more electricity by 2030 than all energy-intensive goods manufacturing combined.
“There is no AI without energy,” it warns, quoting the International Energy Agency.
Four executive orders signed in May direct reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and aim to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.
“Affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply will be a crucial determinant of AI development,” the report states.","The White House Council of Economic Advisers on Thursday released a report highlighting the Trump Administration’s energy strategy, projecting that policies aimed at “unleashing American energy” could raise U.S. GDP by as much as 1.9% by 2035 and support national security, energy affordability, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

The report argues that revitalizing domestic oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production — combined with regulatory reform and infrastructure investment— can strengthen the U.S. economy while meeting the surging energy needs of AI-driven data centers and reshored manufacturing.

“The United States is blessed with a wealth of natural resources,” the report states. “Enacting policies that make the most of U.S. resource abundance and promote U.S. energy dominance can meaningfully contribute to economic growth and consumer welfare.”

The White House credited President Trump’s executive actions, including faster permitting, resumed federal leasing, support for advanced nuclear reactors, and grid modernization efforts, for laying the groundwork for increased production and investment.

According to the analysis, energy-focused policies could increase GDP by:

25% to 0.67% from deregulation alone.

03% to 0.13% from removing restrictions on offshore oil commingling.

025% to 0.11% annually from expanded production on federal lands.

At least 0.03% from increased liquefied natural gas exports.

The report also links energy policy directly to AI competitiveness, citing projections that U.S. data centers will consume more electricity by 2030 than all energy-intensive goods manufacturing combined.

“There is no AI without energy,” it warns, quoting the International Energy Agency.

The report notes that just one ChatGPT prompt can be ten times more energy-intensive than a Google search.

To meet this growing demand, the administration has proposed an “all-of-the-above” strategy, with special emphasis on expanding nuclear power. Four executive orders signed in May direct reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and aim to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.

“Rapid growth of low-cost domestic baseload generation is essential to compete for AI dominance,” the report states, noting that China is already building 150 new nuclear reactors and could become the world’s largest nuclear power producer by 2030.

The White House also used the report to tout the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, which ends tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles while expanding credits for biofuels, hydrogen, hydropower, and carbon capture.

The bill also appropriates funds to rebuild the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and build out grid reliability.

In a warning about overreliance on renewables without adequate backup, the report cites a major blackout in parts of Europe earlier this year caused by a sudden drop in solar generation, calling it “a concerning example of some critical flaws of renewable energy.”

To stabilize prices and supply, the administration advocates for delaying the retirement of coal and nuclear plants and interconnecting U.S. regional power grids.

“Even during hours of normal operation,” the report notes, “arbitraging regional price differences could lead to cost savings.”

The report concludes that small modular reactors could play a vital role in meeting data center needs. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are already exploring co-locating data centers with SMRs.

“SMRs may end up being less costly than their conventional counterparts,” the report claims.

“Affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply will be a crucial determinant of AI development,” the report states. “Countries that can deliver the energy needed at speed and scale will be best placed to benefit.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/07/3.-Depositphotos_White-House.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:41:53.694449

It also includes several of Trump’s campaign promises — though many are only temporary — and eliminates tax breaks related to clean energy. Here’s a rundown of some of the main tax law changes to be aware of as you plan for the 2025 tax year.

Highlights for Individuals

Makes permanent the TCJA’s individual tax rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%,

Makes permanent the higher child tax credit, plus for 2025 increases it to $2,200, with annual inflation adjustments going forward,

Temporarily increases the limit on the deduction for state and local taxes (the SALT cap) to $40,000 for 2025, with a 1% increase each year through 2029, after which the $10,000 limit will return,

Expands the allowable education expenses that can be paid with tax-free Section 529 plan distributions, beginning July 5, 2025, or Jan. 1, 2026, depending on the type of expense,

Permanently increases the federal gift and estate tax exemption amount to $15 million for individuals and $30 million for married couples beginning in 2026, with annual inflation adjustments going forward,

For 2025–2028, creates a new deduction of up to $25,000 for tip income in certain industries, subject to income-based phaseouts,

For 2025–2028, creates a new deduction of up to $12,500 for single filers or $25,000 for joint filers for qualified overtime pay, subject to income-based phaseouts,

For 2025–2028, creates an above-the-line deduction of up to $10,000 for qualified passenger vehicle loan interest on the purchase of certain American-made vehicles, subject to income-based phaseouts,

For 2025–2028, creates an additional deduction of up to $6,000 for taxpayers age 65 or older, subject to income-based phaseouts, and

Eliminates clean energy tax credits, generally after 2025, such as the energy-efficient home improvement and residential clean energy credits — but eliminates the clean vehicle credits for both new and used vehicles after Sept. 30, 2025.

Highlights for Businesses

Makes permanent and expands the 20% Sec. 199A qualified business income (QBI) deduction for owners of pass-through entities (such as partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations) and sole proprietorships,

Makes bonus depreciation permanent and increases it to 100% for qualified new and used assets acquired after January 19, 2025,

Increases the Sec. 179 expensing limit to $2.5 million and the expensing phaseout threshold to $4 million for 2025, with annual inflation adjustments going forward,

Permanently allows the immediate deduction of domestic research and experimentation expenses (retroactive to 2022 for eligible small businesses), and

Eliminates clean energy tax incentives, such as the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit and the Sec. 179D deduction for energy-efficient commercial buildings after June 30, 2026 — but eliminates the qualified commercial clean vehicle credit after Sept. 30, 2025.

The April 2010 explosion on an offshore BP drilling rig killed 11 people and caused the largest marine oil spill in history, leaking almost 134 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before it was capped 87 days later

Radford assumed his new role on April 21 serving under Regional Administrator Scott Mason IV, the Trump administration’s appointee as Region 6 chief. Radford was a BP spokesperson and a director of communications for BP America between 2010 and 2023.

Environmental advocates say his appointment signals that the agency is putting corporate interests above environmental protection.

Diane Wilson, a fourth-generation shrimper from Seadrift, Texas, who has challenged oil and gas pollution on the Gulf Coast for decades, said that Radford’s appointment sends a clear message.

“The message is a slammed door in our faces,” Wilson said. “It’s a clear message of ‘don’t bother.’”

Region 6 is headquartered in Dallas and covers Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and 66 Tribal Nations.

From BP to the EPA

Radford worked in the George W. Bush White House before joining BP in 2010. The multinational company was embroiled in the fallout from the Deepwater Horizon disaster that April.

While working at BP, Radford was active in trade groups in Louisiana and served on the Mining, Oil and Gas Sector Committee for the state’s 2021 Climate Action Plan. The company declined to comment on Radford’s employment, saying it does not comment on personnel issues.

BP paid billions of dollars in penalties under the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act for the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Settlements with the families of the workers killed in the explosion were reported to be between $8 and $9 million. Members of crews that cleaned up after the spill also received settlements.

Radford left BP in 2023. He worked for a consulting firm in Dallas before becoming Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s chief of staff in January 2025. He was replaced by early March, as reported by Politico, and joined the EPA in April.

Region 6 manages general permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System for offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico. BP currently operates five offshore oil rigs in the Gulf.

“To appoint a former executive from the company responsible for the worst oil spill in human history to lead a key agency for regulating the fossil fuel industry is total lunacy,” said Jeffrey Jacoby, acting co-executive director of the Texas Campaign for the Environment, which works on the Gulf Coast.

Adrian Shelley is Texas director of Public Citizen, an advocacy group focused on corporate interests in politics. He said that 15 years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP continues to litigate dozens of individual claims related to the incident.

“In a Trump administration, serving corporate interests is practically a qualification for an environmental position,” Shelley said. “The goal is to protect corporate profits, and the strategy is to install industry leaders in the agencies that are supposed to regulate them.”

Robledo, the Region 6 spokesperson, said that “while accomplishing EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, the agency is committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to unleash American energy, lower cost of living for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, restore the rule of law, and give power back to states to make their own decisions.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1726482254-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 18:11:47.042918

“It’s completely heartless that Lee Zeldin would gut the department whose work has saved countless lives and prevented Americans across the country from illnesses linked to air and water pollution. This is just another step to further this administration’s agenda to coddle the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our lives.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-18 18:10:24.752583

Some polls indicate strong bipartisan support for federal clean energy incentives implemented by the Biden administration, including among 78% of people who voted for Trump in 2020.
But with the new tax-spending package now in place, rollbacks of those clean energy incentives are set to begin quickly.
A federal judge last month ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funding for states to build EV chargers.
“Even if you're not going to file for these tax credits, the clean energy credits are helping to lower energy costs for everyone,” Dory Larsen, Senior Electric Transportation Program Manager for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said in May.","Winter Park just installed seven rapid electric vehicle chargers at the city’s new, so-called “mobility hub” right next to the SunRail station on West Morse Boulevard.

The rapid chargers provide “best-in-class EV charging, as compared to the single, slow charging station that was once here,” said Gloria Eby, director of natural resources and sustainability at Winter Park.

City officials say they also plan to install two chargers for electric scooters and bicycles at the hub soon. While e-scooters and e-bikes aren’t allowed on nearby Park Avenue, they are encouraged for use on adjacent streets, according to the city.

The city received the new EV chargers as a donation from Optimus Energy Solutions, a renewable energy company based in Mount Dora. President and founder Ben Pauluhn said from signing the contract to getting the chargers built and fully operational, the process took about three-and-a-half months.

“That's what it should be, because everyone's rowing in the same direction. Everyone's working together,” Pauluhn said. “So from a pure partnership standpoint: it works, it works, it works. People just have to say yes and go.”

The private-public partnership is key to Winter Park’s goal of building out “an industry-leading, multimodal transportation hub,” with options for people who drive cars and rely on public transit, according to Eby.

Winter Park’s new EV chargers arrive at a critical moment for clean energy in the United States. The country stands to lose major ground on achieving clean energy goals, as a slew of federal tax incentives begin sunsetting under President Donald Trump’s new tax-spending package, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Given the rollbacks, the U.S. will now likely drop emissions by just 3% by the end of this decade, compared to the 40% goal set by former President Joseph Biden’s administration, according to one analysis.

RELATED: Some say proposed clean energy rollbacks could send local businesses into “survival mode”

Central Floridians working across the renewable energy industry, including Pauluhn, have expressed concerns about the bill. Before the final version of it became law, Pauluhn said he was especially worried about a provision in the bill that would’ve required any projects benefiting from a commercial solar energy tax credit to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

Such a sudden disruption, Pauluhn said then, would cause “meaningful pain to people, communities and businesses that is probably not necessary.” Ultimately, to his relief, that provision was removed from the final version of the bill.

“The final version was far better than the interim version. Obviously, the final version is terrible, compared to the previous baseline,” Pauluhn said. For residential solar, he said the outlook is still grim, with rollbacks likely to kill many jobs throughout the state.

Some polls indicate strong bipartisan support for federal clean energy incentives implemented by the Biden administration, including among 78% of people who voted for Trump in 2020.

But with the new tax-spending package now in place, rollbacks of those clean energy incentives are set to begin quickly. Tax credits reducing the cost of electric vehicles are set to end September 30.

A federal judge last month ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funding for states to build EV chargers. But the new tax-spending package ends a “30C” tax credit currently helping offset the cost of building EV chargers in certain locations. That incentive expires at the end of next June.

“Even if you're not going to file for these tax credits, the clean energy credits are helping to lower energy costs for everyone,” Dory Larsen, Senior Electric Transportation Program Manager for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said in May. “That makes a huge difference in the cost of goods.

“Businesses have to pay energy costs as well …. Those increased energy costs for businesses are going to be passed on to consumers,” Larsen said.

For Pauluhn, politics are not the main focus. What he wants to see is market predictability, Pauluhn said — and as federal incentives fade, “it gives a real market certainty to private businesses like us.”

“If you say yes, then private capital, private ideas, private excitement and energy flows into it, and neat stuff happens,” Pauluhn said. “If we say yes, the best technologies win. And the best consumer experience is based around electrification.”

Democratic State Representative Anna Eskamani, who represents Winter Park, joined a recent ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new mobility hub. She said beyond it being a “fantastic private-public partnership,” the hub’s new rapid EV chargers represent a promise kept to Floridians across the political spectrum.

“We're responding to what consumers are asking us to do,” Eskamani said. “Despite the political climate and the rhetoric coming from some politicians, the reality is, on the ground, everyday Floridians want charging stations; they want solar; they want alternatives to fossil fuels.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53b569f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F54%2F2fa1940d40e7877cc9215f8ac2ae%2F07172025-mobility-hub-wp-duerig-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 18:08:48.617684

Industry watchers in general expect slower growth in America's EV market throughout the decade due to the Trump administration’s war on climate policies.","How’s the electric vehicle market doing in America so far this year? Well, that depends on what exactly you mean, and who you ask.

EV sales are up this half—but the most recent quarter isn’t looking so pretty. General Motors? Crushing it. Tesla? I probably don’t even have to say it at this point.

My point is: It’s a mixed bag. The clean car will not shrivel up and die under President Donald Trump, but getting Americans hooked on EVs isn’t proving to be a walk in the park either. And while EV sales generally trended upward for most companies in the past as the market exploded, in 2025 clear winners and losers are emerging.

So let’s break down the first half of EV sales in America, and what they could look like going forward.

What EV Sales Are Like In 2025

I’ll start with the glass-half-full view. EV sales got off to a strong start in the first quarter of this year, growing by more than 10% year-over-year, according to Cox Automotive. From January through June, EV sales rose 1.5% to roughly 607,000 units, a new first-half record.

Get a bit more granular, though, and the picture gets less rosy. In Q2, U.S. EV sales dropped by over 6%, according to Cox, to a little over 310,000 units from an estimated 332,000. That was only the third year-over-year decline on record, the firm said.

There are a lot of factors at play that could be dragging down sales, and some are company-specific. But some headwinds apply across the board, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

There’s more work to be done on educating consumers on EVs, she said. There’s a lot of consumer unease around the economy and where prices are headed, especially with tariff bombs dropping left and right. It’s a lot harder to sell EVs to wary, everyday Americans than the tech-obsessed early adopters that lined up for Teslas in years past. Many of those people are leaning into increasingly popular hybrids instead.

Not to mention, EVs are simply a new and volatile market, and there are bound to be big swings as they gain traction.

“We saw really amazing growth in ‘23 to ‘24,” she said. “I think with any new technology, you have to expect that you're going to have accelerations, decelerations. So I think this is part of it.”

One potentially troubling stat: EV sales fell in Q2 despite the introduction of over a dozen new models over the last 12 months. Those include the Cadillac Optiq, Volvo EX30 and America’s first electric muscle car, the Dodge Charger Daytona.

Average sales per EV model, according to Paren

Of the 59 electric models that were on sale in Q2 2024, 50 experienced a decline in sales in Q2 2025, according to Loren McDonald, who tracks the EV industry as chief analyst at the charging data firm Paren. The average sales volume per EV model on the market has trended downward over the last year, his analysis found.

“As we get more models and the overall sales pie doesn't grow that much, it means that the individual models are seeing more competition for the same buyers,” McDonald said.

Who’s Up In The EV Market?

The biggest success story so far this year has been General Motors. With a slew of new electric Cadillacs and Chevys on offer, it doubled its EV sales in Q2 and ended the quarter having moved over 78,000 units.

Its real hero was the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which has become a hit thanks to its low (for EVs, at least) $35,000 price point and healthy 319 miles of range. Through the first half of the year, the Equinox EV was the best-selling non-Tesla EV, racking up nearly 28,000 sales.

Honda and Acura also posted big gains. They were basically non-factors at the beginning of last year and have been burning up the sales charts with the Prologue and ZDX, respectively. Valdez Streaty notes that the biggest winners in Q2, like these cars, probably benefited from hefty manufacturer incentives to boost sales. (In a way, this is another win for GM, since the Prologue and ZDX are built by the Detroit automaker using its platforms.)

Stellantis, parent to Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep, was up by over 11,000 units too. But that’s because it had no EV presence to speak of this time last year. The Charger Daytona and Jeep Wagoneer S just went on sale.

At the Volkswagen Group, strong sales of the new Porsche Macan EV and Audi Q6 E-Tron outweighed weaker sales for other models. And the Nissan Ariya crossover served as a boon to that brand as it awaits the next-generation Leaf.

Who’s Down In The EV Market?

Tesla, far and away the industry leader, saw the biggest drop. It sold 31,000 fewer EVs in the first half than it did during the same period last year, Cox said. What’s more, Tesla still makes up nearly half of America’s EV market, so its troubles (or successes) have an outsized influence on the broader picture.

If you take Tesla out of the equation, EV sales would’ve been up 14% year-to-date, Valdez Streaty said.

The refreshed Tesla Model Y.

Part of the drop was due to the rollout of the refreshed Model Y, Tesla said, which required factory downtime. But even once that crucial model was ramped up in Q2, the automaker couldn’t match last year’s sales. The Cybertruck, meanwhile, posted a 50% decline in sales year over year in Q2 as that proves to be an extremely niche offering.

It’s clearer than ever that what Tesla needs are new, widely appealing models—and that it needs to play by the same rules that have governed the auto industry for decades. Polling has also shown that Elon Musk’s politics have been repelling potential buyers.

“Like any car company, when you don't have new products, you're going to start to see competitors start to eat at that share,” Valdez Streaty said.

2025 Kia EV6

The Hyundai Motor Group, which has been a real leader in the EV space, saw a big drop-off, led by Kia.

Kia's electric sales were down by a whopping 53.5% or nearly 16,000 vehicles in the first half, according to Cox data. Earlier this year, Kia spokesperson attributed its decline to supply disruptions caused by model-year changeovers. The electric Kia EV6 has long been outpaced by its cousin, the Hyundai Ioniq 5; we'll see if it can pick up more sales on the back half of this year.

""EV sales across the industry are experiencing a transitional phase as the market shifts from early adopters to mainstream buyers,"" Hyundai spokesperson Ira Gabriel said. ""While Hyundai’s EV sales were essentially flat in the first half of the year (-1%), our overall green vehicle sales, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, grew 22% in H1 and 9% in Q2, reflecting strong consumer interest in electrified options.""

Gabriel added that Hyundai has no plans to delay EV rollouts or reduce production."" We believe in the future of EVs but also recognize that consumers are at different stages of adoption,"" he said, noting that the company has seen success with its mix of powertrain options in America.

Mercedes-Benz saw its EV sales fall off by over 50% in the first half, per Cox, continuing a downward trend. That may be because its jelly-bean-shaped EVs haven’t exactly resonated in the marketplace—something the new CLA and electric G-Wagen could change. The company also said in a statement that new tariffs on imported cars hit its sales in the U.S.

Earlier today, a Mercedes spokesperson confirmed that the automaker would end production of the U.S.-made and U.S.-bound EQ cars, ahead of the end of the tax credits in September.

Ford sold about 5,000 fewer EVs this year, amounting to an 11.8% drop. A spokesperson said that was due to a model-year changeover and a stop-sale on the Mustang Mach-E crossover. Valdez Streaty said it could also be because of Ford’s thin lineup that hasn’t changed in years: the Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning pickup and the commercial E-Transit van.

The Volkswagen brand posted a drop as well. The brand’s head of communications, Mark Gillies, noted to InsideEVs that the ID.4 lost federal EV tax credit eligibility in January and that the ID. Buzz van was hit with a recall. “The consumer uncertainty didn’t help, either,” he wrote in an email.

Rivian sold about 8,000 fewer EVs year-to-date. It lowered its delivery guidance this year due to Trump’s tariffs and the recent Los Angeles wildfires, which hit a key market. It expects its next phase of growth to come from the upcoming, more affordable R2 crossover.

What’s Next For The EV Market?

EV sales are all over the place for a myriad of reasons. Industry watchers in general expect slower growth in America's EV market throughout the decade due to the Trump administration’s war on climate policies.

With various EV tax credits now set to end after September 30, Valdez Streaty expects a mad dash to buy and lease electric cars in Q3—followed potentially by a “collapse” in Q4. Cox Automotive estimates that EV sales in the U.S. will be flat this year, making up around 8.5% of the car market.

Until, of course, more affordable options appear in the U.S.

“We need vehicles that are affordable that have that price parity with their ICE counterpart,” she said, referring to internal combustion vehicles. “Once we have more options like that, I think that’s going to be the game changer.”",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/NGKQPG/s1/equinox-cybetruck.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 18:11:30.050586

“Commerce’s determination proves that China is selling AAM at less than fair value into the domestic market,” Erik Olson, a spokesperson for the anode producers trade group, said in a statement.
Syrah Resources Ltd., an Australian graphite and battery anode company, surged as much as 38%, the most since October 2023.
Posco Future M Co., a South Korean battery material firm, jumped 24%.","The US Commerce Department will impose preliminary anti-dumping duties of 93.5% on imports of Chinese graphite, a key battery component, after concluding the materials had been unfairly subsidized.

A trade association representing US graphite producers in December filed petitions with two federal agencies, asking for investigations into whether Chinese companies were violating anti-dumping laws. The new duties will add to existing rates making the effective tariff 160%, according to the American Active Anode Material Producers, the trade group that filed the complaint.

The anti-dumping duty on graphite is set to increase tensions along the global electric-vehicle supply chain that’s already facing Beijing’s export controls of some critical minerals and battery technology. Battery supplier shares slipped, while producers in North America and the Asia-Pacific soared.

“Commerce’s determination proves that China is selling AAM at less than fair value into the domestic market,” Erik Olson, a spokesperson for the anode producers trade group, said in a statement.

Syrah Resources Ltd., an Australian graphite and battery anode company, surged as much as 38%, the most since October 2023. Posco Future M Co., a South Korean battery material firm, jumped 24%.

The tariff would be a blow to battery manufacturers, said Sam Adham, head of battery materials at consultancy CRU Group. A 160% tariff equates to $7 per kilowatt-hour added cost to an average EV battery cell, or one fifth of the battery manufacturing tax credits that originated in the Inflation Reduction Act and survived President Donald Trump’s budget bill, he said.

“That basically wipes out profits for one or two entire quarters for the Korean battery makers,” Adham said.

Tesla Inc. and its key battery supplier, Japan’s Panasonic Inc., were among companies pushing to block the new tariffs, arguing that they rely on Chinese graphite imports because the domestic industry hasn’t developed enough to meet the quality standards and volume that the carmaker requires. Tesla shares fell as much as 0.7% Thursday.

Graphite is a key raw material used to make anodes of the batteries, and nearly 180,000 metric tons of graphite products were imported into the US last year, with about two-thirds of these deliveries coming from China, according to BloombergNEF.

China dominates the processing capacity of graphite, with the International Energy Agency calling the material one of the most exposed to potential supply risks and “requiring urgent efforts for diversification,” according to a report in May.

Graphite is expected to remain the most common anode material for all types of lithium-ion batteries in the medium term, according to the IEA, with silicon only expected to begin eating into its market share from 2030.

The Commerce Department issued the preliminary determination affirming the anti-dumping duties in a document Thursday, and said the final determination should be announced by Dec. 5.

The tariff ruling “provides the policy clarity and market signals needed to accelerate domestic graphite production,” said Jon Jacobs, chief commercial officer at Westwater Resources Inc., which is building a graphite plant in Alabama. Westwater, which has agreements with Jeep-owner Stellantis NV and South Korea’s SK On Co., will have 12,500 metric tons of production capacity when its first phase comes online next year, with plans to expand capacity to 50,000 tons annually by 2028, Jacobs said.

Westwater rose 15% on Thursday. Canadian graphite firms Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. and Northern Graphite Corp. also surged on the tariff news.

The anti-dumping rate determination “could impact the cost structure for battery suppliers” like Fluence Energy Inc. and Enphase Energy Inc., analysts at Roth Capital Partners said in a note Wednesday. Fluence shares closed lower by 0.4% while Enphase dropped 0.7%.

Additional duties on batteries will add to pressures facing the renewable industry. While energy storage retained key tax incentives in Trump’s budget bill, Treasury Department rules restricting the use of Chinese cells complicates compliance for many developers. Supply chain risks and costs will slow the pace of storage growth on the US grid, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Changes to clean energy incentives could reduce or eliminate benefits for some taxpayers.

According to Leader Powers, new and used clean energy tax credits are set to expire soon. The $7,500 Clean Vehicle Credit and $4,000 Used Clean Vehicle Credit will end after Sept. 30, 2025. The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit expires for purchases made after June 30, 2026.

Home energy credits, including the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and Residential Clean Energy Credit, will sunset after Dec. 31, 2025. These terminations can be found under Subchapter A, “Termination of Green New Deal Subsidies” in the bill.

“For businesses that have built sustainability initiatives around those incentives, it’s time to revisit assumptions and update forecasts,” Sotsky said.

What Does This Mean for Taxpayers?

According to Leader Powers, whenever eligibility for credits and deductions is updated, it’s important for taxpayers to evaluate how the changes apply to their personal situation.

For instance, several clean energy tax credits will expire by the end of the year. “If you are considering an energy-efficient home improvement or replacement purchase, hurry up! You have until the end of the year to make that purchase or complete the improvement and take advantage of the expiring home clean energy credits,” she explained. “Examples of qualifying property may include exterior doors and windows, skylights, heat pumps, central air conditioners, water heaters, biomass stoves or boilers.”

And you have only until the end of September to purchase a qualified new or used electric vehicle and still claim the available tax credits. You can qualify for a credit of up to $7,500, subject to limitations. There’s also an additional credit for charging components of up to $1,000 per item, which expires on June 30, 2026.

In partnership with ExxonMobil, the facility is a major step forward in carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the U.S. ammonia sector—helping CF Industries produce approximately 1.9 million tons of low-carbon ammonia annually while qualifying for Section 45Q tax credits.

“By starting permanent sequestration now, we reduce our emissions, accelerate the availability of low-carbon ammonia for our customers, and begin generating valuable 45Q tax credits,” said Tony Will, CEO of CF Industries.

Inside the Project

Location: Donaldsonville Complex, Louisiana

Storage Volume: 2 million metric tons of CO2 per year

Product Output: 1.9 million tons of low-carbon ammonia

Partner: ExxonMobil

Initial Storage: Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)

Future Storage: Permanent sequestration via Exxon’s Rose CCS project (pending EPA Class VI permit)

Industry Impact: Scaling Carbon Capture and Blue Ammonia

From Concept to Execution

The Donaldsonville facility marks a shift in CCS from pilot stage to industrial-scale deployment in the U.S. fertilizer sector.

Ammonia Export Opportunity

Rising global demand—particularly from Japan, South Korea, and the EU—for low-carbon hydrogen carriers positions the U.S. as a blue ammonia exporter.

Tax Credits as Economic Driver

Section 45Q provides up to $85 per ton for CO2 stored in saline formations. If fully utilized, CF Industries could receive approximately $170 million annually, reshaping CCS economics.

Strengthening the Gulf Coast CCS Hub

With ExxonMobil’s Rose project and other Class VI permit applications in progress, the Gulf Coast is emerging as a key region for U.S. CCS development.

Challenges and Trade-Offs

Despite its promise, the project raises critical environmental and regulatory concerns.

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Use

Although ExxonMobil plans to transition to dedicated storage, the current use of EOR—injection of CO2 to extract oil—raises questions about climate benefits. Critics say this undermines net-zero goals.

Environmental Justice in Cancer Alley

Donaldsonville lies within Louisiana’s heavily industrialized “Cancer Alley.” CCS may reduce CO2 but does not address toxic co-pollutants like NOx and particulates. Community advocates warn the project could prolong harmful local emissions.

Long-Term Storage and Leakage Risk

Studies by the IPCC and National Academies highlight the potential for CO2 leakage and stress the need for rigorous, decades-long monitoring. While the EPA’s Class VI well program sets strict standards, implementation has been slow.

Financial Dependence on 45Q Subsidies

The business case hinges on 45Q tax credits, which expire in 2033. If the political environment changes or incentives drop, the facility’s long-term economics could falter.

Green Hydrogen Delay

While blue ammonia is cleaner than conventional ammonia, it still relies on fossil fuel-derived hydrogen. Experts caution that overinvesting in blue hydrogen may delay the infrastructure and scale-up needed for truly green alternatives.

Final Takeaway

The Donaldsonville CCS facility positions CF Industries at the forefront of blue ammonia production and offers a commercial model for industrial decarbonization. But it also reflects the nuanced reality of the energy transition—where carbon reductions, community impact, and financial structures are tightly intertwined.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250717-122655-f68-CF%20Industries%27%20Donaldsonville%20Complex.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 17:15:00.374191

“This is going to be very transformative for the graphite industry in the United States,” he told CNN Friday.
On top of the other duties the Trump administration has imposed on China, Chinese graphite could face tariffs of about 160%.","(CNN) — The Trump administration is imposing a substantial tariff on a raw material that is critical for electric vehicle batteries, which could significantly raise the cost of building EVs in the United States.

The Commerce Department announced a 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite Thursday, accusing the country of “dumping” the raw material in the United States below the market price. The decision was hailed by domestic graphite producers, who say Chinese producers dominate the market and keep American companies from getting off the ground.

Raw graphite is relatively cheap, costing less than $2 per pound. Chinese imports to the United States more than doubled over two years, hitting $347 million in 2023, according to the most recent Commerce Department data available. But domestic producers haven’t been making graphite of the purity needed to build EV batteries, according to testimony from Tesla during the investigation into the tariffs.

Mike O’Kronley, CEO of US-based graphite producer Novonix, said the tariff will help to increase investment and production in the domestic industry.

“This is going to be very transformative for the graphite industry in the United States,” he told CNN Friday. “Manufacturers in China have really overinvested, and they have a lot of additional capacity, so they are exporting a lot of that volume. It’s hampering the development of the US critical minerals.”

The move not only is an escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China, but another blow to American EV production.

The Trump administration is slashing federal support for electric vehicles. The administration is looking to eliminate or recall federal government loans used to help fund construction of EV factories and battery plants, and the spending and tax bill passed earlier this month that Trump signed into law will eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers.

The Biden administration imposed a 25% tariff on graphite last year and started the process that led to the 93.5% tariff announced Thursday. On top of the other duties the Trump administration has imposed on China, Chinese graphite could face tariffs of about 160%.

However, the US industry does not currently produce enough graphite to fill demand. Until it does, American EV battery makers will just have to pay a higher price for the graphite it needs from China.

Numerous auto and EV battery makers did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. But during the hearing process on the potential tariff increase, attorneys for the automakers argued that US producers do not make the high-quality graphite needed for EV batteries.

“Lithium-ion battery producers demand (graphite) with a 99.9 percent carbon purity level, meaning extremely low metallic impurities,” said Matt Nicely, an attorney for Tesla at a hearing in early January. “Not a single US producer is able to produce (graphite) to these exacting specifications. (Domestic producers) cannot blame imports ….when they are not yet able to produce the product the market demands.”

Even O’Kronley admits it will take time for the domestic market to catch up.

“This material takes a long time to develop and qualify to be used in batteries. So it’s not very easy to switch or change supply,” he said. “Tariffs will not have an immediate effect with changing supply. But we will see changes over time and the development of a US industry is going happen now, or it’s going to be accelerated.”

,American Energy,2025-07-18 19:47:04+00:00,KJZZ,"Interior Secretary Burgum must personally approve all wind, solar projects","MATTHEW DALY, Associated Press, MATTHEW DALY, Associated Press, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://kjzz.com/news/local/interior-secretary-burgum-must-personally-approve-all-wind-solar-projects,"The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at ""ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,"" the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday.
The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct ""elevated review"" of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at ""ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,"" the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order ""will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative"" on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

""At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""There's no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.''

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called ""expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.""

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that ""smart"" countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans' utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation's electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

""This isn't oversight. It's obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move ""particularly confounding"" as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

'Level the playing field'

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum's order will ""level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,"" such as coal and natural gas ""after years of assault under the previous administration.""

""American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,"" said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law's enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are ""placed in service,"" or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

On its website, it says, “That independence matters. It means Recurrent can serve drivers and the industry with data-backed insights without bias or hidden agendas.”

Recently, Recurrent CEO Scott Case said in a blog post, “Gas cars are disappearing, and this data shows it’s happening before most people realize, There will be fewer gas powered cars on the road in California next year than this year, and every year after that. In Colorado and Washington State, that tipping point occurs in 2026.”

“It turns out that when a state approaches 30 percent new EV sales, that’s the tipping point for the number of gas cars on the road falling. It’s a little counterintuitive that it’s not 50 percent when that happens — almost like one of those tricky logic problems on the SATs. The catch is that a certain percentage of all cars on the road exit operation each year. This can be due to accidents or being aged out of the purchase pool.”

The Recurrent Vision Vs Reality

At CleanTechnica, we are all in on the EV revolution. Our pages are filled with stories about electric vehicles, not just in North America, Europe, and China, but in Australia, Africa, South America, the Philippines, and even Nepal. But despite our firm embrace of all things electric (We even like electrified high speed rail. Oh the horror!), we have to be pragmatic as well.

A quick glance around shows a world in which the oil, methane, and coal industries wield outsize influence over governments everywhere. The failed US administration was largely bought and paid for by fossil fuel interest. In exchange for their financial contributions to the last campaign, they have been richly rewarded with new policies that roll back limits on atmospheric pollution from thermal generating plants which burn either methane or coal.

Auto emissions standards have been weakened so manufacturers are now free to build cars and trucks that spew more fine particulates, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in their wake. Fracking companies no longer have to worry about turning our aquifers into toxic waste because America has an energy emergency, which has given the fossil fuel companies a license to run roughshod over any and all environmental restrictions.

Today, the EV revolution has a new obstacle in the path to a clean transportation future. Jack Ewing, automotive correspondent for the New York Times, reported that the Commerce Department, now headed by Howard Lutnick, has ruled that China is “dumping” battery grade graphite on the United States. As a result of that finding, the graphite will now face a 92.5% tariff starting today. The ruling by the Commerce Department is preliminary, so if it turns out that it is rescinded as some point in the future — something that is always possible with the TACO president — the money collected will be refunded — maybe.

“The decision will hurt many automakers like Ford, and suppliers like Panasonic and LG Energy Solution, that have been setting up battery factories in the United States. The tariffs are likely to raise prices for electric cars at the same time that the federal government is eliminating tax credits of up to $7,500 for people who buy or lease the vehicles,” Ewing wrote.

Many other items needed to make electric cars — like the copper needed to make electric motors and the aluminum used to make lightweight body parts — are also facing increased tariffs. If you think Big Oil isn’t using its lobbying muscle to put any road blocks in the path of the EV revolution it can, you aren’t paying attention. The new tariffs on graphite could raise the price of a new electric car by about a thousand dollars, but when you add that to the other tariffs and the repeal of the federal tax credit on September 30, 2025, the vision Recurrent laid out seems more like hope than reality.

Tesla is one of the companies that will be hurt by the new tariff on graphite. It sent a letter to the Commerce Department in February saying it had agreed to buy graphite from US suppliers, but “they have not yet shown the technical ability to produce commercial quantities” of battery-grade graphite “at the quality and purity required by Tesla and other battery cell manufacturers.”

The anode material producers group applauded Thursday’s decision. “Dumping is a malicious trade practice used by China to undercut competition and wield geopolitical influence,” the organization said in a statement.

Readers may note that the prior administration had put policies in place to encourage companies to build stuff in America. This administration is taking all those incentives away. The cruel irony is that the US was an early leader in battery technology but seemed quite content to let others develop it. Now the chickens have come home to roost and America finds itself left to wonder what happened to its original lead in the field.

New York Times columnist David Brooks, who used to be a staunch Republican but has distanced himself from the MAGA wing of the party, wrote an essay on July 17 with this title: “Trump is winning the race to the bottom.” It’s an interesting read, but here is the part that pertains to this discussion:

Populists are anti-intellectual. President Trump isn’t pumping research money into the universities; he’s draining it out. The administration is not tripling the National Science Foundation’s budget; it’s trying to gut it. The administration is trying to cut all federal basic research funding by a third, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A survey by the journal Nature of 1,600 scientists in the United States found that three-quarters of them have considered leaving the country.

The response to the Sputnik threat was to go outward and compete. Trump’s response to the Chinese threat generally is to build walls, to erect trade barriers and to turn inward. A normal country would be strengthening friendships with all nations not named China, but the United States is burning bridges in all directions. A normal country would be trying to restore America’s shipbuilding industry by making it the best in the world. We’re trying to save it through protectionism. The thinking seems to be: We can protect our mediocre industries by walling ourselves off from the world. That’s a recipe for national decline.

The problem is not just Trump. China has been displaying intellectual and innovative vitality for decades and the United States has scarcely mobilized. This country sometimes feels exhausted, gridlocked, as if it has lost its faith in itself and contact with its future.

China graduates more engineers every quarter than the entire number of engineers in the US. This is not a strategy for winning, it is a strategy for becoming irrelevant on the world stage. Another story in the New York Times today describes how the leaders of Germany, France, and the UK are planning a new political order that does not include the US.

The alleged president likes to spout off about how anyone who doesn’t agree with him is a sucker, but in fact, it is America that is the sucker for putting this aging buffoon in power. The costs of that error will be enormous and weigh the country down for decades to come. In fact, America may never recover from this self-inflicted wound.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EVs.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 17:11:39.191774

The New Jersey Legislature recently passed a bill that creates the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program, which will provide $500 million in new tax credits for manufacturing, marking the largest manufacturing investment in state history.

“We’re giving manufacturers and entrepreneurs the tools they need to grow, compete globally, and succeed right here in the Garden State,” said bill co-sponsor Senator Michael Testa (R-1), at a manufacturing webinar hosted by NJBIA yesterday. “It is a modern revival of the message proudly displayed on the Lower Trenton Bridge — ‘Trenton Makes, The World Takes.’”

The program will incentivize various manufacturing activities, including advanced manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, defense, and clean energy component manufacturing, all with the aim to drive innovation, create jobs, and bolster the overall manufacturing sector in the state.

NJBIA Chief Government Affairs Officer Christopher Emigholz called the legislation monumental for manufacturing and the overall business climate in New Jersey.

“Coupled with federal uncertainty regarding some manufacturing programs that companies rely upon, this legislation really is a no-brainer,” Emigholz added. “It requires no new additional funding and enjoys bipartisan support from the Legislature’s Manufacturing Caucus.”

To qualify for tax credits under the program, which would be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), an eligible business would be required to:

Make, acquire, or lease no less than $10 million in capital investments at a qualified business facility in New Jersey.

Create at least 20 new full-time jobs in New Jersey.

Provide a median salary for the full-time jobs at the qualified business facility of no less than 120% of the median salary for manufacturing employees in the county in which the project is located.

Separately, under the bill, $100 million of the $500 million in tax credits would be exclusively reserved for clean energy product manufacturers during the first two years of the program.

If the NJEDA awards less than $100 million in tax credits reserved for clean energy product manufacturers during that two-year period, the uncommitted portion could be awarded to any other eligible manufacturer in the third year of the program.

Under the legislation, clean energy is defined as offshore wind, solar, geothermal, green hydrogen, nuclear energy, fuel cells, battery storage, and other sustainable clean energy solutions

Testa said that while the mere mention of clean energy may evoke certain feelings about the state’s offshore wind industry struggles, the $100 million portion aims to hit myriad manufacturers, such as those involved in nuclear energy, for example.

“If $1 billion was not able to save one singular project in Ørsted , $100 million that is not even dedicated specifically to offshore wind is not going to resuscitate or revive an entire industry,” Testa said.

He then pointed to Camden-based Holtec, which makes small modular reactors with a focus on nuclear energy, as an example of a company that would likely benefit from the clean energy portion of the tax credits.

“This is not an offshore wind bill,” Emigholz said. “The clean energy portion only accounts for 20% of the program and the definition of clean energy under the bill includes nuclear, which by all accounts will be increasing in New Jersey.”

He also added that if a New Jersey manufacturer is creating parts or mechanisms for wind projects anywhere else in the world, the state is still the beneficiary of the jobs and revenue created.

Additionally, the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program comes at a time when President Donald Trump has signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law earlier this month.

Characterized by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) as a manufacturing bill, OBBBA aims to incentivize manufacturing, supply chains and job creation in the states.

“I truly believe most New Jerseyans want to see us working together to bring great legislation to help all citizens and create a better version of the Garden State,” Testa said. “I see this working as a hand in glove process with this program. I want to work with the Federal administration to make manufacturing great again in the state of New Jersey.”

Freeport told Texas environmental regulators on Wednesday that the plant had an emissions event after liquefaction train 2 shut Tuesday night due to an issue with a compressor system.

Officials at Freeport LNG were not immediately available for comment on Thursday.

Prices in the U.S. and Europe, however, did not react much on Wednesday or so far on Thursday.

LSEG said the amount of gas flowing to Freeport was on track to reach 1.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Thursday, up from 1.6 bcfd on Tuesday and 1.7 bcfd on Wednesday. That compares with an average of 1.9 bcfd over the prior seven days.

The three liquefaction trains at Freeport are capable of turning about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG.

One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.

And according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association, recycled steel doesn’t lose its quality.
But recycling concrete doesn’t substantially lower its carbon footprint, he added.","ALTADENA, Calif. (AP) — Candace Frazee recently walked through the burnt remains of The Bunny Museum, searching for anything that could be salvaged before workers cleared the land.

The Eaton Fire in Southern California in January scorched more than 60,000 bunny objects and memorabilia, leaving behind mounds of ash, steel and concrete littered across the landscape. Giant bunny statues that once greeted guests were left just wiry, hollow skeletons. Her home in the back was also gone.

Yet amid the debris, there are valuable materials being redeemed: Metal, concrete and some trees are being recycled and given new life.

“It’s fantastic. It’s absolutely fantastic,” said Frazee of recycling the materials, who co-founded the museum with her husband. “That’s the right thing to do.”

After the Palisades and Eaton fires scorched entire neighborhoods, the Army Corps of Engineers set up operations to recycle concrete and metal from mostly fire-damaged homes. Metal is compacted and concrete is crushed, then trucked to recycling facilities before re-entering the supply chain for future uses. And some trees and shrubs are processed and sold.

“A lot of this material can be reused in future construction, and that’s just good for the environment,” said Col. Sonny Avichal, an Army Corps commander for the Eaton Fire. “And so there is definitely this notion of, you know, a lot of the stuff that we’re able to recover will actually come back and help rebuild Altadena.”

The agency said these operations have sped up recovery efforts, reduced waste going to landfills and helped lower the number of trucks on the road, but they’ve also sparked some worries. Residents have raised concerns that the work produces or kick up particles into the air. The Army Corps maintains they’re ensuring operations are safe by monitoring air quality and continually watering the sites to minimize dust.

Steel is an “infinitely recyclable” material

A large dump truck filled with wiry and garbled steel arrived at an Altadena golf course that had been partially burned. The metal pulled from fire-destroyed properties was compacted here before being trucked to a recycling facility where it can be melted, cast and resold. A steel beam can become a steel beam again, or be morphed into a car door or roof panel.

Across the globe, the steel industry represents an estimated 8% of planet-warming emissions, and just 1 to 2 % in the U.S. — the fourth largest steel producer. And according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association, recycled steel doesn’t lose its quality. Annually, some 60 to 80 million tons of steel scrap are recycled into new products in North America. Every refrigerator that’s recycled reduces 215 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the group’s estimates.

“Steel is infinitely recyclable,” said Adina Renee Adler, executive director of the Global Steel Climate Council, an industry group working to reduce carbon emissions. “It is, in fact, the most recycled material out of everything that we have.”

Adler hopes people who lost homes to the fires will feel a glimmer of hope knowing some of those materials will be given new life. That could be for somebody else, somewhere else, or to build their own homes anew.

Recycling concrete has environmental perks

The concrete that arrived to these sites is pulverized into large concrete chunks piled 10 feet (3.05 meters) high into inch-and-a-half and 3 inch pieces before being trucked to local construction materials companies.

In its new form, concrete can be used to elevate ground in construction sites, for example, or provide a base layer before pavement is applied, or be used to create concrete again.

Making concrete is responsible for roughly 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions and 2% in the U.S., most of which come from producing and processing its predecessor, cement. That’s because coal and other fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases when burned, are the main energy sources for making cement, and the actual chemical reaction that occurs when producing it also releases planet-warming emissions, said Ben Skinner, a manager on the cement and concrete team with RMI, a group working to accelerate the clean energy transition.

But recycling concrete doesn’t substantially lower its carbon footprint, he added. It does, however, have “great environmental impacts” because it reduces the extraction of new raw materials when it’s turned into aggregate — stuff like sand or gravel used to make concrete — while still producing high quality material. It also keeps waste from going to landfills.

Some trees could also be used in rebuilding

Large trees were knocked onto homes and parkways from the same powerful winds that sent fires out of control, and the infernos scorched canopies. Trees that fell into ash get sent to landfills. Others that are still standing and pose a safety risk are cut down.

Some logs are sent to local mills to be manufactured into lumber that can be used in the rebuilding process. Others are mulched to become soil amendment, the name for organic matter added to soil to improve its quality, then sold to companies and farmers, said Matthew Long, senior program manager for Environmental Chemical Corporation, the contractor running the operations.

Long has done fire recovery work for nearly a decade — including in Hawaii after the Lahaina fires and other California blazes in 2017 and 2018. “It’s really rewarding work,” he said. “You’re interacting with someone who lost everything daily and helping them move to the next step of recovery.”

Continue monetizing credits through familiar structures Another piece of good news is that the Act did not affect the core tools used to monetize clean energy tax credits.","Over the July 4th holiday, President Trump signed H.R. 1 (a/k/a the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) into law (Public Law No: 119-21, the “Act”). This sweeping piece of legislation significantly rolls back clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and introduces meaningful complexity and uncertainty into the renewable energy tax credit landscape. However, the Act also creates short-term windows of opportunity for renewable energy industry participants who act fast.

There’s been no shortage of coverage breaking down timelines and statutory text. What developers and sponsors need now is practical guidance on how to move quickly, where the risks sit, and what might still change.

Here are five actions developers and sponsors can take now to protect their long-term interests, and what utilities and tax equity investors should expect for projects they anticipate investing in or acquiring.

1. Begin construction in 2025 if possible

While this is a difficult time to make business decisions, it is important to act now to preserve eligibility, manage risk, and stay ahead of coming regulatory shifts.

One of the most consequential changes in the Act is the phaseout of the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y (“PTCs”) and the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E (“ITCs”) for wind and solar facilities. Going forward, projects must either:

Begin construction by July 4, 2026, or

Be placed in service by December 31, 2027

… Or they won’t be eligible for those tax credits.

In practice, completing large-scale energy projects that do not begin construction before July 4th of next year prior to the December 31, 2027 deadline will likely be difficult. Under existing guidance, projects have a continuity safe harbor that allows them to qualify for PTCs or ITCs if they are placed in service before the end of the calendar year that is 4 years after the year in which construction began, such that projects that begin construction in 2025 must be placed in service in or before 2029 and projects that begin construction between January 1, 2026 and July 4, 2026 must be placed in service in or before 2030. To complicate matters further, a new Executive Order issued July 7th directs the Treasury Department to update its ""beginning of construction"" guidance, possibly making it stricter than the current guidance that the renewable energy industry has been relying on for over a decade. The Treasury Department is supposed to issue the guidance by Monday, August 18th, but meeting that deadline could be challenging.

While we expect industry participants to take steps to ensure that new projects begin construction as soon as possible to avoid the phaseout deadline, relying on industry norms under the existing beginning of construction guidance (e.g., placing transformer orders with accelerated component production timelines) may not be sufficient if the new guidance applies retroactively.

2. Lock in beginning of construction by December 31, 2025 to avoid FEOC exposure

A second, more complicated issue introduced by the Act is the enactment of new Foreign Entity of Concern (“FEOC”) restrictions. These rules come in two flavors:

At the taxpayer level: If a project owner is a “prohibited foreign entity” (i.e., a “specified foreign entity” or a ""foreign-influenced entity""), the taxpayer will be ineligible for the credits.

At the project level: If the project receives ""material assistance"" from a prohibited foreign entity – which will be determined based on the percentage of certain project costs paid to a prohibited foreign entity – the project will not be eligible for tax credits.

The challenge for developers with global supply chains is that there is no guidance yet on the application of these rules, and the guidance (even in proposed form) may not be available before business decisions need to be made with respect to the FEOC rules. The definitions are vague and the percentage-based tests for “material assistance” are murky.

If construction is begun before December 31, 2025, the ""material assistance"" rules will not apply at the project level. If the December 31st cut off is missed, taxpayers will be at the mercy of guidance that could torpedo a project after its development is already underway.

3. Develop battery projects while the window is wide open

Amid all the disruption, battery storage projects came through largely unscathed by the changes in the Act, except that the FEOC rules described above will apply.

We’re already seeing developers accelerate battery project timelines to take advantage of this relative stability. If you’ve been considering standalone storage, now is the time to move.

4. Continue monetizing credits through familiar structures

Another piece of good news is that the Act did not affect the core tools used to monetize clean energy tax credits. The strategies we’ve been helping clients implement, including traditional tax equity structures (like partnership flips and sale-leasebacks), as well as the direct transfer option under Section 6418, remain fully available, except that transfers may not be made to prohibited foreign entities.

That means sponsors and tax equity investors can largely still turn credits into cash using the same market-tested structures as before.

5. Move fast, but manage the risks carefully

There is risk in moving quickly; especially when it means placing non-refundable deposits or starting work based on rules that may change. For example, if the Treasury Department tightens the beginning of construction rules to require a larger percentage payment or more extensive physical work, some early-stage strategies may no longer qualify.

What’s more, tax equity investors and strategic build-transfer purchasers typically don’t take construction or credit eligibility risk. That burden falls on developers. If the rules change after a down payment is made, it’s the developer, not the investor, who could be left with a project that does not qualify for the PTCs or ITCs.

In this environment, moving early is the right strategy; but it’s not a risk-free one. Renewable energy industry participants need to work closely with counsel to ensure documentation, contracts and construction activity all line up with current safe harbor practices.

Act now before the ground shifts

We’re in a moment where the incentives are clear, but the rules are shifting. Developers and sponsors have a narrow window, through the end of 2025, to lock in the beginning of construction under terms they understand. Beginning next year, the FEOC provisions apply and until the Treasury Department issues guidance, the requirements of the provisions, and practical ability to comply with them remain uncertain.

We’re advising clients to move fast, document carefully and avoid unnecessary exposure to future rulemaking wherever possible.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15569_1953.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 17:13:29.688922

Environmental activists, community members and local leaders on Thursday gathered in Southwest Detroit to speak out against the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken or outright eliminate key pollution protections.

In Kemeny Park, just a short distance from the Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s Detroit refinery, speakers slammed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin’s work to roll back rules on mercury and air pollution, end the good neighbor rule – intended to limit smog in communities located downwind from power plants and industrial facilities – and offer exemptions to Clean Air Act regulations.

Southwest Detroit is home to more than 150 manufacturing facilities, and its residents have long suffered from the impacts of air pollution with significantly higher rates for cancer, asthma and respiratory illness than the rest of the state.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is strongly tied to stroke and heart disease with some evidence linking pollution to diabetes, cognitive impairment, neurological diseases and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight.

But rather than strengthening pollution protections, the Trump administration is rolling them back, with environmentalists arguing the government is putting polluters first.

‘Extreme heat meets poor air quality’ in Detroit

“This isn’t just policy, it’s personal, and these rollbacks are literally going to cost lives,” said Meghan Richards, the assistant director of climate equity for Detroit’s Eastside Community Network.

While Southwest Detroit makes headlines for its exposure to pollution, residents of the city’s east side share many of the same burdens, Richards said.

“We have neighborhoods where folks can’t open their windows in the summer, extreme heat meets poor air quality, and where people are suffering silently, and it’s not just because they’re passive, but it’s because it’s really just a matter of survival for almost all of us,” Richards said.

These issues are only intensified by climate change, Richards said, with residents already suffering from systematic disinvestment, old infrastructure and environmental neglect.

“As temperature rises, so does the threat of pollution. Heat doesn’t just make us uncomfortable, it intensifies ground level ozone, triggering more asthma attacks, heart issues and emergency room visits. That’s especially dangerous for elders, children and people with chronic illnesses,” Richards said.

While Detroiters are resilient, resilience should not be code for abandonment, Richards said, arguing that giving big polluters the opportunity to opt out of regulations is sanctioning harm.

“We deserve more than survival. We deserve justice. We deserve to be able to live and enjoy and have peace and happiness. We need climate standards that protect – not punish – Black, brown and low-income communities who’ve historically borne the brunt of environmental racism. And I want to be very clear that the communities who are harmed the most have done the very least to cause the harm,” Richards said.

Detroit must fight pollution rollbacks: Santiago-Romero

Gabriela Santiago-Romero, Detroit city councilmember for the city’s sixth district, which includes Southwest Detroit, emphasized that behind every rollback is a child who will need to miss school, an elder struggling to breathe in the summer and families forced to choose between paying for medicine or paying for clean water.

While Santiago-Romero said she successfully pressed for a dust ordinance to require polluters to control the dust and particulate matter their facilities release, she stressed that the ordinance came directly from listening to residents.

“Environmental justice is not just a policy fight. It’s a people’s movement. We are a community who is going to continue to organize, and we need your voices at city hall. We need you to speak to your neighbors, to your schools, to let your folks know, your friends know, about the issues. With corporate polluters and now climate change roaring through our world, everyone’s fights in this movement is critical,” Santiago-Romero said.

In addition to strong federal regulations, Detroiters need support for clean energy to cut down on fossil fuel emissions, alongside bold local leadership to stand up for the people, she said.

As part of Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill,” Congress approved cuts to key clean energy provisions within former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, slashing tax incentives for solar and wind generation.

While Congress works to roll back progress and CEOs seek exemptions on pollution, Detroiters need to present a united front, Santiago-Romero said.

“This is the moment to fight back against the rollback, against the lies, against the idea that some communities are disposable. Detroit is not disposable. The people of Michigan are not disposable,” she said.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kemeny.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 17:13:07.911581

This legislation gives away $4.5 trillion in tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy while slashing vital programs. The legislation guts much of the Inflation Reduction Act, the nation’s largest climate investment, by repealing clean energy tax credits, ending incentives for electric vehicles, heat pumps and rooftop solar, and boosting fossil fuel development. Meanwhile, fossil fuel companies benefit from reduced royalties, mandatory lease sales on public lands and waters and billions in subsidies for carbon capture used to extract more oil. The bill is also expected to increase energy costs and eliminate hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. New fees on wind and solar development and a tax credit for coal production, regardless of where it occurs, underscore the bill’s pro-fossil fuel tilt. This bill does all of this while also taking away healthcare and food assistance from millions.

The bill’s impacts are staggering:

12 million Americans could lose health coverage, and 3 million more could lose food assistance.

Clean energy tax credits are set to expire in 2025, including incentives for rooftop solar and electric vehicles.

Power bills will rise by $110 next year and up to $400 annually by 2035.

Funding is slashed for National Parks, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), weakening our ability to respond to disasters and protect treasured landscapes.

It expands U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement’s (ICE) budget to historic levels, escalating attacks on immigrant communities.

We won some critical battles thanks to grassroots pressure. Public lands were spared from forced sales, a wind and solar tax was defeated and emissions standards survived. These are real victories. But make no mistake, this bill still represents a cruel and reckless vision for America. Policy reflects values. This bill prioritizes billionaires over everyday people, polluters over public health and short-term profit over our future.

Those days are gone.

The United States grid is flicking the switch on the biggest rebuild since Edison threaded copper through Manhattan.

Federal incentives, surging renewables, and record private backing are pumping billions into fresh megawatts. Behind the headline numbers sits a far more interesting story for engineers.

New projects mean new blueprints, new kit to commission, and a conveyor belt of roles that did not exist five years ago.

Wind technicians now outpace dental hygienists on the growth charts, battery storage has leapt from curiosity to multi gigawatt workhorse, and hydrogen hubs are hiring chemical graduates by the score.

Even nuclear is dusting itself off with small modular reactors that can slot inside a business park.

In short, if you can interpret a P&ID, automate a relay, or coax an inverter back online after a lightning strike, employers are queueing up.

This guide cuts through the noise.

We will explain why demand has exploded, which technologies are paying top dollar, and how you can position your career to surf the clean energy swell rather than watch it from the beach [1].

1. The Macro Shift, why energy is suddenly cool again

Picture the grid as a giant pie.

In 2020 gas grabbed the fattest slice, coal sulked in second place, and renewables nibbled the crust.

Fast forward to 2025 and the ratios look very different.

Coal’s share has fallen below 16%, wind and solar together generate more than 21%, and batteries have appeared as a brand new colour on the Energy Information Administration charts [1].

Three policy moves sit behind the change.

Inflation Reduction Act, the money tap

Ten year tax credits locked in by the Act give developers rare certainty. Analysts count more than three hundred and forty new clean energy factories and projects announced since it passed [1].

Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the cable upgrade

Sixty five billion dollars for transmission lines is not sexy but it is essential. Grain Belt Express in the Midwest and SunZia in the Southwest are only two examples of multi state routes that will carry wind and solar from remote plains to crowded cities [1].

State clean power mandates, the race to one hundred percent

Twenty one states plus the District of Columbia have promised fully clean grids by mid century, with California and New York aiming even earlier. No developer wants to be last to that party, so pipelines are stuffed with projects [1].

Combine policy with falling kit costs, ever larger turbines, and a corporate rush to decarbonise, and you get what Bloomberg calls a once in a generation hiring boom.

The United States added more than one hundred and fourteen thousand new clean energy jobs in a single year, outpacing the wider economy by more than two to one [1].

2. Technology spotlight, six arenas that are soaking up talent

Below is a snapshot of where the action is hottest.

Each technology brings a different balance of risk, reward, and required skill.

Wind, onshore and offshore

Onshore wind already spins more than 140GW, and the Department of Energy wants 330GW by 2035.

The result is a projected shortfall of 124,000 technicians if training fails to keep up [1].

Offshore, the Biden Administration targets 30GW by 2030.

Marine engineers, subsea cable specialists, and blade technicians who can work from boats are at the sharp end of new hiring sprees, particularly along the Atlantic seaboard [1].

Hot roles:

Wind turbine service technician (fastest growing job in the country, sixty percent growth predicted) [1]

Site operations engineer, maximising SCADA data to squeeze extra output

Substructure design engineer, transferring oil and gas foundation know‑how into monopiles and jackets

Utility-scale solar

Solar has doubled its share of the generation mix since 2020 and now matches hydropower for the first time [1].

Capacity will jump another 75% by 2025 according to Energy Information Administration forecasts.

Installers, project engineers, and grid interconnection specialists are in constant demand because construction pipelines run years deep.

Hot roles:

NABCEP certified solar designer, ensuring arrays pass utility scrutiny

Project manager for one hundred megawatt plus builds in the Sun Belt

SCADA engineer for solar plus storage hybrid sites

Battery energy storage

The grid now hosts 28GW of battery plants, and Energy Information Administration expects that number to top 65GW by 2027.

Batteries turn midday solar into prime time power and enable lucrative market arbitrage.

Projects complete in 12-18 months, so contractors prioritise speed and safe commissioning.

Hot roles:

Power systems engineer with NFPA 855 know‑how

Battery thermal management specialist, often ex automotive, now re‑worked for containerised packs

Energy markets analyst trading stored electrons across nodal price spreads

Green hydrogen

Tax credits worth up to three dollars per kilogram have jump started electrolyser orders.

Department of Energy modelling suggests as many as 700,000 hydrogen jobs by 2030 if hubs scale as planned [1].

Chemical and mechanical engineers who understand process safety and high pressure gases can name their salary.

Hot roles:

Electrolyser process engineer, fine tuning stack efficiency

Hydrogen storage and transport engineer, repurposing pipeline expertise

Operations technician monitoring purity and moisture in gas streams

Small modular reactors

The first new United States reactors in decades, Vogtle 3 and 4, entered service in Georgia, and demonstration programmes for Natrium and Xe‑100 are underway.

While the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects total nuclear employment to dip slightly, looming retirements create gaps, and advanced reactors bring fresh digital skill requirements.

Hot roles:

Reactor digital instrumentation engineer

Licensing specialist bridging Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules with new reactor physics

Construction integration manager converting coal plant real estate into modular nuclear sites

Carbon capture and storage

Richer 45Q tax credits are rebooting a technology once confined to academic slides.

Gas plants in Louisiana and Texas are filing permits to add capture units, and the first large direct air capture hubs are under construction.

Skills cross over heavily with petrochemicals.

Hot roles:

CO₂ pipeline integrity engineer

Solvent absorption process engineer

Subsurface reservoir geologist for sequestration wells

3. Skills and credentials that hiring managers truly value

Recruiters might scan résumés for degree titles, yet the projects that come out on top share three themes.

Digital literacy

Whether monitoring turbines via LIDAR or running predictive maintenance algorithms, data fluency is now a baseline, not a bonus. Engineers who can script in Python or R to query SCADA databases solve bottlenecks in days rather than weeks [1].

Cross‑technology agility

Employers prize engineers who can translate steam cycle acumen into hydrogen electrolysers or turbine aerodynamic maths into solar tracker kinematics. Demonstrated curiosity beats narrow specialism every time.

Compliance mindset

NERC operator certificates, OSHA 30 cards, and NFPA battery safety training still open doors faster than any buzzword. Advanced nuclear also leans heavily on Professional Engineer licences and Nuclear Regulatory Commission senior reactor operator credentials.

Soft power

Teams that communicate clearly hit milestones and size grid upgrades correctly first time.

Certifications that pay a premium

Certification Typical Salary Uplift NERC System Operator Extra 10-15% NABCEP PV Installation Professional Extra 8-12% GWO advanced rescue and blade repair Extra 5-10% Professional Engineer licence in structural or electrical Extra 15 for design approval authority

4. Where the jobs cluster

Clean energy has regional flavours.

Texas leads in wind, solar, and batteries thanks to vast open space and the quick moving ERCOT market [1].

California dominates storage and solar, driven by aggressive decarbonisation targets.

Midwest hydrogen hub states, notably Illinois and Indiana, expect a hiring spike as federal grants flow.

Georgia, Wyoming, and Washington host flagship nuclear projects and associated supply chains.

East Coast ports from New Jersey to Virginia are racing to secure offshore wind assembly yards, creating everything from welding apprenticeships to subsea cable design posts.

Remote-first culture is creeping into operations desks, but field work still requires boots on ground, so relocation stipends and 14 days on, 14 off rotations are back in fashion.

5. Pay and progression

Median pay in utility scale generation already sits well above the national average, and the bidding war for talent is nudging it higher.

Role Median Pay (USD) 75th Percentile Growth Outlook to 2030 Power plant operator, dispatch $104,000 $128,000 stable, retirements offset closures Wind turbine technician $62,600 $75,000 sixty percent growth Solar project engineer $95,000 $120,000 strong Battery storage control engineer $100,000 $130,000 very strong Hydrogen process engineer $110,000 $140,000 explosive Nuclear SMR commissioning lead $120,000 $150,000 solid, niche

Progression tends to follow one of two tracks.

Technicians climb into site supervisor roles within 3-5 years, often doubling pay.

Degree holders specialising in controls or grid integration can reach six figures inside 7 years by stepping into fleet optimisation or market trading teams.

Lateral moves, for example from solar Engineering Procurement Construction into battery storage, remain the fastest hack for a significant salary jump.

6. How to future proof your career

Add a data layer

Learn Pandas, dive into SCADA historians, and practice turning live feeds into dashboards managers can act on the same day.

Embrace multi‑disciplinary projects

Volunteer for the next battery retrofit at your gas plant, or help the hydrogen pilot on your refinery. Each crossover experience multiplies your options.

Keep certifications current

Set a calendar reminder for continuous professional development hours. Standards evolve quickly, especially around battery safety and hydrogen handling.

Network in the right rooms

Join the American Clean Power Association, battery meet ups, or nuclear young generation societies. The best roles circulate by word of mouth long before a recruiter advertises.

Champion diversity

The sector knows it has a diversity gap, and companies are rewarding staff who mentor, create inclusive hiring funnels, and build a workforce that reflects modern America.

7. Your action plan

Audit your skill gaps against the three big themes above.

Pick one technology vertical to deepen over the next six months.

Acquire the certificate that gives you the biggest pay bump quickest.

Update your LinkedIn headline to reflect that new specialism.

Reach out to Astute for tailored introductions to high growth employers.

The transition is happening with or without your CV in the mix.

Choose to be an early adopter and you will enjoy choice, leverage, and a salary trajectory that beats inflation by a clear margin.

Wait on the sidelines, and you may find yourself competing for shrinking legacy roles.

Energy is changing.

The smart move is to change with it.

Support Local Stories. Support Public Media.

Jupiter Bach, a Denmark-based company that manufactures nacelle covers and other components for wind turbines, currently employs about 240 people at its Gulf Coast facility. The company supplies components directly to GE Vernova, whose nearby plant assembles complete nacelles for wind energy projects across the country. The company had planned to grow its local workforce to more than 320 employees next year.

""Now we see a more flat year,"" said plant manager Sean Guidry.

The policy shift comes after President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law earlier this month. The legislation significantly shortens the eligibility window for wind and solar tax credits, which were previously locked in through 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Projects must now break ground by 2026 and enter service by 2027 to receive full tax benefits.

Those credits helped drive more than $70 million in investment at GE Vernova’s nacelle plant in Pensacola since 2023, as well as an additional $5 million that Jupiter Bach invested in its own operations nearby.

Guidry said his company had planned for an additional $1.2 million of investments to their Pensacola plant this year.

""Now those are in question,"" he said.

Guidry said the new policy introduces a level of uncertainty that’s already complicating long-term planning.

""It’s more about the world of uncertainty than it is order catalog,"" he said. ""Now we’re kind of focused on how to find our way around it.""

GE Vernova did not agree to an interview before publication. However, in April, CEO Scott Strazik spoke at a ribbon-cutting for the company’s new customer experience center in Pensacola and emphasized the facility’s importance to GE’s broader wind business.

""This is our largest site that we have in our wind business,"" Strazik told the crowd. ""That’s a $10 billion revenue business, in which this is our single biggest location. So it just matters a lot for us. And we’re committed to you.""

At the time, Strazik said the facility had the capacity to more than double its output and could one day employ more than 1,000 people.

In addition to compressing the window for clean energy credits, the new law also introduces restrictions on sourcing components from so-called ""foreign entities of concern,"" including China. That provision, combined with rising tariffs, is adding pressure to manufacturers like Jupiter Bach that rely on global supply chains for smaller parts.

Guidry said China has emerged as a dominant global supplier of low-cost steel components, making it difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete on price.

""These things that we see from tariffs are essentially just going to draw down on earnings potential,"" he added.

He said those costs are starting to reach consumers as tariff-affected goods work through inventories and hit store shelves.

Meanwhile, GE Vernova’s growing “repowering” business—which involves retrofitting older turbines—may help sustain some local demand, but Guidry said it won’t insulate suppliers like Jupiter Bach from the broader slowdown.

""Repower does insulate a little bit,"" he said, ""... but it’s minor for us.""

Together, GE Vernova, Jupiter Bach, and fellow supplier BlueWind Technology (which declined to comment for this story) anchor a clean energy cluster that local officials say is often overlooked. The sector supports more than 2,000 jobs in the region, including positions tied to port operations and logistics.

""We’re like one of the best-kept secrets in Pensacola,"" Guidry said.

He urged policymakers to view the wind energy sector not through a partisan lens, but as a key part of the U.S. manufacturing base and a strategic asset in the global energy transition.

""We should be looked at more in the light of energy independence, manufacturing jobs in the United States,"" he said.

Guidry also warned that without reliable federal support for energy infrastructure, the U.S. could lose ground in fast-growing global industries that depend on abundant, low-cost electricity, like artificial intelligence.

(For a comprehensive analysis of the bill, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Trump Signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 3, 2025.) Although few provisions directly reference Tribal governments or their members, several could impact Indian Country. Work also remains because with the OBBB, Congress failed to address long-standing Tribal tax priorities.

This Holland & Knight alert offers an overview of several provisions included in the OBBB that will likely impact Tribal governments and their members. Following the overview is a brief description of several Tribal tax priorities that remain pending before the U.S. Congress.

Adoption Tax Credit Parity Provision

Section 23 of the Code provides a tax credit to parents for certain adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs and attorney fees (Adoption Tax Credit). Individuals who adopt a child with a special need are often eligible for the full credit even if they pay no adoption expenses that would qualify for the credit. Before the OBBB's passage, only states could determine that a child had a special need. Under the OBBB, Tribal governments now have the same authority to determine that a child has a special need for purposes of the Adoption Tax Credit. This increases access to the full Adoption Tax Credit for taxpayers who adopt a child when a Tribal government has determined that the child has a special need, correcting a longstanding Tribal parity issue in the Code. This provision was included in the Tribal Tax and Investment and Reform Act of 2025 (discussed below) and is the only provision from that bill to be included in the OBBB.

New Tax Deduction for Seniors

Under the OBBB, taxpayers aged 65 and older are entitled to a new deduction of up to $6,000. The new deduction begins phasing down when the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 (or $150,000 in the case of a joint return). This new deduction goes into effect for the 2025 tax year and will sunset at the end of 2028.

Deduction for Tipped Workers and Overtime Pay

The OBBB offers tax relief to many tipped workers and those who earn overtime pay. Under the OBBB, both provisions will sunset at the end of 2028.

Deduction for Tipped Workers

The OBBB created new Section 224 of the Code. Under Section 224, individuals who receive cash tips in an occupation that ""customarily and regularly received tips"" as of the end of 2024 may claim a deduction of up to $25,000. The new law does not provide a definition for occupations that ""customarily and regularly received tips""; however, it requires that the U.S. Department of the Treasury issue a list of occupations that customarily and regularly received tips as of the end of 2024.

The new deduction for tipped workers begins phasing down when the tipped worker's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 in the case of a joint return). The deduction is allowed only for qualified tips that are included on a W-2 or information statement furnished to the individual by their employer showing the portion of payments reasonably designated as cash tips and the occupation of the person receiving such tips. Employers should take notice of this requirement, as it will require changes to information statements.

To qualify for this deduction, individual taxpayers must have a Social Security number. Additionally, if married, individuals must file their taxes on a joint return.

Given that many Tribal governments employ tipped workers at casinos, restaurants and other establishments, this new law could be very beneficial. However, Tribes and their casinos that have tip agreements with the IRS should consider potential implications.

Deduction for Overtime Pay

The OBBB also provides for a new deduction of up to $12,500 (or $25,000 in the case of a joint return) for ""qualified overtime compensation"" received by an individual. New Section 225 of the Code defines ""qualified overtime compensation"" as overtime compensation paid to the individual that is required under Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

Similar to the tipped worker deduction, the overtime pay deduction begins phasing down when an individual's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 in the case of a joint return). For an individual to claim the deduction, his or her employer must also include the portion of any payments that are qualified overtime compensation on a W-2 or information statement furnished to the individual. Additionally, as with the tipped worker deduction, individuals must have a Social Security number and, if married, they must file their taxes on a joint return.

Provisions Affecting the New Markets Tax Credit, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and Opportunity Zones

The OBBB permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit and permanently renews Opportunity Zones. It also increases allocations for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and modifies Opportunity Zones by imposing stricter eligibility requirements and providing enhanced benefits for rural investments. These programs have incentivized investments in economically distressed areas, including many Tribal lands. As such, Tribal governments may wish to consider how the OBBB's provisions related to these programs may benefit Tribal communities.

Rescissions of IRA Funds

The OBBB additionally repeals unobligated funds from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for a host of federal programs, including the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Under that program, the U.S. Department of Energy secretary could provide loan guarantees to federally recognized Tribes for amounts due on loans for energy development projects. The OBBB eliminates funding from numerous other programs funded under the IRA, including grant programs for transmission deployment and siting. Additionally, the OBBB scales back many of the IRA's clean energy tax credits and incentives, which Tribal governments had increasingly explored due to the availability of direct pay.

Further information about these and other similar changes is provided in Holland & Knight's Comprehensive Analysis of the OBBB, as well as its previous alert on the OBBB's impacts on IRS clean energy tax credits.

Modifications to Gambling Tax Law

The OBBB also reduces the amount of gambling losses individuals may deduct on their annual tax returns. Under previous law, individuals could deduct 100 percent of their gambling losses up to the extent of their gambling winnings. Following the OBBB's passage, individuals may deduct only up to 90 percent of their losses as of the 2026 tax year.

To demonstrate how this change may affect taxpayers, consider, for example, an individual who has $100,000 in gains from gambling and $100,000 in losses from gambling. Previously, under Section 165(d) of the Code, that individual could fully deduct all $100,000 of his or her gambling losses, leaving the individual with a zero-dollar net effect. Beginning in 2026, that same individual is limited to a deduction of $90,000 (90 percent of $100,000), leaving the individual with $10,000 of tax gain from gambling despite having no economic gain. This change may increase taxes on frequent and professional gamblers and could carry with it implications for Tribal casinos.

Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025

As previously discussed, the OBBB included one provision aimed at providing tax parity to Tribal governments related to the Adoption Tax Credit. However, a number of Tribal tax priorities remain unaddressed.

Introduced by Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025 (S. 2022) includes Tribal government parity provisions in the areas of tax-exempt bond financing, excise tax exemptions, employee plan administration, Tribal charity funding and child support enforcement, among others. Below is a discussion of three of S. 2022's proposed changes.

Tax-Exempt Bonds

Specifically, the bond reforms would address certain limits on Tribal governments' ability to issue tax-exempt bonds under the Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status Act of 1983 and current Section 7871 of the Code. Essentially, current law prohibits Tribal governments from issuing tax-exempt private activity bonds in most circumstances, and it limits tax-exempt bond status to bonds when ""substantially all"" of the proceeds from their issuance will be issued in the ""exercise of any essential governmental function."" Currently, Section 7871(e) provides that ""essential governmental function(s)"" do not include ""any function which is not customarily performed by State and local governments with general taxing powers.""

S. 2022 would amend Section 7871 to remove many restrictions placed on Tribal governments' ability to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds. It would also eliminate the ""essential government function"" test, providing Tribal governments increased access to tax-exempt financing opportunities for commercial projects. This would provide additional parity with state and local governments that already have access to these types of tax-exempt financing opportunities.

Pensions

Next, certain pension reforms included in S. 2022 would expand the definition of a ""governmental plan"" to include plans established by entities ""wholly owned or controlled"" by Tribal governments and eliminate the essential governmental function test currently in Section 414(d) of the Code. This change – and other similar changes proposed in S. 2022 – should help ensure that more types of pension and employee benefits for Tribal entity employees are administered in the same manner as benefits provided to employees of state governments, providing parity for Tribal governments while reducing administrative burdens.

Social Security Benefits

Tribal governments should also take note of the impact this legislation would have on Indian General Welfare Benefits programs. Notably, S. 2022 includes provisions that would impact how these benefits are treated by the Social Security Administration, including for purposes of determining eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If enacted, S. 2022 would exclude Indian General Welfare Benefits from counting as ""income"" for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI, as well as certain Medicaid programs and benefit programs administered by states. Additionally, it would exclude any Indian General Welfare Benefits from counting as ""resources"" for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility for the nine-month period after the General Welfare Benefit is received. Tribal governments with minors' trusts would also benefit, as grantor trusts for which the Tribe is the grantor would be excluded from resources for SSI purposes.

Tribal governments should lend their support to S. 2022, as it would have broad implications for their members, help lift up their economies and reduce administrative burdens.

The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.”

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the Playing Field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

Only GM has set a sales target — 100 percent electric vehicles globally by 2035 — that aligns with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But the report authors argued that such commitments are of limited use without specific transition plans, such as vehicle sales targets, to back them up.
VW included the emissions of a high-emissions subsidiary — Traton, which produces trucks and buses — in its annual inventory for the first time.","Uncertainty around plans by major car manufacturers to phase out internal combustion engines is one of several shortcomings undermining the sector’s transition to net zero, said researchers who conducted a detailed analysis of five leading automotive companies.

The team from the NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch, two European nonprofits, also highlighted several developments by the companies that they describe as encouraging and worth replicating. Yet overall, the researchers concluded, the companies are “making inadequate progress in accelerating the long-overdue transition to electric mobility.”

The researchers compared the net-zero plans of five manufacturers — Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and Volkswagen — with a transition framework for the industry developed by the NewClimate Institute. By far the most critical component in the framework is the reduction of tailpipe emissions, which can be achieved by transitioning to electric vehicles. Switching to low-carbon steel, aluminum and batteries are other components.

Viewed through the framework, the companies’ commitments appear well short of what’s required. Only GM has set a sales target — 100 percent electric vehicles globally by 2035 — that aligns with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Other targets are delayed (Ford will “work toward” 100 percent EVs by 2040), regionally specific (Stellantis’ 100 percent target applies only to the U.S.) or incomplete (VW and Toyota have committed to selling more EVs, but not to reaching 100 percent).

All five companies have committed to reaching net-zero emissions: Stellantis has the earliest target year, 2038; Toyota and VW the latest, 2050. But the report authors argued that such commitments are of limited use without specific transition plans, such as vehicle sales targets, to back them up.

“Emissions reduction targets are only helpful to a certain degree, in that they paint a picture of where a company wants to be in terms of outcomes,” said Saskia Straub, a climate policy analyst at the New Climate Institute. “But they don’t tell us how they are planning to reach those outcomes.”

The absence of 1.5C-aligned EV sales targets is also notable given the latest draft of the Science Based Target initiative’s (SBTi) automotive sector standard requires companies to commit to 100 percent low-emission vehicle sales by 2030 in advanced economies, and by 2040 globally. The draft is open for consultation until August 11,

Asked to comment on the lack of sales targets and other issues in the report, VW stated its commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and Ford referred to the company’s latest sustainability report. GM, Stellantis and Toyota did not share a response. But uncertain demand for EVs in some territories is a known issue, with consumers remaining concerned about access to charging points and put off by the higher price tag on EVs. Demand in the U.S. is likely to take a further hit in September when the federal tax credit for EVs, which is worth a maximum of $7,500, is eliminated.

Despite the overall misalignment between the manufacturers’ actions and 1.5C pathways, Straub and colleagues identified several bright spots in the companies’ plans:

Stellantis has improved the transparency of its net-zero goal by setting an interim absolute emissions target: the company aims to cut emissions to 20 percent below 2021 levels by 2030.

Ford and GM have committed to purchasing 10 percent near-zero or low-carbon steel and aluminum by 2030.

Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, R-W.Va., along with Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore voted to phase out the tax incentives.
A growing industry is at risk West Virginia has one of the smallest but fastest-growing clean energy workforces in the country.
Repealing certain clean energy tax credits has raised concerns with businesses, said Steve Roberts, president of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce.
Another one of those clean energy projects, Form Energy’s factory in Weirton, is already reshaping the economy of the Northern Panhandle.","Developers have started building solar fields, wind farms and renewable energy storage plants across the state, expecting to bring thousands of jobs spurred by federal tax incentives and billions in private investment.

But earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed his “Big, Beautiful Bill” into law, repealing several tax incentives for solar, wind and clean energy manufacturing, just as the sector was taking off.

Created by 2022 federal legislation, those credits helped drive millions of federal dollars into West Virginia’s growing clean energy economy.

And without them, the state stands to lose nearly 10,500 jobs by 2030, according to an analysis from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a clean energy think tank.

“You can look at the success we’ve had here in West Virginia utilizing these tax credits to create jobs, growth and opportunity,” said Mitch Carmichael, former economic development secretary and Republican state Senate president.

The incentives helped keep utility bills down for residential customers, but he said they got caught in a “climate ideology debate.”

“Why on Earth would anyone want to raise the cost of energy?” said Carmichael, who lobbied federal lawmakers and President Trump to preserve the incentives.

Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, R-W.Va., along with Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore voted to phase out the tax incentives.

In an email, a Capito spokesperson pointed to her efforts to preserve hydrogen tax credits. The rest of West Virginia’s congressional delegation did not respond to questions.

Josh Sword, president of the WV-AFL-CIO, said West Virginia was set to gain the most from these clean energy projects, as the state historically relied on coal and natural gas.

“In a lot of ways, we will be starting from scratch,” he said.

A growing industry is at risk

West Virginia has one of the smallest but fastest-growing clean energy workforces in the country.

More than 10,000 West Virginians now work in wind, solar, electric vehicle production and battery storage, according to the U.S. Department of Energy Jobs Report.

And the Inflation Reduction Act was key to that growth. The bill was a nearly trillion-dollar investment to combat inflation, rising prescription costs and climate change.

The bill included tax credits for companies investing in renewable energy. The credits were aimed at advanced manufacturing, hydrogen production and clean electricity.

Since its passage, over $5 billion of investment and more than 5,000 jobs have been announced in West Virginia’s growing clean energy and transportation sector.

About 17 facilities have been in development, and seven have already begun manufacturing, according to data from the Clean Investment Monitor.

The phaseout of some of the credits under the Trump administration is set to begin immediately. Other solar and wind energy projects will have to speed up development or risk missing out.

Repealing certain clean energy tax credits has raised concerns with businesses, said Steve Roberts, president of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. But he said many of the incentives will remain in place long enough to ease a transition.

“Tax credits can absolutely be a factor in attracting or retaining business in West Virginia,” he said.

Just last month, Clearway Energy announced a $400 million wind development in Tucker and Grant counties to power thousands of homes by 2027, marking continued growth in the sector.

Meanwhile, in Jackson County, BHE Renewables is building a massive solar microgrid to store energy and to help power a new titanium manufacturing plant.

The $500 million investment is also set to be completed by 2027. If construction begins before a newly-imposed deadline, the project would still qualify for solar or clean manufacturing tax credits.

Another one of those clean energy projects, Form Energy’s factory in Weirton, is already reshaping the economy of the Northern Panhandle.

Two decades after the closure of the Weirton Steel Mill, the roar of blast furnaces has been replaced by the hydraulic hiss of robotic arms.

“This town was built in iron, and now it’s being rebuilt on it,” Ray Larkey, one of more than 400 employees, said in a promotional video.

The plant produces iron-air batteries, a new technology aiming to reshape how renewable energy is stored. The company is one of the largest clean energy employers in the state and expects to supply 750 jobs by the end of the decade.

As the company is preparing to deploy its first commercial-scale battery system in the coming months, Form Energy spokesperson Sarah Bray said it has not yet received federal tax credits.

The tax credit is nonrefundable, meaning the amount of credit you receive can’t exceed the amount of tax you owe.
However, the tax credit does include a “carry forward” provision, meaning any unused credit could reduce your tax bill in future years.
Claiming the solar tax credit in 2025 Tax credits for clean energy residential projects were first introduced in 2005, but 2025 will be the final year that taxpayers can claim this credit.
That means customers could save if they decide to go solar — even after the residential clean energy credit expires.","If you’ve been debating whether it’s time to “go solar” on your home, you better go call a residential solar installation company — and soon. You only have until the end of the year to take advantage of a federal tax credit that allows homeowners to claim up to 30 percent of eligible solar-related costs as a tax break.

If that feels like a tight deadline to get solar panels installed on your home, it probably is. While there had been plans to phase out the residential clean energy credit over the next decade, the massive tax bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 eliminated it altogether as of the end of this year.

The current tax credit covers up to 30 percent of eligible costs to invest in renewable energy for your home — and it’s been a popular credit among homeowners. In 2023 alone, more than 1.2 million taxpayers claimed the residential clean energy tax credit — for projects that include solar panels, wind energy, and more — receiving an average tax break of nearly $5,100, according to IRS data.

For solar panel installation projects, which accounted for more than 65 percent of residential clean energy credit claims in 2023, the timeframe for getting the system up and running can vary widely state-by-state. It takes about 45 days, on average, from the time a sale is completed until the homeowner receives permission from their utility provider to operate solar panels, according to Benjamin Airth, policy director at Freedom Forever, which does residential solar panel installations in more than 30 states.

“In any state with any contractor, if you were to go solar today, you’d be almost guaranteed to get the tax credit as long as you don’t have any barriers that hold up the project from getting installed,” Airth says. But given the nuances that can delay timing in various jurisdictions, it’s still a good idea to “move on that” plan soon, he says.

While the amount of the tax credit has been reduced during its 20-year lifespan, it’s never been completely eliminated like now — and that might mean a rush to get these projects completed this year.

Solar installers in the greater Chicago area, according to anecdotal reports, are “loaded down” with project requests, says Mark Luscombe, a CPA and principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting in Chicago. “Unfortunately, you might be out of luck already.”

But it may still be possible to claim this credit — or the energy efficient home improvement credit that’s also expiring at year-end. Here’s what you need to know.

What is the solar tax credit?

The clean energy credit is often referred to as the solar panel tax credit or the federal solar tax credit, but it actually applies to a broad variety of clean energy projects.

Its official name is the residential clean energy credit, and this tax break allows homeowners to claim up to 30 percent of eligible expenses for the following qualified projects:

Solar electric panels

Solar water heaters

Wind turbines

Geothermal heat pumps

Fuel cells

Battery storage technology

Because this tax credit has no annual or lifetime dollar limit, taxpayers were able to claim it each year they made clean energy improvements to their residence. To be eligible for this credit, you must directly own the equipment — you can’t lease it. The tax credit is nonrefundable, meaning the amount of credit you receive can’t exceed the amount of tax you owe. However, the tax credit does include a “carry forward” provision, meaning any unused credit could reduce your tax bill in future years. (Read more on this IRS page.)

Claiming the solar tax credit in 2025

Tax credits for clean energy residential projects were first introduced in 2005, but 2025 will be the final year that taxpayers can claim this credit. While this tax credit was previously scheduled to be in effect until 2034, with phase outs beginning in 2033, it will no longer be available after Dec. 31, 2025.

What work, exactly, needs to be completed by the end of the year to claim this credit? The language the IRS uses is a little vague, Airth notes, as the agency refers to the projects being placed “in service” during the calendar year. If solar panels have been installed, but a homeowner hasn’t yet received permission from their utility provider to use them, there could be a risk this year that eligible expenses might not be covered, he says.

That said, a separate tax credit for companies that offer leases of solar panel equipment is still in effect through 2027, and those savings are passed along to customers as lower costs in their lease agreement, Airth says. That means customers could save if they decide to go solar — even after the residential clean energy credit expires.

What’s more, as noted above, the residential clean energy tax credit covers eligible expenses beyond solar panel installation, and you may not face such a time crunch with completing other types of projects by year-end. But any additional expenses you incur after this year won’t be eligible for a tax credit, Luscombe says.

Changes to other clean energy tax credits

For taxpayers who have been debating a switch to clean energy for their homes or vehicles — and want to receive a tax break in the process — the incentives to do so will end this year. Two other tax credits were eliminated as a result of the tax megabill:

Electric vehicle (EV) tax credit: This popular tax break offers a $7,500 credit for taxpayers who purchase a new electric vehicle and a $4,000 credit for purchasing a used EV. But there’s an even tighter deadline to take advantage, as this federal tax credit is being eliminated for any electric vehicle purchased after Sept. 30.

Energy efficient home improvement credit: This federal tax incentive offers a 30 percent credit to those taxpayers who make qualified energy-efficient improvements to their home — up to $3,200 each year. As with the residential clean energy credit, this program will be eliminated after Dec. 31, 2025.

What is the energy efficient home improvement credit?

As the name implies, the energy efficient home improvement credit offers a tax break to cover up to 30 percent of eligible expenses for a wide variety of projects, including replacing doors, windows, and insulation.

While the credit maxes out at $3,200 per year, there is no lifetime dollar limit, meaning that taxpayers could claim up to the maximum annual credit every year they made eligible improvements.

That said, the credit has much lower dollar limits on specific types of projects. For example, the maximum credit for installing energy efficient windows is $600 a year and exterior doors are limited to $250 each, with a maximum $500-per-year credit for doors. (Read more on this IRS page.)

This credit also expires on Dec. 31, 2025, though these types of projects are generally more feasible than solar panel installation to achieve in that shortened time period.

What does the end of tax breaks mean for the future of clean energy?

Combined, the elimination of the residential clean energy credit and the energy efficient home improvement credit will add up to lost dollars for taxpayers as these were popular tax breaks, Luscombe says.

One of the arguments in favor of eliminating these federal tax breaks was that the savings from switching to clean energy is sufficient such that taxpayers no longer need a tax credit to be incentivized, he adds. “We’ll see if there’s any truth to that.”

From Airth’s perspective, the elimination of these tax breaks has undeniably created concern in the solar industry about what adoption rates will look like going forward. “We’re trying to figure out: Where do we go from here?”

Incentives still available at the state level

That said, there are still some incentives for taxpayers who want to go solar, as state and local governments offer programs to help offset the high upfront costs of installation. Solar incentives by state vary widely and may include rebates, rather than a tax break.

Some states also offer tax breaks for people who make energy-efficient improvements to their home or switch to an electric vehicle. While the elimination of the federal tax credits is significant, policies that benefit these types of residential projects are happening at the state and local level — and Airth says the focus in the solar industry will shift to how to cut red tape to speed up these projects and ensure the industry is immune to the type of policy shifts that just occurred.

Even though these tax credits were eliminated much sooner than the planned phase-out, they could be revived in the future under a different administration, Luscombe says.

Finally, most taxpayers will benefit from the megabill’s extension of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were set to expire — more so than the elimination of some tax credits, he says. “There are some pluses in there for taxpayers.”",https://www.bankrate.com/brp/2025/07/18133950/GettyImages-1368229731.png,N,,2025-07-18 17:11:42.134893

Cox Foundation. This transformational gift, made to Ducks Unlimited (DU), will directly fund projects that restore wetlands, enhance wildlife habitat, and create natural buffers to protect communities from severe storms and rising waters. This gift follows an earlier $1.1M grant made by the Foundation to preserve nearly 20,000 acres of Louisiana wetlands.

“Restoring wetlands in coastal Louisiana and Texas is critically important to the future of North America’s waterfowl, other wildlife, and people, yet these habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate,” said Cassidy Lejune, DU Director of Conservation Programs – S. Louisiana. “In the next year, DU plans to invest more than $61 million to impact over 40,000 acres across the Western Gulf Coast. While much of that is competitive public funding, it must be unlocked with private dollars. That’s why this gift from the James M. Cox Foundation, coupled with our ongoing partnership with Cox across the country, is so impactful. It will accelerate efforts to ensure that future generations can experience the abundant resources this landscape has to offer.”

The Foundation’s $2.5 million grant to DU marks the continuation of its long-term commitment to restoring America’s wetlands.

“As a native of South Louisiana, I am deeply grateful for this gift from the James M. Cox Foundation, and proud of Cox’s longstanding relationship with Ducks Unlimited,” said Jeff Breaux, chief commercial officer for Cox Communications. “Conservation initiatives like these are highly critical — as is their impact on the safety, sustainability and future of our communities.""

Jim Kennedy, chairman emeritus of Cox Enterprises and chairman, James M. Cox Foundation, is Ducks Unlimited’s single-largest donor. In honor of Kennedy’s philanthropic legacy, Cox Enterprises recently announced a $100 million gift for Ducks Unlimited’s land trust, Wetlands America Trust, to help conserve North America’s prairie pothole region. Previous grants from the Cox Foundation have supported conservation in Louisiana and around the Chesapeake Bay.

“Being a good steward and actively caring for the environment is one of the many ways Cox supports our communities,” said Breaux. “With Mr. Kennedy’s and the Foundation’s whole-hearted support, we’re able to expand our impact even further.”

The Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Germany has broken the record for plasma duration in a nuclear fusion reactor.

Fusion reactions were sustained at high performance levels for 43 seconds, which is a major breakthrough in plasma physics.

Unlike nuclear fission (which involves uranium), nuclear fusion only needs hydrogen ions and produces no toxic waste.

Nuclear energy as we know it today is generated through fission—the process of splitting atomic nuclei, which produces electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. The problem? Fission also creates radioactive waste as a byproduct of using uranium fuel.

That’s where nuclear fusion—or, at least, the promise of it—comes in.

Nuclear fusion is the same process that powers stars, like our Sun. Inside a star, hydrogen nuclei slam together under intense pressure and heat, fusing into helium and releasing a huge burst of energy. Scientists have long wanted to recreate fusion on Earth because it could deliver clean, virtually limitless power with no carbon emissions and much less radioactive waste than today’s nuclear plants.

Fusion reactors are still very much in the experimental stage, and scientists mostly focused on developing a kind of reactor called a tokamak, which uses magnetic coils to confine plasma in a donut-shaped chamber by generating a magnetic field. But the other serious design contender is called a stellarator.

Stellarators are more complex than tokamaks—especially when it comes to their magnetic coils—but they’re also more flexible. They can sustain plasma with less power and have design features that make controlling that plasma easier. The Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Germany is one such monster, and it recently smashed a record in ... well, atom smashing.

In a recent experiment, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics sustained a stable plasma reaction in the Wendelstein 7-X for 43 seconds, reaching the “triple product” performance level that’s required for viable nuclear fusion and achieving the all-time best results for any stellarator.

Maybe 43 seconds doesn’t sound like much, but it’s now the longest plasma duration ever in nuclear fusion, including tokamaks. Previously, the now-defunct JT60U Tokamak in Japan and the JET European Tokamak in the U.K—which boasted triple the plasma volume—held the records for plasma duration.

The triple product measures how close a fusion reactor is to reaching self-sustaining ‘breakeven’ energy production levels—the point at which a reactor produces more energy than it consumes. The three factors that go into the triple product are the density of ionized particles flowing through hot plasma, the temperature of ions being fused, and energy confinement time (how long it takes for heat to escape plasma that’s not heated again). Longer confinement times mean better insulation.

Unlike fission reactors, which use heavy elements such as uranium, fusion reactors rely on lighter elements (like the hydrogen ions deuterium and tritium), which help them avoid creating toxic nuclear waste.

The fuel injector for Wendelstein 7-X was created exclusively for this stellarator by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has also been instrumental in advancing other types of reactors. Several European laboratories—including the Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT) in Spain and Budapest’s HUN-REN Center for Energy Research—contributed to the development of the fuel pellets.

As plasma was heated with microwaves over those record-breaking 43 seconds, the fuel injector provided the stellarator with 90 pellets of frozen hydrogen ions. The microwave heating system used electron cyclotron resonance—the most effective method for fusion, which uses electromagnetic waves to heat and ionize plasma to temperatures that (in this case) reached a scorching 30 million degrees Celsius (about 54 million degrees Fahrenheit). Because success depended on balancing heating with pulses of incoming fuel, the pellet injector was programmed with automatic pulse rates, which is an unprecedented move.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/abstract-sphere-and-circle-with-fluctuating-lines-royalty-free-image-1752781514.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.877xh;0,0.0532xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-07-18 17:12:34.638378

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, represents a major step forward in the United States’ efforts to combat climate change, drive economic growth, and promote sustainability. The IRA offers businesses across the country the opportunity to reduce tax liability through Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and Production Tax Credits (PTCs).

With over $369 billion allocated to clean energy investments, the IRA includes new incentives while extending and expanding existing ones. This makes it a vital resource for businesses looking to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of clean energy tax benefits. These incentives play a critical role in helping the U.S. reach its environmental goals by encouraging the adoption of clean energy technologies.

Who Can Qualify for ITC and PTC Tax Credits?

Both the ITC and PTC are available to a broad range of entities, including for-profit businesses, nonprofits, local governments, and even individuals. The eligibility requirements vary based on the type of credit and the technology being used.

Investment Tax Credit (ITC): Businesses, nonprofits and local governments can benefit as long as they invest in qualifying renewable energy technologies. This includes systems such as solar, wind, geothermal, and energy storage technologies. Businesses that adopt these technologies can use the ITC to reduce their tax liabilities, thereby lowering the overall cost of their investment. Additionally, nonprofit and tax-exempt entities can use the elective pay option to monetize certain tax credits.

Production Tax Credit (PTC): Available to companies that produce energy from renewable sources or manufacture certain eligible clean energy systems. The PTC works by offering a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for the energy generated from renewable sources, meaning that businesses can continue to receive tax benefits as long as their renewable energy systems are operational and producing energy.

Do You Need to Meet Some Requirements?

To qualify for the full Investment Tax Credit or Production Tax Credit, businesses must meet certain new requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Key Requirements

Prevailing wage and apprenticeship, which means workers on the project – including those from contractors and subcontractors – must be paid local prevailing wages. A portion of the work must also be done by registered apprentices. Failure to meet the requirements will result in a business being limited to only the base credit instead of the increased amount. However, businesses can fix wage shortfalls by paying owed wages plus interest and penalties. For apprenticeships, there’s a “good faith effort” exception if businesses try to hire apprentices but are unable to do so.

The IRA also offers bonus credits for businesses that meet certain conditions.

Bonus Requirements

Domestic Content Rule

The structural steel and iron products used in a project must be produced completely in the U.S.

A certain adjusted percentage of the manufactured products in an energy facility must be mined, produced or manufactured in the U.S.

Energy Communities

Extra credits for projects built in energy communities, such as former coal mining areas, and for small wind and solar projects in low-income areas.

What Are the Financial Benefits of Clean Energy Tax Credits?

The financial benefits of clean energy tax credits can be transformative for businesses, especially in the current economic climate. By taking full advantage of the ITC and PTC, businesses can significantly lower the upfront costs of adopting renewable energy technologies and reduce ongoing energy expenses.

For example, if you’re a business owner interested in adopting solar energy technology, the Federal Investment Tax Credit is one of the smartest ways to cut the cost of your installation by 30 percent, as well as reduce your federal taxable income liability.

The PTC, while structured differently, offers long-term benefits. The credit is based on the amount of clean energy a business produces. For example, businesses receive a per-kilowatt-hour credit for the electricity generated from renewable sources like wind. Over time, this credit can add up to significant savings for energy-intensive companies. For businesses that rely heavily on energy for production, manufacturing or other activities, the PTC offers a way to offset energy costs while helping the environment.

These tax credits help cover both the upfront costs and ongoing production expenses of energy projects, making renewable energy investments more affordable. By lowering financial barriers, they encourage private investment, create jobs, drive innovation, and speed up the adoption of clean energy technologies, ultimately supporting carbon reduction and long-term energy sustainability.

How Accountants Can Maximize the Business Benefits of Adopting Clean Energy

A crucial function of accountants is strategically planning to ensure clients benefit fully from ITCs and PTCs:

Evaluate Eligibility: A deep understanding of eligibility criteria ensures clients qualify for the right incentives. Accountants can identify opportunities to integrate these credits into a client’s long-term financial plan.

Analyze Project Documentation: A thorough review of project documentation, such as invoices, contracts, purchase orders, and construction cost breakdown, is critical for accountants to ensure clients maximize the tax credits and be at ease of IRS audits and recapture risks.

Monetizing Tax Credits: Accountants help unlock cash benefits for tax-exempt entities such as nonprofits, municipalities, and tribal entities using a Direct Pay or Elective Payment method. For-profit businesses can monetize the credit by selling credits to third parties (credit transferability) or using tax equity financing to bring in investors who can use the tax credits.

Maximize Combined Incentives: Beyond ITCs and PTCs, accountants should look for additional federal, state or local incentives that can be layered with these credits, optimizing financial outcomes.

By focusing on developing a strategy for clean energy tax credits, accountants can help clients avoid costly mistakes and ensure they fully leverage the available incentives and maximize tax savings.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/239165771_l.png,N,,2025-07-18 17:12:14.521198

OBBBA extends many of the policies first enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), rolls back several renewable energy incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and introduces new rules that will impact individuals, domestic and multi-national businesses, business owners, and nonprofit organizations. This alert provides an overview of some of the key provisions included in OBBBA.

Business Tax Provisions

Restoration of 100% Bonus Depreciation

OBBBA permanently restores 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property (e.g., machinery and equipment) acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, repealing the TCJA’s phase-down that began in 2023.

Bonus Depreciation for Qualified Manufacturing Facilities

OBBBA enacts a new bonus depreciation election allowing the immediate expensing of 100% of the cost basis of “qualified production property” (e.g., manufacturing facilities placed in service in the United States), if construction commences after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029, and the asset is placed in service before January 1, 2031.

Increased Limitation on Interest Deductions

OBBBA makes favorable adjustments to the interest deduction rules by permanently restoring the pre-2022 deduction cap on interest expenses with respect to debt incurred in a trade or business to generally 30% of a taxpayer’s EBITDA (as opposed to 30% of EBIT, as required under prior law).

Permanency of Qualified Business Income Deduction

OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income (QBI) (generally, business income other than employee income and income from certain service businesses) and expands the phase-in thresholds.

Immediate Research and Experimental Expensing

Since 2022, taxpayers have been required to amortize expenditures related to research and experimental (R&E) activities conducted in the United States over a five-year amortization schedule (foreign-based R&E expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year amortization schedule). OBBBA permanently allows taxpayers to deduct 100% of expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2024, with respect to research and experimental activities conducted in the United States (capitalization requirements for foreign-based R&E expenses are not modified). Certain small business taxpayers may be eligible to retroactively deduct R&E expenses for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. Other taxpayers may elect to deduct any remaining unamortized amount with respect to domestic R&E expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2025. Taxpayers should discuss with their tax advisors whether they qualify to retroactively expense capitalized R&E or otherwise accelerate the remaining amortizable amount of such expenses.

Increased Expensing Limitations

Under prior law, taxpayers could elect to fully expense 100% of the cost of certain qualifying property (generally, machinery and equipment), as opposed to depreciating such costs over a depreciation schedule. For 2025, this is subject to a $1,250,000 cap on such expensing and a phase-down if the qualifying property costs exceed $3,130,000. For property placed in service after December 31, 2024, OBBBA expands expensing limitations by increasing (1) the $1,250,000 cap under the TCJA to $2,500,000 and (2) the phase-down threshold under the TCJA to $4,000,000, with these numbers being subject to annual inflation adjustments.

Qualified Small Business Stock Gains

OBBBA provides a three-tiered gain exclusion for qualified small business stock (QSBS), offering (1) 50% if the stock is held for three years, (2) 75% if held for four years, and (3) 100% if held for five years. In addition, OBBBA increases the gross asset cap for QSBS issuers from $50 million to $75 million (indexed for inflation) and raises the per-issuer gain exclusion cap to $15 million (also indexed), thereby extending QSBS exclusion eligibility. These changes only apply to stock acquired after the date of OBBBA’s enactment.

Extended Limit on Excess Business Losses

Under prior law, non-corporate taxpayers were subject to disallowance of “excess business losses,” which generally are net business losses that exceed certain threshold amounts as adjusted for inflation. OBBBA makes permanent the disallowance of a non-corporate taxpayer’s excess business loss (the threshold amount for 2025 is $313,000 for non-joint filers and $626,000 for joint filers), which was scheduled to expire December 31, 2028.

International Provisions

Foreign Derived Deduction Eligible Income

OBBBA renames “foreign-derived intangible income” (FDII) to “foreign-derived deduction eligible income” (FDDEI), lowers the Section 250 deduction rate to 33.34% (14% effective tax rate), and eliminates the 10% qualified business asset investment offset. These changes apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.

GILTI (Now NCTI)

OBBBA renames “global intangible low-taxed income” (GILTI) to “net CFC tested income” (NCTI) and permanently decreases the NCTI deduction rate to 40% (from 50% under GILTI), enacting an effective rate of 12.6% (assuming NCTI is not subject to foreign tax).

Foreign Tax Credits

OBBBA increases the deemed paid credit for foreign taxes on NCTI (formerly GILTI) from 80% to 90% and limits deductions allocable to NCTI to the FDDEI deduction (see above) and directly related expenses, with all others (like interest and R&E) allocated to US-source income. For US-produced inventory sold abroad via a foreign branch, up to 50% of the income may be treated as foreign-source for foreign tax credit (FTC) purposes. These changes generally raise the FTC limitation and reduce residual US tax, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Controlled Foreign Corporation Downward Attribution

OBBBA eliminates the downward attribution of stock from foreign to US persons for purposes of determining controlled foreign corporation (CFC) status. In addition, a new provision (Section 951B) targets anti-deferral rules at certain foreign-controlled structures to prevent avoidance. These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Subpart F Pro-Rata Share Rules

OBBBA requires any US shareholder who owned CFC stock at any time during the year (while the entity was a CFC and the shareholder was a “U.S. shareholder”) to include their pro rata share of subpart F and NCTI income, closing the loophole for mid-year transfers. This applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Real Estate

Qualified Opportunity Zones

OBBBA makes the opportunity zone (OZ) tax incentive (enacted under the TCJA) a permanent policy in the tax code. In addition, OBBBA improves on the existing OZ framework by creating an ongoing five-year deferral period for capital gains invested after December 31, 2026, in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) (i.e., there is not a universal recognition date for all taxpayers, as was the case under the TCJA), with a 10% basis step-up at the five-year mark, and provides enhanced tax benefits to investments in QOFs that make certain qualifying investments in rural areas (e.g., the initial five-year holding period 10% step-up in basis is increased to 30%). OBBBA also enacts a new information reporting regime for QOFs and makes other changes to the (qualified opportunity zones (QOZ) program.

Adjustment to Real Estate Investment Trust Subsidiary Asset Tests

OBBBA increases the amount of taxable real estate investment trust (REIT) subsidiary stock that a REIT may own from 20% to 25% for purposes of the 75% asset value test that a REIT must satisfy. This applies with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Energy and Environmental Incentives

Limitations for Clean Electricity Production Credit, Clean Electricity Investment Credit, and Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

OBBBA terminates the relevant credits for wind and solar energy property placed in service after December 31, 2027. However, such placed-in-service requirement does not apply to property that begins construction within one year after the enactment of OBBBA. The advanced manufacturing production credit remains largely intact, with some modifications. For all these credits, however, OBBBA adopts prohibited foreign entity rules, which prevent certain entities that either are owned or have commercial ties with persons from certain nations (i.e., China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran) from claiming credits. Further, OBBBA adopts material assistance rules, which bar the availability of credits where a prohibited foreign entity materially assisted with the manufacturing or construction of a project.

Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 enacted a 25% tax credit to provide semiconductor manufacturers an incentive to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States. Generally, under the CHIPS Act, taxpayers may receive a tax credit for 25% of the investment cost of qualifying facilities that manufacture semiconductors, or the equipment to manufacture semiconductors. OBBBA increases this credit from 25% to 35% for property placed in service beginning in 2026.

State and Local Tax Cap and Other Provisions

Increased State and Local Tax Cap

OBBBA increases the current $10,000 cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT) (set to expire on December 31, 2025) to $40,000 for 2025. For tax years after 2025 and through 2029, the SALT cap will nominally adjust upward by 1% every year. Beginning in 2030, the SALT cap will revert to $10,000. In addition, OBBBA enacts a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) threshold, whereby taxpayers with MAGI over $500,000 (also adjusted upward by 1% each year) are generally subject to a phase-down of the SALT deduction. OBBBA does not impose restrictions on pass-through entity tax (PTET) regimes enacted by states and approved by the US Department of the Treasury in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2020-75.

Modifications to Deductions for Charitable Contributions by Individuals

With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, OBBBA allows individuals who do not itemize their deductions to once again claim a deduction for charitable donations of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers. Additionally, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, OBBBA allows individuals who itemize their deductions to claim a deduction for charitable donations only to the extent that the total contributions exceed 0.5% of an individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.

Limitation on Itemized Deductions

With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, OBBBA provides that the total of itemized deductions a taxpayer may claim is reduced by 2/37 of the lesser of (1) the total itemized deductions otherwise allowable, or (2) the amount by which the taxpayer’s taxable income (before this limitation and increased by itemized deductions) exceeds the threshold where the 37% tax bracket begins for their filing status.

1% Floor on Corporate Charitable Giving

With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, OBBBA allows corporations to claim a deduction for charitable donations only to the extent that the total contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income.

Deduction for Tip Income Received

For taxable years 2025 through 2028, OBBBA provides up to a $25,000 federal income tax deduction for qualified tips received by an employee or independent contractor in certain occupations in which tips are customarily and regularly received. The deduction phases out beginning when the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 in the case of a joint return). The deduction is available to individuals who itemize deductions and individuals who do not itemize deductions. The IRS is expected to provide guidance and transition relief for individuals and their employers and payors on accounting for the deduction and related withholding and reporting changes.

Deduction for Overtime Pay

For taxable years 2025 through 2028, OBBBA provides a $12,500 federal income tax deduction ($25,000 in the case of a joint return) for qualified overtime compensation received by an individual. Qualified overtime compensation is defined as overtime compensation paid to an individual in excess of the regular rate paid to such individual. The deduction phases out beginning when the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 in the case of a joint return). To be eligible for the deduction, gross overtime pay must be reported separately on the employee’s Form W-2. The deduction is available to individuals who itemize deductions and individuals who do not itemize deductions. The IRS is expected to provide guidance and transition relief for individuals and their employers and payors on accounting for the deduction and related withholding and reporting changes.

Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, OBBBA made permanent the paid family and medical leave (FMLA) credit, which was scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025. With three modifications, (1) the credit would be available in all states (regardless of whether leave is required in such state), (2) the minimum employee work requirement could be reduced (at the election of the employer) from one year to six months, and (3) the credit could be claimed for an applicable percentage of FMLA insurance premiums paid or incurred by an eligible employer during a taxable year (i.e., an employer may elect between premiums paid or wages paid, but not both).

COVID-Related Employee Retention Credits

OBBBA disallows employee retention credit claims for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 filed after January 31, 2024. Further, the statute of limitations on assessments for those claims is extended to six years. OBBBA also imposes penalties and reporting requirements on employee retention credit promoters (i.e., persons who aid, assist, or advise taxpayers filing an employee retention credit claim and derive a significant portion of their revenue from such assistance).

Lastly, we note that numerous tax policies were considered during the OBBBA legislative making process that did not ultimately become law. We note specifically that OBBBA did not change the carried interest rules or taxation of social security benefits.

This collaboration marks a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery technology beyond EVs and builds on GM and Redwood’s existing collaboration.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars – we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications. The memorandum announced today enables Redwood to pair that integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and new U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution from cell to system.

Already, GM second-life electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to help power the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America, at Redwood’s 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said JB Straubel, founder and CEO of Redwood Materials. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. As power consumption increases, there’s an expanding need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

Mercedes-Benz has announced a significant shift in its electric vehicle (EV) strategy for the US market. Following the enactment of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the German luxury automaker confirmed that it will be pausing the production of the EQE and EQS sedan and SUV models.

According to Inside EVs, the three-pointed star marque will temporarily put on hold the assembly of the models starting September 1, 2025, in response to the removal of tax credits to EVs in the country by the end of the same month. Mercedes clarified, though, that the move only affects EQ-badged cars in the US.

Mounting Pressure for Mercedes EQ Cars

Mercedes-Benz has only limited its EQ lineup in the US to the EQE and EQS. The sedan versions of the vehicles come from the automaker’s German plant. Meanwhile, the company assembles the SUV variants in its Alabama facility.

Despite offering an impressive range and efficiency, these models have struggled to generate a substantial consumer demand. Sales figures for 2024 paint a bleak picture of the interest of consumers in them, with EQS sedan and SUV sales plummeting by 52% compared to 2023.

Analysts blamed the poor reception of the EVs due to their polarizing designs, which they believe have considerably veered away from Mercedes’ design philosophy. Additionally, critics said that their electric powertrains have failed to resonate with new and loyal customers of the brand as they lacked the appeal offered by the three-pointed star marque’s signature high-performance gas-powered engines, particularly those equipped in the E-Class and S-Class.

Moreover, pundits noted that the EQ interiors, while having a very advanced interface, often fall short of consumer expectations.

With the energy mix in the US becoming increasingly a blend of both renewable and fossil-based energy, the modern era of energy independence and affordability will be different from the past. The ongoing resource or fuel element for renewable energy – such as sunlight or wind – is both domestic and free. As a result, ensuring energy independence in a world inclusive of renewable generation focuses more on the sourcing of key components and equipment needed to harness this renewable potential. Today, the supply chains to provide domestically made components for renewables are nascent, creating a great opportunity to build out the sector.

Building this industry in the US would both add jobs and reinforce energy independence. US policymakers from both the previous and current administrations have stated ambitions to strengthen the country's manufacturing base. The current manufacturing workforce is 25% lower than it was in 2000. Reversing that trend has become a priority for economic and political reasons, therefore creating jobs in rural areas combined with reducing the nation’s reliance on imports should be a political win-win.

At the intersection of so many important political priorities, it would seem domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components and equipment is an industry set up for success. Regardless of how the on-going debate about the future of energy policy evolves, even taking into account the impacts of the newly approved One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), renewables will play a central role in the US energy future, providing low cost and decarbonised energy to a grid with growing demands.

What is the size of the opportunity?

Renewable energy installations are expected to grow strongly through the middle of the century.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Texas is recognized as a leader in the energy industry with oil and gas production. The Permian Basin in West Texas (if it were a stand-alone country) would rank in the top five global oil and gas producers. Over 50,000 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, the largest bulk liquid ports in the U.S., an extensive petrochemical network, and of course, a highly trained, specialized workforce of technicians, engineers, scientists and business leaders are just a few of the resources located in Texas that have led to the region’s global leadership in energy.

What many don’t know is that Texas is also the U.S. leader in hydrogen production, transportation and use. About one-third of the nation’s 10 – 12 million metric tons of annual hydrogen production is located in Texas – mostly along the Gulf Coast industrial corridor. This hydrogen is primarily used for refinery operations, ammonia production, and as a chemical feedstock. Over 95 percent of it is generated via a process called steam methane reforming or “SMR” that converts natural gas to hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the CO2 being vented to the atmosphere.

Hydrogen’s potential as a clean fuel for a variety of applications beyond its conventional industrial use has long been known. Decades of research and technology development funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in partnership with state agencies, industry, non-profits and universities has led to promising low and zero-emissions hydrogen production and end-use technologies that are ready or near ready for commercialization. Power turbines, heavy and light-duty vehicles, steelmaking, and “drop-in fuels,” such as methanol and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), can all utilize hydrogen – and some already do.

Most of the attention that hydrogen has received recently has focused on “clean hydrogen” or hydrogen with a low “carbon intensity” or CI score. Hydrogen from an SMR typically generates 9 – 12 kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide (CO2) for each kg of hydrogen produced. While definitions vary, the U.S. DOE has defined “clean hydrogen” as hydrogen with no more than two kg of CO2 per kg of hydrogen produced. To produce clean hydrogen, one must either remove CO2 from the production process and find somewhere to “sequester” that CO2 or utilize a process for hydrogen generation that does not generate CO2. It turns out that Texas is a great place to do both. Discussing CO2 removal and storage is beyond the scope of this article, but there are excellent reports on this topic that can be found at Rice University’s Baker Institute of Public Policy. Among other things, one will find that Texas has literally hundreds of years of CO2 storage reservoir capacity at current rates in the state’s subsurface geology.

It is at this point that one might be asking, “Why are we reading about low-carbon, clean energy when the mantra of the day is, Drill, Baby, Drill?”

To borrow a quote attributed to Mark Twain, “… reports of my death are greatly exaggerated …” In other words, clean hydrogen is still very much alive, and work continues on clean hydrogen projects in Texas and other locations in the U.S. There is a well-established multi-decade trend toward low-emissions fuels that predates the recent focus on climate change, even when the initial cost for those fuels is higher than the fuels they replace. A couple of examples are low-sulfur diesel fuel or using natural gas to replace coal for power production. Both were once thought to be a costly trade-off for incrementally cleaner air.

The commercial potential for clean hydrogen can be seen in the development of “mega-plant” projects such as Linde and Woodside’s $2.8 billion plant in Beaumont, Texas, which will utilize clean hydrogen to produce clean ammonia for export. CF Industries’ clean ammonia (also made from clean hydrogen) plant in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, is planned to be operational by 2030. Finally, ExxonMobil continues to move forward with its plan to export clean ammonia (from clean hydrogen) to Asian markets from Baytown, Texas. Other, smaller and/or less developed projects are also moving forward with applications ranging from hydrogen as a heavy-duty truck fuel, to hydrogen for sustainable aviation fuels and “drop-in” fuels such as methanol.

The single most common criticism of hydrogen is its cost. Hydrogen is more costly than many conventional fuels, although not by as much as a few years ago before recent advances in technology. This brings us to another rarely discussed hydrogen application for which cost is perhaps a secondary issue. I am, of course, referring to hydrogen as an energy storage solution.

In Texas, the power grid has a problem. There has been tremendous growth in renewable power generation; i.e., wind and solar. The challenge is that most of the wind and solar power is in the western part of the state, while most of the load demand is in the eastern part of the state. Distance, along with the inherent intermittency of renewable power introduces risks to grid reliability. Adding to the challenges of distance and intermittency, another problem is emerging; electric-grid congestion during periods of high production from wind and solar.

ERCOT, the grid operator in most of Texas, reported in its 2022 “Long Term West Texas Export Study,” (latest edition available) that wind and solar generation capacity in West Texas could be significantly constrained as soon as 2030 when curtailment levels could reach almost 30 percent. Further, the report stated that “technologies beyond typical 345-kV transmission lines would be needed to effectively improve the West Texas export limit.” In other words, we can’t just build our way out of this problem.

The University of Texas’s Center for ElectroMechanics was looking at this problem at the same time, with an eye toward hydrogen as a solution. In a white paper titled, “Renewable Electrolysis in Texas – Pipelines vs Power Lines,” the UT team compared ways to move clean energy from West Texas to industrialized areas along the state’s coast in the most cost-effective – and environmentally benign – manner possible. They focused on a concept called “power-to-gas,” which refers to the production of clean hydrogen from capacity-constrained wind and solar generation as a possible solution for “grid-scale” energy storage. The excess renewable power converts water to hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyzer. The hydrogen can then be stored or transported via pipeline.

I like to call this process “moving energy across space and time” – space because hydrogen can be transported via pipeline to end use applications far away and time because, once in the pipeline network, it can also be stored to meet hourly or seasonal peaks.

The UT paper concluded that about four gigawatts (GW), or half of the prospective wind and solar-related capacity constraints for West Texas, could be resolved by converting that renewable energy to hydrogen and transporting it to the Houston area (one of the world’s largest hydrogen production/consumption hubs) via a large hydrogen pipeline. That represents almost 25 percent of the Houston area’s use of natural gas-sourced hydrogen via SMRs. The alternative for moving that same electric energy to Houston would be the construction of five 345-kV electric transmission lines. Let’s repeat that: One pipeline or five electric transmission lines to move an equivalent amount of energy!

The breadth of potential end-uses for clean hydrogen is illustrated by the Texas Hydrogen Alliance (THA), the central advocacy group for hydrogen in Texas. THA members include global energy companies, automakers, engine manufacturers, chemical exporters, ports, universities and convenience store operators, just to name a few. Each of these organizations shares a common belief that hydrogen has strong commercial potential and can provide economic, health and societal benefits to consumers for the growing list of hydrogen end-use applications.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Opening-image-hydrogen_edited.png,N,,2025-07-18 17:14:56.219217

Southwest Detroit is home to more than 150 manufacturing facilities, and its residents have long suffered from the impacts of air pollution with significantly higher rates for cancer, asthma and respiratory illness than the rest of the state.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is strongly tied to stroke and heart disease with some evidence linking pollution to diabetes, cognitive impairment, neurological diseases and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight.

But rather than strengthening pollution protections, the Trump administration is rolling them back, with environmentalists arguing the government is putting polluters first.

“This isn’t just policy, it’s personal, and these rollbacks are literally going to cost lives,” said Meghan Richards, the assistant director of climate equity for Detroit’s Eastside Community Network.

While Southwest Detroit makes headlines for its exposure to pollution, residents of the city’s eastside share many of the same burdens, Richards said.

“We have neighborhoods where folks can’t open their windows in the summer, extreme heat meets poor air quality, and where people are suffering silently, and it’s not just because they’re passive, but it’s because it’s really just a matter of survival for almost all of us,” Richards said.

These issues are only intensified by climate change, Richards said, with residents already suffering from systematic disinvestment, old infrastructure and environmental neglect.

“As temperature rises, so does the threat of pollution. Heat doesn’t just make us uncomfortable, it intensifies ground level ozone, triggering more asthma attacks, heart issues and emergency room visits. That’s especially dangerous for elders, children and people with chronic illnesses,” Richards said.

While Detroiters are resilient, resilience should not be code for abandonment, Richards said, arguing that giving big polluters the opportunity to opt out of regulations is sanctioning harm.

“We deserve more than survival. We deserve justice. We deserve to be able to live and enjoy and have peace and happiness. We need climate standards that protect – not punish – Black, brown and low-income communities who’ve historically borne the brunt of environmental racism. And I want to be very clear that the communities who are harmed the most have done the very least to cause the harm” Richards said.

Gabriela Santiago-Romero, Detroit city councilmember for the city’s sixth district, which includes Southwest Detroit, emphasized that behind every rollback is a child who will need to miss school, an elder struggling to breathe in the summer and families forced to choose between paying for medicine or paying for clean water.

While Santiago-Romero successfully pressed for a dust ordinance to require polluters to control the dust and particulate matter their facilities release, she stressed that the ordinance came directly from listening to residents.

“Environmental Justice is not just a policy fight. It’s a people’s movement. We are a community who is going to continue to organize, and we need your voices at City Hall. We need you to speak to your neighbors, to your schools, to let your folks know, your friends know, about the issues. With corporate polluters and now climate change roaring through our world, everyone’s fights in this movement is critical,” Santiago-Romero stressed.

In addition to strong federal regulations, Detroiters need support for clean energy to cut down on fossil fuel emissions, alongside bold local leadership to stand up for the people.

As part of Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill,” Congress approved cuts to key clean energy provisions within former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, slashing tax incentives for solar and wind generation.

While Congress works to roll back progress and CEOs seek exemptions on pollution, Detroiters need to present a united front, Santiago-Romero said.

“This is the moment to fight back against the rollback, against the lies, against the idea that some communities are disposable. Detroit is not disposable. The people of Michigan are not disposable,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7173741-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 15:45:28.598048

The automaker announced plans on Wednesday to more than double the plant’s production capacity—from around 230,000 vehicles per year to 535,000. The move would also add around 3,100 new jobs. That’s a big leap, especially for a plant that only opened in June 2019.

The news came from Samir Cherfan, Stellantis’ Chief Operating Officer (COO) for the Middle East & Africa (MEA) region. The plant currently builds supermini electric city cars (quadricycles) like the Citroën Ami, Opel Rocks-e, and Fiat Topolino. Annual production of these quirky little EVs has already grown from 20,000 units to 70,000 since January 2025, and now it’s about to get even bigger.

Backed by a €1.2 billion (about $1.4 billion) investment, the expanded Kenitra site will also start building hybrid engines and a futuristic three-wheeled EV called the Fiat TRIS. This thing isn’t your typical delivery vehicle—it’s basically a tiny electric tuk-tuk built for city life and last-mile delivery routes across Africa and the Middle East.

The TRIS will be offered in three versions: Pickup, Flatbed, and Chassis Cab. It’s only 3.17 meters long (about 10.4 feet) and has a turning radius of just over 10 feet. Powered by a 48-volt electric motor making 12 horsepower, it tops out at 45 km/h (28 mph) and runs on the same 6.9 kWh lithium battery as its quadricycle cousins.

On the hybrid side of things, Stellantis plans to build 350,000 engines annually at the site. The first wave of mild-hybrid engines started assembly in May 2025, with a second phase focusing on component machining launching in November 2026.

New polling shows that 67% of voters oppose the so-called “big, beautiful bill” once they learn what’s in it — including cuts to clean energy that will raise people’s energy costs and increase health-harming pollution.

We asked Joanna Slaney, who leads political affairs work for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, to explain how energy provisions in the law are going to hit home.

How will clean energy cuts in the law affect people’s wallets?

This new law is expected to add $170 each year on average to your energy bills, and more than $400 a year for people in several states over the next decade. The law cuts tax credits for reliable, affordable clean energy at a time when America needs it most. Demand for energy in the U.S. is breaking records, and clean energy is often the fastest, cheapest way to meet this demand — last year 95% of new power on the grid came from wind and solar. Without enough supply over the coming years, costs for consumers will go up.

On top of that, this law limits the options families once had to bring their energy costs down. For example, if you were thinking about buying an electric vehicle to save on the cost of gas, that tax credit will be gone by the end of September. For those planning to add solar panels to lower their electric bill, the solar tax credit is disappearing too, by the end of the year.

These credits don’t just help bring down costs. They create jobs and, unlike fossil fuel energy, they don’t create pollution that makes us sick.

Clean energy and EV tax credits are disappearing, but not gone yet. How you can still save money

Some in clean energy are calling this law a job-killer. What’s your take?

The numbers are sobering. This law could eliminate 900,000 good-paying jobs in energy and manufacturing. Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, called it “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.”

One reason some lawmakers were hesitant to support this bill is because many communities have been benefiting from clean energy jobs, and this law threatens those jobs.",https://vitalsigns.edf.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/54634952199_54576ef5f2_o%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 17:12:23.290600

“The American people elected President Trump to unleash American energy and lower prices, not to entertain the left’s radical climate agenda,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.
The White House in a fact sheet maintained that’s indeed the case.
In statements assailing the program’s expansion, they accused Trump of opening the spigot for cancer-causing pollution and vowed to contest the newly announced rollbacks.
Trump’s announcement Thursday directly benefited companies tied to making steel and producing power from coal by easing pollution controls.","President Donald Trump, putting White House muscle to work for polluting industries, on Thursday gave dozens of plants around the country more time to meet EPA regulations intended to cut emissions of air toxics tied to cancer and other serious health problems.

In a series of four “proclamations” released late in the day, Trump tapped a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act to grant two-year compliance extensions to 53 chemical plants and refineries, 39 medical sterilization facilities, eight mills that process the low-grade iron ore known as taconite, and three coal-fired power plants.

All are subject to strengthened hazardous air pollutant rules issued last year during then-President Joe Biden’s administration. While the rules contain a variety of deadlines, the extensions will broadly push back the cutoffs to meet key requirements from 2027 to 2029.

Corporations benefiting from the delays include Shell, Sterigenics, Dow and other heavyweights.

While not all plants covered by the tighter regulations sought delays, previous EPA forecasts suggest that the extensions will save industry collectively millions of dollars while allowing the release of hundreds of tons more pollution than would have otherwise occurred.

EPA meanwhile plans to revisit — and possibly repeal — each of the rules under what Administrator Lee Zeldin has billed the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.

The White House in a statement said the exemptions show the president is delivering for the American public.

“The American people elected President Trump to unleash American energy and lower prices, not to entertain the left’s radical climate agenda,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. “Yesterday’s proclamations will provide temporary regulatory relief from stringent Biden-era regulations that impacted sectors critical to our national security.”

The Clean Air Act allows the postponements if the president finds that they would both benefit national security and that the needed pollution control technology is not available. The White House in a fact sheet maintained that’s indeed the case.

“The exemptions ensure that these facilities within these critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs to comply with, in some cases, unattainable compliance requirements,” White House officials wrote.

EPA concurred that the president is authorized under the Clean Air Act to take action.

“Decisions to grant compliance extensions is an authority that rests with the President,” said Molly Vaseliou, a spokesperson for the agency.

Yet environmental groups are already suing to overturn extensions granted to 68 coal-fired power plants in April. In statements assailing the program’s expansion, they accused Trump of opening the spigot for cancer-causing pollution and vowed to contest the newly announced rollbacks.

“Trump is illegally delaying clean air laws from his desk because polluters make more money when they just dump their toxic chemicals in our air,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of litigation at Earthjustice’s Healthy Communities program. “Trump’s action on behalf of big corporate polluters will cause more cancer, more birth defects, and more children to suffer asthma. The country deserves better.”

Vickie Patton, the Environmental Defense Fund’s general counsel, said Trump’s “callous and dangerous actions would let some of the country’s worst industrial polluters evade compliance with the safeguards that protect Americans from toxic air pollution” and “increase cancer risk and mean more suffering for people — children and adults — in communities across the country.”

Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club’s climate policy director, said the White House move shows Trump is putting profit over public health. “It is disgusting that Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are continuing to hand out exemption after exemption from standards that would save lives and prevent illnesses,” said Drupp. “We have already taken action on their treacherous and dangerous actions and we will continue to push back against this disgraceful administration.”

The delays also threaten a key part of Biden’s environmental legacy. The regulations for medical sterilization plants, many of them located in residential neighborhoods or near schools, were expected to cut emissions of highly carcinogenic ethylene oxide by more than 90 percent.

But on Thursday, Trump wrote that the current compliance timetable would likely force some sterilization facilities to close, thus making “critical sterile medical devices unavailable to care for patients in our civilian and military medical systems.”

He took a similar stance in granting waivers to the 53 chemical plants and refineries encompassed by a separate set of rules targeting their emissions of ethylene oxide and chloroprene, which EPA considers a likely carcinogen. Those rules were central to Biden’s efforts to reduce disproportionately high pollution exposure in communities of color and low-income areas, such as the Louisiana tract often known as “Cancer Alley.”

In another proclamation, however, Trump warned that the technological requirements embedded in the regulations would weaken supply chains and increase dependence on foreign producers.

“These consequences would ripple across sectors vital to America’s growing industrial strength and emergency readiness,” the proclamation says.

The Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the American Chemistry Council in a release applauded the exemptions and reiterated that the Biden-era rule was costly and risked potential shutdowns with unworkable compliance deadlines.

“Without relief from these unworkable timelines, the HON rule jeopardizes the production of essential chemistries that are crucial for our national security interests, including public health and economic security, as they are used for countless everyday products and critical industries such as agriculture, healthcare, semiconductor manufacturing, and more,” the council wrote.

You’ve got mail

EPA opened the door to companies seeking extensions in March, inviting companies to shoot the agency an email should they want exemptions to a host of Clean Air Act rules. Since then, the process has been enveloped in secrecy, with the public given no opportunity to comment before the compliance delays were announced.

The agency has thus far not responded to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking the names of applicants. It is unclear how EPA vetted requests to ensure they meet the Clean Air Act’s criteria.

Trump’s announcement Thursday directly benefited companies tied to making steel and producing power from coal by easing pollution controls.

One proclamation the president signed exempted eight additional facilities that use taconite — a low-grade iron ore used in steelmaking — from a 2024 Biden-era rule aimed at reducing mercury pollution. Mercury is a neurotoxin that can accumulate in fish and harm human health, particularly affecting developing brains and nervous systems.

The White House in a fact sheet argued that the so-called Taconite Rule requires compliance with standards that rely on emissions-control technologies that haven’t been demonstrated to work, are untested at commercial scale or are not “reasonably achievable under current operational conditions.”

The White House also warned that enforcing the rule could force some facilities to shut down, reduce domestic production and threaten national security.

Now, eight taconite iron ore processing plants in Michigan and Minnesota under the umbrella of Cleveland-Cliffs and U.S. Steel are exempt from the rule for an additional two years.

Andrew Fulton, a spokesperson for U.S. Steel, welcomed the proclamation in an email and said such action directly protects national security, domestic steelmaking and U.S. workers.

“The 2024 Taconite Rule is not supported by science and would impose unprecedented costs while setting technologically unachievable standards,” said Fulton. “This Presidential exemption is fair, reasonable and necessary. U. S. Steel remains committed to environmental excellence and safety, and we will work collaboratively with the EPA in support of regulations based on sound science and proven technology.”

Cleveland-Cliffis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Yet another directive added three coal-fired power plants in Ohio, Illinois and Colorado to the 68 facilities exempt from stricter Mercury and Air Toxics Standards regulations.

In issuing the proclamation, Trump argued that the rule “requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form.”

But environmental groups that sued the administration for exempting scores of coal plants from the MATS regulation in June argued that not only was the technology available, but companies were already moving to install it.

“Many of the exempted power plants have already installed and are actively using the technology sufficient to meet the targeted mercury and other toxic air pollution standards — technology that EPA itself determined was available in a final rule issued just over a year ago, based on an ample record developed through public notice and comment,” wrote attorneys for Earthjustice.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/0c/12/c583952a4a7ea1a5a453d44c461b/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2221323284,N,,2025-07-18 15:44:11.665763

The anticipated sale, announced July 18 for an undisclosed sum, meshes with BP’s new strategy of doubling down on fossil fuel production while cutting overall costs, especially in clean energy investments. It includes ownership stakes in 10 U.S. wind farms with a combined gross capacity of 1.7 gigawatts, roughly enough to power 1.3 million homes.

“We have been clear that while low-carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused BP, we will continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio to generate value,” said William Lin, BP executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy, in a statement. “The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward.”

Amid struggling stock performance and increased investor activism, BP announced in February it would divest about $20 billion in assets through 2027, including up to $4 billion in 2025. The company said it would also be investing nearly 20% more per year in oil and gas production.

Earlier this month, BP said it would sell its network of 300 fueling stations in the Netherlands—also for an undisclosed price—to the Dutch business Catom. The company plans to sell its retail fueling business in Austria as well, and is also divesting a 50% stake in its Lightsource solar business and selling much of its global offshore wind business through a new, fifty-fifty joint venture with Japanese utility JERA.

BP has already sold a $1 billion stake in the TANAP gas pipeline from the Caspian Sea to Apollo Global Management. A strategic review of its Castrol lubricants business is ongoing. Castrol alone is worth close to $8 billion, according to analyst estimates.

With BP and archrival Shell both now London based, long-rumored reports escalated in late June that Shell would enter early talks to buy BP in what would be the biggest energy deal this century—if not ever. However, Shell quickly denied any such negotiations, and BP has declined to comment.

But recycling concrete doesn't substantially lower its carbon footprint, he added.","Altadena, Calif. — Candace Frazee recently walked through the burnt remains of The Bunny Museum, searching for anything that could be salvaged before workers cleared the land.

The Eaton Fire in Southern California in January scorched more than 60,000 bunny objects and memorabilia, leaving behind mounds of ash, steel and concrete littered across the landscape. Giant bunny statues that once greeted guests were left just wiry, hollow skeletons. Her home in the back was also gone.

Yet amid the debris, there are valuable materials being redeemed: Metal, concrete and some trees are being recycled and given new life.

“It's fantastic. It's absolutely fantastic,” said Frazee of recycling the materials, who co-founded the museum with her husband. “That's the right thing to do.”

After the Palisades and Eaton fires scorched entire neighborhoods, the Army Corps of Engineers set up operations to recycle concrete and metal from mostly fire-damaged homes. Metal is compacted and concrete is crushed, then trucked to recycling facilities before re-entering the supply chain for future uses. And some trees and shrubs are processed and sold.

“A lot of this material can be reused in future construction, and that’s just good for the environment,” said Col. Sonny Avichal, an Army Corps commander for the Eaton Fire. “And so there is definitely this notion of, you know, a lot of the stuff that we’re able to recover will actually come back and help rebuild Altadena.”

The agency said these operations have sped up recovery efforts, reduced waste going to landfills and helped lower the number of trucks on the road, but they've also sparked some worries. Residents have raised concerns that the work produces or kick up particles into the air. The Army Corps maintains they're ensuring operations are safe by monitoring air quality and continually watering the sites to minimize dust.

Steel is an “infinitely recyclable” material

A large dump truck filled with wiry and garbled steel arrived at an Altadena golf course that had been partially burned. The metal pulled from fire-destroyed properties was compacted here before being trucked to a recycling facility where it can be melted, cast and resold. A steel beam can become a steel beam again, or be morphed into a car door or roof panel.

Across the globe, the steel industry represents an estimated 8% of planet-warming emissions, and just 1 to 2 % in the U.S. — the fourth largest steel producer. And according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association, recycled steel doesn't lose its quality. Annually, some 60 to 80 million tons of steel scrap are recycled into new products in North America. Every refrigerator that's recycled reduces 215 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the group's estimates.

“Steel is infinitely recyclable,” said Adina Renee Adler, executive director of the Global Steel Climate Council, an industry group working to reduce carbon emissions. “It is, in fact, the most recycled material out of everything that we have.”

Adler hopes people who lost homes to the fires will feel a glimmer of hope knowing some of those materials will be given new life. That could be for somebody else, somewhere else, or to build their own homes anew.

Recycling concrete has environmental perks

The concrete that arrived to these sites is pulverized into large concrete chunks piled 10 feet (3.05 meters) high into inch-and-a-half and 3 inch pieces before being trucked to local construction materials companies.

In its new form, concrete can be used to elevate ground in construction sites, for example, or provide a base layer before pavement is applied, or be used to create concrete again.

Making concrete is responsible for roughly 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions and 2% in the U.S., most of which come from producing and processing its predecessor, cement. That's because coal and other fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases when burned, are the main energy sources for making cement, and the actual chemical reaction that occurs when producing it also releases planet-warming emissions, said Ben Skinner, a manager on the cement and concrete team with RMI, a group working to accelerate the clean energy transition.

But recycling concrete doesn't substantially lower its carbon footprint, he added. It does, however, have “great environmental impacts” because it reduces the extraction of new raw materials when it's turned into aggregate — stuff like sand or gravel used to make concrete — while still producing high quality material. It also keeps waste from going to landfills.

Some trees could also be used in rebuilding

Large trees were knocked onto homes and parkways from the same powerful winds that sent fires out of control, and the infernos scorched canopies. Trees that fell into ash get sent to landfills. Others that are still standing and pose a safety risk are cut down.

Some logs are sent to local mills to be manufactured into lumber that can be used in the rebuilding process. Others are mulched to become soil amendment, the name for organic matter added to soil to improve its quality, then sold to companies and farmers, said Matthew Long, senior program manager for Environmental Chemical Corporation, the contractor running the operations.

Long has done fire recovery work for nearly a decade — including in Hawaii after the Lahaina fires and other California blazes in 2017 and 2018. “It's really rewarding work,” he said. “You’re interacting with someone who lost everything daily and helping them move to the next step of recovery.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/18/PDTN/85271968007-ap-25198768893259.jpg?crop=5766,3244,x0,y242&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-18 17:13:16.247199

GASP Executive Director Patrick Campbell was flanked by Braddock resident and activist Edith Abeyta, Pittsburgh City Council Member Erika Strassburger, and registered nurse Kathryn Westman - all gave powerful comments demanding EPA uphold its mission and stop the roll backs.

Little bit of background: In the past month, EPA has announced its intent to roll back a host of environmental regulations (some of which effect U.S. Steel's Mon Valley Works facilities among others), which will have an inevitable impact on the Pittsburgh region.

""Braddock has lived in the shadows of major pollution sources for more than a century, and the health and well-being of our community has suffered. There is a better way. It's time for stronger air pollution standards that protect our friends and family, the people we love,"" Abeyta said at the press conference.

We agree, Edith!

And here are the comments GASP Executive Director Patrick Campbell shared:

Good morning. My name is Patrick Campbell, and I'm here today representing the Group Against Smog and Pollution. For decades, GASP has been on the front lines, fighting for the right to breathe clean air in our communities.

Today, I stand before you with a sense of urgency, because that fundamental right is under threat. We are witnessing a dangerous trend: The systematic rollback of crucial environmental protections by the Environmental Protection Agency.

These regulations, regulations like the Coke Oven Emissions Standards, limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and the mercury and air toxics standards all of which were crafted over years, based on sound science and public health imperatives and input, are being dismantled. These aren't just bureaucratic adjustments; these are decisions that will have real, tangible, and potentially devastating consequences for our health and our future.

Right here in Braddock, the delayed implementation of the revised National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Integrated Iron and Steel alone will allow U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson Works to emit greater amounts of hazardous air pollutants between now and July 3, 2027, than it otherwise would have.

Let's be clear: the air quality regulations being weakened were designed for a reason. They were put in place to limit the very pollutants that cause asthma attacks in our children, trigger heart disease in our seniors, and contribute to a host of other respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.

When the EPA loosens standards on emissions from power plants or industrial facilities, it means more particulate matter in our lungs, more ozone damaging our airways, and more toxic chemicals contaminating our neighborhoods.

The human cost of this deregulation is immense. We're talking about increased emergency room visits, more missed school days, and a greater burden on our healthcare system.

For those already struggling with chronic conditions, these rollbacks are not just concerning; they are a direct threat to their quality of life - and in some cases - their very survival. We cannot, and must not, sacrifice public health for short-sighted economic gains. Full stop.

Because who bears the brunt of these rollbacks? It is our frontline neighbors. These neighbors live closest to industrial facilities, major roadways, and other sources of pollution, and have borne the greatest share of environmental burden. These rollbacks will only exacerbate that injustice.

So, what can we do? We certainly cannot afford to be silent.

We must raise our voices and demand accountability from our elected officials and from the EPA. Contact your representatives, share your stories, and let them know that clean air is not a luxury; it is a necessity, a right, and a non-negotiable foundation for healthy communities.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f3af33_bcdbbe11cdb948c4824bb8f12239944f~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_750,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f3af33_bcdbbe11cdb948c4824bb8f12239944f~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-07-18 17:12:51.933873

AUSTIN COUNTY, Texas — An entity known as EmberYork Energy Center LLC is considering investing between $750 million and $800 million to build a natural gas-fired power plant in Austin County, west of Houston.

Backed by Brightforge Energy LLC, EmberYork has applied for a tax abatement under the Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation Act, which replaced Chapter 313 tax abatements at the beginning of 2024.

In the application, Brightforge said it could build a 900-megawatt natural gas power plant within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’ Houston load zone, 3 miles south of Interstate 10 near Sealy.

Brightforge said in the filing the proposed project would directly connect with Houston-based CenterPoint Energy Inc.’s (NYSE: CNP) 138-kilovolt transmission line between the Wallis Substation and Gebhardt Substation.

The project would be what's known as a peaking facility, which operates when power demand is at its peak.

The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.
The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,’' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.’'

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,’' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries’ long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam’s Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they’ve gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia’s growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia’s sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG math doesn’t add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they’re unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the long-term stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out … But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

Irene Himona, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Using 2024 average global renewables transaction multiples as a reference point, we estimate the deal consideration could reach circa $2.2 billion or above.”

However, sources indicated the value was likely to be significantly lower than this, as the global averages did not reflect prices for ageing assets in the American market.

BP is also looking to sell its Castrol lubricants business and a stake in Lightsource BP. It has already announced a deal this month to offload its petrol stations in the Netherlands for an undisclosed sum, thought to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

BP has global operations including drilling for new oil and gas discoveries and retailing fuel and Marks & Spencer convenience food. It reported underlying profits of $8.9 billion last year.

Two of the four existing ORC units, each rated at 2.5 Mwe, will be replaced with a new 5 MWe unit. Exergy’s ORC system, based on a single-pressure-level cycle, will harness a geothermal resource at approximately 150°C in both brine and steam phases, to produce clean electricity using Exergy’s Radial Outflow turbine technology.

The cycle is designed to utilise all available heat content of the steam, minimising geothermal fluid loss. Additionally, the high isentropic efficiency of the Exergy radial outflow turbine will enable the generation of approximately 5.3 MWe of net power, exceeding the 5 MWe requested by the customer, thus enhancing the overall competitiveness of the systems. An air-cooled condensing system will be used to avoid water consumption, and the geothermal steam and brine will be reinjected into the well at the ORC outlet.

Exergy’s scope of work includes the full Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) of the ORC plant and associated gathering systems. The plant is planned to be fully operational before the end of 2026 with the First Provisional Take-Over (Partial) scheduled for the end of June 2026. By means of the Ribeira Grande repowering project, EDAR will ensure a sustainable and reliable electricity supply for the local population, marking another step towards the Azores’ goal of carbon neutrality.

This is the second contract awarded to Exergy by EDA Renováveis, the renewable energy division of Azorean utility company EDA, following the successful supply of the 4 MWe Pico Alto plant on Terceira Island, which has been in operation since 2017.

“We are honoured by the renewed trust placed in us by EDAR, a long-standing partner with whom we have maintained a strong and continuous collaboration” said Exergy’s Deputy CEO, Luca Pozzoni. “We are pleased to engage once again in a project that will ensure a stable and reliable source of renewable energy for the local community on the island of São Miguel for many years to come. This initiative further consolidates our expertise in the development of geothermal energy solutions in complex and distinctive environments. Exergy will oversee the entire execution process - from engineering and design to construction and commissioning - within a highly demanding timeframe.”

The Azores has seen significant achievements in renewable energy, with the share of RES in electricity production exceeding 35 percent in 2021 and 2022. The region aims to go further, targeting above 70 percent in the near future and full carbon neutrality by 2050. Geothermal is the most important renewable resource in the Azores, accounting for around 21 percent of the total regional electricity demand in 2024, despite current exploration being limited to the islands of São Miguel and Terceira. The Azores hosts three geothermal plants: two in São Miguel (10 and 12 MWe), and one 4 MWe plant by Exergy in Terceira.

“In the Azores, in the year 2024, around 89 percent of the electricity fed into the grid from renewable or endogenous resources was the responsibility of EDA Renováveis” said António Félix Rodrigues, Managing Director of EDA Renováveis. “The revamping of the Ribeira Grande Geothermal Power Plant, along with the expansion of the Pico Vermelho Geothermal Plant—both located on the island of São Miguel—will contribute to increasing the share of renewable energy on that island to around 60 percent by the end of 2026. The revamping project of the Ribeira Grande Geothermal Power Plant is particularly challenging, as it involves the simultaneous development of various construction works coordinated by EDA Renováveis. These range from the dismantling of generator units to civil engineering work on the ORC platform, always in close collaboration with Exergy International.”

For decades, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) has driven many of the biggest advances for safeguarding human health and ecosystems from chemicals.

But this year, the Trump administration began dismantling the office by terminating programmes, cutting staff, closing laboratories and moving remaining scientists into regulatory offices. Legal challenges temporarily blocked mass government layoffs.

But that changed when a recent Supreme Court ruling gave the Trump administration the green light to proceed with widespread redundancies and the total elimination of ORD.

Now, in so doing, the US is not just gutting its own scientific foundation. It’s also putting decades of global progress in chemical safety, pollution control and public health at risk.

ORD is the EPA’s independent science arm, conducting research that supports clean air, water and land. From detecting pollutants and assessing health risks to guiding environmental cleanup, it ensures EPA decisions are grounded in credible, evidence-based research. ORD develops this science under intense scientific, policy, political and legal scrutiny, which means it produces the best available science that is credible and robust.

ORD doesn’t just study pollution, it uncovers threats before they become crises. Take North Carolina’s Cape Fear River, which supplies drinking water to an estimated 2 million people.

While most scientists focused on known pollutants, ORD used advanced screening tools to detect GenX, a little-known synthetic “forever chemical”. Despite evidence that GenX was contaminating the river basin since the 1980s, not much was known about its potential to harm living systems.

ORD rapidly filled this void, linking GenX to decreased birth weight and increased mortality in newborn rats, prompting swift regulatory action against the manufacturer to ensure cleaner, safer water for local communities. No other government agency in the world delivers this kind of rapid, science-led response.

It’s not just the strength of ORD’s science that sets it apart, but also its visionary thinking. Among ORD’s most influential ideas is a model that maps out how a chemical is causing harm.

This works like a chain of building blocks, linking tiny effects (like a chemical disrupting a hormone) to much bigger problems, such as cancer or even extinction. Each step shows how one change leads to another until it reaches something we truly care about. This approach helps scientists detect danger early, before it leads to irreversible damage.

Then there’s the EPA’s groundbreaking work in computational toxicology. Nearly two decades ago, leading scientists warned that chemical safety testing relied too heavily on outdated methods and animal experiments.

In response, ORD built ToxCast, a system that uses tiny cells and computer models to screen thousands of chemicals for effects like endocrine disruption or cell damage. It’s faster, cheaper and more humane, and helps scientists predict which substances may pose serious risks.

These scientific breakthroughs don’t come from policy offices. They require researchers with the independence to explore and innovate.

Beyond the US

Europe has bold goals to phase out animal testing. Much of the science driving this shift comes from ORD.

Tools like Ecotox (the world’s largest chemical toxicity database) and the CompTox dashboard (a platform that links predictive models and non-animal test data for over a million substances) are widely used across the EU and UK. Without ORD, these vital resources, hosted by EPA, could disappear, stalling global progress toward safer, more ethical chemical testing.

EPA also collaborates closely with European partners. It maintains formal agreements and joint programmes with the European Chemicals Agency and the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Areas of focus include air quality, computational toxicology and chemical risk assessment.

ORD is a leading scientific institution with global reach. Its tools and ideas have shaped how governments detect hazardous chemicals, understand their effects, and protect people and the planet. From toxicity databases to modern, non-animal testing methods, ORD underpins how we respond to pollution. Eliminating it would create a dangerous void, just as chemical and climate threats are accelerating.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/680683/original/file-20250717-56-r6zdbx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C119%2C3839%2C1919&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-18 13:55:10.812436

Tony Evers approved a $111 billion state budget that will increase spending on child care and the Universities of Wisconsin system, while cutting taxes by $1.5 billion.

The budget was the first since Democrats gained 14 seats in both chambers of the Legislature under new legislative maps and reflected a stronger bipartisan compromise than in previous cycles.

Senate Republicans, with only one vote to spare, needed Senate Democrats at the negotiating table to pass the budget after multiple Republican senators indicated their disapproval with the budget. Four Republican state senators voted against the budget, and five Democratic state senators voted for it.

The budget was approved in both chambers and signed quickly by Evers because lawmakers wanted to finish the state budget before President Donald Trump’s big federal bill passed. The federal bill capped Medicaid reimbursement for state taxes on hospitals at 6% and would have frozen tax rates on states like Wisconsin, which previously was at 1.8%. The move helped Wisconsin secure $1.5 billion in additional federal funds.

Evers called 2025 the “year of the kid,” prioritizing more funding for child care, K-12 education — particularly special education reimbursement — and higher education. While those areas received significant funding increases, and Republicans got their desired tax cut, postpartum Medicaid extension, renewal of the popular Knowles-Nelson public land acquisition fund and several other items, many with bipartisan support, were missing from this budget.

Environmental advocates look to fall session for stewardship, PFAS fund

Two major environmental initiatives — reauthorization of the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Fund and increased funding for the PFAS trust fund created in the last budget cycle — failed to make it into the final budget.

But Republican lawmakers have shown a willingness to reauthorize the stewardship fund, with a separate bill by Rep. Tony Kurtz, R-Wonewoc, and Sen. Patrick Testin, R-Stevens Point, aiming to fund the stewardship program through 2030. The fund supports land conservation and outdoor recreation through grants to local governments and nonprofits and also allows the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to purchase and maintain state land.

Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, D-Whitefish Bay, shared her disappointment that the budget deal did not reauthorize the stewardship fund and pointed to it as one of the reasons she voted against the budget.

“Beyond the long-time importance of this program to me personally, Knowles-Nelson funding has stood out as the single-most popular issue I have heard from my constituents during my first six months in office – from voters across the political spectrum,” Habush Sinykin said.

The state Supreme Court recently limited the power of the state budget committee to block conservation projects. Although funds for the program are currently set to expire on June 30, 2026, most funds are already awarded, and a lapse in funds could impact planning for land trusts and local governments hoping to access the funds, according to the program.

Paul Heinen, policy director at environmental policy organization Wisconsin Green Fire, and a lobbyist for the first stewardship fund in 1989, said the battle over reauthorization mirrors past debates over the fund.

“The stewardship fund is, could very well be, the single most loved state program,” Heinen said. “But oftentimes it’s leadership who says, no, we’re spending too much money. We’re not going to spend money on this, and then invariably, the other 120 legislators overrule them at some point, and the stewardship fund is reauthorized. That’s where we’re at right now.”

Heinen said he was “99% sure” the fund would be reauthorized in future legislative sessions but was uncertain at what level the fund would be restored. Evers’ budget proposed reauthorizing the fund with $100 million of bonding authority per year through 2036.

How successful was Moss Landing at enlivening opponents of energy storage?","President Trump on Thursday signed four proclamations allowing certain highly polluting industries to bypass regulations established by the Biden administration. In addition to chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers, the proclamations singled out coal-fired power plants and taconite iron ore processing facilities for two years of exemptions. Taconite is a low-grade iron ore primarily mined in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Minnesota, which is then processed for use in the production of iron and steel. Trump justified the move by arguing that compliance with the current emissions rule for coal-fired power plants raises the “unacceptable risk” of shutdowns, “eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk, and threatening broader, harmful economic and energy security effects,” while the iron processing emissions rule “risks forcing shutdowns, reducing domestic production, and undermining the nation’s ability to supply steel for defense, energy, and critical manufacturing.”

The proclamations allow industries to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency standards that predate former President Joe Biden’s tenure. Trump justified the pause by claiming the former administration had mandated compliance with “standards that rely on emissions-control technologies that have not been demonstrated to work.” Researchers have previously found that air pollutants related to coal power plants cause nearly 3,000 attributable deaths per year. Taconite iron ore processing facilities produce harmful acid gases, including hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, as well as mercury, which have been linked to numerous adverse health effects.

Separately, the House passed Trump’s $9 billion rescissions package late last night, which includes cuts to international climate, energy, and environmental programs like the Clean Technology Fund. Republicans Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mike Turner of Ohio joined Democrats in objecting to the bill. Trump is expected to sign the package Friday. An additional rescissions package is expected “soon.”

2. The Pentagon’s 2026 budget will generate the emissions equivalent of 68 gas power plants: report

The Pentagon’s 2026 budget will enable the Department of Defense’s planet-warming emissions to grow by an additional 26 megatons, or about the equivalent of 68 gas power plants, a new analysis by the Climate and Community Institute found. The U.S. military was already the single largest institutional polluter in the world due to its “vast global operations — from jet fuel consumption and overseas deployments to domestic base maintenance,” as well as its manufacturing of weapons and vehicles, the think tank notes. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Pentagon’s budget will exceed $1 trillion in 2026, representing a 17% increase over 2024. Its emissions, in turn, could grow to the point that if the DOD were its own country, it’d be the 38th largest polluter in the world, producing more CO2 emissions than the Netherlands, Bangladesh, or Venezuela. But “the Pentagon’s true climate impact will almost certainly be worse” than what the researchers found, The Guardian notes, “as the calculation does not include emissions generated from future supplemental funding such as the billions of dollars appropriated separately for military equipment for Israel and Ukraine in recent years.”

3. New York halts offshore wind transmission project, citing federal obstacles

New York’s Public Service Commission decided Thursday against moving forward with a major transmission project that would have had the capacity to deliver at least 4,770 megawatts of offshore wind power to New York City by the early 2030s. The commissioners said they were unable to justify “charging ratepayers for the multibillion-dollar project when feds are stymying” offshore wind, New York Focus’ Colin Kinniburgh reported on Bluesky. “We will continue to press forward regarding infrastructure needs for offshore wind in the future once the federal government resumes leasing and permitting for wind energy generation projects,” PSC chair Rory Christian said.

The canceled Public Policy Transmission Need determination was not specific to a particular offshore wind project, but rather was intended to match New York’s general offshore wind ambitions when it was approved in 2023. But as Heatmap has previously reported, Trump’s crusade against offshore wind has been a “worst case scenario” for the industry since day one, and, per ABC News 10, effectively “eliminates any reason for building new power lines in the first place.”

4. Microsoft inks second-largest carbon removal deal to date with waste management startup

Microsoft has inked a deal to purchase 4.9 million metric tons of durable carbon dioxide removal from Vaulted Deep, a waste management startup, for an undisclosed amount. The companies boasted that the deal, which runs through 2038, represents “the second-largest carbon removal deal to date.” Vaulted Deep, an Xprize Carbon runner-up, diverts organic waste from landfills and incinerators by injecting it into wells thousands of feet underground using fracking technologies, which it says ensures over 1,000 years of durability, TechCrunch reports. Since Vaulted’s launch in the summer of 2023, the Houston-based company has removed 18,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Microsoft, meanwhile, has slipped behind its 2020 goal to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates by the end of the decade due to its rush to build out data centers.

5. EPA announces more restructuring, opposition to closure of coal-fired plants

The Environmental Protection Agency’s reorganization and downsizing are set to continue, with the agency offering another round of buyouts and early retirements to staffers in offices it aims to restructure, Politico reports. Among the affected offices are the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, which the EPA said it seeks to tweak to “better address pollution problems that impact American communities by re-aligning enforcement with the law to deliver economic prosperity and ensure compliance with agency regulations,” as well as the Office of Land and Emergency Management, which works on Superfund and disaster response issues. The Office of Research and Development, the Office of Mission Support, and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer are also affected.

Separately, in a preliminary decision earlier this week, the agency moved to block the state of Colorado from closing its six remaining coal-fired power plants by 2031. Colorado was attempting to codify the retirement dates in its Regional Haze Plan, which is typically used to protect the air quality of federal wilderness and national parks; however, the EPA rejected the proposal, according to CPR News. “We believe that the Clean Air Act does not give anybody the authority to shut down coal generation plants against the owner’s will,” Cyrus Western, the administrator of EPA Region 8, said. Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate for the Center of Biological Diversity’s environmental health program, claimed the EPA’s move shows the limits of what climate-conscious states can do on their own. “We may have state rules, but they won't be federally approved,” Nichols told CPR.

THE KICKER

“There are so many developers and so many projects in so many places of the world that there are examples where either something goes wrong with a project or a developer doesn’t follow best practices. I think those have a lot more staying power in the public perception of renewable energy than the many successful projects that go without a hiccup and don’t bother people.” —Heatmap Pro’s Charlie Clynes, in conversation with Jael Holzman about his new project tracking all of the nation’s county-level restrictions on renewable energy.

How successful was Moss Landing at enlivening opponents of energy storage? Since the California disaster six months ago, more than 6 gigawatts of BESS has received opposition from activists explicitly tying their campaigns to the incident, Heatmap Pro® researcher Charlie Clynes told me in an interview earlier this month.

Matt Eisenson of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Law agreed that there’s been a spike in opposition, telling me that we are currently seeing “more instances of opposition to battery storage than we have in past years.” And while Eisenson said he couldn’t speak to the impacts of the fire specifically on that rise, he acknowledged that the disaster set “a harmful precedent” at the same time “battery storage is becoming much more present.”

“The type of fire that occurred there is unlikely to occur with modern technology, but the Moss Landing example [now] tends to come up across the country,” Eisenson said.

Some of the fresh opposition is in rural agricultural communities such as Grundy County, Illinois, which just banned energy storage systems indefinitely “until the science is settled.” But the most crucial place to watch seems to be New York City, for two reasons: One, it’s where a lot of energy storage is being developed all at once; and two, it has a hyper-saturated media market where criticism can receive more national media attention than it would in other parts of the country.

Someone who’s felt this pressure firsthand is Nick Lombardi, senior vice president of project development for battery storage company NineDot Energy. NineDot and other battery storage developers had spent years laying the groundwork in New York City to build out the energy storage necessary for the city to meet its net-zero climate goals. More recently they’ve faced crowds of protestors against a battery storage facility in Queens, and in Staten Island endured hecklers at public meetings.

“We’ve been developing projects in New York City for a few years now, and for a long time we didn’t run into opposition to our projects or really any sort of meaningful negative coverage in the press. All of that really changed about six months ago,” Lombardi said.

The battery storage developer insists that opposition to the technology is not popular and represents a fringe group. Lombardi told me that the company has more than 50 battery storage sites in development across New York City, and only faced “durable opposition” at “three or four sites.” The company also told me it has yet to receive the kind of email complaint flood that would demonstrate widespread opposition.

This is visible in the politicians who’ve picked up the anti-BESS mantle: GOP mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa’s become a champion for the cause, but mayor Eric Adams’ “City of Yes” campaign itself would provide for the construction of these facilities.

Lombardi told me he now views Moss Landing as a “catalyst” for opposition in the NYC metro area. “Suddenly there’s national headlines about what’s happening,” he told me. “There were incidents in the past that were in the news, but Moss Landing was headline news for a while, and that combined with the fact people knew it was happening in their city combined to create a new level of awareness.”

He added that six months after the blaze, it feels like developers in the city have a better handle on the situation. “We’ve spent a lot of time in reaction to that to make sure we’re organized and making sure we’re in contact with elected officials, community officials, [and] coordinated with utilities,” Lombardi said.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTI0MzI2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTk1MDIyNn0.daW-92qHlJKJE7BFmNpsrowjm1-w-_EzBd-KH-R8g_s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-07-18 15:49:29.448226

Trump Signs OBBBA Into Law: On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed H.R. 1, the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), into law, codified as Public Law 119-21. The tax title of the legislation makes several provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA, Public Law 115-97) permanent. See below for the key takeaways:

Business Deductions: Makes permanent the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) expiring business provisions, namely, the section 199A passthrough deduction, bonus depreciation, R&D expensing and the broader section 163(j) interest limitation.

International Tax: Permanently increases the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), reduces the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) deduction, expands the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction and makes permanent the extension of the look-thru rule for controlled foreign corporations.

Clean Energy: Substantially cuts back the Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits, including terminating the electric vehicle credits, limiting the hydrogen production credit, extending the clean fuel production credit and establishing new restrictions on foreign entities of concern.

Child Tax Credit: Enhances the employer-provided child care credit, adoption tax credit, child and dependent credit, and the dependent care assistance program.

Education: Modifies the excise tax on colleges and universities, restores the TCJA exclusion from gross income for forgiven student loans and expands qualified higher education expenses.

Health Care: Extends the paid family and medical leave employer tax credit, requires verification of applicant eligibility to receive the premium tax credit, enhances treatment of the Bronze and Catastrophic plans for use with health savings accounts, and allows high-deductible health plans to provide telehealth and other remote care without a deductible. Finally, it limits Medicare coverage and premium tax credit eligibility to foreign persons who are “lawfully present” in the United States. Rep. Dina Titus Introduces Bill to Restore Gaming Loss Deduction: Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) has introduced the FAIR BET Act, which would restore the full 100% deduction for gambling losses that was reduced to 90% in the recently enacted OBBBA. Rep. Titus argues the provision unfairly taxes gamblers on money they did not win and could discourage proper reporting and drive players to unregulated platforms.

Gambling Tax Repeal Bill Blocked in Senate: Last week, Senate Republicans blocked a request from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) to pass her bipartisan bill, the Facilitating Useful Loss Limitations to Help Our Unique Service Economy (FULL HOUSE) Act, which would restore full deductibility of gambling losses, after the recently passed OBBBA capped deductions at 90% of winnings. Sen. Cortez Masto, joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), warned the cap could harm Nevada’s tourism and gaming industry by taxing gamblers even if they break even. Sen. Todd Young (R-IN), while supporting the fix, objected to the request unless Democrats also agreed to reinstate a religious exemption from an unrelated endowment tax affecting institutions like Notre Dame in Indiana. With no agreement reached, both proposals stalled. Sen. Cortez Masto vowed to continue pushing the bill, though Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) noted it would face procedural hurdles in the House, where tax bills must originate.

Senators Announce Passage of Bill to Put Off Filing Deadlines: The Senate passed H.R. 517, the Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act, a bipartisan bill led by Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Kennedy (R-LA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and it now heads to President Trump for his signature. The bill allows the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to extend federal tax filing deadlines for individuals impacted by disasters declared at the state level, addressing a gap in current law that limits such relief to federally declared disasters. It also increases the standard extension window from 60 to 120 days, ensuring broader access to tax relief for affected communities.

Rep. Sykes Introduces Bill to Preserve and Expand IRS Direct File Tax Program: Rep. Emilia Sykes (D-OH) introduced H.R.4352, the Get Your Money Back Act, to permanently authorize the IRS’ Direct File tax-filing program and mandate its availability in all states. Developed under the Biden administration and expanded to 25 states in 2025, Direct File facilitated the filing of about 296,000 tax returns this year, out of 32 million eligible taxpayers. The Trump administration is expected to terminate the project due to the fact it was not authorized by Congress, as well as its low take-up rate and high costs.

Energy-Tax Mainlines

Trump Executive Order Seeks to End Wind and Solar Tax Credits: On July 7, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14135, titled “Ending Market-Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources.” The EO directs the accelerated elimination of federal subsidies and tax credits for wind, solar and other “green” energy sources. It mandates strict implementation of the OBBBA’s repeal of Sections 45Y and 48E Clean Electricity tax credits and enhanced restrictions on foreign entities of concern. Within 45 days, the departments of the Treasury and Interior must review and revise policies to remove preferences for wind and solar, ensure enforcement of tax credit terminations and report their actions to the president.

IRS Eliminates 83 Pieces of Obsolete Guidance: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has revoked 83 guidance documents considered outdated to help simplify tax administration and improve clarity for taxpayers and advisors. According to Notice 2025-36, removing these documents aims to reduce the volume of guidance that must be reviewed for compliance and make tax laws easier to navigate. The IRS earlier withdrew nine pieces of obsolete guidance in April and plans to retire additional documents in the coming months. The revoked guidance includes previous Notices, Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures, and Announcements covering topics like tax credits, estate tax portability, digital asset reporting and valuation rules dating back several decades.

IRS Workers in Limbo Amid Supreme Court Ruling on Firings: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is undergoing significant workforce reductions following a recent Supreme Court ruling that lifted the injunction blocking federal agency layoffs. The agency is expected to lose over 26,000 employees—approximately a quarter of its staff—by the end of the year due to retirements, resignations and layoffs, while a hiring freeze remains in effect until Oct. 15. Initial reductions have affected probationary workers and key divisions such as audits and compliance, and the agency has experienced considerable leadership turnover, with several acting officials serving until the recent confirmation of IRS Commissioner Billy Long.

IRS Encourages Free File Use for Extension Filers: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is encouraging taxpayers who requested an extension to file their returns now instead of waiting until the Oct. 15 deadline. They are suggesting taxpayers use IRS Free File, which offers free tax preparation for individuals with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less. Filing early helps avoid the fall rush and allows more time to address any issues or arrange payments.

IRS Eyes Changes to Proposed Cloud-Computing Rules, Official Says: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is considering revisions to its proposed regulations on sourcing income from cloud-computing transactions. At a recent event, Peter Blessing, the IRS associate chief counsel (International), acknowledged that the agency may change several aspects of the proposal, which was issued in January to help determine whether income from cloud-based services should be treated as U.S.- or foreign-sourced for tax purposes. While some business groups and tax professionals have called for the rules to be withdrawn due to their complexity and rigidity, the IRS maintains that having clear guidance is important for audit and compliance purposes.

IRS Increased High-Income Taxpayer Audits in 2024, TIGTA Says: A report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) planned about 70,000 audits of high earners—nearly 2.5 times the average from previous years—while aiming to lower audits for others to around 350,000, down from an average of 450,000. This progress was supported by increased enforcement funding under the Biden administration, though much of that funding has since been reduced, with the enforcement allocation now at roughly $4 billion. Staffing reductions raise questions about the agency’s capacity to maintain this audit strategy, especially as TIGTA urges the IRS to better define what qualifies as a high-income return.

Tax Worldview

Path for G7 Pillar Two Deal Enactment Must Be Clear by November: Negotiations are underway to finalize how to implement the G7’s recent agreement exempting U.S.-based multinational groups from certain OECD Pillar Two global minimum tax rules. The European Union (EU) faces challenges with the transitional undertaxed profits safe harbor expiring on Jan. 1, 2026, and member states will need to amend national legislation within a tight time frame, even if changes to the EU directive itself are not required. The Pillar Two rules, part of the OECD’s global tax reform, require large multinational enterprises to maintain a minimum 15% effective tax rate across jurisdictions. Differences between the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) framework and OECD’s income inclusion rule prompted the G7 agreement to avoid dual taxation of U.S.-parented groups, with the United States agreeing to drop plans for retaliatory taxes on countries enforcing certain Pillar Two measures. Some EU countries have expressed concerns about the exclusivity of the G7 talks and the complexity of implementation, while the European Commission supports using safe harbors to apply the agreement without amending the directive.

U.S. Companies Still on Hook for Global Tax, Advisers Warn: U.S. multinational companies have reacted with cautious optimism to the G7’s recent announcement of a tentative understanding to exempt U.S. firms from certain OECD Pillar Two rules, but tax advisers emphasize that no formal agreement has yet been reached. Despite hopes for an exemption, companies face upcoming Pillar Two filing deadlines in multiple countries and are advised to continue compliance efforts to avoid legal and reputational risks. The exemption depends on a broader agreement among over 140 OECD member countries, followed by the development and implementation of administrative guidance and local legislation, a process that could take considerable time. While the United States aims for a “side-by-side” system allowing its tax framework to coexist with the global minimum tax, companies will still be subject to qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes in many jurisdictions.

EU Proposes Corporate Tax, Ditches Bloc-wide DST in New Budget: The European Commission’s latest budget proposal does not include a bloc-wide digital services tax (DST) on major tech companies like Amazon, Google and Meta. Instead, the proposal focuses on a new corporate tax, an excise tax on tobacco and a tax on electronic waste to help fund the European Union (EU) budget. The DST, previously imposed by some EU countries, has faced criticism from the United States as discriminatory, leading countries like Canada to revoke their DSTs to ease trade tensions. Under the new plan, companies with a permanent establishment in the EU and annual turnover over €50 million would pay a lump-sum annual contribution. The proposal also emphasizes revenue from the EU carbon market as a key budget source, though most proceeds will stay with national governments. The commission aims to raise its “own resources” to address growing demands in areas like green and digital transitions, defense, migration and resilience.

At a Glance

Treasury Department Officially Removes Crypto Broker Reporting Rules: The Department of the Treasury has officially withdrawn TD 10021, a set of crypto reporting rules that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges to report customer transaction data to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This action follows the passage of H.J. Res. 25, a Congressional Review Act resolution introduced by Rep. Mike Carey (R-OH), which repealed the IRS’s proposed rule titled “Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers That Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales.” The now-revoked rules, issued under Section 6045, aimed to improve tax compliance in the crypto space but faced strong pushback from industry advocates who argued that DeFi platforms lack the personnel or structure to meet such reporting requirements.

Litigation Funders’ Tax Bill Escape Spurs Industry Reckoning: Litigation funders recently avoided a major policy challenge when a proposed 40% tax on their profits was removed from the OBBBA. Introduced by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), the measure sought to increase tax burdens on third-party entities that finance civil lawsuits and limit their ability to offset losses. While the provision was ultimately struck under the Byrd Rule, it sparked a coordinated response from funders through the International Legal Finance Association (ILFA) and other advocacy channels. The provision underscored both the fragmented nature of the industry’s lobbying efforts and ongoing calls from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for greater transparency and oversight. In response, some litigation finance firms are now pushing for more unified engagement and public education as policy discussions continue at both federal and state levels.

The Woodwell Climate Research Center thanks Congresswoman Leger Fernández for her leadership on this bill and for recognizing the urgent risk of extreme weather.”","U.S. CONGRESS News:

WASHINGTON D.C. — As wildfires rage, floods surge, and power grids strain under record-breaking heat, U.S. Reps. Leger Fernández (NM-03), Casten (IL-06), Castor (FL-11), and Ross (NC-02) introduced the Weather-Safe Energy Act of 2025. This landmark bill will equip utilities with the cutting-edge weather data, modeling, and support they need to withstand the growing threat of extreme weather. The bill addresses a critical need at a time when the nation’s energy infrastructure faces unprecedented threats from increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events, including hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and droughts. Utilities and grid operators currently lack the sophisticated weather data and modeling tools necessary to prepare for these cascading risks.

The Weather-Safe Energy Act directs the Department of Energy to create a comprehensive weather data platform that will give utilities and grid operators the information they need to plan for extreme weather events and keep the lights on during dangerous conditions. The legislation also expands research funding to better understand how severe weather affects our electricity systems and provides training and technical assistance to help energy companies use these new tools effectively. By equipping our energy sector with better weather data and planning resources, this bill will strengthen our electricity grid while ensuring reliable power for American families and businesses.

“When the lights go out during a heat wave, flood, or wildfire, it’s not just inconvenient—it’s a matter of life or death,” Leger Fernández said. “Every family deserves to know the power will stay on, no matter the forecast. We’re using the tools of science and technology to protect our communities and build a clean, resilient energy future.”

“There is no question that climate change-fueled extreme weather events will continue to threaten blackouts throughout the United States,” Rep. Sean Casten said. “Ensuring our energy system is resilient and able to withstand these events is crucial. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation to provide utilities and system operators with the information necessary to effectively respond to extreme weather, keep power running, and save lives.”

“Florida families know the cost of extreme weather all too well — from stronger hurricanes to scorching heat waves that raise our electric bills and strain our power grid,” Rep. Kathy Castor said. “The Weather-Safe Energy Act provides a forward-looking solution to help keep the lights on and our communities safe when disaster strikes. I’m proud to introduce this common-sense bill with my colleague, Rep. Leger Fernández, to ensure that we have tools to protect families from energy disruptions. By improving access to cutting-edge weather and energy data, we can empower states like Florida to build a more resilient, secure, and affordable energy future.”

“Our communities are facing more frequent and intense weather events that threaten the safety and reliability of our energy infrastructure,” Congresswoman Deborah Ross said. “In North Carolina, we have seen firsthand how extreme weather can shut down entire regions. This bill will give energy producers the information they need to prepare for extreme weather. I’m proud to lead this effort to make sure every community has the tools it needs to meet these growing challenges.”

This bill has been endorsed by the Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Woodwell Climate Research Center.

“Rep. Leger Fernandez’s Weather-Safe Energy Act is the right framework to make sure energy grid operators have the tools to keep our lights on and our homes air conditioned. The publicly available digital database and other resources in this proposal give grid operators everything they need to keep electricity flowing to our homes in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather,” a spokesperson from the Environmental Defense Fund said.

The Union of Concerned Scientists said, “UCS commends Congresswoman Leger Fernández for recognizing the critical role of federal agencies to provide science-driven tools to address issues of national importance. Passage of the Weather-Safe Energy Act would provide scientifically robust, transparent, and standardized data necessary to address one of the nation’s most pressing issues: the ability to provide a reliable, affordable electricity supply in the face of climate change and extreme weather. This is an issue anyone who cares about electric grid reliability should be able to get behind, and one where properly supported federal agencies can play a crucial role.”

Dave McGlinchey, the Chief of Government Relations at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, added, “As the threat of extreme weather events continues to increase, we must improve our defenses to protect lives and livelihoods. That includes investing in research and modeling, and enhancing data accessibility, for resilient energy infrastructure. The Weather-Safe Energy Act prioritizes these urgent needs and recognizes the importance of systems to translate research and data into practical application. The Woodwell Climate Research Center thanks Congresswoman Leger Fernández for her leadership on this bill and for recognizing the urgent risk of extreme weather.”",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,,2025-07-18 13:02:13.038781

""Affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply will be a crucial determinant of AI development,"" the report states.","(The Center Square) − The White House Council of Economic Advisers on Thursday released a report highlighting the Trump Administration's energy strategy, projecting that policies aimed at ""unleashing American energy"" could raise U.S. GDP by as much as 1.9% by 2035 and support national security, energy affordability, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

The report argues that revitalizing domestic oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production — combined with regulatory reform and infrastructure investment— can strengthen the U.S. economy while meeting the surging energy needs of AI-driven data centers and reshored manufacturing.

""The United States is blessed with a wealth of natural resources,"" the report states. ""Enacting policies that make the most of U.S. resource abundance and promote U.S. energy dominance can meaningfully contribute to economic growth and consumer welfare.""

The White House credited President Trump's executive actions, including faster permitting, resumed federal leasing, support for advanced nuclear reactors, and grid modernization efforts, for laying the groundwork for increased production and investment.

According to the analysis, energy-focused policies could increase GDP by:

0.25% to 0.67% from deregulation alone.

0.03% to 0.13% from removing restrictions on offshore oil commingling.

0.025% to 0.11% annually from expanded production on federal lands.

At least 0.03% from increased liquefied natural gas exports.

The report also links energy policy directly to AI competitiveness, citing projections that U.S. data centers will consume more electricity by 2030 than all energy-intensive goods manufacturing combined.

""There is no AI without energy,"" it warns, quoting the International Energy Agency.

The report notes that just one ChatGPT prompt can be ten times more energy-intensive than a Google search.

To meet this growing demand, the administration has proposed an ""all-of-the-above"" strategy, with special emphasis on expanding nuclear power. Four executive orders signed in May direct reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and aim to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.

""Rapid growth of low-cost domestic baseload generation is essential to compete for AI dominance,"" the report states, noting that China is already building 150 new nuclear reactors and could become the world's largest nuclear power producer by 2030.

The White House also used the report to tout the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"", which ends tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles while expanding credits for biofuels, hydrogen, hydropower, and carbon capture.

The bill also appropriates funds to rebuild the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and build out grid reliability.

In a warning about overreliance on renewables without adequate backup, the report cites a major blackout in parts of Europe earlier this year caused by a sudden drop in solar generation, calling it ""a concerning example of some critical flaws of renewable energy.""

To stabilize prices and supply, the administration advocates for delaying the retirement of coal and nuclear plants and interconnecting U.S. regional power grids.

""Even during hours of normal operation,"" the report notes, ""arbitraging regional price differences could lead to cost savings.""

The report concludes that small modular reactors could play a vital role in meeting data center needs. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are already exploring co-locating data centers with SMRs.

""SMRs may end up being less costly than their conventional counterparts,"" the report claims.

""Affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply will be a crucial determinant of AI development,"" the report states.

On Tuesday, the president summoned leaders from tech, energy, and finance to Pittsburgh — that Silicon Valley of western Pennsylvania, a veritable Menlo Park on the Monongahela — where executives gushed about Trump’s apparent leadership as if their survival on a dating show depended on it.

At the summit, the industry offered some new insight into how it’s thinking about a key question it faces, namely how AI companies are going to find the electricity to fuel their exponential growth. Hint: The answer might not be solar, wind, and batteries.

Investment firm Blackstone, for instance, unveiled a $25 billion strategy to build data centers alongside fossil gas power plants in Pennsylvania, which is rich in natural gas that’s hard to export elsewhere. Loading up the Keystone State with data centers could thus boost the fracking industry, which has plateaued in recent years.

Google brought its own major commitment, but with a clean twist: The tech giant will work with Brookfield Asset Management to relicense a pair of Pennsylvania hydropower plants to funnel up to 3 gigawatts of clean power to data centers in the region for 20 years.

The splashy announcements follow one from Microsoft last fall, in which the tech giant said it plans to bring back a reactor at Three Mile Island (the quietly retired one, not the one that had those problems you may have heard about) and use its output to power computing operations. No nuclear reactor has ever been restarted in the country, though a few restarts are in progress now.

There’s something other than Pennsylvania’s energy-rich geography connecting these three AI-energy plays: They’re banking on big, old-school, slow-moving energy projects to keep pace with the propulsive sprint of AI.

While gas is the No. 1 source of electricity in the U.S., new plants can’t be spun up quickly; top-tier turbine suppliers have warned of multi-year backlogs for that key ingredient. As for hydropower, new construction of major generators has stagnated for decades. Nuclear construction has shown more signs of life, but barely: Two new reactors were started and finished in the last 30 years, way behind schedule and massively over budget.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has been churning out gigawatts of new solar and battery installations, especially in Texas, where free markets reign and jealous incumbents have fewer tools to eliminate competition.

But Trump’s new budget bill whacked the solar and wind sector and threw new foreign-content restrictions at the grid storage industry. Analysts at the Rhodium Group think the budget law will eliminate about 60% of the clean power capacity we would have built in the next 10 years.

The law, then, is manufacturing energy scarcity at the moment when AI tycoons need abundance. Perhaps the long-lead-time technologies of bygone decades will shrug off their sluggishness and meet the moment. But history suggests that’s a risky thing to depend on for the nation’s tech dominance.

More big energy stories

Rural energy funding in turmoil

For over two decades, the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, has helped farmers and rural businesses save on energy costs, ranging from installing solar panels to buying more efficient grain dryers. The program has given out billions of dollars in grants and loans in its lifetime, and was infused with another $2 billion by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 — but now the Trump administration has cast uncertainty over the future of REAP, Kari Lydersen reports for Canary Media.

After taking office in January, Trump froze over $1 billion in REAP funds. Then, on July 1, the USDA abruptly canceled a grant application window for the program. The administration has also explicitly said it wants the program to deemphasize its most popular function: helping farmers afford solar. Farmers are concerned about the upheaval with the popular program, which, as Kari reports in a second story, largely benefits Republican congressional districts.

Consumers could lose big as Trump pushes fossil fuels

Twice now, Trump has ordered aging fossil-fueled power plants to stay open right as they were about to close. These directives, which energy experts agree are unnecessary, could cost consumers tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars — and some fear Trump might just be getting started, Jeff St. John reports for Canary.

Last week, Trump’s Energy Department released a report that experts say relies on flawed math to bolster the case for keeping old coal-fired power plants online past their planned closure dates. Experts fear the administration will use this report to justify additional orders like the two Trump has already made. If that happens, Jeff reports in a second story that it would be disastrous for Americans, potentially costing them billions of dollars in extra energy costs all to prop up expensive, polluting energy infrastructure that the grid doesn’t need.

Solar, wind and battery storage accounted for 93 percent of power capacity added to the grid last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“In stark contradiction to the Administration’s commitment to tackling bureaucracy, this directive adds three new layers of needless process and unprecedented political review to the construction of domestic energy projects,” Grumet said in a statement.","But the directive sparked bipartisan angst on Capitol Hill. Congressional Republicans fear a future Democratic administration will use these moves as a roadmap to derail fossil fuel energy sources. Democrats worry Trump’s efforts to stunt less expensive wind and solar projects will raise electricity prices across the country.

“It is definitely playing favorites and they’ve made it very clear they do not support continuation of new wind and solar projects,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), adding the Interior memo “is like putting the final nail into” a last-minute compromise she helped negotiate as part of the GOP’s megalaw offering more time for projects that begin construction in the next 12 months to qualify for tax credits.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, expressed concern about potential delays in approving energy infrastructure.

“Every energy project needs to be permitted as fast as possible regardless of resource,” she said, adding that Republicans dealt with the “heavy hand” of the Biden administration’s slow approvals of LNG, drilling and pipelines over the last four years.

“We know what that feels like,” she said. The Trump administration “should remember this. I just think it should be a fair playing field and we ought to move forward with all types.”

Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, warned the move would hamstring the U.S. economy by delaying additions of readily available power.

“The president and Secretary Burgum will then be responsible for raising electricity prices on every state in this country because that will be the end result of that kind of abuse of permitting,” he said. “I would warn them if they create this as a precedent and it survives, a future administration could play the same game with oil and gas pipelines and leases.”

The department’s new policy requires Burgum’s office to weigh in on virtually every aspect of or permit for solar and wind projects with a nexus to Interior. That includes siting, navigating threats to endangered species, road access and right-of-way permissions.

“There are some projects — particularly in the West because that’s mostly where you’re going to see this Interior footprint — that are going to be directly impacted by this, significantly impacted by this,” said Walter McLeod, managing director of Monarch Strategic Ventures, which finances solar and battery storage projects.

Those steps would ensnare a massive amount of projects, said Ted Boling, a partner at law firm Perkins Coie who spent decades working on permitting at Interior and the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

Projects that begin on private land but must cross public land — such as transmission lines that connect solar and wind to other power lines carrying electricity to populated areas — require authorization from Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, he said. Transmission projects, which can span hundreds of miles, that cross national wildlife refuges on Interior-managed land may also need Burgum’s approval, Boling added.

Some companies and clean energy advocates worried the directive would slow solar and wind approvals to a crawl by creating a bottleneck at Burgum’s office. The memo outlining the new marching orders referenced several executive orders that were designed to either elevate fossil fuel production or stymie renewable power.

Solar, wind and battery storage accounted for 93 percent of power capacity added to the grid last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas turbines face a yearslong backlog. New coal-fired power plants are unlikely given the competition from more cost-effective renewables and natural gas despite the Trump administration’s efforts to revive the coal industry.

Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said the memo was a “short-sighted policy” that would strangle U.S. power supply just as demand is surging from artificial intelligence and manufacturing, among other drivers.

“This is ideology over practicality,” he said.

Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), who helped negotiate the compromise providing more time for wind and solar projects to qualify for tax credits, said he is “concerned enough” that he is asking Burgum for a meeting to clarify the memo.

Requiring Burgum’s direct input at so many turns of each project seemed “a pretty bald-faced attempt to throw wrenches in the works,” said Steve Feldgus, who was principal deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management at Interior during the Biden administration.

American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet called the new policy “obstruction” and an “intentional effort to slow energy production.” He said it hinders Trump’s pledge to lower energy prices and secure AI investment by impeding new power from connecting to the grid amid rising electricity demand.

“In stark contradiction to the Administration’s commitment to tackling bureaucracy, this directive adds three new layers of needless process and unprecedented political review to the construction of domestic energy projects,” Grumet said in a statement.

Harry Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy United, who leads the clean energy organization’s federal engagement efforts, said in a statement it is “deeply disappointing to see the Administration yet again singling out affordable energy sources for added scrutiny, particularly at a time of rising demand. This is the antithesis of expedited permitting that the Administration supposedly favors.”

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), put it bluntly: “It sounds blatantly political on the face of it.”",https://static.politico.com/39/d3/728ce6a94314bf940c4077714136/official-state-symbols-41297.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:54:26.953466

Georgia Power did not specify how these auctions would be split between different renewable energy technologies, but the dominance of solar in the state’s renewable energy mix suggests it will continue to play a key role. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar provided the largest share of the state’s renewable electricity generation in 2024 for the third year in a row, accounting for half of Georgia’s renewable electricity generation and nearly 7% of its total net generation.

However, “almost all” of this generation came from utility-scale solar, with the EIA reporting that the state had 5.2GW of utility-scale PV capacity in operation at the beginning of this year. Georgia added around 1.5GW of utility-scale solar alone in 2024, accounting for a significant portion of the state’s 7.5GW of capacity in operation across all scales.

The utility’s latest IRP notes that clean energy procurement bids will be opened for both the utility-scale and distributed sectors, suggesting there could be potential for commercial and industrial (C&I) and residential solar in Georgia’s energy future.

Delivering grid growth

Georgia has seen a number of new investments in the solar sector this year, but many of these have focused on manufacturing and recycling, rather than project deployment. Last month, Qcells launched a new recycling arm, to be headquartered in Georgia, and in May German research centre ISC Konstanz announced that it would work with cell manufacturer Suniva on its crystalline silicon cell production facility in the state.

The utility’s IRP also includes a ten-year plan for transmission upgrades, including more than 1,000 miles of new transmission lines and steps to “improve the system’s efficiency and resiliency”. The plan also established “semi-annual meetings” with PSC Public Interest Advocacy (PIA) staff to assess the progress of grid expansion projects, and “implement a formal review process” to better integrate solar and storage projects into the state’s grid.

A lack of available grid capacity has long been a challenge for the US, both in terms of connecting completed projects to the grid and giving investors confidence that the projects they back will receive grid connections. Figures from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, published in January, found that close to 80% of new US energy generation projects awaiting grid connections withdraw their applications before coming online, so long is the queue for connections.

In Detail : U.S. solar panel manufacturers have filed a petition seeking new tariffs on imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos. They allege that producers from these countries are dumping solar products into the American market at unfairly low prices, undermining domestic manufacturers.

The petition was submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission. It claims that these imports threaten billions of dollars in planned investments and risk destabilizing the growing domestic solar manufacturing sector.

According to the manufacturers, companies in these countries are benefiting from subsidies and exporting solar modules at prices that do not reflect fair market value. This practice, they argue, creates an uneven playing field for U.S. producers.

The move comes at a time when the United States is actively working to build a robust clean energy supply chain at home. Industry players say that without action, the flood of low-cost imports could derail progress toward domestic manufacturing goals.

India, Indonesia, and Laos are emerging players in the global solar supply chain, and these proposed tariffs could significantly affect their exports. The issue also raises broader questions about balancing global trade with clean energy expansion.

July 17, 2025 (Boston, MA) – Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) has filed an amicus brief in federal court on behalf of 17 community-based organizations and local governments whose Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant funding was abruptly terminated by the Trump administration. Filed in Appalachian Voices v. EPA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the brief supports a motion to restore funding while litigation proceeds – and lays bare the devastating impact these cuts have had on frontline communities.

“These groups are the beating heart of environmental justice work across our country,” said Britteny Jenkins, CLF’s vice president for environmental justice. “Cutting their funding isn’t just bureaucratic cruelty – it’s a targeted strike on the people most impacted by pollution and climate change. When you cut off the grassroots, you cut off progress, well, at its roots.”

The organizations represented by CLF are subrecipients of EPA grants – trusted local partners tapped by primary grantees to carry out on-the-ground work of public health, education, climate resilience, and pollution reduction. Many serve communities that have historically fought numerous environmental challenges – and several are based here in New England.

“When our neighbors in New Hampshire or Vermont or across the country lose funding to address food insecurity, monitor air quality, or educate youth about lead exposure, we all lose,” added Jenkins. “This is not just their fight. Our communities are interconnected. An attack on one is a setback for all.”

Though not formal plaintiffs in the case, the subrecipients’ work has been at risk of pausing critical community work, losing staff capacity, and unraveling progress made through years of dedicated effort. In some cases, that work has been completely stopped.

CLF is providing pro bono legal counsel to these organizations, urging the court to recognize both the urgent harm and the national stakes.

“The Thriving Communities grant would have supported the scaling of Gather’s food recovery initiative called Seacoast Waste Not, which rescues quality surplus food from participating restaurants, caterers, cafeterias, food brokers, and food manufacturers across New Hampshire, southern Maine, and northern Massachusetts. This recovered food would have doubled the number of well-balanced meals Gather makes and distributes to hungry residents in our region. Food waste in our landfills is a serious problem and a major source of methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. In diverting this food from our overflowing landfills, Gather would have significantly decreased the amount of carbon methane emissions. Investing in food recovery is smart, strategic, and cost-effective.”

“The termination of the EPA’s Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program is not just a bureaucratic setback—it’s a direct blow to frontline communities who have historically borne the brunt of environmental injustice. This decision undermines years of trust-building between government and grassroots organizations, and it jeopardizes urgently needed investments in environmental health, economic opportunity, and racial equity. ECC stands with our partners in calling on the court to restore these critical funds, so that communities most impacted by pollution and climate change can lead in shaping the solutions they need and deserve.”

,EPA,2025-07-18 16:11:13+00:00,The Colorado Sun,“Slap in the face”: EPA ruling could alter Colorado's plans for coal plant closures,"Michael Booth, Michael Booth Environment",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/07/18/epa-colorado-coal-fired-power-plants-extension/,"Trump administration rollbacks of key state anti-pollution policies continued this week, with the EPA telling Colorado it can’t set deadlines for coal power plant closures under Clean Air Act rules.
The EPA ruling said Colorado could not include the dates of the remaining six coal plant closures as part of its latest SIP.
Federal energy and environment regulators under Trump have said coal power can be cheaper and more reliable as baseline power than intermittent clean energy sources.
The recent budget policy passed by Congress eliminates most clean energy development credits and consumer rebates, while spiking tariffs make cheap Asian solar panels far more expensive.
“Colorado utilities have their own ambitious plans to reduce costs, including retiring costly coal plants to transition to more stable clean energy, and lower costs,” a governor’s spokesperson said.","Trump administration rollbacks of key state anti-pollution policies continued this week, with the EPA telling Colorado it can’t set deadlines for coal power plant closures under Clean Air Act rules.

Colorado Springs Utilities is already using the ruling to consider extending its Nixon 1 unit in Fountain past a planned December 2029 closure, and environmental groups decried the EPA ruling as a “shocking” warning of looming assaults on anti-pollution laws.

“There’s every reason to be concerned that this proposal could be the opening salvo of a broader attack on Colorado’s efforts to move away from costly and dirty coal,” said Jeremy Nichols of the Center for Biological Diversity. “This is a major slap in the face to the state’s ability to protect clean air on its terms.”

Colorado Springs Utilities said it has not officially changed the date of closing Nixon 1, which is one of six remaining coal-fired power plants in Colorado scheduled to shut down entirely by 2031. But the EPA’s decision notice in the Federal Register said CSU wants flexibility on Nixon because it can no longer assure the opening of cleaner alternatives by 2029.

“The EPA notes that at least one of the sources slated for closure in the SIP — Nixon Unit 1 — has expressly stated that it does not consent to closing by the enforceable deadline,” the EPA’s Federal Register notice says.

“Moving forward with the 2029 date poses serious reliability challenges and we are in discussions with the state on how best to address this,” a CSU spokesperson said in written responses to questions about Nixon. “ We are seeking a smart energy transition at a pace that makes sense given the current challenges around cost and reliability … choosing to include Nixon could present serious reliability challenges for Colorado Springs Utilities. Our goal is to maintain system reliability and affordability, while finding a suitable retirement date for Nixon.”

Xcel Energy, the largest power generator in Colorado, said, “Nothing in this action from the Environmental Protection Agency directly changes our Colorado resource plans.

“We continue to make significant progress towards our emission reduction goals approved by the state which would require us to retire our coal units by 2030. We’re working with the administration and our states to continue delivering customers safe, clean, reliable energy while keeping our customers’ bills as low as possible.”

The Western Region 8 of the EPA filed notice this week it was partially approving and partially disapproving Colorado’s “state implementation plan” or SIP to meet federal rules requiring reduction of pollutants that lead to humanmade haze in national parks and other open spaces. Closing coal- and natural gas-fired power plants in favor of clean solar and wind energy has been an important part of those state haze-reduction plans.

The EPA ruling said Colorado could not include the dates of the remaining six coal plant closures as part of its latest SIP.

Regional administrator Cyrus Western, a former Wyoming state representative, said in a phone interview Thursday, “So at a high level, what we’re saying is that there are not going to be any coal-fired units shut down because of federal regulations breathing down their necks.”

Colorado has also said in policy directions and state law that coal plant closures are needed to meet its mandated greenhouse gas cuts, and to bring the Front Range under EPA ozone limits. Asked if the federal government would intervene further and challenge all state laws discouraging coal power, Western said this week’s decision is limited to the haze rule.

“Whatever the conversations that go on between the state of Colorado and those utilities, that’s their business,” Western said. “But we’ve made it really clear that these shutdowns are not going to happen on our watch, and the Clean Air Act does not allow for these federal steps, to be shut down against the will of the power generation owner.”

Colorado can meet the federal haze regulations without the remaining scheduled coal plant shutdowns, Western said. Federal energy and environment regulators under Trump have said coal power can be cheaper and more reliable as baseline power than intermittent clean energy sources. The Federal Register notice includes a discussion reflecting Trump administration claims that surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers and other heavy users requires growth of fossil fuels for baseline power generation.

“There are a lot of conversations that should have happened under previous governments, previous Democratic administrators, to really continue to work with coal, versus just telling them, ’Hey, you’re going to shut down,’” Western said.

Environmental groups noted in response that the Trump administration has ordered fossil fuel power plants to stay open rather than close as scheduled, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, and could do the same in Colorado. Trump also issued executive orders promoting coal mining and coal power, and warned states the Department of Justice could go after state-level environmental laws that federal agencies now say are an overreach.

The Region 8 haze decision promoting coal appears to be “part of a broader attack on state sovereignty and states’ ability to make their own environmental policies,” said Surbhi Sarang, a clean power attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund.

A spokesperson for the Colorado health department’s Air Pollution Control Division said under state regulations, retirement dates for coal plants “remain enforceable.”

“We’re not impacted by the EPA’s proposed partial disapproval of Colorado’s ambitious and protective regional haze plan — and the decision won’t change Colorado’s direction or delay the transition already underway,” Division director Michael Ogletree said in an emailed statement.

“Utilities are moving away from coal because it’s no longer the most affordable or reliable option. Many coal plants have already shut down or are on track to retire — driven by economics and cost savings for consumers, not federal mandates. That transition is locked in through utility planning, and will continue regardless of this federal decision,” Ogletree said.

Colorado Springs Utilities, environmental groups and others have noted, however, that Trump administration decisions have made future solar and wind power farms more expensive to develop, while lowered federal severance taxes and lease costs could make coal cheaper. The recent budget policy passed by Congress eliminates most clean energy development credits and consumer rebates, while spiking tariffs make cheap Asian solar panels far more expensive.

“Unless the state steps up to defend its rules and transition from coal, we’re going to get rolled by fossil fuel zealots,” Nichols said.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is also running for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2026, has said his office will defend Colorado’s aggressive climate change and clean energy legislation.

Gov. Jared Polis’ office also said the regional EPA decision on haze would have “no meaningful impact” on utility plans.

“Colorado utilities have their own ambitious plans to reduce costs, including retiring costly coal plants to transition to more stable clean energy, and lower costs,” a governor’s spokesperson said.",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Colo_Sun_Carbon_Cap_Nixon_Gen_Sta_01.jpg?fit=1800%2C1128&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-18 13:55:14.891794

BYD surpassed Tesla last year to become the world’s top-selling EV brand, but most Americans have never seen a BYD car and won’t anytime soon.

Tariffs on Chinese EVs have kept BYD off America’s roads, but these won’t help it be competitive in the long run. China’s industrial model includes government support, long-term planning, and aggressive innovation, which puts it in a position to leave America’s auto industry behind. BYD specifically manufactures its own components in-house, making its vehicles cheaper.

Now that Trump’s budget has slashed the IRA, Democrats have shifted their messaging to argue that the budget bill will raise costs for Americans. It’s an effort to portray Republicans as the party of higher energy costs and power shortages and target the moderate Republicans who once urged Congress to preserve Biden’s tax breaks, but voted for Trump’s bill anyway.

New EV ATP: In June, the average transaction price (ATP) for new electric vehicles dipped slightly to $56,910, reflecting a 0.6% decrease from May and a 2.8% decline year over year. The price gap between EVs and ICE+ vehicles narrowed to $8,785, down from $9,260 the previous month. EV incentives rose for the third consecutive month, reaching a record 14.8% of ATP, or $8,451 – more than twice the incentive level offered on ICE+ vehicles. This underscores the continued push to make EVs more accessible amid softening demand. Seven EV models had average transaction prices below $40,000, with the Nissan Leaf remaining the most affordable at $32,047. The Chevrolet Equinox, priced at $39,731, led in sales volume, making it the top-selling EV in this price range.

Used EV Listing Price: The used electric vehicle market saw a modest price increase in June, with the average listing price rising to $36,046, up 0.3% from the previous month and 3.6% year over year. The price gap between used EVs and ICE+ vehicles remained narrow, below $2,000.Importantly, 43% of used EVs sold were priced under $25,000, highlighting the growing affordability in this segment. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, the top-selling used EVs, both fell within this range, averaging $22,998 and $29,111, respectively.

What’s Next

As the EV market enters the second half of 2025, momentum remains strong. Q2 sales rose 4.9% over Q1, and total EV sales for the first half of the year hit a record 607,089, up 1.5% year over year, as reported in the Kelley Blue Book EV Sales Report. With the federal EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act set to expire at the end of September, the next few months are likely to bring a wave of compelling EV offers, creating a critical window for consumers to act.

However, the landscape is shifting from one shaped by policy support to one increasingly defined by market realities.

Amid this evolving environment, the used EV segment is maturing, bringing greater model variety and more competitive pricing. These trends are opening new doors for buyers seeking long-term value and more accessible entry points.

But the outlook for Q4 is far less certain. The elimination of government-backed incentives and the emergence of new tariff headwinds signal a more volatile phase for the industry. The training wheels are coming off, and the transition to electrification will no longer be buoyed by incentives alone.

Automakers and retailers alike will need to navigate this next chapter with agility, as the EV landscape becomes more complex and demanding of true market resilience.",https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EV-Market-Monitor-image-Facebook.jpeg,N,,2025-07-18 13:00:14.890854

Glenn Youngkin last week announced funding to take the first steps towards building an advanced nuclear reactor in the southwest region of the state.

Wise County is the focus of a combined grant of $197,500 to search for private investment and federal funding to prepare the area for an advanced nuclear reactor. The area will be studied to find what kind of advanced nuclear reactor would best serve the region, how it would be funded, and if it could be used for research and power at the University of Virginia Wise.

“This study is going to look at all the possibilities. What do we need? Does it help with data center development? But also we’re in a unique position to where you have an institution of higher education right there,” said Duane Miller, executive director of LENOWISCO Planning District Commission.

There have been discussions of a reactor coming to the area for some time as funding has been sought out. Members of the public have expressed concern over nuclear power coming to their doorstep. Miller said this study process will have a public education and interaction period before any project is allowed to move forward. A reactor will be years away from construction in the area, but there is a lot to understand about the growing interest in the new-age small reactors.

What are advanced nuclear reactors?

The third generation of nuclear power facilities are considered advanced nuclear reactors. Most of the designs are small modular reactors, only generating a maximum of 300 MW. They are less costly than a full-sized reactor, driving interest in their development, and they are able to provide power in more remote areas. They are also touted as safer than full-sized reactors due to safety measures that can automatically stop a meltdown.

There are four main types of reactors that the U.S. Department of Energy lays out.

-Advanced small modular water-cooled reactor (SMR), which uses water as a coolant and is smaller than a traditional light water reactor.

-Liquid metal-cooled fast reactors use sodium or lead as a coolant instead of water, allowing the coolant to operate at higher temperature and lower pressures.

-Gas-cooled reactors use flowing gas to cool them and are designed for higher temperatures.

-Molten salt reactors use molten fluoride or chloride salts as coolant.

There are currently no reactors of these designs in operation in the United States, but several states have cleared the way for the construction of new smaller reactors.

There are dozens of companies racing to have their designs approved as the interest in kickstarting the nuclear industry again in the U.S. grows. A 2024 Pew Research survey showed that 56% of Americans are in support of expanding nuclear energy. That is significantly lower than the interest in expanding solar and wind, which are at 78% and 72%, respectively. Public interest in those renewable energy sources has significantly dropped since 2020, mainly from Republicans who are shifting focus to nuclear, according to the survey.

Having an advanced nuclear reactor online and producing power is still years off, with the first ones projected to power up in the 2030s. There are multiple advanced reactors in construction already in other states. TerraPower is building a molten salt reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming. It has 345 MW capacity and can power more than 250,000 homes. The company aims to have it online early in the next decade.

How are advanced nuclear reactors approved?

On the local level, a roadmap has to be created, which is being done with the grant funding, to show options for placement, investors, and workforce development. Permitting by the county requires multiple public meetings and votes. State legislation has already been passed to allow utilities to comp some of the development costs of advanced nuclear reactors by passing the costs to consumers.

On a federal level, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is in charge of licensing and regulating commercial nuclear power plants. Applicants have to undergo a safety, environmental, and antitrust review. There are public meetings held near the site to go over the findings of the reviews.

Only one of the third generation reactor designs have been approved by the NRC, with others working through the process. Fourth generation designs are also in the works. The NRC then visits and approves individual sites for reactors based on various requirements and environmental impacts.

The reviews include looking at site characteristics, design of the nuclear plant, how the plant would respond to hypothetical accidents, what could be emitted from the plant to impact the environment, and other emergency plans.

As there are dozens of designs floating around for these advanced nuclear reactors, the NRC also has to approve the designs in order to move forward with the application.

President Donald Trump has also been pushing for the small reactors to get up and running in the country. In May, he signed an executive order to direct the federal government to develop policies to expedite investment and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors.

The order also allows the Department of Defense to have a say in the approval of these new reactors on federal lands, taking some of the power away from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which has had the sole power in the past. This comes as a major political push for nuclear reactors takes center stage in national debates about energy production

Why Wise County?

Southwest Virginia once was a bustling energy producer in the heyday of coal production. Department of Energy Secretary Glenn Davis said he anticipates thousands of jobs could be created through the advanced nuclear reactor industry.

“Southwest Virginia was the energy capital of the East Coast, and it is sitting in a prime position to lead this new energy resurgence,” Davis said. “It’s perfectly situated, so we’re just trying to make sure we’re out in front of it, and getting the ball rolling.”

The state is not only considering producing nuclear energy, but Davis said there is interest in bringing manufacturing of the reactors to the commonwealth. He hopes to have some announcements by the end of the year.

Miller explained that like much of the rest of the state, there is a growing demand for reliable power sources. They are in support of an “all of the above” portfolio for energy production, an echo of the energy platform of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. With data centers popping up in their region, he believes that wind and solar power won’t be enough to meet demand.

“What we’re looking at right now, at least at the outset, would be something to help provide power…for UV-Wise but also to provide power for data center development at the adjacent data center park at the Lonesome Pine Technology park,” Miller said.

He said the region also wants to provide research opportunities at the university to aid in training students for the nuclear workforce as the industry grows.

With the university and workforce that is no stranger to energy production, Davis believes the region would benefit from small reactor manufacturing. The grant funds will be focused on bringing one project online, while the state separately works to secure manufacturing facilities.

What comes next for the Wise County project?

The Virginia Innovative Nuclear Hub is assisting local leaders and stakeholders in making a roadmap of the type of reactor that would be needed in that region to meet their future growth aspirations.

“When you’re deploying nuclear, you have a lot of licensing, you have site prep, you have to be able to figure out how you’re going to connect to the grid or not connect to the grid or whatever the case is,” said Jeff Whitt, director of Virginia Innovative Nuclear.

Whitt has decades of experience in the nuclear industry. He believes that Virginia is optimally positioned to develop these emerging reactors to manage energy needs.

“Deploying nuclear technology in a highly regulated, highly licensed regime with somewhat complex supply chain demands, it takes time and some organizations will be more mature in being able to do that than others will,” Whitt said.

Miller wants to assure the community of Wise County that this project can’t be rushed through the permitting process and there will be multiple chances for the public to learn about advanced nuclear reactors and how it could look in their communities.

The roadmap will be developed over the coming months while the state also applies for federal assistance to begin early implementation for a project. Davis said there are two other advanced nuclear reactor sites proposed near the North Anna nuclear reactor site, which aim to come online in the early 2030s. The Wise County reactor would be online around the same time, should permitting and investment go through.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:54:01.925098

According to Cox Automotive, wholesale prices – adjusted for mix, mileage and seasonality –dipped 0.7% from June levels in the first 15 days of July. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index (MUVVI) registered 206.9 mid-month, a 2.6% increase year-over-year, though the seasonal adjustment made July’s pricing appear weaker than it actually is.

“Price appreciation trends against last year are starting to moderate as we enter Q3, a time that showed stronger pricing than normal for wholesale markets last year,” Jeremy Robb, senior director of Economic and Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, says in a statement. “However, wholesale supply is quite a bit tighter than last year, so supply and demand are well balanced currently.”

More Depreciation Than Normal

The 1.6% non-adjusted drop in prices was sharper compared to June. Historically, July sees a 0.7% decline for the full month, suggesting early July’s depreciation is heavier than usual, reports Cox.

Year-over-year, however, unadjusted prices are still up 2.8%, though that reflects an unusually hot July 2024 market, making current comparisons appear softer.

The average daily sales conversion rate – the percentage of vehicles sold relative to inventory – dropped to 54.9% in early July, down from 57.8% in June and lower than July 2024’s 57.0%. Cox analysts say that dip signals a modest cooling in wholesale demand.

Dealer Takeaways: Trucks Up, EVs Leading Gains

For franchised and independent dealers navigating inventory acquisition, segment performance varied:

Inventory Remains Tight

Wholesale supply continues to favor sellers. As of July 15, supply stood at 25 days – unchanged from the end of June and three days lower than the same time last year. That’s also about two days below typical levels for mid-July.

""Thank you for your participation in the 6th National Climate Assessment. At this time, the scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990. We are now releasing all current assessment participants from their roles. As plans develop for the assessment, there may be future opportunities to contribute or engage. Thank you for your service.”

This was the email that landed April 28 in the inboxes of the nearly 400 scientists who were contributing to the latest National Climate Assessment (NCA), the congressionally mandated review of how global warming impacts the US. One of these scientists was Elizabeth Koebele, an environmental social scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno. She was at home, trying to get work done on a grant proposal.

“It was the middle of the afternoon when I got the email,” says Koebele, who was one of the chapter leads for the sixth NCA, due out in 2028. Thirteen US agencies work with the scientist-authors over several years to produce each assessment, which draws upon the most up-to-date research to report on current and projected climate conditions in the US.

Koebele had been chipping away at the massive assessment for over 6 months—coordinating with the federal employees at the US Global Change Research Program (GCRP), searching out other volunteer scientists to contribute to the report, and generally reading and sending a lot of emails.

But she was not expecting the email that dismissed her. “We knew that things were challenging and staff were being laid off” but didn’t think that all the authors would be released, she says. The email was so short and blunt that Koebele was sure she’d get a follow-up from a trusted source about it. But that never came. Instead, Koebele turned to the social network Bluesky and quickly found that many other authors were posting about it there, likewise surprised and dismayed.

The Donald J. Trump administration has said no more since then about the next NCA, but it has taken multiple actions that seem to undermine evidence that climate change is a threat to human health and welfare and to remove this evidence from government websites.

What will fill in the void? Will the Trump administration turn to junk science?

Melissa Finucane, vice president of science and innovation, Union of Concerned Scientists

On June 30, the website for the GCRP—the federal entity that coordinates government research on climate change—went dark. All past versions of the NCA hosted on the website went with it. Also on June 30, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked the White House Office of Management and Budget to reconsider a key 2009 scientific finding that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions endanger human health, known as the endangerment finding. And on July 8, the New York Times broke the news that the US Department of Energy (DOE) had hired three scientists known for their climate change–denialist stances.

Scientists and environmental advocates say that these actions aren’t isolated incidents. Along with the release of the NCA authors, they add up to an attempt by the Trump administration’s EPA to stop regulating GHGs altogether.

Knocking down the endangerment finding

On March 12, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced the government’s intention to reconsider the endangerment finding, which he called the “holy grail of the climate change religion.” Issued by the EPA during Barack Obama’s administration, the endangerment finding is the scientific and legal foundation for the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. It essentially says that because GHGs contribute to climate change, they are harmful to people and should be regulated.

Striking down the endangerment finding would mean that GHGs could no longer legally be regulated by the federal government, since regulations that rely on the finding would no longer be valid. To fully free GHGs from regulatory constraints, each of the laws and rules would still have to be rescinded.

The EPA really has only two legal ways of rescinding the endangerment finding, according to Andy Miller, former senior science adviser for the EPA's Office of Research and Development. One method is to ask Congress to change the Clean Air Act to say that GHGs are not pollutants. This is the harder road and unlikely to be successful, Miller says. The other way is to show a solid scientific basis for overturning the finding.

“The endangerment finding is based on what's called a highly influential scientific assessment,” Miller says. Under government rules, agencies making such assessments must cite research with a solid scientific basis. So to overturn the endangerment finding, the EPA would have to say it has new science that invalidates the previous science that supported the finding, Miller says, or that past research was somehow inappropriate or not robust. But by the same government rules, any new science also must be built on a solid scientific basis.

“Zeldin has said that [the EPA] plans to go through notice and comment to revoke the endangerment finding,” says Jeff Holmstead, former assistant administrator of the EPA Office of Air and Radiation and now a lawyer at the firm Bracewell. That means the EPA would have to get a lot of information and data together and “then write up a proposal that says, ‘Upon further reflection and looking at these other things, we believe that it was incorrect to say that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles or from other US sources are reasonably anticipated to endanger public health and welfare,’” Holmstead says.

In essence, the EPA would have to produce a new mini NCA.

The agency would have to put this proposal up for public review for the legally required amount of time, Holmstead says. “Then they would issue a final rule that revokes the endangerment finding more broadly, that in and of itself could be challenged,” he says.

According to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs’ online schedule, Office of Management and Budget meetings about the EPA’s proposed reconsideration of the endangerment finding started on July 10 and are ongoing.

To NCA or not to NCA

In the past, the NCAs have been used to support the endangerment finding because they provide the solid scientific evidence the government requires, Miller says. But with the release of Koebele and the other authors in April, the future of the NCA is up in the air. Scientists and environmental activists worry about what scientific evidence the Trump administration might turn to instead of the NCA.

“What will fill in the void? Will the Trump administration turn to junk science?” says Melissa Finucane, vice president of science and innovation at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group.

Legally, the government has to produce an NCA. The Global Change Research Act of 1990, a US law that requires the government to research climate change, includes a mandate to create the report. But the timetable is malleable, Miller says. “The requirement is to produce a report every 4 years to the president and Congress,” he says. “But we’re now, what, 35 years after the passage of the act and we're now on the sixth climate assessment? So it's clearly not every 4 years.”

In theory, the Trump administration could not put out an NCA at all. But just not issuing one doesn't help overturn the endangerment finding, Holmstead from Bracewell says. “If they convened a new group and that group were to draft an NCA that somehow concludes that greenhouse gas emissions are not reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, then that would be a step towards revoking the 2009 endangerment finding,” he says.

Miller agrees. “If they were not to do a new NCA, then the scientific record would not change,” he says. “But if they do a new one from their perspective, they have something new to point to.” Miller suspects that the Trump administration will release a report that reflects its policy preferences. And the DOE’s recent engagement of three climate change–denial scientists suggests the administration is moving in that direction, he says.

Many scientists and environmental advocates fear such a revisionist NCA. “They could do some reckless stuff with it by subverting the intent and making it kind of a splashy climate denialist version of the assessment report,” says Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental scientist at San José State University and one of the released authors.

In the past, the NCAs have varied significantly in scope and depth, the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Finucane says. But this time is different, she says. “Any resumption of the climate [assessment] process will be perceived to be a political rather than a scientific endeavor,” Finucane says. Because of that, the credibility of the NCA takes a hit, “and it could be a lasting hit.”

If they were not to do a new NCA, then the scientific record would not change. But if they do a new one from their perspective, they have something new to point to.

Andy Miller, former senior science adviser, EPA Office of Research and Development

Working against a revised NCA is the fact that the GCRP would have a hard time gathering enough authors to write a scientific assessment concluding that GHGs don’t endanger public health or welfare, Miller says. “There are only a few people who have scientifically robust enough backgrounds that would be appropriate that could even pass a laugh test in terms of authorship,” he says.

The new report would need reviewers too. “You have to have a separate group of people who will do a review of this document if you're going to follow the rules,” Miller says. And very few people with the right scientific background would be willing to stand up and say that all the NCAs to date were wrong, he says.

But the damage could go beyond issuing a report at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change, he says. “I think that the damage is that this is the process now. In some ways, the report doesn't matter anymore,” Mulvaney says. The spectacle of the administration dismissing the NCA authors and showing that it has the power to stop scientific reports is the goal, he says.

Representatives from the US government offices that oversee the NCA—the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the GCRP—did not respond to requests for comment.

“It’s up to Congress”

No matter what kind of NCA the government might produce, whether or not it happens during this administration is in Congress’s hands, says Joseph Brazauskas, senior counsel at Bracewell.

“It's up to Congress to enforce and oversee the directive that's given to the federal government,” he says, to the extent that Congress indicates it ought to happen, appropriates funds, and ultimately authorizes the funds needed to complete the assessment. “The way that Congress has written this bill, this law, essentially, is that it gives the discretion to the federal government to choose the members of the council” and other overseeing members however they choose to, he says.

I think that the damage is that this is the process now. In some ways, the report doesn't matter anymore.

Dustin Mulvaney, environmental scientist and former NCA author, San José State University

But if Congress does not demand that the sixth NCA be delivered in 2028, there’s no other authority that can. “I am not aware of any sort of legal mechanisms that would allow a group outside of Congress to try to enforce completion of [the NCA], to live up to the standards of this,” Brazauskas says.

None of the members of the House or Senate science committees responded to repeated requests for comment about enforcing the mandate to do the assessment.

As for Koebele, she has hope that she can still work on the sixth NCA. “The email did say that there might be potential for us to re-engage,” she says. “So if there is a point where NCA6 is revived, and it maybe has a slightly different scope, I know that several of my chapter authors and I are anxious to stay engaged with the process.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/National-Climate-Assessment-scientists-fired---73650-1?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-07-18 13:01:14.526844

We did not include changes in the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which essentially preserved tax credits for carbon capture but made them more generous in the case of utilization.

Under the IRA, developers could claim the tax credits, known as 45Q, for projects that begin construction before January 1, 2033, for up to 12 years once placed in service. The 12-year period will end between the late 2030s through the mid-2040s. We project CO2 capture will decrease as the tax credits expire through 2050 across all AEO2025 cases.

How do CO2 capture rates look through 2050?

Projected peak CO2 capture amounts vary by AEO2025 case. In the Reference case, CO2 capture peaks at just under 71 million metric tons (MMmt) in 2039, or about 2% of overall energy emissions. Projected peak captured emissions are lowest in the Alternative Electricity case, at 56 MMmt in 2037, and highest in the High Oil Price case, at 122 MMmt in 2039.

Our Alternative Electricity case has less carbon capture activity because it does not model Clean Air Act 111 regulations implemented in 2024, which effectively require carbon capture for coal and natural gas power plants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed to repeal the rule.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook 2025

Note: ZTC= Zero-Carbon Technology Cost

Historically, most CO2 capture has occurred at ethanol and natural gas processing plants. We project CO2 capture at coal power plants, natural gas power plants, and hydrogen facilities to surpass these industries across many of the AEO2025 cases. In addition, we project that no bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is deployed in any of our cases, and CO2 capture at cement facilities remains small—between 1 MMmt and 2.5 MMmt in 2035.

How will CO2 be sequestered?

We modeled CO2 sequestered in saline storage—deep underground formations containing saltwater—and injected into oil fields to increase output, a process known as enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The 45Q tax credit under the IRA was $60 per metric ton of CO2 for EOR and $85 per metric ton for saline storage. The recently passed OBBBA increased the value of the credit for EOR to $85 per metric ton, but the new value is not included in our analysis.

In all our cases, we project captured CO2 sent to saline storage will increase through the mid- to late-2030s. In the Reference case, we project CO2 sequestered in saline storage will increase from essentially none in 2024 to 52 MMmt in 2040. Less CO2 is sequestered in saline formations after 2041 as the 45Q tax credits expire because we do not model other sources of revenue.

We project CO2 sequestered for EOR sites will increase in the Reference case from 12 MMmt of CO2 in 2024 to 26 MMmt of CO2 in 2044. The amount of CO2 sequestered at EOR sites through the projection period stays relatively steady because revenue from increased oil production supports the projects even after 45Q tax credits expire.

What portion of emissions is captured and sequestered?

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook 2025

CO2 capture remains small relative to overall energy emissions across AEO2025 cases. We project that for the electric power sector, gross emissions decline in all cases while CO2 capture increases. Peak CO2 capture in the electric power sector ranges from 2.8% to 15.6% of sector emissions, depending on the AEO2025 case. In the industrial sector, we project that gross CO2 emissions increase in most cases and captured CO2 emissions remain low. Peak CO2 capture ranges from 2.6% to 3.9% of industrial sector emissions in our projections.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/TIE07182025.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:56:11.625246

The EQ cars failed to find a wider audience and their designs were often criticized. Their production end coincides with the end of EV tax credits in America.

That's a wrap for Mercedes-Benz's EQ family of electric vehicles in America. At least, for now.

A Mercedes-Benz USA spokesperson confirmed to InsideEVs that the German automaker will temporarily pause production of all variants of its EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs in the U.S. and bound for the U.S. on Sept. 1. Dealers have been notified that order banks for the cars are now closed as well.

""Vehicles scheduled for production prior to Sept. 1 will continue to be produced,"" the spokesperson added. ""This announcement applies only [to] U.S. vehicle orders of these models. The news was first reported by CarBuzz.

The spokesperson declined to say how ""temporary"" this Sept. 1 production pause might be. That date coincides with the end of the EV tax credits in America, which will expire on Sept. 30 following the passage of President Donald Trump's budget bill.

The Mercedes-Benz EQS and EQE SUVs are both produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their sedan variants are built in Germany and exported to the U.S. None of them were eligible for the EV tax credit unless they were leased.

""As a company with global activities and more than 30 plants worldwide, including in Alabama and South Carolina, Mercedes-Benz maintains a local-for-local strategy,"" a spokesperson said. ""In doing so, we continuously optimize our production network and use its high flexibility to react quickly to market conditions.""

While Mercedes didn't elaborate on what those market conditions are, exactly, most analysts are predicting a decline in EV sales when the tax credits expire. And Mercedes' EQ models had been especially sluggish sellers since the beginning.

The cars were often criticized by reviewers as lacking the interior quality and refinement of Mercedes' gas-powered E-Class and S-Class, even though many of them offered exceptional range and efficiency. However, their biggest turnoff was their controversial designs; even Mercedes executives have admitted that the ultra-streamlined shapes of the cars didn't have the gravitas that their buyers wanted. Sales of the EQS sedan and EQS SUV were down 52% in the U.S. in 2024 versus the previous year.

This has led Mercedes to retrench somewhat, and rethink its EV strategy for the U.S. and beyond. Future electric models will follow the template of the new G-Class with EQ Technology: battery-powered versions of familiar Mercedes models and typically with hybrid variants as well. The German automaker just unveiled the new electric CLA-Class sedan and wagon, and will be debuting a new electric GLC SUV later this year or in early 2026.

The Commerce Department has now proposed steep tariffs on graphite—a critical material used in the anodes of lithium-ion batteries—imported from China.

While this move will eventually push automakers to diversify their supply chains, it could deliver a short-term blow to EV prices. After all, more than 90% of the world’s graphite is processed in China.

Welcome to the Friday edition of Critical Materials, your daily round up of news and events shaping the world of electric cars and technology.

Also on today’s deck: Mitsubishi is planning to launch new hybrids in the U.S. and Canada by the end of this year. Plus, the voice assistant in the new, electric Mercedes-Benz CLA will use AI from an American company. Let’s begin.

30%: Why Battery Prices Could Increase Even More

Photo by: Panasonic Energy

Lithium may be the “oil” of the 21st century, but critical materials like graphite, cobalt, nickel and manganese are the real workhorses. Without graphite, the lithium ions in a battery have nowhere to go. The graphite anode is where the charge gets deposited when you plug in your EV.

Yet as of 2023, the U.S. had no domestic mine production capacity for graphite, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Most of it came from China, with smaller amounts from Mexico, Canada and Madagascar.

Now, the Trump administration has proposed a 93.5% tariff on graphite imported from China—the latest escalation in a resource war that could have ripple effects across the EV industry. With the federal EV tax credits ending soon and fuel economy standards nullified, EV makers are dealing with multiple headwinds.

American companies are indeed trying to bring graphite production home. There are at least half a dozen companies exploring or developing local graphite production in Alabama, Alaska, Montana, and New York—they have received billions of dollars of federal support under the Inflation Reduction Act.

But China’s graphite industry is already mature. It was producing 1.2 million tons of graphite annually in 2023. Industry groups in the U.S. have long accused the country of “dumping” graphite into the U.S. at prices cheaper than their home markets.

“China can flood global markets with cheap, highly subsidized graphite and drive down prices, domestic graphite manufacturers have difficulty securing the investments necessary to bolster production capacity to the levels needed to meet domestic demand,” the North American Graphite Alliance, a group representing graphite producers, wrote in a letter to the Department of Treasury last year.

Other groups are also actively trying to block off Chinese graphite from entering the U.S. The American Active Anode Material Producers brought the petition to tariff Chinese-origin graphite. Automakers, including Tesla, have fought back.

Here’s more from The New York Times this morning.

Tesla said in a letter to administration officials in February that it had already agreed to buy graphite from U.S. suppliers, but “they have not yet shown the technical ability to produce commercial quantities” of battery-grade graphite “at the quality and purity required by Tesla and other battery cell manufacturers.”

This is, in many ways, inflicting self-harm. The original goal of Biden-era policies was to reduce America’s reliance on China for critical materials. Now, with that same goal in mind, the Trump administration is tightening those restrictions—but also dismantling the clean energy policies that made local supply chains possible in the first place.

60%: Mercedes-Benz CLA To Use U.S. Company’s AI Voice Assistant

Photo by: Andrei Nedelea

Automakers believe that their customers really want ChatGPT-like AI voice assistants in their cars for conversational commands. The new electric CLA, which InsideEVs recently drove and reviewed in Denmark, will use a voice assistant developed by American company Cerence AI.

The CLA will be the first Mercedes model to get it, followed by other electric and gas Mercedes vehicles.

Here’s more from Automotive News:

“We offer a conversational experience so that you can talk to the system in a natural and human-like way and it responds in a chatty way, so you feel like you are talking to a human,” said Nils Schanz, chief technology and product officer at Cerence. “The system is very capable of understanding you.”

The system, which is available in 25 languages, will launch in Europe with Mercedes before expanding globally.

I don’t use in-car voice commands all that often. Google Assistant handles my Spotify and navigation requests pretty well. But in today’s software-defined vehicles, where everything from climate control to seat adjustment has migrated to a touchscreen, a well-executed voice assistant could save a lot of taps and distractions.

90%: Mitsubishi Hybrids Are Coming To The U.S.

2025 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV

Mitsubishi wants to benefit from the surge of hybrid sales in North America. The automaker will change the Outlander from a gasoline-only SUV into a hybrid model year in 2026 onwards for the U.S. and Canada, Nikkei reported on Friday.

It already sells the Outlander plug-in hybrid in the U.S. In the first six months of 2025, it has sold over 3,000 units of the Outlander PHEV stateside, marking a 6% year-over-year growth. But the more conventional hybrids could be cheaper than the PHEV and drive more sales volumes.

The automaker also planning to launch an EV in the U.S. next summer—that’s expected to be the rebadged version of the Nissan Leaf that’s due to go on sale in the U.S. this fall.

100%: Do Cars Need AI Voice Assistants?

Back in the day, automakers designed the engine and powertrain first—then built the rest of the car around that hardware. It was a mechanical-first mindset. Now, that’s flipped to a software-first approach. Automakers figure out the vehicle’s brains first and then see how they can build an EV around it.

This computerization of EVs also unlocks many possibilities, like ChatGPT integration and over-the-air updates that can add extra horsepower or improve braking performance.

But do we really need AI voice assistants to roll down windows or answer random trivia while we’re driving? What’s that line between being functional and gimmicky?

“At a time of rapidly rising load growth, PJM’s multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment that may flow to other regions,” the governors said to PJM’s board in a letter released Thursday.

The letter from the governors comes about a year after total capacity costs in PJM’s last capacity auction jumped to $14.7 billion from $2.2 billion in the previous auction. The increase led to potential electric bill hikes in some states in the 10% to 20% range. Some states took steps to ease those bill increases. PJM is set to release the results of its most recent capacity auction on Tuesday.

Increasingly, states are considering leaving PJM, the governors said. The letter was signed by governors from Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.

“We are deeply concerned that PJM’s response has been typified by halting, inconsistent steps and rising internal conflicts within the stakeholder community that have recently culminated in the abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” the governors said.

Manu Asthana, PJM president and CEO, on April 14 said he plans to step down from his job at the end of this year. He joined PJM in January 2020. PJM is seeking a replacement.

Also, at a May 12 Members Committee meeting, two incumbent board nominees — Chairman Mark Takahashi and Terry Blackwell — failed to receive enough votes to be reelected to three-year terms, according to PJM. Blackwell joined the PJM board in 2015 and Takahashi joined a year later. PJM’s board has 10 members, including the grid operator’s CEO.

The two vacant board seats should be filled by candidates proposed by states instead of through “closed-door deliberations,” according to the nine governors.

“At a time when PJM faces difficult decisions that could substantially raise consumer bills, we strongly believe ongoing board-level representation of these perspectives is essential to preserving PJM’s legitimacy,” the governors said.

The governors plan to create a formal group to represent PJM governors to help the grid operator chart “a productive path forward on the issues facing our region.”

PJM board Chair David Mills on Friday invited the governors to share their views at a July 23 PJM Members Committee meeting. Some of the changes suggested by the governors would require changing PJM’s operating agreement, which would require approval by the Members Committee, Mills said in a letter.

Mills defended PJM from some of the governors’ charges about the state of the grid operator. “Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” Mills said.

Also, PJM has responded to state concerns by temporarily setting a cap and floor on capacity prices, requiring reliability must-run power plants to participate in capacity auctions and fast-tracking some interconnection reviews, according to Mills.

Senior state lawmakers from New Jersey said they “fully support” the governors’ effort. “We want representation from the states to ensure that the needs of ratepayers are a priority in the decision-making process,” Senate President Nicholas Scutari and General Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, both Democrats, said in a statement Friday.

In response to last year’s auction results, some state lawmakers are discussing leaving PJM or have moved to increase their state’s power supplies. The New Jersey General Assembly on June 30 passed a bill on a 60-18 vote that directs the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities to consider leaving PJM. A similar bill is pending in the New Jersey Senate.

Analysts with research firm ClearView Energy Partners said they doubted the BPU would support New Jersey establishing a single-state independent system operator or joining New York’s grid, according to a client note issued on Thursday. Policymakers in Maryland and Pennsylvania have also said they could be open to leaving PJM, the analysts noted.

“We think it is unlikely these state policymakers are keen to leave PJM, but recent criticism reflects the political risk that incumbent lawmakers face amid rising power prices as well as the actions they are willing to consider in response to ratepayer frustrations,” the analysts said.

Hope is to soft power what capital is to markets — it enables growth.","America’s global influence has never been solely about its military might or economic dominance. For decades, its soft power — the ability to shape opinions and inspire through culture, values and ideas — has underpinned its leadership on the world stage. Yet whispers of its decline have grown louder, with some arguing this pillar of American strength is fading.

The truth? U.S. soft power isn’t vanishing; it’s evolving. Once the purview of governments, corporations have emerged as its most active stewards. Over the past few decades, American companies have increasingly stepped in as ambassadors of culture, innovation and progress. Their brands, executives and cultural exports influence global discourse, open new markets and challenge the conventional boundaries between profit and purpose.

Today, in an era defined by geopolitical volatility, businesses, both independently and collaboratively, are reshaping soft power in striking ways. They are not just participating in the global conversation; they’re leading it, showing us that the future of influence looks less like diplomacy in a suit and more like a brand with a vision.

Traditional foreign policy paradigms — realism and liberalism — framed soft power as either a tool for advancing national interests without conflict or a framework for fostering global cooperation. Corporations, however, are now repurposing soft power as a strategic asset: to mitigate long-term risk, expand consumer bases and satisfy stakeholder expectations. In a way governments increasingly can’t, businesses can integrate short-term imperatives, like quarterly growth, with long-term investments into areas like resilience, longevity or upskilling, into a cohesive strategy that fuels the brand and its bottom line.

Technology giants like Microsoft, for example, have partnered with governments to bring digital literacy to underserved communities, while brands like Walmart are remaking the workforce across middle America as a core component of their identity — expanding their market appeal while pushing industry standards.

But for these examples to push beyond traditional corporate social responsibility and achieve real soft power, their ROI must include social and financial outcomes. Without both, these efforts risk creating the very structural barriers to influence they seek to dismantle. This very challenge underscores why soft power is no longer optional: in a world of low institutional trust and high market volatility, corporations must now earn influence through strategic positioning beyond business lines to drive the bottom line.

Soft power’s purpose remains the same — to wield influence that maximizes stability — but its center of gravity has moved. To effectively leverage this shift, businesses must focus on three key tenets: partnerships, perspective and presence.

Partnerships: The New Comparative Advantage

Just as England produced cloth for Portuguese wine, today’s multinationals thrive on strategic alliances, even with competitors. Examples like the Amazon-Ford-Rivian collaboration on electric vehicle technology or Ion’s consortium of Fortune 100s to drive local innovation in Houston, Texas, demonstrate how businesses can pool expertise to drive innovation and expand collective soft power.

These partnerships extend beyond operational efficiencies. They help shape industry norms, promote shared values and increase resilience in a fragmented global economy. They also mitigate risk — a core principle in behavioral economics — by creating interdependencies that stabilize otherwise volatile markets.

When businesses work together across borders and sectors, they not only secure their own futures but also position themselves as long-term contributors to global progress. These are not just transactional arrangements; they are soft power strategies.

Perspective: The Power of Story

America’s global image has long been shaped by its media, entertainment and pop culture industries. Today, corporations are beginning to recognize the power of their own narratives — not just to sell, but to lead. The distinction between brand and story is critical: a brand sells a product; a story builds a relationship.

There’s a reason executives like Steve Jobs become synonymous with the brands they lead. They deliver a “why” rooted in personal stories that resonate with stakeholders and forge a lasting bond. For the best storytellers, that bond is built on trust and hope — two things that cannot be manufactured or sold.

As trust in traditional institutions declines, companies have a unique opportunity to inspire it. Soft power doesn’t come from control, but from connection. Effective corporate storytelling must create accountability and elevate stakeholders as protagonists by communicating directly and with a vision for progress. Hope is to soft power what capital is to markets — it enables growth. By delivering it, companies expand their consumer base and increase the global influence they need to thrive.

Presence: Defining the Global Agenda

International forums like the United Nations’ General Assembly, the COP Summits and the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting were long considered the domain of government and multilateral institutions. Increasingly, however, business leaders are not just showing up at these and other gatherings — they are shaping the agenda.

Consider the Milken Institute’s Global Conference and the way it not only brings together global leaders, but the most influential business leaders. This convening has become a mainstay of the corporate agenda as their executives seek to turn influence into action — testing ideas, forging alliances and advancing policy positions that blend commercial objectives with societal growth and advancement priorities.

Still, this growing presence comes with responsibility and the stakes are high: reputational risks, policy backlash and stakeholder distrust can undermine even the most ambitious efforts. Yet the alignment of business goals with progress helps ensure that ambition is rewarded. This is why strategic investments in influence, trust and global engagement are no longer “nice-to-haves,” they are business imperatives.Collaboration, storytelling and presence do not replace governments, but these elements allow the private sector to compliment them with fresh tools for progress while at the same time boosting long-term revenue.

The harder it becomes to do business, lead or progress as a society, the more essential soft power becomes — not as a branding exercise, but as a strategy for shared prosperity.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24234741902328-1568x1045.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 15:48:29.579248

AUSTIN, Texas – Citing the latest Current Employment Statistics (CES) report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) highlighted new employment figures showing a decrease in upstream employment in Texas in the month of June following two months of consecutive job growth. According to TIPRO’s analysis, direct Texas upstream employment for June totaled 205,400, a decline of 2,700 industry positions from May employment numbers. This represented an increase of 200 jobs in oil and gas extraction and a decrease of 2,900 jobs in the services sector.

TIPRO says fluctuations in monthly employment are normal and subject to revisions with CES data, noting demand for talent in the Texas upstream sector remains high. TIPRO also points to recent policy developments that will support the continued expansion of domestic production and energy infrastructure in the coming years.

TIPRO’s new workforce data indicated strong job postings for the Texas oil and natural gas industry. According to the association, there were 8,457 active unique jobs postings for the Texas oil and natural gas industry last month, compared to 8,157 postings in May, and 3,533 new postings, compared to 3,050 in the previous month. In comparison, the state of Pennsylvania had 2,689 unique job postings in June, followed by California (2,555), New York (2,265) and Ohio (2,201). TIPRO reported a total of 51,661 unique job postings nationwide last month within the oil and natural gas sector, including 21,861 new postings.

Among the 19 specific industry sectors TIPRO uses to define the Texas oil and natural gas industry, Support Activities for Oil and Gas Operations led in the ranking for unique job listings in June with 2,120 postings, followed by Gasoline Stations with Convenience Stores (1,388), Petroleum Refineries (849), and Natural Gas Distribution (636). The leading four cities by total unique oil and natural gas job postings were Houston (2,141), Midland (574), Odessa (384) and Dallas (310), said TIPRO.

The top four companies ranked by unique job postings in June were Love’s (654), Energy Transfer (322), Halliburton (293) and ExxonMobil (289), according to the association. Of the top ten companies listed by unique job postings last month, five companies were in the services sector, two midstream companies, one in the gasoline stations with convenience stores category, one petroleum refinery company and one fully integrated oil and natural gas company. Top posted industry occupations for June included retail salespersons (348), maintenance and repair workers general (330) and heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers (278). The top posted job titles for June included maintenance technicians (125), retail cashiers (80) and field service technicians (69).

Top qualifications for unique job postings in June included valid driver’s license (1,678), commercial driver’s license (CDL) (224), and transportation worker identification credential (TWIC) (151). TIPRO reports that 36 percent of unique job postings had no education requirement listed, 35 percent required a bachelor’s degree and 30 percent required a high school diploma or GED. There were 1,753 advertised salary observations (21 percent of the 8,457 matching postings) with a median salary of $59,500. The highest percentage of advertised salaries (31 percent) were in the $90,000 to $500,000 range.

The top three posting sources in June ​included www.indeed.com (3,067), www.simplyhired.com (2,486) and www.dejobs.org (2,287).

TIPRO also calls attention to the strong tax contributions made by the state’s oil and gas industry that offer vital support of government coffers and provide important funding for public services and programs that include Texas’ public schools and universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. Texas energy producers in June paid $405 million in oil production taxes, according to the Texas comptroller’s office. Last month, producers also paid $214 million to the state in natural gas production taxes, up 25 percent from June 2024.

Additionally, TIPRO highlights recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude oil production in Texas continues to climb, rising 1.8 percent in April to 5.77 million barrels per day. Monthly production of natural gas also grew in Texas in the month of April by 1.2 percent to a record 37 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d). According to the EIA, the prior record for Texas was 36.56 bcf/d set in March. Although oil and gas output in Texas and nationwide has reached record highs this year, analysts from the EIA caution production growth could be slowing down, as energy producers ease drilling and completion activity as a result of market uncertainties and price volatility.

Finally, TIPRO emphasizes a major policy victory this month with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB). Key benefits include:

Streamlines permitting for federal energy projects.

Restores certainty to the LNG export approval process.

Mandates onshore and offshore oil and gas lease sales.

Allows commingling of onshore and offshore production on federal lands.

Delays the methane fee until 2035.

Protects industry tax treatment such as intangible drillings costs (IDCs), carried interest and percentage depletion.

“The OBBB marks a major win for domestic producers across the country and restores balance to national energy policy,” said Ed Longanecker, president of TIPRO. “By establishing a streamlined permitting process, rolling back costly regulations and providing certainty to federal leasing, this legislation ushers in a new era of American energy dominance, with Texas continuing to lead the way,” concluded Longanecker.",https://texasborderbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/June-decline.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:01:30.799220

Tax credits and government incentives in the U.S. and other countries further improve the economic case for advanced nuclear.","Manufacturing is the backbone of the American economy, driving innovation, creating jobs, and ensuring our national security. To make the products we use every day, industries such as chemicals, oil refining, steel, cement, and mining require immense amounts of continuous, high-temperature heat and steam to power operations and industrial equipment. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) like X-energy’s Xe-100, are able to provide this heat and steam in abundance, offering a reliable, clean energy solution that ensures industrial operations can run 24/7 without disruption.

Why Manufacturing Can Adopt New Energy Technologies

Production lines require constant, high-temperature heat and steam, and nuclear is the sole clean generation source capable of providing it at scale. X-energy’s Xe-100 High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) is designed to deliver 565°C steam for industrial applications, making it an ideal power source for heavy industry. The Xe-100 operates continuously, ensuring that manufacturers remain competitive, productive, and energy independent.

HTGRs and the Promise of X-energy’s Xe-100 for Manufacturing

Unlike conventional water-cooled nuclear reactors, HTGRs are designed to deliver high outlet temperatures, often above 500°C (in the case of X-energy’s Xe-100, up to 565°C steam). The Xe-100 reactor can produce up to 80 megawatts of electric power (MWe) and/or up to 200 megawatts of high-temperature thermal output (MWt), depending on the customer’s needs. This high-temperature output produces the steam required for industrial processes, offering a clean and reliable alternative to conventional generating sources.

Key features of the Xe-100 include:

Safety-First Design: It uses TRISO-X fuel, a proprietary version of tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) coated particles designed to withstand extreme temperatures.

Multi-unit Reliability: The Xe-100can rapidly ramp its power levels up or down, helping industries adapt to fluctuating demands or integrate with intermittent renewables.

Modular Scalability: Each reactor module can be built in a controlled factory setting and shipped to the deployment site, reducing construction time and assembly common to large-scale conventional reactors.

High-Temperature Heat for Industrial Processes

One of the most compelling advantages of HTGRs for heavy industry is their capacity to supply high-temperature steam and heat.. This continuous, carbon-free supply of thermal energy can be integrated into processes like:

Petroleum Refining & Petrochemicals: Refineries require large volumes of superheated steam for distillation and chemical reactions. HTGRs can provide combined heat and power with zero emissions.

Steelmaking: Traditionally reliant on coal or natural gas for heat and reducing agents, steel production can also utilize advanced nuclear for both heat and electrical generation..

Mining & Mineral Processing: Operations in remote areas often use diesel generators for heat and power. A compact SMR or microreactor could cut emissions and logistical challenges by running on long-lasting nuclear fuel rather than a constant diesel supply.

Seadrift: A Real-World Example of Industrial Applications

A prime example of advanced nuclear potential in heavy industry is unfolding through Dow’s Seadrift site in Texas. X-energy and Dow have partnered to deploy four Xe-100 SMRs at this large chemical manufacturing facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the first advanced nuclear deploymentat an industrial site in North America.

Paving the way to Progress: Dow and X-energy have collaborated closely since first announcing their partnership in 2021, and continue to make progress towards the deployment, recently submitting a Construction Permit Application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commssion..

Sustainable Industrial Growth: This project would demonstrate how advanced nuclear reactors can support major industrial operations without compromising output or reliability.

A Blueprint for Others: Manufacturers worldwide could replicate this model, reducing emissions with cutting-edge technology while accelerating global momentum for next-generation nuclear technologies.

For more on this milestone project, see “A Year of Progress at Seadrift” on X-energy’s blog.

Repurposing Coal Facilities to Keep U.S. Manufacturing Competitive

Another advantage of smaller, intrinsically safe reactors is the possibility of repurposing former coal plant sites. These sites already have grid connections, water permits, and an experienced energy workforce.

According to estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy, reusing coal infrastructure can save 15–35% in construction costs. This reduces costs for new nuclear facilities and supports communities by keeping or creating local jobs in advanced manufacturing and plant operations.

Modernizing Manufacturing Without Compromising Output

As heavy industry grapples with how to reduce emissions and maintain the continuous, high-quality heat and power essential for production, advanced nuclear power has emerged as an attractive solution.

High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) like the Xe-100 offer a safe, modular, and carbon-free energy source that can scale to meet large industrial loads. From supporting hydrogen production to repurposing retiring coal sites, advanced nuclear presents a unique opportunity to enhance and expand clean manufacturing for the future.

By integrating next-generation nuclear into their long-term manufacturing strategies, industry can balance the opportunity to reduce emissions with the practical requirements of maintaining continuous operations and product output. Advanced nuclear power isn’t just for electricity; it’s the high-temperature, 24/7 steam and power solution that heavy industry has been waiting for.

Important Questions

1. How do small modular reactors (SMRs) differ from traditional large reactors?

SMRs, like X-energy’s Xe-100, are smaller in size and output, typically between 50 and 300 MWe per module, allowing for modular construction and easier financing. They can be built in factories and shipped to sites in segments, helping reduce both costs and construction timelines.

2. Why is high-temperature heat so important for heavy industry?

Many industrial processes (e.g., chemical manufacturing, steelmaking, refining) need reliable steam supplies at very high temperatures. Traditionally, this heat comes from burning fossil fuels. Advanced nuclear reactors can deliver the same level of heat with zero emissions.

3. Is advanced nuclear power safe?

Yes. Advanced nuclear reactors incorporate numerous intrinsic safety features. X-energy’s Xe-100, for instance, uses TRISO-X fuel, which is designed not to melt even under extreme conditions. The physics-driven safety design ensures the reactor naturally slows down or shuts off if cooling is lost.

4. Can advanced nuclear reactors replace coal-fired plants?

Yes. One major advantage of smaller reactors is that they can often be sited at existing coal facilities, reusing infrastructure and saving 15–35% in construction costs (according to U.S. Department of Energy estimates). This helps local communities adopt clean energy technologies while preserving jobs.

5. How does nuclear power help with hydrogen production?

Hydrogen is already a major commodity in manufacturing, fertilizer production, chemical production, and oil refining, and it will play a major role in decarbonizing sectors such as transportation, manufacturing, and commercial shipping. Hydrogen is currently reliant on fossil fuels for production. Advanced reactors like the Xe-100 supply can provide the necessary energy to power electrolyzers and produce hydrogen without creating carbon emission.

6. Aren’t nuclear plants expensive?

While large, conventional nuclear plants have historically been capital-intensive, SMRs aim to reduce costs and construction timelines through modular designs and factory assembly. Tax credits and government incentives in the U.S. and other countries further improve the economic case for advanced nuclear.

7. Does advanced nuclear create a lot of waste?

All nuclear technology produces some level of spent fuel, but modern reactor designs like the Xe-100 are more fuel-efficient, generating less waste per unit of energy. The durable TRISO-X particles also simplify handling and reduce the possibility of radiation release.

If a public power authority is established in the Hudson Valley, the American Public Power Association, which advocates for more than 2,000 municipal utilities nationwide, suggests that it invest in distribution.","Could a utility owned by the public, rather than Central Hudson, deliver lower electricity costs?

Many people believe it would, and last year, two state legislators introduced a proposal to make it happen by creating the Hudson Valley Power Authority. The bill outlines the process by which the state would create a “democratically governed” nonprofit corporation that would provide “low rates, reliable service, correct and easy to understand bills, clean energy, community benefits and environmental justice.” The goal would be to keep residential electric bills from exceeding 6 percent of household income.

It would not be the first public utility, even in New York. Along with the state-owned New York Power Authority and the Long Island Power Authority, there are at least 50 municipal utilities in New York, mostly in rural areas. For the rest of the state, the delivery of electricity is monopolized by six investor-owned utilities such as Central Hudson, which has been owned since 2013 by Fortis, a Canadian holding company. In return for their monopolies, these utilities are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which must approve rate hikes and capital projects.

Establishing the Hudson Valley Power Authority would not only lower rates but coordinate with the state’s long-term climate goals while protecting Central Hudson’s 1,130 employees, according to the two Democratic legislators who introduced the proposal, Sen. Michelle Hinchey (whose district includes parts of Dutchess and Putnam counties) and Assembly Member Sarahana Shrestha (whose district includes the northwest corner of Dutchess). “I don’t think the role of government is to empower the private sector,” Shrestha said. “This would put public goods back in the hands of the public.”

How it could happen

Shrestha and Hinchey’s legislation calls for the Hudson Valley Power Authority to purchase Central Hudson and take control of a system with 315,000 electric customers and 90,000 natural gas customers in parts of nine counties, including Dutchess and Putnam. If Central Hudson refused to sell, the legislation suggests authorities could use a legal process called eminent domain to compel a sale.

Tom Konrad, a chartered financial analyst who is the chair of the Marbletown Environmental Conservation Commission, is leading a plan in the Ulster County town — the Hudson Valley’s first — to transition to 100 percent renewable energy. He estimates that it would cost between $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion to acquire Central Hudson, including its $1.4 billion in debt.

The Hudson Valley Power Authority (HVPA) would be overseen by a nine-member board appointed by the governor and the Legislature, which would also include the business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 320, the union representing about 700 Central Hudson employees.

In addition, an independent “observatory” modeled after the Paris Water Authority and composed of elected representatives and members of academic institutions would help the board with “community participation, transparency, research and accountability,” Shrestha said.

The newly formed utility would retain Central Hudson employees represented by labor unions and assume those agreements, including retirement benefits. After buying Central Hudson, the HVPA would be obligated to bargain “in good faith” with union representatives.

The bill also aligns the HVPA with the goals of the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, directing the utility to procure 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030 and 100 percent renewable electricity by 2040, provided the supply is available.

At least 35 percent of the benefits of clean energy and efficiency programs, such as reduced pollution through the phasing out of fossil fuel-burning plants, would be allocated to disadvantaged communities within the service area.

Shrestha doesn’t expect either Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins or Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie to call for a vote until the bill has sufficient momentum to pass, which she said could take two or three years.

Konrad believes the state would realize savings because, like a municipality, a state-owned utility does not pay federal taxes. Municipal bonds would also come at a lower interest rate — a combination he says could save up to 10 percent.

But the most significant savings — and a key selling point for the proposal — would be the elimination of what Shrestha calls Central Hudson’s “profit motive.” Utilities don’t make money on the electricity and gas they provide, but from the delivery rates. That money funds operations, capital projects and returns for shareholders. The Public Service Commission is weighing a request from Central Hudson to increase its delivery charges to provide a 9.5 percent investor return.

According to Joe Jenkins, Central Hudson’s director of media relations, about half of the utility’s capital expansion is covered by borrowed money (through bonds repaid by customers via delivery rates) and half by shareholders. For that reason, Konrad argues, customers are “renting the electric grid from Central Hudson. As renters, we pay Fortis for its cost of capital, plus profit on the amount of equity they put in, plus any maintenance. We have to pay for everything they pay for, plus a profit.”

Konrad estimates that eliminating the need to earn a profit for shareholders could save nearly $50 million annually. He points to data collected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2022, which showed that, on average, public power customers pay 6.3 percent less than customers of investor-owned utilities.

Opposition emerges

“Central Hudson is not for sale,” says Jenkins. If New York State attempts to acquire the company through eminent domain, he predicts “a pretty costly and drawn-out legal battle.”

The company’s objections to the proposal are many. For one, Jenkins said, the utility contributes $60 million in taxes annually to municipalities in its territory. “That’s money that goes to fire departments, school districts, police departments,” he said, cautioning that, for those municipalities, a state takeover would “throw budgeting into chaos.”

Central Hudson also fears a public utility would eliminate hundreds of jobs in the natural gas sector. Jenkins noted that the bill refers to the Hudson Valley Power Authority making an agreement with a union that represents “transitioning employees from non-renewable generation facilities” before the authority completes a renewable-energy project. “We take that to mean natural gas” employees, said Jenkins.

Hochul Proposes Public Nuclear Plant

By Brian PJ Cronin

Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul visited the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant to announce plans for a nuclear power plant built by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to produce at least 1 gigawatt of energy, enough to power about 1 million homes.

“To power New York’s future, we need three things: reliability, affordability and sustainability,” she said. “Nuclear drives all three.”

“There’s strong support among both Democrats and Republicans for nuclear at the federal level,” said Keith Schue of the policy group Nuclear New York. “You can’t really say that about anything else.”

New York has been deactivating power plants faster than it has been connecting new ones. Indian Point near Peekskill was shut down in 2021; the company that ran it said it couldn’t compete with cheap fracked natural gas flowing in from Pennsylvania. While the state acknowledged that the closure would mean an increased reliance on fossil fuels, it expected that reliance to be temporary as hundreds of renewable energy projects awaited approval.

But the reliance on oil and gas has continued. The pace of adding renewable sources was slowed by supply chain issues, inflation, global interest rates and tariffs from President Donald Trump’s first term. Subsidies and policies for renewable energy equipment in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act were eliminated by Trump in a budget bill enacted on July 4.

The fossil fuel industry isn’t immune to the same concerns; there’s a five-year wait for natural-gas turbines. However, with high-tech manufacturing plants and data centers emerging upstate — industries that require a substantial amount of power — and renewable energy sources being curtailed, nuclear power may need to play a larger role.

“Upstate New York gets 90 percent of its electricity from clean sources because of what’s going on here [hydro] and nuclear facilities,” said Hochul. “But we need to scale it up fast.”

Fast is not a word associated with the nuclear industry. The country has completed two plants in 30 years: Watts Bar in Tennessee, which began construction in 1973 and became operational in 1996, and Plant Vogtle in Georgia, which broke ground in 1976 and started producing energy in 1987. (Its fourth and final reactor went online in 2024.) Both projects went considerably over budget.

There may be a role for nuclear power in New York, said Alexander Patterson of the advocacy group Public Power NY. But renewable energy is cheaper and quicker to build. In 2023, Hochul enacted the Build Public Renewables Act, which gave the NYPA the authority to bring clean energy online quickly.

Hochul has found an unlikely ally in President Trump. In May, he signed executive orders designed to quadruple the nuclear power generated by 2050 by rolling back federal safety and security regulations and increasing the allowable amount of radiation exposure. This week, Politico reported that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been instructed to “rubber-stamp” any projects the Trump administration submits.

Jerry Nappi, the director of public affairs for Central Hudson, says the HVPA narrative suggests that “if the government just had control of Central Hudson, we could do X, Y and Z. But that ignores the fact that we are regulated very heavily by New York State.”

Nappi disputes Shrestha’s statement that a “perverse incentive” for profit is the company’s primary motivator, and Jenkins says Central Hudson recognizes “the growing concern about the affordability of energy.”

“We’re committed to doing everything in our power to keep our bills as manageable for our customers as we can,” said Jenkins. Instead of a takeover, collaborative dialogue with elected officials in the region “is a very important part of reaching long-term, permanent solutions to keep energy bills low,” he said. “It takes a village to keep energy costs low.”

In April, more than two dozen labor and business organizations, including the Orange, Ulster and Dutchess County chambers of commerce, signed a letter opposing a Hudson Valley Power Authority. The legislation, the groups said, “poses significant risks to our local economy and workforce, harms customers and communities, hinders the transition to cleaner energy and threatens the overall reliability and affordability of energy” in the Central Hudson service territory.

While HVPA advocates accuse Central Hudson of profiting from capital expansion, the labor and business groups say public power authorities lack oversight and “are not incentivized to make needed investments, potentially leading to a diminishment of reliability.”

The groups cite a 2024 report from the American Public Power Association, which they say demonstrates that electric rates in New York are nearly 10 percent higher for residential customers of government-run utilities.

In Putnam, County Executive Kevin Byrne, a Republican, said he “firmly opposes” the HVPA. While its goals of cleaner energy and local control sound appealing, the financial model “relies on high upfront capital costs and long-term debt, which places significant financial risk on taxpayers,” he said. “The idea that this will result in lower rates is speculative at best.”

Steve Carroll, the president of IBEW 320, the electrical workers’ union, says that by focusing their public-information campaign on customers’ unhappiness with Central Hudson’s widespread billing issues, Hinchey and Shrestha have tried to oversimplify the issue. He, too, believes that municipalities would suffer a loss of tax revenue, while the cost of transitioning to renewable energy sources will make it impossible to lower rates.

Carroll likens the impact of the state’s climate goals, which call for the expansion of the electric grid and the elimination of energy derived from fossil fuels, on Central Hudson’s rates to a deli that must charge more for an egg sandwich because the cost of eggs went up. “You wouldn’t blame the deli,” he said.

If New York State’s goal is affordable energy, it should invest in generation, he said, while being “thoughtful” about climate goals and their effect on rates. “The best way to fix that is to produce your own energy, so you control the cost,” Carroll said. “I’m not saying that something doesn’t need to change, but the HVPA isn’t the change that needs to happen. This is a small move, but it has tentacles that will affect a lot of things.”

Grassroots support

Talk to advocates for the Hudson Valley Power Authority and you’ll hear almost the exact opposite.

The bill states that the HVPA will make payments in lieu of taxes to municipalities and school districts to compensate for the amount that Central Hudson pays. “When Central Hudson talks about local taxes, they are ignoring the fact that the HVPA will still be paying this money to local authorities,” Konrad said. “They are trying to scare you.”

Joe O’Brien-Applegate, a Beacon resident who is leading Beacon Climate Action Now’s advocacy for the public authority, says the discussions he’s had at events such as the city’s Earth Day celebration or the Taproots Festival in the fall have been “the easiest political outreach I’ve ever done.”

Beacon Climate Action Now is part of the Hudson Valley for Public Power coalition. O’Brien-Applegate believes residents of the region are not only deeply dissatisfied with Central Hudson, but that there’s growing enthusiasm for a cleaner, more affordable approach to energy.

“Better alternatives to the status quo are out there,” he said. “Things don’t have to be predatory, win-or-lose, zero-sum situations. You can restructure large institutions that put the needs of the people they serve first.”

The Overlooked Renewable

By Michael Turton

Wind and solar receive considerable attention, but another renewable energy source is often overlooked: hydroelectric power. It made its debut in England in 1878, lighting a single lamp, but within 20 years, the world’s largest hydroelectric plant was operating at Niagara Falls.

With more than 300 plants, New York is the largest producer of hydroelectric power east of the Mississippi River and the third-largest nationally, behind Washington and California. The Robert Moses Power Plant, located just downstream from Niagara Falls in Lewiston, features 13 turbines that produce up to 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity, enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Most of New York’s hydro plants are in the northern part of the state, but smaller installations are found in the south, as well. Central Hudson operates three hydroelectric plants in Ulster County. While not Niagara Falls, the Sturgeon Pool, Dashville and High Falls plants collectively produce 23 megawatts, or 80,000 megawatt-hours of electricity, enough to serve 10,000 homes.

Other hydroelectric plants in the Mid-Hudson Valley include facilities in Beacon and Wappingers Falls in Dutchess County; Walden, Highland Falls and Salisbury Mills in Orange County; and Wallkill in Ulster County.

The New York Independent System Operator, which manages the grid, reported that in 2024, gas and oil-fueled plants produced 41 percent of New York’s electricity while hydroelectric and nuclear plants contributed 21 percent each. Hydro produced 27,936 gigawatt-hours and nuclear 27,073. Wind produced five percent of the state’s electricity, and solar less than 1 percent.

Ulster County Executive Jen Metzger, a Democrat, is on board; last year, she said: “If there was ever a time to consider an alternative to the current model of utility service, it is now.” The Kingston Common Council and the Village of New Paltz Board of Trustees this year adopted resolutions in support of the HVPA. Beacon Climate Action Now says it’s had conversations with the city’s Conservation Advisory Committee about municipal support here.

On Thursday (July 17), Shrestha announced six town halls to be held in Dutchess and Ulster in August to discuss the proposal.

If a public power authority is established in the Hudson Valley, the American Public Power Association, which advocates for more than 2,000 municipal utilities nationwide, suggests that it invest in distribution. Most public utilities purchase power from an outside source, but reliable delivery should be the utility’s only priority, says Ursula Schryver, a senior vice president. That means ensuring that wires, poles and other infrastructure are maintained and upgraded.

The utility should also invest in the community, she said, which could mean providing free electricity to municipal buildings, offering staff for safety workshops, or sharing services such as information technology or billing with other municipal utilities.

In the for-profit model, some of a utility’s revenue is “being pulled away by shareholders,” Schryver said. “All of it is not going back to the community.”

Next steps

If the Legislature approves the measure in two or three years, as Shrestha predicts, whoever is in the governor’s office will need to be amenable to the plan. (The next election for governor is in 2026.) Advocates recognize the need for an independent study to determine the extent to which the proposal would reduce customers’ bills.

Dutchess County Executive Sue Serino, a Republican, noted this week that the state has the power to hold utility companies accountable through the Public Service Commission, “yet we continue to see rate hikes approved time and time again. We need stronger oversight and real accountability now, and any new proposal should come with clear, concrete guarantees that it will truly deliver the savings and reliability people deserve.”

If the legislation to create a Hudson Valley Power Authority is enacted, Shrestha expects Central Hudson will go to court. “We will win,” she said. “It will just be a matter of time.”

The conservative majority used its power in the Senate to pass what supporters call an environmental “streamlining.” In practical terms, it nullifies much of the environmental legislation built over decades in Brazil.

This also represents a major defeat for President Lula da Silva’s government, which has made environmental defense a cornerstone of its domestic policy.

For environmentalists and scientists, this new law marks the most serious setback for environmental policy in Brazil since the dictatorship era. Environment Minister Marina Silva called the day “a day of mourning” for the country.

Brazil dismantles environmental legislation ahead of COP30

Brazil is one of the world’s most biodiverse countries. The vast majority of the Amazon rainforest is located within its borders. For years, Brazil built ambitious environmental protection legislation, with the exception of the Jair Bolsonaro administration (2019-2023).

The Congressional vote began near midnight, with many members participating remotely, and concluded at 3:30 AM Brazilian time. After rejecting amendments from progressive parties and a failed attempt to suspend the vote, the conservative majority achieved its goal and passed the law.

One of the main backers of the bill is the agricultural sector, which holds significant influence in Congress and believes the measure will help “unblock” Brazil and “modernize” the country’s infrastructure.

Known by its critics as the “Devastation Bill,” it ultimately received 267 votes in favor versus 116 against, securing controversial approval at a critical moment: just three months before the global COP30 climate summit in the city of Belem. The vote is a major defeat for the Lula government, which has made environmental defense a pillar of its policy.

The new law’s impact on Brazil

The legislation, which proponents have tried to advance for 20 years, aims to relax environmental regulations, particularly regarding environmental impact assessments and permits required before starting projects.

For example, the new law allows the authorization of projects with high pollution potential or environmental harm if the government classifies them as “strategic.” It also creates, in some cases, a “self-certification” process where the business owner grants themselves the permit by filling out an online form, bypassing external evaluation bodies.

Furthermore, environmental permits will no longer be required to expand roads, conduct various agricultural and livestock activities, or build dams to supply small municipalities or cattle ranches.

Federal oversight bodies for high-risk mining projects, for instance, lose authority, while states and municipalities (seen as more vulnerable to local corruption) gain power.

The law even relaxes rules for cutting native vegetation in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil’s most threatened rainforest, of which only a quarter of its original area remains.

Supporters of the law argue it provides “guarantees for entrepreneurs” by eliminating “bureaucracy and ideological and subjective issues,” as stated by Ze Victor, a member of the Liberal Party led by far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Criticism from Brazil’s government and progressive parties

Beyond the Environment Minister’s forceful statement characterizing the law’s approval, criticism from progressive parties shows the strong impact this legislation is causing in the country.

“Are we going to vote on this at the last gasp, with virtual voting and an empty chamber? What a disgrace!” exclaimed Congresswoman Duda Salabert of the Democratic Labor Party, referring to the pre-dawn remote voting conditions under which yesterday’s vote occurred.

“I will take legal action against the Devastation Bill! The text approved by Congress contains several unconstitutional provisions. This bill attacks not only environmental permits, not only traditional and Indigenous communities—it also attacks the Brazilian Constitution,” the progressive congresswoman wrote on her X social media account.

Socialism and Liberty Party member Célia Xakriabá, the first Indigenous federal congresswoman from the state of Minas Gerais and who had a major clash with conservative lawmakers, warned that “money isn’t going to replace the forests” and called Parliament “sexist, racist, and colonial.”

The day before, Xakriabá warned on her social media channel X that “while Brazil sleeps, they want to vote today on the Devastation Law. Another attempt to sneak it through. We can’t allow it; the Devastation Law will be the biggest climate setback in the last 40 years.”",https://colombiaone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amazon-Brazil-credit-CIAT-Amazon17-cc-sa-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 12:04:35.526121

In Missouri, a new law could make it easier to build nuclear plants.
That’s partly because nuclear plants are notoriously expensive to build.","Hundreds of people gathered in Columbia on Thursday to discuss nuclear energy expansion in Missouri.

The Missouri Nuclear Summit convened lawmakers, business leaders and state and federal energy officials for discussions on how nuclear power plants could meet projected demand for energy.

“It's a priority of mine to make sure Missouri has ample power for the future, and we know nuclear technology can be a critical piece in meeting that goal,” said Gov. Mike Kehoe.

In the past few decades, utilities haven’t built many nuclear power plants in Missouri or the rest of the country. That’s mostly because of their high cost and concerns about the lack of a federal plan to store spent fuel.

But at the summit, panels focused on demand from energy-thirsty sectors like artificial intelligence and on Missouri’s need to compete with other states to attract businesses. The National Governors Association, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy held the summit.

“Nuclear is really what comes to the forefront in terms of dispatchable power that doesn't have an associated carbon emission,” said Kurt Schaefer, director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. “And it really hasn't been in the discussion for a while, and so we were very glad to do that.”

Ameren President Mark Birk said the company plans to rely more heavily on nuclear in the future because as Ameren increasingly uses wind and solar power, it will need an energy source that can be quickly turned on when there isn’t enough sun or breeze.

“When you look toward the future, and you look toward carbon-free energy, and more importantly, dispatchable energy, to help integrate the renewables, nuclear has got to be a key, key part of that,” Birk said.

Ameren’s Callaway reactor is Missouri’s only nuclear power plant, generating 14% of the state’s electricity. By 2045, the company expects nuclear energy to make up the largest share of its generation, about 40%.

There is also a federal push to build more nuclear energy. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that calls for 10 new nuclear reactors to be under construction by 2030. The Biden administration also implemented pro-nuclear policies.

In Missouri, a new law could make it easier to build nuclear plants. The law, known as SB4, allows electric companies to charge its customers for power plants as they are being built, known as construction work in progress. Birk said that will ultimately mean the plants cost less.

“Without construction work in process, you're putting it on a credit card, and you're paying at the end of the period when it gets operational,” Birk said. “If you do have construction work in process, while customers pay as we go, their overall cost to build the plant is going to be lower.”

But consumer advocates fought the law, saying construction work in progress for nuclear plants could cause household bills to go up by as much as $1,000 a year on average over the next 10 years. That’s partly because nuclear plants are notoriously expensive to build.

After decades without constructing new nuclear plants in the U.S., two new projects recently went up in Georgia, but they took significantly longer and cost much more to build than was originally planned. A representative from the company that built the plants spoke at the Missouri summit and said she hopes to share the lessons learned from that “very storied adventure.”

“We were the ones that carried the banner and got beat up all over the place for being over budget and delayed with the AP 1000, but somebody had to do it,” said Lizzy Yates, director of communication for Southern Nuclear. “Somebody has to go first.”

Yates and others said to bring costs down, the U.S. has to get back in the habit of building nuclear plants. Abroad, as countries build more, the cost and timeline to do so go down significantly. Many of the summit’s speakers hope the same could soon happen in Missouri.

Cameron LNG marks 1,000th cargo milestone

Cameron LNG

Cameron LNG announced the successful export of its 1,000th cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on July 17, 2025, from its facility near Hackberry, Louisiana, along the Calcasieu Ship Channel, marking a significant milestone just six years after its first commissioning cargo on May 31, 2019. The 1,000th cargo was loaded onto the Maran Gas Kimolos, highlighting the skill, determination, and commitment of the Cameron LNG team, as stated by President Art Klein, who emphasized the company’s core values of safety and results-based success. Martin Hupka, president of LNG at Sempra Infrastructure and chairman of the Cameron LNG Board, congratulated the team for achieving this milestone in such a short timeframe, reflecting their expertise and dedication. Cameron LNG is jointly owned by affiliates of Sempra Infrastructure, TotalEnergies, Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and Japan LNG Investment LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK). [MDN: Some of the molecules that Cameron liquefies come from the Marcellus/Utica. So, we celebrate this milestone!]

USA crude oil stocks drop week on week

Rigzone/Andreas Exarheas

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 3.9 million barrel decrease in U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) from July 4 to July 11, 2025, dropping from 426.0 million to 422.2 million barrels, which is about eight percent below the five-year average. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve slightly decreased from 403.0 million to 402.7 million barrels. Total petroleum stocks, including crude oil and various fuels, rose by 9.0 million barrels week-on-week to 1.658 billion barrels but were down 11.2 million barrels year-on-year. Motor gasoline inventories increased by 3.4 million barrels, distillate fuel by 4.2 million barrels, and propane/propylene by 4.5 million barrels, though distillate stocks remain 21 percent below the five-year average. Refinery inputs dropped to 16.8 million barrels per day, operating at 93.9 percent capacity, with gasoline and distillate production also declining. Crude oil imports rose, while total products supplied over four weeks fell 1.1 percent year-on-year. [MDN: The news of a 3.9 million barrel drop in U.S. crude oil inventories is significant for energy markets due to its potential to influence oil prices, reflect economic activity, and inform policy and investment decisions. It’s particularly relevant for traders, analysts, and policymakers monitoring supply tightness and global energy dynamics.]

EPA announces next phase of organizational improvements

Environmental Protection Agency

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under Administrator Lee Zeldin, announced a new phase of organizational improvements on July 17, 2025, to enhance its ability to fulfill statutory obligations and deliver clean air, water, and land while modernizing mission support. The restructuring affects the Office of Mission Support, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and Office of Land and Emergency Management. These changes aim to improve efficiency in managing facilities, acquisitions, grants, human capital, IT, and information management, while enhancing communication with Congress and other oversight bodies. The Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance will realign to address pollution effectively, ensuring compliance and economic prosperity. The Office of Land and Emergency Management will be better equipped to prevent contamination, clean up land, and respond to emergencies, reinforcing EPA’s commitment to fiscal responsibility and community outcomes.

The Big Beautiful Bill is a big win for American energy

Institute for Energy Research/Thomas J. Pyle

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) marks a significant shift in U.S. energy policy by setting a 2027 deadline for wind and solar projects to qualify for production and investment tax credits, acknowledging that these intermittent energy sources cannot meet the growing demands of AI and electrification without distorting markets and raising costs. Despite a last-minute Senate loophole allowing projects with 5% funding committed within 12 months a four-year safe harbor, the bill curbs the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) costly subsidies, which failed to lower electricity prices as promised, with retail prices rising faster than inflation since 2022. The OBBBA also eliminates the $7,500 new and $4,000 used electric vehicle tax credits, repeals the IRA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and removes barriers to natural gas, oil, and coal production, promoting reliable energy and reducing grid strain. This legislation, championed by congressional Republicans, aims to restore market competition, lower energy costs, and enhance national security. [MDN: The OBBBA wasn’t perfect by a long shot, but it’s far superior to what we’ve had, and it takes many of the teeth out of Biden’s IRA Green New Deal.]

Chevron moves forward with megadeal for Hess after winning Exxon arbitration

Wall Street Journal

An arbitration panel from the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris has cleared Chevron to proceed with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, rejecting Exxon Mobil’s claim to a right-of-first-refusal on Hess’s 30% stake in Guyana’s lucrative Stabroek offshore oil block. The ruling resolves a heated dispute between Chevron and Exxon, two major oil companies descended from Standard Oil, over one of the world’s most valuable oil projects, which Exxon operates with a 45% stake alongside China’s Cnooc (25%). The decision allows Chevron to move quickly to finalize the deal, initially struck in October 2023, boosting Hess shares by 8% and Chevron’s by 4% in premarket trading. Exxon, despite disagreeing with the ruling, respects the arbitration outcome and expects to maintain its operations in Guyana, which aim to produce 1.2 million barrels daily by 2027. The acquisition strengthens Chevron’s portfolio, critical for future production growth, while Exxon continues its strong financial performance. [MDN: The last vestiges of Hess will now be gone. It sold off its retail gas station subsidiary years ago, and now, the oil drilling company (with major assets in the Bakken shale play) will be absorbed into Chevron.]

BP sells US onshore wind assets to LS Power

Rigzone/Jov Onsat

BP PLC has agreed to sell its U.S. onshore wind business, BP Wind Energy North America Inc., to LS Power Development LLC, aligning with its goal of achieving $3-4 billion in asset sales in 2025 as part of a broader $20 billion divestment target by 2027. The transaction includes 10 grid-connected wind projects with a net capacity of 1.3 gigawatts, comprising five wholly owned projects in Kansas, Indiana, and South Dakota, and five 50%-owned projects in Hawaii, Colorado, Indiana, Idaho, and Pennsylvania. These projects, capable of generating up to 1.7 gigawatts gross, will be managed under LS Power’s Clearlight Energy, expanding its renewable portfolio to 4.3 gigawatts. The deal, expected to close by year-end pending regulatory approvals, includes the transfer of employees to LS Power, though the price was not disclosed. This move supports BP’s strategy to rationalize its low-carbon portfolio while LS Power aims to enhance U.S. energy infrastructure. [MDN: Can Euro weenies actually learn? It would seem so! BP is smart to dump loser wind power assets. LS Power is not so smart for buying it.]

New budget law boosts carbon sequestration, enhanced oil recovery

RBN Energy/Jason Lindquist

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025, by President Trump, significantly alters clean-energy tax credits, scaling back many while bolstering the carbon-capture industry through enhancements to the 45Q tax credit. The legislation equalizes credit rates for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and carbon capture, use, and sequestration (CCUS), including enhanced oil recovery (EOR), at $17 per metric ton ($36 for direct air capture), with a fivefold increase to $85 ($180 for DAC) if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. This parity aims to spur carbon-capture projects, particularly in the Permian Basin, where over 5,000 miles of CO2 pipelines support EOR, benefiting crude oil and blue hydrogen production. Despite criticism for potentially undermining decarbonization by boosting oil production, the changes are expected to drive investment in carbon-capture infrastructure, leveraging existing pipeline networks owned by companies like ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, and Kinder Morgan. [MDN: Contrary to the media narrative, OBBBA didn’t kill carbon capture sentence us all to a dying/frying planet. We wish OBBBA had killed carbon capture, quite frankly.]

Meta (Facebook) going all in on data centers

RBN Energy

Meta is aggressively expanding its AI compute infrastructure, planning massive data centers like the 1-GW Prometheus facility in Ohio, set for 2026, and the potential 5-GW Hyperion project in Louisiana, dwarfing typical nuclear reactors. These “titan clusters” are driving unprecedented power demands, with natural gas emerging as a key energy source due to its reliability and cost-effectiveness. Meta is backing Prometheus with two 200-MW gas plants and Hyperion with 1.5 GW of new gas generation, despite also procuring solar power to meet clean energy goals. Renewables alone can’t match AI’s surging energy needs, positioning gas as a critical bridge. A single 1,000-MW data center could consume 157 MMcf/d of gas, and with data center growth potentially adding 3–6 Bcf/d to U.S. gas demand by 2030, gas producers and power developers face a significant opportunity to fuel the AI boom if they can scale rapidly. [MDN: Data centers are a big deal for M-U molecules.]

The solution to America’s energy security lives in Canada

RealClearEnergy/Michael Yurkovich

President Trump has a critical opportunity to bolster America’s economic and national security by forging a Strategic Minerals Alliance with Canada, a resource-rich ally with vast reserves of lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements essential for technologies like F-35 jets and electric vehicle batteries. With China controlling 90% of global rare earth processing and weaponizing these resources, and global supply chains exposed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reliance on hostile nations threatens U.S. independence. Canada’s new Prime Minister Mark Carney, aligning with Trump’s dealmaking approach, offers a pragmatic partnership for mutual benefit: guaranteed U.S. access to Canadian minerals in exchange for infrastructure investment and long-term purchase agreements. This alliance could extend to energy, defense manufacturing, and technology, reducing dependence on China and unstable suppliers while creating jobs and strengthening North American industrial resilience. Trump’s leadership could secure this historic partnership, countering Beijing’s leverage and ensuring America’s economic future. [MDN: We are all for better deals with Canada, but we think it’s a mistake to look to Canada for critical minerals needed for our own energy security. Canada is not reliable and can turn on us, as we’ve seen.]

INTERNATIONAL

Oil rises on tight supply signals

Bloomberg

Oil prices rose as West Texas Intermediate crude increased 1.7% to settle above $67 a barrel, ending a three-day decline, driven by signs of tighter near-term supplies and stronger US demand signals. Positive US economic data boosted equity markets, a bullish sign for commodities, alleviating concerns about weakening oil demand. US crude inventories dropped last week, and Iraq faced a production loss of about 200,000 barrels per day due to drone attacks in Kurdistan. Chevron reported nearing a production plateau in the largest US oil field. Despite global inventory buildups, US stocks remain low, shifting market focus to supply risks, according to Goldman Sachs’ Daan Struyven. However, Iraq’s approval to resume Kurdish oil exports of at least 230,000 barrels daily limited the rally. The market’s backwardation structure, with premiums for near-term delivery, and low US distillate stockpiles since 1996 further underscored supply concerns. [MDN: Bloomberg always uses headlines that make you think something dramatic has happened, when, in fact, there are ever-so-slight movements in the price up or down. In this case, WTI for August delivery gained 1.7% to settle at $67.54 a barrel in New York. Brent for September settlement climbed 1.5% to $69.52 a barrel. Still in the perfect $60s.]

Will all oil and gas companies have to adopt GenAI?

Rigzone/Andreas Exarheas

Toni Fadnes, Chief Transformation Officer of Pions (formerly eDrilling), told Rigzone that oil and gas companies in competitive environments will need to adopt generative AI (GenAI) to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, though national oil companies with government backing may face less pressure to do so. He predicted this adoption will occur sooner than expected due to the rapid pace of the AI revolution, noting that AI can already save 40-70 percent of a drilling engineer’s time. Pions, a Norway-based company, is advancing AI-powered solutions, including Ida, an AI drilling engineer, Nora, a well design engineer, and Marie, a data management engineer. Recently, Pions announced an upgraded Ida with enhanced reasoning and task management capabilities and began external testing of its AI-powered Engineering SME. Aker BP, a major European independent oil company, has joined Pions’ AI initiatives, reflecting growing industry interest in AI solutions. [MDN: We say AI is taking the world by storm, including the O&G industry. It’s here to stay, and it’s growing rapidly. It “feels” to us like AI is as big a deal as was the internet when it came around.]

Carbon dioxide emissions worldwide rose in 2024

Institute for Energy Research

In 2024, global carbon dioxide emissions rose by 1.1%, driven primarily by a 1.8% increase in the Asia-Pacific region, despite reductions of 0.6% in North America and 1.0% in Europe, according to the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review of World Energy. The Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 65% of the global energy demand increase, saw significant coal production growth in India (7%) and Indonesia (8%), while China’s emissions rose by 1.2% and India’s by 4.1%, representing 31.5% and 8.3% of global emissions, respectively. U.S. emissions fell by 0.8%, comprising 13.0% of the world’s total. Global energy demand grew by 2%, with electricity demand rising faster at 4%, fueled by increased electrification and AI. Fossil fuels maintained an 86.6% share of the energy mix, unchanged from 2023, as renewable energy growth failed to displace them, highlighting inefficiencies in solar and wind power compared to fossil and nuclear energy. [MDN: CO2 emissions are not the horror painted by the left. Even if (somehow) it is a problem (it’s not), for every percentage point we lower CO2 emissions here at home, it goes up in Asia in India and China. You think you can make those countries lower their emissions? Think again. We are self-limiting ourselves with CO2 nonsense while the Indians and Chinese are laughing at us. Wake up!]

Canadian OFS group says relief from counter-tariffs on U.S. sand ‘fantastic news’

The Canadian Press/Lauren Krugel

Canadian oil and gas drillers have been granted relief from counter-tariffs on silica and quartz sand imported from the U.S., a critical component used in hydraulic fracturing to extract resources from shale formations. The exemption, announced in the Canada Gazette, applies to sand imported before October 16 and alleviates an estimated $275 million in annual costs for the industry, which relies heavily on about six million tonnes of sand from Wisconsin due to specific quality requirements. Enserva, an oilfield services group, welcomed the decision, noting the industry’s tight budgets and inability to quickly shift to Canadian sand sources due to regulatory hurdles. The government’s decision followed nearly 7,000 public submissions, with some stakeholders highlighting challenges in sourcing alternatives due to certification, specifications, or supply constraints. The remission is part of broader tariff exemptions for goods critical to Canadian industries, including manufacturing and public health, to mitigate economic harm. [MDN: Yet more evidence that Trump’s tariff “war” is working. We are forcing Canada, who has screwed us for YEARS, to back down and allow our goods and services in with low or no tariffs.]",,N,,2025-07-18 13:02:33.460436

When decision-makers plan fleet enhancements, many focus on emissions-cutting technologies. These near-zero-emission vehicles have integrated components that reduce their polluting effects. For example, selective catalytic reduction systems are active technologies that use catalysts and particulate filters to convert nitrogen oxides into nitrogen, water and tiny amounts of carbon dioxide.

A July 2023 analysis highlighted diesel’s dominance in heavy-duty trucks but revealed strategic enhancements will elevate sustainability. It found that approximately 99.91% of the United States’ trucking fleet has internal combustion engines. Additionally, 57% run on near-zero-emission technologies.

The study found 1,100 internal combustion engine trucks for every electrically powered one. The wide availability of electric trucks theoretically makes adoption easier, but fleet managers must consider several factors, including charging station locations and government grant eligibility. These potential challenges can make diesel upgrades more feasible than switching to electric models.

Many fleet managers use built-in sensors to detect abnormalities in their trucks. They alert technicians and mechanics to emissions-elevating problems, revealing which aging vehicles to replace first to optimize sustainability.

The role of a diesel mechanic is evolving slightly with the influx of technological improvements. These mechanics should learn about the technologies’ impacts and remain adaptable as the landscape changes. Currently, these professionals earn average starting salaries of over $24 per hour. The future could welcome more opportunities and demand for diesel mechanics if these individuals prioritize continued education and stay up to date on the latest monitoring solutions.

Artificial Intelligence Technologies

Artificial intelligence (AI) has upended many industries, including shipping and trucking. Because it excels with pattern detection and information analysis, the technology supports forward-thinking efforts for cleaner diesel operations. For example, formulating biodiesel from ingredients such as used cooking oils can reduce emissions, but making these projects commercially viable takes time. AI could potentially shorten the process.

Identifying new fuel mixtures involves weeks-long laboratory tests. However, an international group of researchers built a system that accelerates the process with machine learning (ML). It finds promising compositions in a few hours. This method suggested over 150 options to lower diesel soot emissions by more than 70%.

Building the ML tool required huge databases of fuels’ chemical and physical properties. For example, the cetane number indicates diesel’s combustion speed. The training dataset included 708 cetane numbers for 475 substances. Additionally, a soot index contained over 400 pure compounds.

Researchers could specify a fuel’s target properties and rapidly receive options aligned with current technological and regulatory constraints. This advancement does not replace expert insight but could help scientists minimize lengthy lab tests, shortening their development time frames.

Some shippers use AI to offset rising fuel costs, automating steps to find reasonably priced carriers with intelligent freight procurement tools. Similarly, platforms can predict fluctuating diesel prices, aiding budget planning. These offerings will remain valuable until cleaner diesels become accessible and affordable.

Engine Additives

Securing diesel’s future could be as straightforward as using specialized products. One lubricant makes engines up to 8.4% more fuel efficient. The manufacturer published the results after four years of controlled testing, independently verified by the University of Queensland and supported by customers reporting similar results in field tests.

Because people can safely use this additive in any mineral or synthetic oil used in internal combustion engines, it is easy to include in maintenance programs. Additionally, each bottle contains 50 doses, making it an economical option for large fleets.

The graphene liquid concentrate boosts fuel efficiency during increased engine loads, such as when trucks begin to move or encounter wind resistance at fast speeds. The product also enhances diesel engine performance in generators, which typically operate at high loads.

Decision-makers should consider adding this product to some trucks in their fleet and comparing their performance over time to trucks without it. Their findings can help them determine whether to expand their usage.

Transition Programs

Even if fleet managers intend to primarily use diesel in their operations, some may want to gradually switch to electricity. Startups make the transition fast and simple, appealing to executives who lack the time to research grants, vehicle types and other specifics.

Forum Mobility is a California-based operation that aggregates clean energy rebates, using them to buy vehicles and increase charging locations. Representatives offer trucks and chargers through a subscription model.

One logistics client runs 50 trucks daily, driven by contractors hauling freight for shippers. The company now has several battery-electric vehicles and high-voltage charging stations to complement its diesel models. According to a Forum Mobility executive, typical subscription costs are the same or lower than the expenses to run conventional fleets.

These startup-enabled possibilities eliminate transition-related headaches, making the switch more attractive to busy leaders juggling numerous other challenges. These solutions could become significant features of the trucking landscape as managers explore electric models while continuing to use diesel assets.

Diesel Dominance

As diesel maintains its prominent position in the trucking industry, technologies and new business models offer greener alternatives. They do not necessarily require completely replacing well-established fuels but encourage decision-makers to consider tech-enabled improvements.",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2536330217-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:02:24.484969

The bipartisan CIRCLE Act tackles this head-on—providing a new investment credit to help communities like ours in PA-1 modernize outdated systems, strengthen domestic supply chains, and compete globally. It’s a fiscally smart, environmentally responsible solution, and part of my broader effort to grow our local economies and protect our environment, our workforce, and the future we owe our next generation,” said Fitzpatrick.

“Before coming to Congress, I was Mayor and a County Executive. Oftentimes, local governments bear the burden of operating waste management programs, having no choice but to pass those costs on to constituents in the form of taxes,” said Suozzi. “Making it easier and cheaper to recycle saves local governments and taxpayers in my district, and all over the country, up to $9.4 billion as less and less recyclable waste unnecessarily goes to costly landfills and incinerators. Bringing down the cost of living by reducing waste, all the while creating jobs in the recycling industry, is a no-brainer.”

The CIRCLE Act establishes a 30% investment tax credit—phased out over 10 years—for qualified investments in new or upgraded recycling infrastructure. Municipalities investing directly in waste reduction efforts will receive a direct rebate, ensuring local governments can modernize without passing the burden on to taxpayers.

According to industry estimates, investments incentivized by the CIRCLE Act could unlock over $30 billion in economic value, generate more than 200,000 jobs, and prevent 169 million tons of recyclable materials from ending up in landfills—all while saving taxpayers nearly $10 billion.

The bill is backed by a broad coalition of environmental and industry leaders, including The Recycling Partnership, World Wildlife Fund, the Aluminum Association, the Association of Plastic Recyclers, Keurig Dr. Pepper, and more.

""Investing in American recycling infrastructure means investing in the American economy. The CIRCLE Act offers an opportunity to galvanize investment from the private sector to help unlock more than $30 billion in economic benefits that can be derived from investments in recycling – including 200,000 new jobs, $9.5 billion taxpayer dollars saved, and 169 million tons of recyclables returned to domestic markets. The Recycling Partnership is committed to building a better U.S. recycling system and is proud to support the CIRCLE Act,” said Keefe Harrison, CEO of The Recycling Partnership.

Congressman Fitzpatrick has been a national leader in advancing bipartisan solutions to modernize our infrastructure, strengthen environmental safeguards, and drive long-term economic growth. From securing critical investments in local communities to shaping forward-looking policy on sustainability and manufacturing, he continues to lead the charge. The CIRCLE Act is the latest in his broad, results-driven agenda to build a cleaner, stronger, and more competitive America.

Using an ensemble of historical and future climate models forecasting climate and precipitation patterns until 2100, they found the PDO-like negative phase continues through this century.
The study also revealed that current climate models are underestimating drought conditions, Todd and Shanahan said, and they hope to find better ways to approximate aridity going forward.
“Doesn’t it suck that every time the science improves, the outlook for the climate and water looks worse?” he said.
Now, he said, their tone has changed to “This is a different kind of a drought.”","The drought in the Southwestern U.S. is likely to last for the rest of the 21st century and potentially beyond as global warming shifts the distribution of heat in the Pacific Ocean, according to a study published last week led by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.

Using sediment cores collected in the Rocky Mountains, paleoclimatology records and climate models, the researchers found warming driven by greenhouse gas emissions can alter patterns of atmospheric and marine heat in the North Pacific Ocean in a way resembling what’s known as the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), fluctuations in sea surface temperatures that result in decreased winter precipitation in the American Southwest. But in this case, the phenomenon can last far longer than the usual 30-year cycle of the PDO.

“If the sea surface temperature patterns in the North Pacific were just the result of processes related to stochastic [random] variability in the past decade or two, we would have just been extremely unlucky, like a really bad roll of the dice,” said Victoria Todd, the lead author of the study and a Ph.D student in geosciences at UT Austin. “But if, as we hypothesize, this is a forced change in the sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific, this will be sustained into the future, and we need to start looking at this as a shift, instead of just the result of bad luck.”

Currently, the Southwestern U.S. is experiencing a megadrought resulting in the aridification of the landscape, a decades-long drying of the region brought on by climate change and the overconsumption of the region’s water. That’s led to major rivers and their basins, such as the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers, seeing reduced flows and a decline of the water stored in underground aquifers, which is forcing states and communities to reckon with a sharply reduced water supply. Farmers have cut back on the amount of water they use. Cities are searching for new water supplies. And states, tribes and federal agencies are engaging in tense negotiations over how to manage declining resources like the Colorado River going forward.

“Planners need to consider that this drought, these reductions in winter precipitation, are likely to continue, and plan for that,” said Tim Shanahan, an associate professor at UT Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences and co-author of the study.

The research began with decades-old sample cores taken from lakes in the Rocky Mountains. Using modern geochemical techniques, Todd was able analyze drought conditions during the mid-Holocene period 6,000 years ago, a period in Earth’s history when the Northern Pacific warmed and the Southwestern U.S. experienced hundreds of years of drought.

But the sample cores suggest the drought was much worse than previously thought by scientists. Through a series of climate models, the researchers found vegetation change in the tropics darkened the Earth’s surface so that it absorbed more of the sun’s heat. That led to a warming of the North Pacific that was similar to the PDO that drives drought in the Southwest, but in this case, the drying lasted for centuries. “As soon as we saw that, you know, we started thinking about what’s happening today,” Todd said.

For the past 30 years, the PDO has been in its negative phase, which leads to drought in the Southwest by reducing winter precipitation and the runoff from mountain snowpack that fills many of the region’s rivers and recharges groundwater aquifers.

Using an ensemble of historical and future climate models forecasting climate and precipitation patterns until 2100, they found the PDO-like negative phase continues through this century. But unlike the mid-Holocene period’s warming, which was brought on by vegetation change, today’s is driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Certain models revealed that the change in the ocean pattern was less about vegetation absorbing solar radiation, Todd said, and more about warming in general.

The study also revealed that current climate models are underestimating drought conditions, Todd and Shanahan said, and they hope to find better ways to approximate aridity going forward.

Drought that continued until the end of the century would have major implications for water resources in the Southwest and how they are managed. The region currently sustains some of the country’s biggest cities and most productive agricultural areas.

Brian Richter, president of the water research and education group Sustainable Waters and a water researcher not involved in the study, said the research further proves the drought in the Southwest is more intense than previously thought and is not going away any time soon.

“Doesn’t it suck that every time the science improves, the outlook for the climate and water looks worse?” he said.

In many ways, Richter said, what people are seeing on the ground is outpacing science. Five years ago, he said, farmers would say they’ve been through droughts before, and this one would soon pass. Now, he said, their tone has changed to “This is a different kind of a drought.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2223867363-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 15:46:25.872797

Projects seeking leases, rights-of-way, construction and operation plans, grants, consultations and biological opinions will now be subject to approval by Trump-appointed Interior head Doug Burgum’s office.

“American Energy Dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said acting assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Adam Suess in a DOI press release.

The move follows a Trump executive order earlier this month that instructed the Department of the Interior within 45 days to conduct a review of regulations, guidance, policies and practices to determine whether it applies “preferential treatment” to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources. If such “preferential treatment” is found, it instructs the Department to eliminate such provisions.

“By removing these artificial advantages, the Department is levelling the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources, such as clean coal and domestic natural gas, after years of assault under the previous administration,” said the DOI press release.

Kabir Green, director of federal affairs for nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council said the move imposes unprecedented scrutiny and bureaucratic roadblocks that could indefinity delay or delay clean energy projects on public lands.

“It is not about oversight, but about unfettered obstruction of wind and solar projects that create jobs, cut pollution, lower costs and strengthen communities. This policy protects select industry profits, not the public interest,” said Green.

Green said the requirement that the that Secretary Burgum must personally sign off on each project for a broad range of permit actions is “absurd.”

“Can you imagine if Sec. Burgum ran his billion-dollar tech company like this—reviewing every single IT ticket himself? That kind of micromanagement would paralyze any operation, and here it’s being used deliberately to snuff out renewable energy development,” said Green.

Ray Long, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) said the rules amount to a “tsunami of red tape and roadblocks” for investment in solar and wind projects.

Long said “Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s personal approval on at least 69 distinct permitting actions — from site leasing to rights of way applications — on potentially hundreds of projects represents an unnecessary and inefficient approach to permitting that will lead to significant delays and uncertainty.”

The Trump administration campaigned on an “all the above” approach to energy policy but has since made sweeping changes targeting a slowdown in solar and wind development. Under the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill, developers now face tightened deadlines on tax credit eligibility and foreign content restrictions.

“[The action] stands in direct conflict with the Secretary’s stated goals as chair of the National Energy Dominance Council: to increase domestic energy production and streamline development,” said Long.

$1B–$1.5B investment over five years to build 1 GW of renewable energy capacity in southern Peru for mining operations.

Largest solar plant in Peru inaugurated: San Martin Solar Park (300 MW), with further projects totaling 450 MW in the pipeline.

Zelestra targets 3 GW of clean energy across Latin America, with Peru accounting for 30% of total output.

Zelestra, owned by Swedish investment firm EQT, will invest between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in renewable energy infrastructure in Peru over the next five years, focusing on powering the country’s copper-rich southern mining region.

“I’m convinced that most, if not all, of the energy projects we build in Peru will be used to supply mining companies,” said Jose Luis Garcia, Zelestra’s CEO for Latin America. He emphasized that the investment will center on building 1 gigawatt (GW) of renewable capacity in Peru, with long-term power purchase agreements with miners offering project stability. “The mining companies have very long-term contracts, and they’re going to have to renew them in the next three years,” Garcia added.

Peru, the world’s third-largest copper producer, hosts major mines such as Freeport-McMoRan’s Cerro Verde, and operations by Glencore, Anglo American, MMG Ltd, and Mexico Group. The majority are concentrated in the southern region—where Zelestra’s developments are strategically located.

On Thursday, the company inaugurated the $177 million San Martin solar park in Arequipa—the country’s largest, with 300 megawatts of installed capacity. The next project, Babilonia solar park (238 MW), will also be built in Arequipa at a cost of $140 million.

The Certified Organic farm, owned and operated by Brett Evans ’13, supplies Elon Dining with fresh, seasonal produce — including microgreens, herbs and lettuce — that’s harvested with care and rooted in sustainable practices.

For Evans, the connection to Elon is personal. A graduate with a deep appreciation for environmental systems, he founded Red Hawk Farm with a vision to grow food that’s both healthy for people and gentle on the planet. That vision has become a reality through partnerships like the one with Elon Dining, which align with the university’s broader goals to reduce its carbon footprint and support the local food economy.

“Knowing that the food we grow is going directly to Elon — a place that shaped who I am — makes it even more meaningful,” Evans says.

Elon Dining’s commitment to sustainability goes far beyond sourcing. Initiatives include composting food waste, minimizing single-use plastics, promoting plant-forward dining and offering reusable to-go containers. The dining team also partners with regional farms, fisheries and dairies, strengthening the local food system and reducing transportation emissions.

These efforts directly support Elon’s Sustainability Master Plan 2025, which outlines the university’s strategy for environmental stewardship through eight key goal areas: academics, buildings and energy, climate and resilience, food and dining, grounds, purchasing, transportation, and waste. The plan also emphasizes equity, inclusion and wellness as foundational themes that should inform all sustainability work on campus.

President Donald Trump signed four separate proclamations granting blanket exemptions to over 100 facilities, including chemical plants, coal-fired power plants, commercial sterilizers, and taconite mills, allowing them to ignore clean air standards and release more toxic air pollution in most of the country, or over at least 30 states and U.S. territories.

The orders Trump signed Thursday evening are unprecedented and let facilities put off using better technology or even turn off the systems that filter out some of the most potent cancer-causing chemicals the Environmental Protection Agency regulates, including ethylene oxide, benzene, chloroprene, and formaldehyde.

“Trump is illegally delaying clean air laws from his desk because polluters make more money when they just dump their toxic chemicals in our air,” said Patrice Simms, Vice President of Litigation at Earthjustice’s Healthy Communities Program. “Trump’s action on behalf of big corporate polluters will cause more cancer, more birth defects, and more children to suffer asthma. The country deserves better.”

Now, more than 50 chemical facilities can turn off pollution controls or dodge recently strengthened emission limits, including those under the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (HON) standards. Factories processing taconite iron ore, manufacturing chemical polymers and resins, and facilities using ethylene oxide, are also getting similar free passes to pollute, even though pollution controls are available.

EPA is also exempting over 30 commercial sterilization facilities. These include over half of the facilities that EPA has already found to pose an exceptional cancer risk to their surrounding communities. Some facilities have cancer risk rates over 80 times EPA’s acceptable cancer risk rate, and are capable of causing a new cancer diagnosis every month and a half.

Neighborhoods next to chemical plants, power plants, commercial sterilizers, and metal processing sites in Texas, California, Utah, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky, and West Virginia will face the worst of this continuing pollution, as these states are home to major facilities. Some of the protections being delayed, like the HON standards, prevent over 6,000 tons of toxic emissions each year and help protect more than 7 million people, many of them children, from breathing chemicals linked to cancer, asthma, and birth defects.

In April 2025, the Trump administration exempted 68 coal-fired power plants from pollution limits set in the strengthened MATS rule, even though pollution controls are widely available and already in use. These came after EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin invited corporations to email the agency to request exemptions from clean air standards. Companies were told they could cite “national security” or “lack of available technology” as justification.

Types of facilities exempt from clean air standards include:

Ethylene oxide commercial sterilizers: At least 39 facilities in 23 states and territories (Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia).

Under the OBBBA cuts to tax credits, projects that began construction within 12 months of enactment, or are “placed in service” by 2028, are eligible for the 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) or the 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC).
“That growth requires every available source of reliable power, including the clean energy technologies that are the only shovel-ready sources of additional power and the low-cost option across much of the nation,” said Grumet.

The OBBB that narrowly passed on July 3 makes sweeping changes to U.S. clean energy industrial policy, including repealing the investment tax credit and production tax credit for solar and wind projects several years ahead of schedule.

The challenge for solar developers is the pace at which projects must become operational. Under the OBBBA cuts to tax credits, projects that began construction within 12 months of enactment, or are “placed in service” by 2028, are eligible for the 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) or the 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Projects beginning construction by July 4, 2026 are eligible for the credits under a safe harbor provision until mid-2030.

A few days later, however, President Trump issued an executive order that directs the Treasury to restrict safe harboring of projects, tightening interpretation of the “beginning of construction” language. The order requires that a “substantial portion” of a project must be built to secure credits and requires enforcement within 45 days of the enactment of the congressional budget bill.

The BNEF report estimates that in 2028, when those tax incentives are gone, deployment of wind and solar will fall to 48 GW, dropping from 81 GW in 2027, as developers rush to place projects into service.

“A short path still exists for wind and solar projects to access these credits, but it will not be an easy road ahead for most developers,” BNEF analysts wrote in the report.

The industry shakeup comes at a time of rapidly increasing load demand by the buildout of data centers. Jason Grumet, chief executive officer, American Clean Power, noted that electricity demand is expected to surge by as much as 50% by 2040.

“That growth requires every available source of reliable power, including the clean energy technologies that are the only shovel-ready sources of additional power and the low-cost option across much of the nation,” said Grumet.

The BNEF report notes states that “renewables are often the cheapest source of electricity,” adding that its forecast “underscores the reliance clean energy still has on subsidies. Eliminating federal incentives threatens to upend the U.S. energy industry by hampering the roll out of wind and solar, which have become the biggest sources of new electricity generation.”

The Q2 2025 Solar Insight Report from Solar Energy Industries Associates estimates that the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 GWdc in Q1 2025, a 7% decline from Q1 2024 and a 43% decrease compared with Q4 2024, but still the fourth largest quarter on record.

With the drop in capacity additions expected to begin in 2028, the report finds that new wind, solar and energy storage additions will drop 23% through 2030 compared to an earlier BNEF forecast.

Will global and European light-vehicle sales improve in 2025? Which models topped the Chinese and European electric vehicle (EV) charts? And what purchase incentives has the UK government introduced for battery-electric vehicles (BEVs)? Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry discusses the week’s biggest news in The Automotive Update podcast.

In this week’s episode, Autovista24 joins forces with EV Volumes to assess the potential threats to global EV sales forecasts. Plus, a deep dive into the best-selling BEVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) in Europe and China. Finally, a look at the UK government’s plan to introduce EV incentives.

The global and European EV landscape

Global light-vehicle sales are expected to grow by just 1.1% in 2025, down from a 1.8% increase forecast in March. This is due to weaker demand in Europe, trade tensions, and geopolitical instability. In contrast, EV sales, including BEVs and PHEVs, are set to rise by 19.8%, pushing their global market share to 23.6%.

In Europe, light-vehicle sales are forecast to decline by 0.3%. This is a downturn from the previously expected 0.7% growth. However, recovery is projected in 2026.. Tightening EU emissions rules, lower lithium prices, and growing pressure on carmakers to cut fossil fuel vehicle output may drive faster EV adoption, and even spark a price war.

Government incentives in major European countries, plus increased availability of affordable domestic and Chinese-built EV models, are expected to further support growth. EV sales in Europe are projected to grow in 2025, raising their market share to 25.3%.

In China, EVs are forecast to make up 51.4% of all light vehicle sales in 2025, up from 44.3%. Total light vehicle sales in the country are predicted to increase by 2.7%.

The leading European EVs

A pair of non-domestic models headed the European BEV and PHEV markets in May. The Tesla Model Y topped the BEV list, and the BYD Seal U ended up number one in the PHEV charts.

Volkswagen (VW) Group enjoyed strong month, with five models following Tesla. The Skoda Elroq ended up second, with the VW ID.4 in third.

In the European PHEV market, the consistently popular VW Tiguan ended the month in second place behind the BYD Seal U. Third spot went to the Volvo XC60, the best-selling PHEV in Europe so far this year.

Geely stretches legs in China

China’s BEV market has seen a shift in rankings through May 2025. After a close battle in April, May’s results saw the Geely Geome Xingyuan establish a clear lead in the monthly and year-to-date rankings.

In the PHEV segment, BYD secured six of the top 10 spots in the month. The BYD Song Plus led the rankings, with the Li Auto L6 in second. Other strong performers included BYD’s Song L, Qin Plus, and Seal 06 models.

Despite year-on-year volume declines in four of the first five months of the year, the Song Plus remains China’s best-selling PHEV. Topping the sales in May, the model has maintained a significant lead over the Qin Plus, which has also endured declining sales.

UK government’s EV incentive

The UK government has introduced new purchase incentives for BEVs, offering up to £3,750 (€4,331) off eligible models. Amounts rewarded will depend on vehicle sustainability. Less sustainable models receive a reduced £1,500 discount, while only vehicles priced at £37,000 or below are eligible.

The grant is tiered, based on the emissions generated during vehicle and battery production. This will be assessed in relation to the carbon intensity of the electricity infrastructure in a vehicles’ origin country.

According to the Financial Times, industry executives are concerned about the eligibility criteria, describing the system as confusing and potentially damaging to market confidence.",https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/tau-18-7-25-e1752827881162.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 12:04:16.523492

The move, part of a broader shift in energy policy under President Donald Trump, adds new federal hurdles to clean energy development. Every wind or solar project seeking to build on federal land must now undergo a new review process, with Burgum personally signing off on leases, rights-of-way, construction permits, and grant approvals.

The Interior Department stated that the changes are necessary to end “preferential treatment” for what it called “unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy.” However, critics argue it will cripple the renewable energy industry at a time when energy demands are surging.

Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, a clean energy advocacy group, warned that under the new policy, the U.S. risks falling behind countries like China in renewable energy development, while rising energy costs will hit Americans already burdened by high utility bills.

“It’s really going to be the American rate payer that’s going to feel this the hardest,” she said. “We need cheap, clean energy to come onto the grid to help bring those rates down. Using red tape to strangle the clean energy industry right now is just going to raise rates and cost American consumers.”

The changes follow a spending bill signed by Trump that begins phasing out federal tax credits for renewable energy and expands support for coal and natural gas projects.

The relief allows coal plants to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards that were in place prior to the Biden Administration’s emission standards.
Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032.
The Trump administration has already granted exceptions to 47 companies (representing at least 66 coal plants) from MATS standards.
Some operators have already delayed retirements of their coal-fired plants due to concerns about grid reliability.","President Donald Trump signed four proclamations last night, granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, among other industries.

The relief allows coal plants to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards that were in place prior to the Biden Administration’s emission standards. The current administration has called the Biden-era rules costly and, “in some cases, unattainable.”

“These sectors are critical to maintaining national security and economic stability,” the White House said in a fact sheet. “Shutdowns could compromise our grid and lead to electricity shortages and reliance on foreign energy.”

Trump’s EPA has already proposed rolling back several regulations that would affect coal-fired generation. Notably, this includes the EPA power plant rule, which would require the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.

Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032. Coal plants that are scheduled to close by 2039 would have to cut their emissions 16% by 2030, while those that are set to retire by 2032 would be exempted from the new rule. Opponents of the EPA power plant rule have argued that its implementation would jeopardize grid reliability and that the emission reduction technologies proposed by the Biden EPA aren’t ready for prime time.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic (MATS) pollutants. The Trump administration has already granted exceptions to 47 companies (representing at least 66 coal plants) from MATS standards. The exemption runs from July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029. Many coal-fired plants added pollution-control systems in the previous decade to comply with MATS regulations.

Some operators have already delayed retirements of their coal-fired plants due to concerns about grid reliability. For example, Talen Energy recently agreed to delay retirement of its Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant in Maryland until 2029. Talen Energy had previously planned to retire Brandon Shores in June 2025.

In May, the U.S. Department of Energy also ordered a 90-day delay of the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan.

Trump has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades. While some plants may stay open longer than originally anticipated, most others still have plans to retire or be repowered to natural gas.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.
Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG math doesn't add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out ... But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/07/ap25190256979256.eC4aZkbKRa.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-07-18 15:44:08.951944

But when President Donald Trump was elected last year, she quickly sped up the project, assuming that federal tax credits for green initiatives could disappear.

Atwell, 35, had her panels installed in May. By the beginning of July, her predictions had come to fruition with the passing of the tax-and-spending bill, referred to by Trump as the “one big beautiful bill” — a bundle of different legislation that included a rollback on tax incentives for home solar panel installations and electric vehicles.

“I can’t do anything about the national political repeals of climate legislation,” Atwell said. “But I can do something about my own personal space, and this is somewhere where I could directly spend money that I knew would make a difference against global warming.”

Atwell may have been ahead of the curve as Washingtonians are now rushing to go green before tax breaks expire in upcoming months. With rising interest, solar companies are working to provide their products while anticipating a sales cliff. And while the tax credit helped ease costs, the high price of solar panel installation has kept some buyers on the fence.

Homeowners currently receive a 30% tax credit on the total cost of installation when they file taxes after putting solar panels on their home. That credit will expire Dec. 31.

Federal tax incentives for buying electric vehicles, including a purchasing credit and a home charging installation credit, are set to expire Sept. 30 and June 30, 2026, respectively. The purchasing tax credit includes up to $4,000 for a used EV and $7,500 for a new one. The credit for installing a home EV charger is 30% of the cost, up to $1,000.

Federal solar tax credits first popped up in 2005 as part of the Energy Policy Act. Since then, the credits have been expanded or extended multiple times with the last extension passed in former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, before it was eliminated by the recent bill. The Inflation Reduction Act also expanded electric vehicle credits.

Chris Hanacek and his wife had been kicking around the idea to install solar panels on their home for a while. Neighbors and friends of his seemed to like theirs, Hanacek said, so when the bill passed, it tipped the decision to yes. Hanacek received a quote, around $35,000, and will have the panels installed in September.

It wasn’t just solar panels the couple decided to jump on. The pair, looking at the repeals on EV credits, decided to purchase another Tesla. Hanacek bought his first Tesla in 2018 and said he loves driving the vehicle. So when Tesla had a financing deal, coinciding with the news of rollbacks, the couple made their decision, replacing their Suburban Hanacek called the “big, white whale.”

“If it hadn’t passed, we might still be on the fence about these things,” Hanacek said. “I feel really good about this. We’re spending a little bit more money this year than I would have otherwise budgeted but I think in the long run it’ll definitely pay off.”

Seattle City Light estimates the cost to install solar panels on homes, before the tax credit, is between $25,000 and $30,000, with the average consumer saving around $2,230 on utility bills per year, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.

Hanacek isn’t alone in his decision. Will Sumner, CEO and co-owner of Puget Sound Solar, said there’s been a huge surge in business since the bill passed and was signed into law. Usually there will be 20 to 30 people asking for installation cost quotes a week, Sumner said. Last week, the company had over 60.

While business is booming right now, Sumner said the company is looking ahead to the upcoming cliff when the credits expire. To manage the sales drop, Sumner said the business is continuing to diversify into other kinds of electrical work. Although the rollbacks are impactful in the short term, he said in the long term, the solar industry doesn’t want to have to rely on subsidies and this could be a chance for it to sustain itself without.

“We needed a runway,” Sumner said. “Right now the rug is being pulled out from underneath us when we needed a runway.”

Puget Sound Solar is not yet booked out until the end of the year, but Sumner said every day he hears about competitors filling up. This could be a concern for some homeowners, Sumner said, because the consensus of those in the solar industry is that the tax credit will only apply to those who have panels installed before the end of December — not people who scheduled installations for later.

This isn’t the first time the company has seen incentives end. In 2021, a state initiative run through Washington State University known as the Renewable Energy System Incentive Program stopped accepting new applications after state funding ran out.

Randy Sprout, co-founder and chief operating officer of Clean Energy Innovators, hopes with federal enticements ending, Washington can create its own programs for solar tax credits to ease the transition and support companies. In Washington, solar and clean energy jobs totaled around 4,149, according to 2023 data from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.

Washington currently offers net metering, meaning homeowners can buy electricity from their provider when needed and send back solar power-generated electricity to their providers when not needed. If consumers produce more electricity than they use, they receive a credit.

Equipment for solar panel energy systems smaller than 100 kilowatts is also exempt from state and local taxes in Washington.

Washington also offers a sales and use tax exemption for purchasing EVs, although those exemptions will expire at the end of July. The state recently introduced a rebate program in April, offering up to $1,200 for e-bike purchases.

Robert Deprez, a co-owner of Paramount Motors NW, said he has not seen an uptick in sales, and that business has been relatively slow overall. He is expecting people to begin buying EVs in the last week of July, however, before the Washington tax credit expires.

Sprout, however, said his company has seen high demand, starting about 30 to 45 days before the bill passed. He knows a sharp decline in sales is likely, but he also believes that solar has a high value, and it will never be fully eliminated.

Even with the incentives, not everyone is sure that the benefits are worth the cost. Olympia homeowner Zack Hofstad, 46, said he’s still considering installing solar. It would cost around $30,000 to install and he could get 30% of the cost back with the federal tax credit if he installs the panels before the end of the year.

But the benefits of offsetting his power bill would take nearly 14 years to actualize, Hofstad said. As he’s likely to sell the home in about a decade, he’s unsure about making the jump.

“I still really like the idea of solar,” Hofstad said. “It’d be really nice if it financially made sense for us.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07162025_tzr_tzr_095309.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-07-18 11:00:29.188523

KC8’s system, UNO MK3, deploys a catalytically enhanced potassium carbonate solvent and is reckoned to be a cheaper, high-performance alternative to amine-based technology. It is capable of capturing 95 per cent of CO2 emissions from industrial sources like natural gas and cement plants. The UNO MK3 will be tested in a 5-10tpd plant that captures CO2 from the combustion flue gas delivered by the NCCC’s natural gas testing system.

Although it is positive news, and while the DoE continues to fund other cement-related CCUS research, the rhetoric from the Trump administration about CCUS in general has been far less encouraging. Last month the DoE announced it was withdrawing US$3.5bn in funding for 24 CCS projects. The two largest beneficiaries of these were both cement related, with National Cement Co’s Lebec Net Zero project (California) and Heidelberg Materials’ Mitchell plant (Indiana) each losing out on US$500m in promised grants, resulting in the their cancellation. As part of the same cuts green cement start-ups Sublime Systems (US$87m) and Brimstone Energy (US$189m) also had funding withdrawn.

The DoE concluded that “these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars”. Mike Ireland, American Cement Association president and CEO, described the cancellations as “a missed opportunity” and comes despite CCS receiving broad bipartisan support in Congress.

As noted recently by the Global Carbon Capture Institute, the US remains the global leader in overall CCUS deployment, with 33 operational projects, 19 under construction, and over 300 in various stages of development. But concerns about the scalability and the requisite investment are undoubtedly growing in the US and beyond. Recent analysis by OneStone Research suggests that by 2030 approx 41.3Mta of carbon capture capacity will be available to the cement industry, well short of the 170Mta required to realise net zero. It projects by 2050 around 10-12 per cent (245-290Mta) will be captured by CCS, with only 20Mta being captured in North America.

Moreover, to make CCUS systems viable would require carbon taxes of about EUR350 (US$406)/t of CO2. Even then, it would not become the main choice until taxes are closer to EUR600/t CO2.

The Trump administration is providing some incentives for CCS development, but the advantages appear angled towards the oil and gas industry. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, signed by the President on 4 July 2025, expanded and increased the federal Section 45Q federal tax credit for point-source capture (US$85/t) and direct air capture (US$180/t) in dedicated geological storage. Notably, it now includes parity for the utilisation of CO2, meaning that CO2 converted into valuable products or stored underground as part of oil and gas recovery projects also qualifies for tax credits.

To what extent this benefits the cement industry remains open to question, although the Lebec and Mitchell plants might have qualified for US$80m and US$170m per year, respectively, if they were operating at their theoretical storage capacity. It should be emphasised both projects were massively ambitious, cement-specific projects and that a billion dollars remains a substantial investment by any standards.

Some experts believe that the sheer scale of such undertakings mean that cement would be better advised to piggyback with other hard-to-abate industries such as the energy sector or steel mills, but this in itself poses infrastructure questions.",https://assets.cemnet.com/Content/uploads/images/785fd7e4-8df9-44cf-9eb5-35a715458f78.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:02:40.684656

The heat just won’t quit! 🥵☀️

While we’re waiting for the sweet relief of the monsoon rains, everyone here in the Sonoran Desert is doing their best to keep cool, including all critters large and small.

Many species have adapted to be crepuscular, meaning they are active only at twilight, when the before sunrise and after sun set. Lesser nighthawks, bobcats, and tarantulas are examples of animals that cool it during the day.

Other animals may remain active in the heat of the sun, like the desert spiny lizard pictured, but find relief in the shade of cacti or in deep burrows, the closest thing to a nice climate-controlled building.

Of course, those critters that are nocturnal avoid the extreme temperatures all together though, they have special adaptations that make traversing the dark less perilous.

CEQA’s Cradle Reagan gave birth to the California Environmental Quality Act in an era of bipartisan concern about pollution, runaway development, and environmental degradation.
The California Supreme Court’s response would shape environmental and housing politics for generations.
His 2016 proposal to waive environmental reviews for developments containing low-income housing did not receive a single vote.
His budget plan, he announced, would incorporate sweeping legislation to exempt most housing from environmental reviews.","More than half a century ago, when Republicans were still running the state, Reagan brought CEQA (pronounced ‘see-kwa’) into the world as a shield against unintended consequences: a project that befouled waterways or drove species toward extinction. But the law’s reach expanded through a series of court rulings until it applied to developments of all kinds, becoming a handy tool for almost anyone to challenge a proposed project by demanding more analysis and remediation.

CEQA has long been a bogeyman for Republicans and developers, a symbol of regulatory excess and government dysfunction — and an expensive one at that. But antipathy steadily grew on the left as home prices squeezed urban progressives and forced middle- and working-class families into two-hour commutes or out of the state entirely. The cost of a mid-priced dwelling in California has nearly doubled over the last decade, to around $800,000, more than twice the national average.

The ultimate tipping point arrived last November, when California voters showed their disillusionment with the stewards of the status quo by ousting down-ballot Democrats and delivering President Donald Trump’s across-the-board gains compared to four years earlier. As Trump toured Los Angeles wildfire damage in January, he assailed red tape for stalling rebuilding, and Newsom waived environmental rules to speed the area’s recovery.

This summer, Newsom and like-minded legislators did what was unthinkable just a few years ago: They scaled the law back dramatically, exempting most urban housing developments, along with daycares, manufacturing hubs and clinics. In doing so, they overcame a once-inviolable alliance of construction unions, environmentalists and homeowners that for decades had fought the smallest changes by casting the law as a vital protection aligned with Democrats’ core values on climate and labor.

“If we can’t address this issue, we’re going to lose trust, and that’s just the truth,” Newsom conceded to news reporters last month, going out of his way to thank the leaders of the ascendant Abundance movement focused on boosting production and rejecting a scarcity mindset.

CEQA still lives. It will still generate reviews and lawsuits, and Newsom said he would never have supported a bill “to eliminate the core tenets” of the law. But his decisive support for paring it back says something essential about the long arc of California politics: where the state has been and where its leaders hope to take it now.

CEQA’s Cradle

Reagan gave birth to the California Environmental Quality Act in an era of bipartisan concern about pollution, runaway development, and environmental degradation. The Republican former governor opened the Legislature’s work in 1970 by urging an “all-out war” against pollution, building on President Richard Nixon’s signing of the National Environmental Policy Act.

“The air is going to be cleaner, the water we drink is going to be purer and we are going to alert the people of California to the indisputable fact that the protection of our natural environment must rank as one of our major priorities,” Reagan wrote in an op-ed adapted from a speech.

CEQA was heralded for ushering in a new age of clean air and water in an era when an oil-slicked river in Ohio caught on fire and Joni Mitchell sang about replacing paradise with a parking lot. It was relatively modest at first, requiring government entities to analyze and mitigate the impact of proposed public projects.

But two years later, a court case changed everything. A group of property owners in the Eastern Sierra region of majestic mountains and crystalline water sued to block a proposed development. Warning of issues with sewage, water and vanishing open space, they argued their county had erred in approving a permit — and they had backup from a new environmental unit created by the state’s attorney general, Evelle Younger.

“Evelle Younger, a moderate Republican — remember when we had those? — he charged us with making him look good and doing good on the environment,” said Clement Shute, Jr., then a young attorney for Younger who would go on to become one of CEQA’s most resolute defenders.

The California Supreme Court’s response would shape environmental and housing politics for generations. Justices ruled in 1972 that CEQA applied to private projects if they required a public agency’s approval — in other words, virtually everything.

“Most activity that takes place is private activity, which usually requires a permit from the government, so if you want to make a real difference that has to be included,” said Nick Yost, an attorney who backed the homeowners as a young deputy attorney general.

The impact was immediate. Many projects halted as lenders, builders, real estate agents, and “anybody engaged commercially in putting two sticks of wood together descended on the Legislature in a panic,” then-Sierra Club lobbyist John Zierold recounted in an oral history.

Industry backlash intensified through the years as CEQA continued to expand through various court rulings. In the mid-'70s, Dow Chemical launched a concerted campaign to dilute the law, which it faulted for stalling economic activity, and irate loggers drove their trucks around the Capitol, horns blaring, after a ruling applied CEQA to timber projects.

CEQA has long been “the scapegoat for everything,” said Shute, and “under attack almost constantly” since its inception.

The Tipping Point

At People’s Park near UC Berkeley, a monument to the CEQA wars is rising above a discarded symbol of 1960’s counterculture, seven years after the campus first announced contentious plans to build a 1,000-student dormitory and low-income housing there.

The project, delayed by the noise-pollution argument, was one of many examples that had accumulated over the years and soured perceptions of the law. Projects delayed or blocked included a food bank in Alameda, bike lanes in San Francisco, and a daycare center in Napa. The law’s expansiveness makes it especially potent.

“Anyone can file a CEQA suit,” said Sonja Trauss, executive director of YIMBY Law, a group she cofounded in 2017 during a protracted fight over a proposed apartment complex in the upscale Bay Area suburb of Lafayette. “This is what’s so astonishing and catastrophic about it.”

The law is also used for reasons that have little to do with environmental protection. Businesses have invoked it to block competition from moving in. And labor unions can use the threat of a lawsuit as leverage to extract conditions from developers such as wage guarantees or the use of union workers.

Union officials insist the tactic is rare and argue the state’s housing affordability crisis runs far deeper than labor costs or CEQA-related delays. But they also describe CEQA as a vital tool to ensure housing is being built in a way that ensures, the Trades’ leader Chris Hannan said, both “better projects” and “good jobs.”

“I don’t see how anyone thinks this is a winning possibility when it includes undermining environmental standards that are important and that give us leverage to get worker standards,” California Labor Federation leader Lorena Gonzalez said of efforts to streamline CEQA.

Similarly, the law’s defenders argue it often works as intended, with little fanfare, by forcing developers to minimize their projects’ fallout and giving the community a vital lens into what is happening in their community. Last week, for instance, a developer agreed to scale back a proposed project in the sensitive area near Lake Tahoe.

But easy-to-condemn cases like the People’s Park standoff — “right under the law but politically stupid,” as Shute described it — would come to symbolize the law’s general brokenness, frustrating even its staunchest allies.

“You have stories that get repeated over and over to the point that they become (seen as) the pinnacles of truth,” said Kim Delfino, a longtime CEQA advocate who founded the firm Earth Advocacy. “That is more the exception than the norm, but unfortunately those lawsuits are so egregious, they provide grist for the mill — for God’s sake, who the hell challenges a daycare center?”

Yet for years, the status quo prevailed, even as home prices and rents continued to climb. Working groups came and went, and efforts to more narrowly tailor CEQA failed even as California passed a series of exemptions for individual projects like arenas for the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Rams.

In 2013, a trio of former governors from both parties urged then-Gov. Jerry Brown to disarm groups who saw CEQA as a “favorite tool … to stop economic growth and progress.” Brown once called reforming CEQA “the Lord’s work,” but the former Jesuit seminarian could not deliver a miracle. His 2016 proposal to waive environmental reviews for developments containing low-income housing did not receive a single vote.

“The Legislature was passing a lot of special interest legislation that continued to drive up the cost of living,” said former Gov. Gray Davis, but “there was nothing happening in California to reduce the cost of housing — just the opposite.”

But change was coming.

The Political Shift

Attorney Jennifer Hernandez has spent decades working on CEQA cases, spotlighting what she calls the law’s abuses, and advising people working to change the law. Unsuccessfully.

“In an arms control race, who wants to lay down their weapon?” Hernandez said. “You’re talking about a real challenge to political power.”

For years, Hernandez’s car bore the vanity plates “CEQANRD.” More recently, she added a “FIX CEQA” plate — feeling, she said, a “political vibe shift” that made her “more bullish about fixing it.”

She had good reasons. A new generation of Democratic state lawmakers from the epicenter of the housing crisis, like Scott Wiener, of San Francisco, and Buffy Wicks, of Oakland, arrived in Sacramento determined to address a housing crisis that had become existential for their priced-out voters.

Over time, Wicks and Wiener maneuvered to positions of power and influence, leading key committees and forging an alliance with unionized carpenters, giving them a counterweight against the Trades.

“For so many years we’ve been nibbling at the edges because we thought it was impossible when you look at the reality of everyone trying to protect the status quo of what CEQA was,” Wicks said in an interview. “I have a lot of battle scars in this space, and it felt like it took all of these things finally to be able to put this bill out there.”

That new cohort was bolstered by a rising “Yes in my backyard,” or “YIMBY,” movement, powered by young urbanites and funded by tech workers. More recently, the “Abundance” philosophy popularized by Ezra Klein — which also blames bloated bureaucracy for the tight housing supply and high cost of living — captivated Democrats, including Newsom and legislative leaders. Housing advocates capitalized on the prevailing winds to elect allies.

“It required an additional decade or more of trench politics,” said Matt Regan of the Bay Area Council, a business coalition whose leader, Jim Wunderman, is close with Newsom. “Relying on logical arguments got us nowhere for 20 years. We had to win some election campaigns and change the political makeup of Sacramento.”

Those dynamics transformed the Legislature, opening political space to take on a law that was once seen as sacrosanct. “It feels like there are more members of the Legislature in the ‘CEQA is the problem’ camp than there are lawmakers in the ‘bedrock environmental laws are worth fighting for’ camp,” said Jennifer Fearing, a veteran environmental lobbyist.

That emerging majority found an ally in Newsom. The governor used his first State of the State speech to call for expedited CEQA reviews for housing, flexed his executive muscle to compel cities like San Francisco — where Newsom rose to power as mayor — to plan for more housing, and signed a series of bills to streamline construction.

“Reforming CEQA always required the leadership of a governor,” said former Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, who led a largely unsuccessful effort under Brown. “When it got really hot and the Trades and the environmentalists pushed back hard, [Brown] chose not to make it a priority. Gov. Newsom chose to lean in, big time.”

Where Reagan vowed to prioritize clean air, Newsom emphasized more homes — and a restoration of the faith in government he said CEQA had helped squander.

Newsom made his move on CEQA in May. His budget plan, he announced, would incorporate sweeping legislation to exempt most housing from environmental reviews. Similar proposals advancing through the statehouse had collided with opposition from labor, environmentalists, and their Democratic allies.

In meetings with legislative leaders, Newsom issued an ultimatum: He was prepared to veto the budget unless lawmakers approved those changes to the law.

“That was a real third rail of Sacramento politics,” said Dan Dunmoyer, head of the California Building Industry Association. “The fact that we have a governor saying, ‘We’re going to hold up the budget if there’s not CEQA reform,’ is a sea change.”

Newsom called the overhaul “the most consequential housing reform we’ve seen in modern history.”

‘Big, Big Headwinds’

Supporters believe California has achieved a breakthrough that will make it far easier, and cheaper, to build new homes in cities throughout the state.

“In my lifetime nothing more significant has happened to build housing,” said Davis, the former governor, who described calls pouring into his law firm from eager developers around the country. “People who’d given up on California are now giving us a second look.”

Others are less sanguine. For all the fanfare, the new housing exemptions are confined to certain parcels within cities. And the bill carving out projects like daycare centers and factories didn’t go as far as it could have in making it harder to contest approvals in court.

“There’s a lot of big, big headwinds on housing this doesn’t solve for,” said Ben Metcalf, who was Brown’s top housing official and now leads UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation.

Environmentalists fear Democrats’ rush to address a political liability is undermining decades of work to battle smog, protect animals, and preserve green spaces.

“We have this sort of collective amnesia about why we enacted these laws in the first place,” Delfino said.

In the meantime, even champions of the overhaul are working to manage expectations, noting CEQA is only one of many factors in a housing market strained by high interest rates and material costs.

Wicks has vowed to carefully track the law’s implementation to ensure it is working as intended. Wiener said in a victory press conference that the bill is not about “the next year or three years, it’s about decades to come.” He has already floated a new exemption for clean energy projects.

After developing over 1 GW of utility-scale solar and storage projects across diverse terrains and jurisdictions in the U.S., I’ve come to realize that the real complexity of this industry rarely lies in photovoltaic modules or grid studies. It lies in people. Coordinating with city officials, utility engineers, fire marshals and local communities isn’t just part of the job. It is the job.

One of my earliest lessons came from a mid-sized city in Southern California where we thought we had a slam-dunk project. The land was zoned appropriately, the interconnection looked promising and we had a clean environmental review.

What we didn’t anticipate was the skepticism from the city council. They had been burned in the past by developers who promised jobs and community benefits but later disappeared. So before we even reached the planning commission hearing, we met one-on-one with local leaders, showed up at community events and clearly outlined how the project aligned with the city’s climate goals. That work paid off. Not only did the council approve the project unanimously, but they became advocates, mentioning it in newsletters and media interviews. The biggest lesson? Cities aren’t obstacles. They’re potential champions if you engage them early and honestly.

Utility coordination is also often misunderstood by developers as a check-box process. But utilities aren’t just black box institutions processing queue positions. They’re risk-averse entities tasked with maintaining grid reliability. On one Electric Reliability Council of Texas project, the hosting capacity maps painted a rosy picture. But thanks to a weekly call we initiated with the utility’s transmission planning team, we learned about a transformer nearing overload that wouldn’t show up in the system impact study for months. That visibility allowed us to move our point of interconnection slightly and avoid an 18-month delay.

These conversations don’t happen through ticketing portals or email. They happen when trust is built. We now make it a policy to initiate human contact with utilities within the first month of site identification.

Working with fire departments has also taught me humility.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

While developing a solar and storage project in Riverside County, California, we submitted our battery layout assuming NFPA 855 compliance would be enough. The fire marshal, however, had real concerns because he’d never dealt with lithium-ion systems at that scale. Instead of pushing forward, we invited him to visit another operating site, provided technical resources and asked for input on emergency access. His team appreciated the transparency. By the time plan check came around, they were already on board. We avoided what could have been a six to 12-month redesign process. That experience led us to formalize early fire marshal engagement for every co-located battery storage project. You’d be surprised how many developers wait until the final design to think about fire code. That’s too late. If the local authority doesn’t feel confident, no permit will save you.

And then there’s the community. Public sentiment is a wild card. I’ve stood in town hall meetings where neighbors feared “massive industrial blight” while we stood near an old landfill the solar project would actually beautify. But I’ve also witnessed how fears melt away with the right engagement. In Arizona, we planned a solar array on a long-vacant site. Locals worried it would cause glare. Rather than dismissing the concern, we hosted an open house with snacks, booths and glare simulations. One of the most vocal opponents ended up speaking in our favor at the final hearing. People just want to be heard and shown respect. You don’t need a massive public relations firm. Just empathy and clear communication.

Equally important is how you show up after the project is approved. Too many developers disappear after they get their permit. That’s a mistake. In one project in Tulare County, California, after reaching commercial operations, we hosted a school field trip and donated to the local robotics club. Months later, when a neighboring landowner proposed a solar project, the planner recommended they speak with us first. That connection led to our next 100-MW project. Cities remember how you behave. Word travels, good and bad.

Our team has also benefited from maintaining an internal knowledge library. Every time we wrap a project, we document everything: review timelines, utility contact preferences, local authority quirks, even average time between submittals and responses. That knowledge helps avoid repeated mistakes and accelerates onboarding new team members. It’s one thing to say “permitting in this city is tricky,” and another to pull up a document with exact plan check comments and how we addressed them.

At the heart of all these lessons is a powerful truth: Large-scale renewable energy is built locally. Federal policy and global capital drive momentum, but local agencies, communities and utilities hold the keys to execution. After a gigawatt’s worth of permits, utility studies and stakeholder meetings, I now approach each new project not just as a technical or financial challenge — but as a deeply human one. And that shift has made all the difference.

This isn’t about soft versus hard skills. It’s about realizing that in clean energy infrastructure, coordination isn’t overhead. It’s the core of the work. As we aim for national decarbonization and grid resilience, developers must be equipped not just with spreadsheets and PVSyst models, but also with communication frameworks, stakeholder mapping and a commitment to collaboration.

Solar development at scale isn’t just about your panels or tracker system. It’s about trust. It’s about delivering on promises not just to financiers, but to planners, fire chiefs, grid operators and neighbors. Every megawatt must pass through hundreds of human hands.

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.

The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden’s administration, the White House said.

Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,’' the White House said in a fact sheet.

Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA’s offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,” Zeldin said.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/865c93c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5166x2906+0+269/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F66%2F59%2F8fb54b3c6d89db288959720d200a%2F879d38f100634389b1ad2eedfdb40673,N,,2025-07-18 13:54:45.547059

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” says Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion and sustainability at Detroit-based GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role.

In June, Carson City, Nevada-based Redwood launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy storage systems built to meet surging power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and other applications. The companies say the memorandum they’ve signed will enable Redwood to pair its integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and new U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution “from cell to system.”

The companies note that GM EV batteries already are being repurposed to help power Redwood’s 12-megawatt/63-megawatt-hour installation in Sparks, Nevada, which supports the AI infrastructure company Crusoe. Redwood claims its Sparks microgrid is the largest in North America.

“Electriciy demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” Redwood founder and CEO JB Straubel says. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

The companies claim U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4 percent in 2023 to 12 percent by 2028, according to U.S. Department of Energy data.

“As power consumption increases, there’s an expanding need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited,” the companies say, adding that they expect to announce more details on their plans later this year.",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/07/18/gm_redwood-web.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 12:04:57.360103

Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is planning to build its own nuclear power generators for its data centers in Illinois.","MISSOURI, USA — Missouri's residents will likely pay the massive cost of the state's upcoming nuclear energy expansion, and officials across the nation pitched why on Thursday.

Numerous national and state supporters of nuclear energy crowded into Columbia's Missouri Theatre after the state was chosen as one of seven states to hold a national Nuclear Summit. The Summit's goal was to ignite the conversation for new nuclear energy projects throughout the state and was driven by the National Governors Association and the Department of Energy.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Missouri, and your bank account, is about to go nuclear

Nearly every speaker at the summit shared the same reason for why Missouri must expand nuclear now: Large-scale data centers are forecast to threaten the nation's energy grid. But critics say that's speculation, and there's no guarantee big tech companies will choose Missouri to build.

Why do people want to build more nuclear power plants in Missouri now?

Missouri already has a nuclear power plant in Callaway County that's been operating for over 40 years. Doug True, senior vice president and chief nuclear officer at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said more is needed because national electricity demand is expected to spike as the nation moves into the artificial intelligence era.

""If you ask an AI chatbot to show you a picture of your dog driving a car, that takes about 1,000 times more energy (than a Google search) and it's enough energy to keep a lightbulb on for 20 minutes,"" True said. ""Now think about all the people going to ChatGPT and just playing around. Every time they do that, they're requiring that much energy.""

A recent Department of Energy report said that the growth of AI data centers must be matched by the growth of the national energy grid. A separate report from the International Energy Agency said AI data centers are expected to more than double energy needs worldwide by 2030. True said other projections showed electricity demand is going to dramatically increase after being largely steady over the past decade.

Missouri has already heard the rumblings of new data centers. A large-scale data center in St. Charles recently got partial approval from local officials. The potential of more data centers in Missouri was also alluded to by Department Chief of Staff Joe Alexander, who said he was approached by representatives from a company, whom Alexander didn't identify, who he said expressed interest in building an AI data center in Columbia.

But, while national forecasts for energy demand increases hold up to scrutiny, energy experts told 5 On Your Side that state forecasts become a lot more speculative.

There's ""no guarantee"" that data centers will show up in Missouri

Withholding specific information from the public about data centers is common, as Alexander did with the AI company supposedly interested in Columbia.

Ameren Missouri has also redacted information about two supposed data centers coming to Missouri in its justification to build a methane power plant south of St. Louis. Officials involved with the possible St. Charles data center refused to release the name of the company that will operate it.

The secrecy, in part, is because up until construction starts, the interested company can choose another state to build their data center instead.

Missouri has already lost out on multiple data center projects, Missouri Partnership CEO Subash Alias said at the summit.

""(Data center) companies are not looking to select Missouri, they're looking to eliminate Missouri,"" Alias said. ""These companies are eliminating regions and states quickly, based on certain factors. If you have what they're looking for, that doesn't mean you're going to advance; it just means you won't be eliminated.""

Missouri officials often know the state can't serve the data centers' demands, but they still pursue the contracts in hopes that other states fail and are eliminated from consideration, according to Alias. He also said the state tries to bank on the companies being unseasoned negotiators to try to extend deadlines.

Alias blamed the state's current lack of nuclear generation as the reason why these centers were lost, but other experts pointed to incentives other states have for data centers, which are missing from Missouri.

""There's a belief that 'If we build it, they will come,' but there are a lot of other states with incentives for data centers that Missouri doesn't have,"" Renew Missouri Executive Director James Owen told 5 On Your Side. ""There's absolutely no guarantee that this is going to happen.""

There's also no clarity on what guardrails, if any, Missouri lawmakers may put in place to stop the ""rug getting pulled"" from Missouri utilities, Energy and Policy Institute Research Associate Jonathan Kim said. That means if data centers say they'll build in Missouri, but end up pulling out after utilities have already built numerous power plants, the state's ratepayers will be on the hook for paying for energy that's not going anywhere.

""The biggest risk here, and something that cannot have enough caution taken around it, is the risk of building new generation for this new energy load, and the load not showing up,"" Kim said. ""If that happens, it's all the existing ratepayers that are footing the bill for something they didn't need and is ungodly expensive.""

Data centers are increasingly relying on their own power, rather than state grids

There's another option that wasn't discussed at the summit and comes with its own issues.

Numerous data centers are being built by multi-billion-dollar technology companies across the country, and they're more frequently choosing to build their own energy generation on-site, rather than relying on a state's electricity grid.

Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is planning to build its own nuclear power generators for its data centers in Illinois. Data centers in Texas are building their own gas power plants. The proposed St. Charles data center has also floated building its own power generator on site, though the details remain murky.

The benefits of data center power generators include taking strains off states' power grids and keeping power plant costs away from state residents.

A downside is that power plants built by and for big tech companies may skirt, or even reshape, state regulations, along with needing additional infrastructure and causing additional headaches for nearby residents.

""There are standard rules about how maintenance and upgrade costs are shared and allocated. But the situation is totally changed by the presence of a new data center,"" MIT said. ""As a result, utilities now need to rethink their traditional rate structures so as not to place an undue burden on residents to pay for the infrastructure changes needed to host data centers.""",https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/aa390741-f95d-4a5f-b616-d09427931c42/20250717T190718/aa390741-f95d-4a5f-b616-d09427931c42_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:54:58.296640

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.
Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons.
“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said.
A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.

The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said.

Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet.

Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.""

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/07/ap25178811543765.P8GxvhdxJY.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.47&fp-y=0.12&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-07-18 12:05:43.506646

The layoffs are among the first in a tide of solar job dislocations that are expected in the wake of the budget bill’s final passage early this month. In particular, residential solar businesses are widely understood to be scaling back hiring and bracing for layoffs.

Few formal announcements of employment curtailments have yet come to light, however, as some companies choose to quietly usher workers out the door.

Word that Pine Gate Renewables, a North Carolina developer and owner-operator of U.S. utility-scale solar and energy storage projects, has laid off 15% have echoed this week over social-media platforms. But responding to a query from pv magazine USA, the company said, “Pine Gate Renewables is committed to the privacy of its current and former team members and does not publicly comment on employee-related matters.”

If there’s any truth to the social-media posts, the company has parted company with more than 50 of its more than 350 reported employees.

In a post on New Leaf’s LinkedIn page, the company reported that it stands on well-capitalized and otherwise solid financial footing and maintains a strong and diverse pipeline of U.S. solar, wind and battery-storage projects. The post also contended that the company has taken measures to buttress its pipeline against “the sudden swing in tax treatment” and make sure to continue to market and sell projects on schedule.

“However,” the statement says, “NLE recognized the need to move quickly to reduce its cost structure in preparation for a market without the Federal ITC. The pathway to developing clean energy projects has narrowed, but it has not vanished; reducing the size of the company is intended to provide stability and free cash while the company adapts to a changed market for the long term.”

BBC News, Yorkshire

Yorkshire's mayors have been awarded more than £2.5m by the government to invest in clean energy for libraries, schools, leisure centres and other public services.

Great British Energy, the government's clean energy company, announced that mayoral authorities across England would receive a share of a £10m grant.

The East Riding, North and West Yorkshire will receive £700,000 to invest in putting cleaner energy into its public services, while South Yorkshire will be given £572,025.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the aim of the scheme was to help reduce energy bills.

He said: ""Your local sports hall, library and community centre could have their energy bills cut by Great British Energy, the government's publicly-owned clean energy company.

""Our plans will mean more money can be spent on the services that make working people better off and help strengthen the ties that bind us in our communities.""

Clean energy involves switching to energy sources that do not rely on greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants for their production and use, such as solar panels, wind turbines and hydropower.

In North Yorkshire, the facilities that will benefit include Joseph Rowntree School in New Earswick, Jack Laugher Leisure Centre in Ripon and Whitby Leisure Centre.

North Yorkshire Mayor David Skaith said the money would be put towards ""spending less on energy and more on supporting people"".

He said: ""We need to take action for our communities who suffer the devastation of flooding and for our farmers who face unpredictable weather.

""We are backing exciting projects that change how we heat our homes, produce electricity and grow our food.""

'Lower bills and cleaner future'

Meanwhile in South Yorkshire, public spaces to benefit include Rotherham Outdoor Market and libraries, Bullcroft Memorial Hall in Doncaster and Hatchell Wood School, also in Doncaster.

South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard said the scheme would make the region ""cleaner, greener and fairer"".

He said: ""The Rotherham Outdoor Market scheme is a brilliant example of how innovation can power local adaptation and resilience.

""By reducing emissions and energy costs, we're supporting the stallholders who are the beating heart of the market - helping them grow in the face of rising energy prices and making the market more attractive for both traders and shoppers.

""In Doncaster, solar panels on three local schools won't just save money, they'll help to educate the next generation.""

And over in West Yorkshire, the police stations in Pudsey and Stainbeck, Sedbergh Sports Centre in Bradford and South Parade School in Ossett will get clean energy.

Tracy Brabin, Mayor of West Yorkshire, said moving to clean energy was a ""key part of our plan to build a net-zero West Yorkshire by 2038"".

She said: ""This investment will make our public buildings greener, warmer, and cheaper to run – helping us save taxpayers' money and upgrade community spaces across the region.""

The BBC has contacted Hull and East Yorkshire Mayor Luke Campbell for more information on which services would benefit from the grant.

Dan McGrail, the CEO of Great British Energy, added the clean energy scheme would make a ""lasting positive impact for the country by creating new jobs, lower bills and a cleaner future"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ff29/live/13fe5320-63cf-11f0-999c-79495cb3f5d9.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:54:10.766666

The TCJA’s increased 60% contribution ceiling for those cash gifts was set to expire on December 31, 2025.","On July 4, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, (the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (“OBBBA”)), a sweeping legislation package featuring significant changes to U.S. tax law. The OBBBA was passed via a budget reconciliation process, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, and a razor-thin margin of four votes in the House of Representatives.

Broadly, the OBBBA extends and modifies several taxpayer-favorable provisions of the 2017 tax reform legislation known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“TCJA”) and introduces a host of new measures impacting individuals and businesses. A portion of the OBBBA’s cost is offset by a cutback to the energy tax credit legislation enacted under the Biden administration as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Some of the more notable changes wrought by the OBBBA will impact significant domestic and international tax rules, including those relating to:

qualified small business stock (QSBS) benefits;

qualified opportunity zone (QOZ) investments;

taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) limitations;

state and local tax (SALT) deductions;

the “qualified business income” deduction under section1 199A;

research and development expenses;

bonus depreciation;

the limitation on interest deductibility under section 163(j);

global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) and controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules;

accelerated expiration of, and new restrictions on, certain energy credits;

charitable deductions; and

investment income of certain tax-exempt organizations.

Also notable are several items not included in the OBBBA, most importantly the proposed section 899 “retaliatory tax” provision that had been included in the House and Senate version of the bill. In addition, the OBBBA does not include a previously proposed new tax on proceeds received under litigation funding arrangements. The OBBBA also declines to eliminate tax credit transferability, which had been proposed in prior versions of the legislation. Finally, the OBBBA does not impact the taxation of carried interest, which remains eligible for preferential tax rates, subject to the existing 3-year holding period requirement.

Below we provide a high-level summary of some of the key OBBBA changes that will primarily impact business clients.

Qualified Small Business Stock

Under prior law, taxpayers were required to hold qualified small business stock (“QSBS”) for at least five years prior to disposition in order to exclude gain on the sale of QSBS under section 1202. The OBBBA shortens the holding period by allowing a 50% exclusion of eligible gain on sales of QSBS held for three years and a 75% exclusion of eligible gain on QSBS held for four years. QSBS held for five or more years at the time of sale will continue to qualify for 100% exclusion of eligible gain.

Under prior law, stock would not be QSBS if the issuing corporation’s aggregate gross assets exceeded $50 million at any point before and immediately after the stock issuance. The OBBBA increases the aggregate gross asset limit to $75 million.

Prior to the OBBBA, excludible gain was generally limited to the greater of (i) $10 million ($5 million for married taxpayers filing separate returns) and (ii) ten times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in QSBS. The OBBBA increases the $10 million cap to $15 million.

These changes generally apply to QSBS acquired after July 4, 2025.

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The OBBBA eliminates the previously applicable investment sunset of December 31, 2026 and makes the QOZ program permanent, with certain changes.

There will be a new census tract designation process commencing in 2026, which will go into effect on January 1, 2027. The new QOZs will be effective for ten years, and new designations will be made on each ten-year anniversary.

The OBBBA adds a new “rolling” five year gain deferral period (as opposed to a fixed trigger date of December 31, 2026 under the prior QOZ rules) as well as an automatic 10% basis step-up that crystallizes at the end of the five-year period (30% for an investment in a rural area).

The OBBBA eliminates the 2047 program sunset provision, such that a 30-year rolling sunset will apply with respect to post-10-year dispositions of qualifying investments.

The OBBBA enacts new, enhanced reporting requirements applicable to QOZs.

Most of the QOZ changes are set to take effect after December 31, 2026. Various uncertainties remain regarding the interplay of the “old” and “new” QOZ designations and timelines.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

Section 856 establishes a limit on the percentage of a REIT’s assets that can be held in securities of TRSs. The OBBBA increases the limit from 20% to 25%.

State and Local Tax Deductions

The TCJA capped the itemized deduction for payments of state and local taxes (“SALT”) by individual taxpayers to $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayers filing separate returns). The TCJA’s $10,000 SALT cap was set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA increases the SALT cap to $40,000 for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2025. The OBBBA further increases the SALT cap to $40,400 for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2026, and then by an additional 1% for 2027, 2028, and 2029.

The OBBBA also phases out the SALT deduction for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (“MAGI”) greater than $500,000 in 2026. In 2026, the phaseout threshold increases to $505,000, and then by an additional 1% annually. For taxpayers with MAGI above the threshold amount, the SALT cap is reduced (but not below $10,000) by 30% of the excess of the taxpayer’s MAGI over the threshold amount.

The SALT cap will revert to $10,000 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2029.

The pass-through entity tax workaround enacted in many states was not affected directly by Othe BBBA.

Qualified Business Income Deduction

The TCJA added a deduction for certain non-corporate taxpayers equal to 20% of qualified business income (“QBI”) derived from partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships. For this purpose, QBI is generally active trade or business income (other than income as an employee or from certain specified service businesses). Ordinary REIT dividends and certain publicly traded partnership income also qualify for the 20% deduction. The deduction is subject to a limitation based in part on W-2 wages paid by the qualifying trade or business, which limitation is phased in for single filers with taxable income of at least $50,000 and married taxpayers filing joint returns with taxable incomes of at least $100,000. The deduction was set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA makes the 20% deduction for QBI permanent. OBBBA also sets a $400 minimum deduction for active QBI and requires a taxpayer to have at least $1,000 of QBI in order to claim the deduction.

Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the OBBBA increases the phase-in threshold to $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns, with both thresholds indexed for inflation starting in 2027.

Research and Development Expenses

Under prior law, research and development (“R&D”) expenditures (called “research and experimental” expenditures under section 174) incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, were required to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a 5-year period (15 years in the case of expenditures related to foreign research).

The OBBBA permanently allows for immediate expensing of domestic R&D expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Foreign R&D expenses remain subject to capitalization and amortization over a 15-year period.

In addition, the OBBBA allows taxpayers to elect to deduct unamortized domestic R&D expenditures capitalized in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025 in either the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024, or ratably over the first two taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

Bonus Depreciation

The TCJA amended section 168(k) to permit taxpayers to elect to immediately expense 100% of the cost of qualified property (including machinery, equipment and other tangible personal property with a recovery period of 20 years or less). The 100% bonus depreciation added by the TCJA was subject to a phase-out of 20 percentage points per year beginning in 2023 and was scheduled to expire after 2026.

The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

The OBBBA also allows taxpayers to elect 100% bonus depreciation for “qualified production property,” defined to include nonresidential real property used in the manufacturing, production or refining of certain products in the United States (excluding certain food and beverage products), if the following requirements are met: (i) the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer; (ii) construction of the property begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029; and (iii) the property is placed in service in the United States by December 31, 2030.

Business Interest Expense Limitation

Under section 163(j), which was added by the TCJA, the amount of business interest expense that a taxpayer can deduct generally is limited to 30 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income (“ATI”) (equal to taxable income with certain modifications). Following enactment of the TCJA, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, ATI was determined based on an EBITDA standard. For subsequent taxable years, a less-favorable EBIT standard was used in computing ATI, resulting in lower ATI (and a correspondingly lower cap on interest deductions).

The OBBBA restores the more favorable pre-2022 EBITDA rule, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

Under the OBBBA, the section 163(j) limitation will also apply to certain capitalized interest, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (now “Net CFC Tested Income”)

The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) regime was introduced by the TCJA, in effect, to impose a minimum tax on U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”). Under that regime, U.S. shareholders were taxed on their share of a CFC’s foreign earnings exceeding a 10% return on the CFC’s tangible property. Domestic corporations are allowed to deduct 50% of their GILTI income and claim a foreign tax credit (“FTC”) for 80% of foreign taxes paid on the GILTI income. This results in an effective tax rate of 10.5% (or 13.125% when factoring in the FTC limitation) on earnings exceeding the 10% threshold. Starting in 2026, the deduction was scheduled to decrease to 37.5%, raising the effective tax rate to 13.125% (or 16.4% when accounting for the FTC limitation).

The OBBBA eliminates the rule excluding CFC earnings up to a 10% return on its tangible property from the GILTI calculation, resets the deduction for domestic corporations permanently at 40%, and increases the FTC limitation to 90%. These changes will result in an effective tax rate of 12.6% (or 14% when accounting for the FTC limitation) on CFC earnings without any threshold. Furthermore, the OBBBA disallows 10% of the deemed paid FTC for distributions of previously taxed Net CFC Tested Income, which applies to foreign income taxes paid or accrued after June 28, 2025. The OBBBA also renames GILTI as “Net CFC Tested Income.”

The OBBBA also introduces a new limitation on expenses allocable to foreign source income in the “Net CFC Tested Income” FTC basket to the 40% deduction for Net CFC Tested Income and any other deduction that is directly allocable to Net CFC Tested Income. Additionally, no amount of interest expense or research and experimental expenditures will be allocable to the Net CFC Tested Income basket. Instead, such expenses will be allocated to U.S. source income.

The OBBBA’s changes to the GILTI regime apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII)

The TCJA also established the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) regime, which allows domestic corporations to deduct 37.5% of certain income derived from foreign sources exceeding a 10% return on the corporation’s tangible property. This deduction results in an effective tax rate of 13.125% on earnings exceeding the 10% threshold. Beginning in 2026, the deduction was scheduled to be reduced to 21.875%, increasing the effective tax rate to 16.4% on earnings exceeding the 10% threshold.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the OBBBA eliminates the rule excluding earnings up to a 10% return on tangible property from the FDII calculation and renames the regime “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (“FDDEI”). The deduction for domestic corporations is permanently set at 33.34%, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14% on earnings without any threshold. This aligns with the effective tax rate for Net CFC Tested Income when factoring in the FTC limitation.

Additionally, the OBBBA modifies the calculation of FDDEI compared to FDII by implementing restrictions on expense apportionment and excluding certain types of income from deduction eligibility. Specifically, gains from the sale of certain intangible property, as well as property that is depreciable or amortizable, are excluded from deduction eligible income. This exclusion applies to amounts received or accrued on or after June 16, 2025.

Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT)

The Base Erosion & Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”), which was added by the TCJA, is a minimum tax regime designed to prevent large U.S. corporations from eroding their U.S. tax base by making related party payments to foreign affiliates. The BEAT applies to multinational corporations with average gross receipts of $500 million or more over the three preceding taxable years and deductions for payments to related foreign corporations in excess of 3% of total deductions (the “BEAT Threshold”).

Under the TCJA, the BEAT tax rate was set to 10% for 2025 and was set to increase to 12.5% beginning in 2026. The base erosion minimum tax amount is due in addition to regularly owed U.S. corporate tax and is calculated as the applicable BEAT rate multiplied by a modified income base less the adjusted regular tax liability.

The OBBBA permanently sets the BEAT rate at 10.5% for taxable years beginning in 2026 (11.5% for banks and certain securities dealers), but maintains the BEAT Threshold at 3% of total deductions. The OBBBA also retains the current treatment of certain tax credits (e.g., R&D credits), whereby “regular tax liability” calculated for BEAT purposes would not be reduced by such credits for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Subpart F Income Inclusions

Under current law, a U.S. shareholder of a CFC is required to recognize their share of the CFC’s subpart F income only if it owns stock in the CFC on the last day of the taxable year.

Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the OBBBA requires any U.S. shareholder who owns stock in a CFC at any point during the taxable year to include its pro rata share of the CFC’s subpart F income in its taxable income for that year, regardless of whether it owns stock in the CFC on the last day of the year.

Stock Ownership for CFC Purposes

Prior to the TCJA, section 958(b)(4) prevented the downward attribution from foreign persons to U.S. persons for purposes of determining whether the U.S. person is the owner of CFC stock by providing that sections 318(a)(3)(A) through 318(a)(3)(C) are not to be applied to consider a U.S. person as owning stock owned by a foreign person. The TCJA repealed section 958(b)(4).

The OBBBA restores section 958(b)(4), reinstituting restrictions on the downward attribution of stock ownership. Thus, a U.S. corporation wholly owned by a foreign corporation will not necessarily be treated as owning the stock of the foreign parent’s wholly owned foreign subsidiary. The OBBBA also introduces new Section 951B which allows downward attribution in limited circumstances. Sections 958(b)(4) and 951B are effective beginning in taxable years after December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA also grants the Treasury Secretary the authority to issue regulations to treat foreign controlled U.S. shareholders and foreign controlled foreign corporations as U.S. shareholders and CFCs, respectively, for other tax purposes, including reporting requirements and determining the treatment of foreign controlled foreign corporations that are passive foreign investment companies.

Enforcement of Remedies Against Unfair Foreign Taxes (Proposed Section 899)

Prior versions of the OBBBA passed by the House and introduced in the Senate proposed a new section 899 which caused much consternation among legal professionals, industry stakeholders, and taxpayers. Proposed section 899 would have raised tax rates on certain categories of U.S. source income paid to foreign individuals, entities, and governments with connections to countries imposing taxes (such as a global minimum tax and a digital services tax previously negotiated by the OECD) deemed to be “unfair foreign taxes.”.

The proposed section 899 was removed from the OBBBA after the Treasury Department and the G7 countries reached an agreement not to apply the global minimum tax of the OECD’s Pillar II to U.S.-parented corporate groups.

Energy Credit Provisions

Clean Electricity Investment/Production Tax Credits (Section 48E/45Y)

These credits are phased out for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2032, except for solar and wind. No credits under section 48E/45Y are available for solar and wind projects that are placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless they begin construction within 12 months of the enactment of the OBBBA. Previously, under the IRA, the phase-out would have been automatically extended beyond 2032 if U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were not reduced to 25% of 2022 levels.

For facilities that begin construction starting June 16, 2025, higher thresholds for domestic content requirements apply for purposes of section 48E.

Section 48E was revised to provide a flat 30% credit to qualified fuel cell property that begin construction after December 31, 2025, which will not be eligible for bonus credits (i.e., the domestic content and energy community bonuses).

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Under prior law, the credit rate varied based on how the sequestered carbon oxide was stored or used.

Under the OBBBA, the credit rate is same across the different uses of sequestered carbon oxide. As revised, both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for an inflation-indexed credit of initially up to $85 per metric ton.

Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Section 45V)

This credit, created by the IRA, is eliminated for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (Section 45Z)

Under prior law, the credit was set to expire at the end of 2027.

The OBBBA extends the credit through December 31, 2029, but eliminated the special credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel.

Additionally, fuel produced after December 31, 2025 must be from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transferability (Section 6418) and Direct Pay (Section 6417)

The OBBBA generally preserves transferability and direct pay of certain tax credits, features added by the IRA.

The OBBBA does, however, prohibit transfer of credits to specified foreign entities. For this purpose, “specified foreign entities” generally include entities with certain ties to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) Restrictions

FEOC restrictions disallow many tax credits for

taxpayers that are “prohibited foreign entities” for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, and

facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, receive “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.”

The FEOC restrictions are intended to limit the ownership of and control over U.S. energy projects by individuals and entities from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The material assistance restrictions, which apply to credits under sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X, prohibit a project from qualifying for a tax credit if the total direct costs exceed specified thresholds related to products or components from those jurisdictions. The FEOC restrictions are likely to significantly impact credit eligibility for projects with Chinese-owned suppliers in particular.

The OBBBA introduces accuracy-related penalties due to overstating the “material assistance cost ratio” where applicable. Additionally, the OBBBA extends the period for assessment to 6 years material assistance issues.

Beginning of Construction

For purposes of the FEOC restrictions, the OBBBA codifies the beginning of construction rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

A recent executive order directs the Treasury Department to more strictly define when a project begins construction for other purposes, including by restricting the use of existing broad safe harbors “unless a substantial portion of the project has been built.”

Charitable Contribution Deductions

The TCJA increased the limit on deductibility of cash contributions by individuals to certain tax-exempt organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) from 50% of the taxpayer’s contribution base (which is, generally, adjusted gross income (“AGI”)) to 60% of the taxpayer’s contribution base. The TCJA’s increased 60% contribution ceiling for those cash gifts was set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA permanently extends the TCJA’s 60% ceiling for cash gifts made by individuals to tax-exempt organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A).

Additionally, the OBBBA imposes a floor on the charitable contribution deduction equal to 0.5% of the taxpayer’s contribution base (in the case of individuals) or 1% of the taxpayer’s taxable income (in the case of corporations). Thus, qualifying charitable contributions by individuals will now be deductible only to the extent their aggregate contributions exceed 0.5% of the taxpayer’s contribution base, and qualifying charitable contributions by corporations will now be deductible only to the extent the aggregate contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. These new floors apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

It's getting to that future that's going to be the hard part.

Just look at how 2025 has gone so far. We've got flashy new models on the market and charging infrastructure improving at a rapid clip, but also tariffs slamming the entire auto industry and EV tax credits ending soon.

What's the result? I'd call it a mixed bag, if there ever was one.

EV sales were up modestly in the first half—but things got ugly in Q2. General Motors absolutely crushed it, doubling its electric sales in the most recent quarter. Tesla, the dominant force in EVs in this country, continued to slide—and the Cybertruck didn't do it any favors.

On this week's episode of The Plugged-In Podcast, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, helps break down the big moves in the EV market so far this year. We discuss the winners and losers, what's dragging down electric car sales and what the future holds.

I've had a lot of conversations like this over the years. And while there are so many factors that can impact EV adoption, the experts will often tell you it comes down to the most basic things. Like affordability.

Clearlight Energy was also bought by LS Power earlier this year from Algonquin Power & Utilities to manage the acquired assets.","BP on July 18 said it has agreed to sell its onshore U.S. wind business, BP Wind Energy North America, to New York-based LS Power.

Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2025 subject to regulatory approvals, was not disclosed.

The sell of the company’s 10 operating wind assets with a total generating capacity of 1.3 gigawatts comes as part of the energy giant’s $20 billion divestment program announced in February. BP has been shifting its focus back to oil and gas, prioritizing investments that deliver value.

“We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused BP, we will continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio to generate value,” said William Lin, executive vice president of gas & low carbon energy at BP. “The onshore U.S. wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward.”

The transaction will increase the operating portfolio of LS Power’s Clearlight Energy to about 4.3 GW. Following the deal’s closing, BP Wind Energy will be owned and operated as part of Clearlight.

“As an integrated business, BP Wind Energy is a natural addition to Clearlight Energy’s growing portfolio of scalable solutions that will broaden our reach geographically and supports our strategy to make energy more efficient, affordable and available,” LS Power CEO Paul Segal said.

In all, LS Power currently has an operating portfolio of 21 GW of renewable, energy storage, gas and renewable fuel assets, along with more than 780 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in operation and more than 350 miles under construction.

BP’s U.S. wind assets, which provide power to more than 15 offtakers, are located in Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and South Dakota. Among the largest are the 470-megawatt (MW) Flat Ridge 2 in Kansas, the 288-MW Fowler Ridge 1 in Indiana and the 248-MW Cedar Creek 2 in Colorado.

The acquisition is among several recent moves made by LS Power to expand its portfolio. In June, the company announced its acquisition of Engie Services, which rebranded to Opterra Energy Services.

The Current State of Agricultural Energy and Emissions

The agricultural sector's relationship with energy and emissions presents challenges and opportunities. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, about 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from agriculture. This substantial contribution stems from various sources throughout the food production chain, from fertilizer manufacturing to livestock operations to food processing.

The agricultural sector's energy landscape is changing quickly, with farmers increasingly recognizing renewables as an environmental imperative and an economic opportunity. This shift is driven by:

Technological advances

Supportive policies

Growing awareness of sustainable energy systems’ long-term benefits

The economic drivers supporting this transition are compelling. Energy costs represent a substantial portion of farm operating expenses, and volatile fossil fuel prices create financial uncertainty. Renewable power offers the potential for more predictable costs and long-term savings while providing new revenue streams through sales and government incentives.

Solar Power: From Rooftops to Revolutionary Agrivoltaics

Solar energy adoption in agriculture has evolved far beyond simple rooftop installations, while traditional arrays on barn roofs and equipment sheds continue to provide valuable power generation. Even during winter, when there is reduced sunshine, solar power continues to generate energy. The emergence of agrivoltaics represents a revolutionary approach to land use optimization.

Agrivoltaics, which combines solar energy generation with agricultural production on the same land, has demonstrated remarkable potential. Research indicates that agrivoltaic systems can achieve land use efficiency rates of up to 186% by pairing solar energy with agrarian efforts. This means the combined output of both sectors is considerably higher than that of a single-use application. This dual-use approach addresses one of the primary concerns about renewable energy deployment — competition with food production for valuable agricultural land.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE) project has researched agrivoltaic systems for over nine years. Its findings show crops and solar production can perform better when paired under optimal conditions. Solar installations provide economic benefits while offering ecological advantages, such as reduced water stress and improved crop resilience.

International examples further demonstrate the technology's potential. For example, converting just 1% of Canada’s agricultural land to agrivoltaics can provide enough energy to fill between one-fourth and one-third of the country’s electrical needs.

Wind Energy: Capturing Rural Resources for Agricultural Benefits

Wind energy presents another significant opportunity for agricultural decarbonization, particularly in rural areas with favorable wind conditions. Small- and large-scale wind installations can provide substantial benefits to farming operations.

The agricultural sector's vast land resources and rural locations often coincide with excellent wind resources, creating natural synergies. Turbines can be installed on agricultural land while allowing continued farming activities around their base, providing landowners with additional income through lease agreements. This dual-use approach diversifies farmers' revenue streams while contributing to renewable energy.

Community wind projects have demonstrated powerful potential for rural economic development. These initiatives can bring significant investment to rural communities while creating local jobs and generating tax revenue. The financial benefits extend beyond individual farmers to support entire rural ecosystems, helping to revitalize areas that have faced economic challenges.

Transforming Waste Into Valuable Resources

Converting agricultural waste into valuable energy represents one of the most promising applications of renewable technology in farming. Biogas systems, which process organic matter such as crop residue, food waste and animal manure, can provide multiple benefits. These include power generation, waste management and nutrient recycling.

Modern anaerobic digesters can process various types of agricultural waste to produce biogas for heat, electricity generation and renewable gas (RNG) for injection into existing pipeline networks. This technology addresses waste management challenges while creating valuable energy resources. This demonstrates the circular economy principles that are increasingly important in sustainable agriculture.

The economic impact of biogas adoption can be substantial. These systems provide multiple pathways to profitability, including significant reductions in energy costs, improved waste management efficiency and the creation of valuable byproducts. Even using machinery that runs on a mix of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel fuel can make a big difference.

Rural households implementing biogas technology can typically experience immediate savings on cooking fuel and electricity expenses, and the nutrient-rich slurry produced during the digestion process serves as high-quality organic fertilizer. These systems create a circular economy approach where waste products become valuable resources, reducing input costs and generating additional revenue streams.

Emerging Technologies and Future Opportunities

Beyond established renewable energy, some emerging solutions offer additional pathways for agricultural decarbonization. Geothermal systems can provide consistent heating and cooling for greenhouse operations and livestock facilities, while small-scale hydropower systems can serve farms with suitable water resources.

Hydrogen from renewable sources presents another frontier, with potential applications in fertilizer production and heavy machinery operations. As these technologies mature and costs decline, they may become increasingly viable for agricultural applications, particularly in regions with specific resource advantages.

Policy Support and Financial Incentives

Government policies and incentives are crucial in accelerating agriculture's adoption of renewable power. The USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides grants and loans for renewable systems and efficiency improvements. The Inflation Reduction Act has made these investments more attractive for agricultural operations.

State-level programs complement federal initiatives, with many offering additional incentives for agricultural renewable energy projects. They recognize the benefits of supporting rural green power, including economic development and security enhancement.

Innovative financing mechanisms, including cooperative approaches and blended finance models, make renewable energy more accessible to smaller farming operations. These approaches help address the capital requirements that can be barriers to adoption, especially for smaller farms that may lack the resources for significant upfront investments.

Overcoming Implementation Challenges

Despite the clear benefits, several challenges can impede renewable energy adoption in agriculture. Land use competition, grid interconnection requirements and initial capital costs represent significant barriers for many farming operations. Additionally, the technical complexity of some systems may require specialized knowledge that many farmers lack.

Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts from multiple stakeholders, including utilities, equipment manufacturers, financial institutions and government agencies. Some measures that can help reduce barriers to adoption include:

Technical assistance programs

Streamlined permitting processes

Improved grid infrastructure

Global Lessons for American Agriculture

European farmers have demonstrated extensive integration of renewable energy systems, supported by favorable policies and market mechanisms that value environmental benefits. Almost 25% of the European Union's power comes from eco-friendly sources. These examples show how comprehensive approaches can achieve significant scale in adoption.

The global experience also highlights the importance of tailoring solutions to local conditions, including climate, crop types and economic factors. What works in one region may require modification for a different agricultural system, emphasizing the need for flexible and adaptive approaches.

The Path Forward for Sustainable Agriculture

Integrating renewable energy technologies into American agriculture represents a transformative opportunity for environmental improvement, economic development and rural revitalization. As technology costs continue to decline and policy support remains strong, adopting eco-friendly solutions in agriculture is likely to accelerate significantly.

Success will require continued collaboration between farms, technology providers, policymakers and financial institutions to address remaining barriers and optimize the benefits of these technologies. The future of American agriculture increasingly depends on harnessing the power of renewable energy to create more sustainable, resilient and economically viable farming systems that can meet the challenges of the 21st century.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/rose.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:12:35.822308

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.

The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden’s administration, the White House said.

Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,” the White House said in a fact sheet.

Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA’s offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help … unleash American energy,” Zeldin said.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/preview-1341.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 13:02:43.513177

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.”

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

“Dominion’s long-term plan should serve Virginia customers — not stand in the way of progress,” Shawn Kelly, Virginia-based regulatory director at industry group Advanced Energy United, said in a statement.
The commission ​“quite clearly” signaled it wouldn’t be rubber-stamping new plant permits, said Benforado.
Other disappointments for proponents of clean energy: The panel accepted Dominion’s self-imposed limits on new solar farms, which advocates say are far too low.
“We appreciate the Commission’s thorough review, and we’ll of course follow the additional requirements in future [plans],” Ruby said.","Virginia regulators sent mixed signals on the state’s clean energy transition this week — accepting utility Dominion Energy’s plan for new fossil-fueled plants on one hand but ordering the company’s future blueprints to better account for the state’s carbon-free electricity law on the other.

Dominion’s forecast represents its strategy for meeting electricity demand over 15 years and doesn’t lock the company into building specific power plants — a nuance the State Corporation Commission was careful to note in its July 15 ruling. But the regulatory panel could still factor in the plan as it mulls Dominion’s bid to build a massive gas-burning complex outside of Richmond.

“This order rightfully notices a lot of problems with Dominion’s planning process and is rightfully requiring them to fix it,” said Nate Benforado, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“The real question is: What’s going to happen in the meantime? We certainly shouldn’t be relying on a flawed plan when billions of customer dollars are at stake.”

Benforado and other advocates had urged the State Corporation Commission to reject Dominion’s plan outright, an action it’s taken before. Instead, the panel OK’d the resource plan with only faint praise, calling it merely ​“legally sufficient” and directing Dominion to change its approach for its next forecast, due October 2026.

The accepted plan stops six years shy of 2045, the year by which Dominion is supposed to generate 100% carbon-free electricity, according to the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act. The road map does not address how the utility expects to meet the decarbonization requirement.

In light of what Benforado and other advocates called this ​“fundamental flaw,” the commission ordered future schemes to span 20 years — not 15 — and include at least one scenario where all fossil-fueled plants are shuttered by the law’s deadline.

“Year after year, Dominion files plans that ignore clean energy requirements, lock in expensive fossil-fuel infrastructure, and drive up electric bills,” Dyanna Jaye, deputy director of strategy and governance at nonprofit Clean Virginia, said in a statement. ​“By recognizing the harm this process can cause to Virginia families and businesses, the Commission has taken a step in the right direction by calling for significant reforms moving forward.”

Regulators also directed Dominion’s future plans to include additional battery storage, discuss grid-enhancing technologies, and aim to shave more power demand through energy-efficiency measures. The commission called the utility’s proposal to achieve 2.73% energy savings by 2028 ​“the low end of feasible,” and said a 5% target would be more reasonable.

“Dominion’s long-term plan should serve Virginia customers — not stand in the way of progress,” Shawn Kelly, Virginia-based regulatory director at industry group Advanced Energy United, said in a statement. ​“The [proposal] needs to reflect the law, plan for a reliable clean energy future, and make use of proven tools like energy efficiency and storage to meet customer needs affordably.”

Though they didn’t call out the proposed 944-megawatt gas complex in Chesterfield County by name, regulators stressed that they will still debate Dominion’s plans for it and roughly 5 more gigawatts of new gas-burning plants before green-lighting any actual construction.

“Acceptance does not express approval … of the magnitude or specifics of Dominion’s future spending plans, the costs of which will significantly impact millions of residential and business customers in the monthly bills they must pay for power,” the order says.

The commission ​“quite clearly” signaled it wouldn’t be rubber-stamping new plant permits, said Benforado. But how the panel plans to treat the modeling underlying the Chesterfield proposal, which mirrors that of the long-term plan, is murkier. ​“There’s just a lot of question marks there,” he said.

Other disappointments for proponents of clean energy: The panel accepted Dominion’s self-imposed limits on new solar farms, which advocates say are far too low. Plus, neither the utility nor its regulators made mention of environmental justice, though the public health toll of burning fossil fuels is possible to quantify.

“Our estimates put those health impacts in the range of $7 [billion] to $13 billion,” Benforado said. ​“We urged the commission to direct the company to really analyze health impacts, and it just wasn’t addressed in the order.”

Asked for a reaction to the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Aaron Ruby emphasized that the company is building the country’s largest offshore wind project, and that it faces the biggest growth in power demand since World War II.

“We appreciate the Commission’s thorough review, and we’ll of course follow the additional requirements in future [plans],” Ruby said. ​“Most of our new power comes from carbon-free sources like offshore wind and solar. We also need natural gas in the mix because renewables are not always available.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1147419304.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7cad22c45c657061714f2a118ab3886d,N,,2025-07-18 11:01:32.816773

The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA’s offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help … unleash American energy,” Zeldin said.",https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/07/6879a697acb9e3.10024015.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-18 12:05:04.624363

Bob Pike hesitated before answering whether Natron Energy has paused building a $1.4 billion battery plant in North Carolina.

Pike leads the Carolinas Gateway Partnership, a public-private organization that recruits businesses to Edgecombe County, a rural region 60 miles east of Raleigh. Last summer, Edgecombe landed a historic project: The California startup Natron Energy announced it would create more than 1,000 jobs by establishing the world’s first sodium-ion battery “gigafatory.”

It was the state’s biggest jobs headline of 2024. Gov. Roy Cooper called Natron a win for clean energy, while Edgecombe leaders celebrated a tenant filling the long-dormant megasite in one of North Carolina’s poorer counties. The state awarded Natron $21.7 million in performance-based incentives, plus another $30 million toward upfront construction.

Among alternative battery materials, sodium-ion is more abundant than lithium-ion and thus potentially less expensive. Founded in 2012, Natron patented a unique battery from an electrode family called Pressuian blue, which produces longer-lasting batteries when combined with sodium ions. Backup power to data centers has been an early use.

“We’re going to revolutionize the market for batteries going forward,” Natron CEO Wendell Brooks promised at the North Carolina factory announcement last August.

Now, less than a year later, the Edgecombe site looks unchanged from above ground, Pike says, and the question is if Natron can continue financially. Pike said his team at Carolinas Gateway Partnership speaks with the alternative battery company weekly and hears of their liquidity issues.

“I don’t know how to describe something,” he said. “If you don’t have the money, you don’t have the money. It’s not paused because of the opportunities; it’s paused in terms of clarification of the financing.”

‘The money dried up’

I hadn’t asked Pike about Natron Energy on a whim. In late June, the tech-business industry news outlet The Information published a story saying the startup had little money.

“Natron is pretty much out of cash,” the article stated, citing “people familiar with the situation.”

According to The Information, many of Natron’s most recent investors have halted scheduled payments to the company. And though the battery maker has $25 million in booked orders, it can’t see this revenue until it gets certified from Underwriters Laboratory, an independent lab whose certification investors often require. Natron hopes to be “UL Certified” by the end of the summer, the article said.

The cost of launching factories in both Michigan and North Carolina, The Information also wrote, has “put Natron on an almost constant and increasingly difficult quest for cash.” This despite tax credits from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which are now being threatened by Republicans in Congress.

Responding to its cash crunch, Natron’s CEO Brooks “also froze plans for the North Carolina plant.”

Analysts say the chief advantage of sodium-ion over lithium-ion, availability, has been undercut by lithium’s falling prices. “Lithium carbonate prices have crashed by more than 70% over the past several years, negatively impacting the business case for sodium-ion batteries,” S&P Global wrote in an article last month.

And Steve LeVine, the editor at The Information who wrote the article, told me the headwinds Natron faces are affecting all U.S. battery startups.

“It’s super expensive to scale up,” he said, explaining that companies with promising batteries can’t cross the so-called “valley of death” to become established mass manufacturers.

“The money dried up,” LeVine said. “Like Silicon Valley, private equity. They’ve been almost unwilling to finance battery companies.”

What’s next for Natron in NC?

Natron Energy did not respond to N&O questions about its finances or its plans in North Carolina. If the company has indeed halted its Edgecombe project, it hasn’t told the state Commerce Department.

“The company has not contacted us with any updates regarding their plans in Edgecombe County,” N.C. Department of Commerce spokesperson David Rhoades said in an email Thursday.

The state’s incentive grant to Natron, Rhoades noted, does not begin until 2028. After that, the company will only benefit from payroll tax breaks if it meets hiring targets. Nor has any of the $30 million for site preparation been distributed.

“Release of program funds to the county is conditional on the company (Natron in this case) providing evidence of funding,” emailed Denise Desatnick, vice president of marketing and research at the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “Natron is still lining up their capital, so none of the Program funds have been released at this point.”

In Edgecombe, Bob Pike still believes in Natron and the future demand for its “proven” batteries. LeVine, an industry expert who launched The Information’s vertical on EVs and batteries, also said Natron has an attractive product.

Worst case, Pike said the local Kingsboro megasite near the city of Rocky Mount will have other suitors; in 2023, a state-commissioned report identified Kingsboro as the most “pad-ready” megasite (defined as at least 1,000 contiguous acres) in North Carolina, meaning a company could reasonably begin to build on it right away.

“If there’s a point in time that it becomes evident things change for whatever financial (reason), it’s still a very marketable asset,” Pike said.

Yet others wonder whether North Carolina was right to partner with a company without an established robust revenue stream.

“Was this a venture risk?” Tony Copeland, who served as state Commerce secretary during Cooper’s first term, asked. “I really think we need to ask these questions.”

In an interview with The N&O last month, current state Secretary of Commerce Lee Lilly compared economic development to a hockey team taking “shots on goal.”

“We don’t take every shot, but we try to take the ones that we think are going to be most successful,” he said.

It’s too soon to call Natron a missed shot. But it has not been an ideal start. What is clear is that North Carolina, the reigning “No. 1 state for business,” will keep shooting.

In an N&O interview last week, Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, said the state is currently competing for 243 projects, of which 10 promise investments of over $1 billion.

Trump 2.0 and the Triangle

Six months down, 42 to go.

Whether the time left in President Donald Trump’s second term gives you a smile or a jolt of dread will vary. But the half-year mark served as a good occasion to look back at how the administration has affected the “research” part of the Research Triangle, which over the past 70 years has grown as both a place and a concept with consistent support from the federal government.

By looking back, I mean looking back — all the way to the first National Institutes of Health award Duke University received in 1946. This history of research around Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill illuminates what has been lost at the area’s pillar institutions — the universities, the foreign assistance nonprofits, and the federal campuses — since Jan. 20.

Clearing my cache

The Chinese tech company Lenovo, which has dual headquarters in Beijing and the North Carolina Triangle, told The N&O this week it is laying off 3% of its full-time U.S. workforce. Lenovo in recent years has shifted resources from traditional personal computer operations toward artificial intelligence hardware.

Around two dozen workers at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences campus in Research Triangle Park received an email Monday notifying them that they would be laid off at the end of the day. This was part of much broader Health and Human Services job cuts made possible by a recent Supreme Court decision.

And in one of the largest North Carolina layoffs of the year so far, Daimler Truck North America is cutting 573 positions across two sites west of Charlotte. The company says it’s seen a marked slowdown in new orders for medium-duty, on-highway and electric vehicle trucks.

The Morrisville-based wealth management software firm Eton Solutions has raised $58 million in a Series C round.

Micropep Technologies, a French-American agricultural technology firm with U.S. headquarters in Durham, announced Georg Goeres as its new CEO.

Raleigh Founded, a prominent local coworking space provider, is closing its Gateway location.

National Tech Happenings

The Defense Department will soon use Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot from Elon Musk’s xAI. The Pentagon announced similar deals with Google, Anthropic and OpenAI — each with $200 million caps. This comes a week after Grok posted a series of blatantly antisemitic messages.

Starbucks is requiring corporate workers to be in the office four days a week starting this fall — or take a separation buyout — as the coffee chain looks to reverse lagging U.S. sales. Its previous return-to-office rule was three days per week.

Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI released nearly 11 hours of what they said was “raw” overnight surveillance footage outside Jeffery Epstein’s prison cell the day he died. This week, a Wired analysis found part of the “raw” footage is 2 minutes and 53 seconds shorter than its original source video. The cut, Wired reported, begins right at the so-called “missing minute” — which has fueled conspiracy theories surrounding the financier’s reported suicide. Attorney General Pam Bondi has chalked up the “missing minute” to a daily surveillance system reset.

Read the Tracking SDG7: Energy Progress Report 2025: https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/downloads","Universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030 (SDG7) is within reach, but only if we find ways to unlock and accelerate investments where they are needed most, fueling inclusive growth and shared prosperity.

The Tracking SDG7: Energy Progress Report 2025 unveiled this week, points to the risk of leaving millions without clean and sustainable energy. According to the report, the number of people without electricity stands at 666 million,19 million fewer than the previous year, while progress on clean cooking has largely stagnated, with roughly a quarter of the world’s population, around 2.1 billion people remaining dependent on polluting fuels and technologies.

At the same time, the report indicates that the energy transition is not progressing fast enough to accomplish international climate and development objectives. A successful global energy transition depends on where the next billion people get their electricity and how they consume this electricity. If these communities are powered by coal and diesel, and do not utilize energy efficiency measures, the climate goals of Paris and beyond will fail.

While the 2025 report highlights areas where the world is off track, it also offers a blueprint for action. Here are seven key opportunities we see for accelerating progress towards SDG7.

1. Expand Decentralized Renewable Energy Solutions

The 2025 report shows that rural areas continue to bear the brunt of the electricity access challenge, with 84 percent of those lacking electricity living in rural communities. Moreover, the report shows that decentralized renewables are often more fit-for-purpose in remote areas.

Therefore to close the gap,reach universal electricity access and ultimately industrialize, we see an opportunity in investing in solar home systems, mini-grids, and off-grid solutions focused on productive use for rural communities.

At SEforALL, we manage the Universal Energy Facility (UEF), which is a multi-donor results-based financing (RBF) facility designed to pool funding from various partners and ensure ongoing delivery of energy access programmes. Since its launch in 2020 with an initial capitalization of USD 8.5 million, the UEF has grown into a USD 67.3 million facility and currently operates in six Sub-Saharan African countries and provides RBF grants to developers of green mini-grids, and standalone solar systems for productive use. The solutions we promote create local jobs, improve resilience, and reduce reliance on diesel and biomass.

2. Triple Renewable Energy Capacity

Sustained action is needed to drive the uptake of renewable energy solutions, and the 2025 report indicates that current ambitions fall short of achieving the COP28 goal to triple global renewable power capacity by 2030. The gap risks slowing the penetration of renewables and electrification in key sectors such as industry, transport, and buildings, sectors that are critical for increasing the overall share of renewable energy.

We see an opportunity to accelerate electrification and renewable energy deployment to align with the COP28 target and advance the broader energy transition outcomes envisioned.

Emerging economies have vast potential in wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal energy. Realizing this potential requires targeted policies that improve access to financing, support technology and knowledge exchange, and build local capacity, which are key to achieving equitable energy access and sustainable economic growth.

3. Double the Rate of Energy Efficiency Improvements

SDG7 calls for doubling the rate of global improvement in energy intensity by 2030, relative to the 1990-2010 average. Sluggish global progress in recent years means that energy intensity will have to improve by 4 percent per year on average in order to meet the original SDG 7.3 target. This is consistent with the goal of doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030 agreed on at COP28.

We see an opportunity in implementing stronger policies and incentives to scale up efficiency gains in buildings, transport, and industry. Although current improvement is only 0.8%, technical potential is high. Digital tools, smart meters and updated building codes are underused levers.

SEforALL, working with the Government of India and an ecosystem of partners - including the Bureau of Energy Efficiency of India, the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy and the International Energy Agency - has developed a Voluntary Action Plan on doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030, that outlines potential measures along key pillars such as energy efficiency financing and sustainable consumption patterns, to be implemented in line with national goals and objectives.

4. Leverage Clean Cooking as a Health and Gender Equity Solution

The 2025 report shows that roughly a quarter of the world’s population remains dependent on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, and if current trends continue, only 78 percent of the global population will have access to clean cooking by 2030. This shortfall would leave nearly 1.8 billion people without clean cooking fuels and solutions.

We see an opportunity in mobilizing multi-sector investment into clean cooking solutions. The recent Summit on Clean Cooking in Africa shows donor interest and policy momentum. The Summit, which mobilised USD 2.2 billion in financial pledges from governments and the private sector, included a pivotal announcement by SEforALL and the World Food Programme (WFP) on an innovative partnership that will bring clean and efficient cooking solutions to schools in Africa, helping them shift away from polluting and harmful cooking methods currently used for preparing student meals.

Working with the Government of Tanzania and the UK-funded Modern Energy Cooking Services (MECS) programme, the project is kicking off this month (in July) in Tanzania with plans to bring eCooking to an initial 50 grid-connected primary schools serving 25,000 students followed by a potential roll-out of 5,000 additional grid-connected schools.

5. Expand Results-Based and Innovative Financing Models

The SDG7 Tracking Report 2025 estimates that annual investments between USD 4.2 and 4.5 trillion are needed to achieve SDG7 targets by 2030.

We see an opportunity for sector players to deliver investment to those who are most-in-need. This can be done through reforming multilateral and bilateral lending to expand the availability of public capital; mobilizing more concessional finance, grants, and risk mitigation instruments to attract private sector capital; improving risk tolerance among donors; and enacting appropriate national policy frameworks, regulations, and reforms through integrated and rigorous planning.

At SEforALL, we are working with the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet to implement Mission 300, the ambitious initiative to electrify 300 million people by 2030. To help achieve this objective, SEforALL is collaborating with partners to develop innovative financing instruments to enable private participation in local currency financing platforms with an aim to create a new pan-African local currency mechanism that will not only protect local investors from the risks associated with the volatility of currency markets, but also lays the groundwork to unlock currently unavailable sources of capital for developers across Africa.

In March this year, together with Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Africa50, and International Solar Alliance (ISA), we unveiled the USD 500 million DRE Nigeria Fund, which is the first country-focused DRE fund established under the DRE Africa Platform that will develop and invest in distributed renewable projects across Africa.

6. International Cooperation and Dialogue to Unlock Financing

International cooperation and dialogue are more critical than ever to advance energy action aligned with SDG7.

The UN General Assembly’s decision last year to extend the UN Decade of Sustainable Energy for All to 2030 provides an important platform to mobilize a final push towards SDG7. Importantly, the review of SDG7 at the HLPF 2026 will be a unique opportunity to strengthen international cooperation on energy and its interlinkages, and to consider potential building blocks that could inform the intergovernmental discussions on a post-2030 development framework, which will be initiated at the SDG Summit 2026.

Here, we see an opportunity for the multilateral institutions, and the global community to step up efforts with bold, collaborative action to unlock the trillions sitting in global financial markets and channel them toward the world’s most underserved.

7. Harness Digital and Data Technologies

The 2025 report shows that improved data on energy access gaps, cooking usage, and performance can sharpen policy and funding.

We see an opportunity to deploy digital platforms, satellite mapping, and smart meters to better target interventions. Further, open data tools (like those highlighted in the 2025 report) enhance transparency and accountability.

At SEforALL, we believe that integrating AI in the energy sector planning and evidence – especially for developing countries, will go a long way in designing comprehensive solutions for many of the developmental challenges currently facing those in developing countries. In collaboration with IBM, we developed the Open Building Insights (OBI) Tool, which is helping energy planners overcome critical data gap challenges to inform energy access and energy transition interventions and better deliver results for those most in need.

The global community has the tools, finance models, and technology to make SDG7 achievable by 2030. The seven opportunities that we have highlighted, if acted upon now, can deliver huge co-benefits for development, climate, health, and jobs.

A trade association representing US graphite producers in December filed petitions with two federal agencies, asking for investigations into whether Chinese companies were violating anti-dumping laws. The new duties will add to existing rates, making the effective tariff 160 per cent, according to the American Active Anode Material Producers, the trade group that filed the complaint.

The anti-dumping duty on graphite is set to increase tensions along the global electric-vehicle (EV) supply chain that’s already facing Beijing’s export controls of some critical minerals and battery technology. Battery supplier shares slipped while North American graphite producers soared.

“Commerce’s determination proves that China is selling AAM at less than fair value into the domestic market,” Erik Olson, a spokesperson for the anode producers trade group, said.

The tariff would be a blow to battery manufacturers, said Sam Adham, head of battery materials at consultancy CRU Group. A 160 per cent tariff equates to US$7 per kilowatt-hour added cost to an average EV battery cell, or one fifth of the battery manufacturing tax credits that originated in the Inflation Reduction Act and survived US President Donald Trump’s budget bill, he said.

“That basically wipes out profits for one or two entire quarters for the Korean battery makers,” Adham said.

Tesla and its key battery supplier, Japan’s Panasonic, were among companies pushing to block the new tariffs, arguing that they rely on Chinese graphite imports because the domestic industry has not developed enough to meet the quality standards and volume that the carmaker requires. Tesla shares fell as much as 0.7 per cent on Thursday.

Graphite is a key raw material used to make anodes of the batteries, and nearly 180,000 tonnes of graphite products were imported into the US last year, with about two-thirds of these deliveries coming from China, according to BloombergNEF.

China dominates the processing capacity of graphite, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) calling the material one of the most exposed to potential supply risks and “requiring urgent efforts for diversification”, according to a report in May.

Graphite is expected to remain the most common anode material for all types of lithium-ion batteries in the medium term, according to the IEA, with silicon only expected to begin eating into its market share from 2030.

The Commerce Department issued the preliminary determination affirming the anti-dumping duties in a document on Thursday, and said the final determination should be announced by Dec 5.

The tariff ruling “provides the policy clarity and market signals needed to accelerate domestic graphite production”, said Jon Jacobs, chief commercial officer at Westwater Resources, which is building a graphite plant in Alabama. Westwater, which has agreements with Jeep-owner Stellantis NV and South Korea’s SK On, will have 12,500 tonnes of production capacity when its first phase comes online next year, with plans to expand capacity to 50,000 tonnes annually by 2028, Jacobs said.

Westwater rose 15 per cent on Thursday. Canadian graphite firms Nouveau Monde Graphite and Northern Graphite also surged on the tariff news.

The anti-dumping rate determination “could impact the cost structure for battery suppliers” such as Fluence Energy and Enphase Energy, analysts at Roth Capital Partners said in a note on Wednesday. Fluence shares closed lower by 0.4 per cent while Enphase dropped 0.7 per cent.

Additional duties on batteries will add to the pressures facing the renewable industry. While energy storage retained key tax incentives in US President Donald Trump’s budget bill, Treasury Department rules restricting the use of Chinese cells complicates compliance for many developers. Supply chain risks and costs will slow the pace of storage growth on the US grid, according to Wood Mackenzie.

The company has built more than 30 energy projects between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains.
The company’s clean energy initiatives are both beneficial for the environment and for the company’s revenues.
Plus, according to the company’s 2023 sustainability report, the company’s clean energy initiatives that year contributed to 18% growth in net income.","With operations in 23 states, Avangrid is working to improve the power layout of the U.S. The company has eight electric and natural gas utilities in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York, such as the Central Maine Power Company (CMP) and New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (NYSEG), which collectively serve over 3.3 million customers. Its power business also includes more than 75 generation sites, serving over 3.1 million customers nationwide with 10.5 GW of hydroelectric, natural gas, solar, and wind power, enough for more than three million residences.

During the March CERAWeek 2025 conference in Houston, Avangrid announced it would invest $20 billion in electrical grid infrastructure, including substations and transmission lines, through 2030. A spokesperson told The Energy Mix that the investment was spurred by the fact that “the U.S. grid infrastructure is aging and in need of major modernization and repair,” as well as the increase in domestic energy demand from the likes of artificial intelligence and data centers. Earlier in the year, the company stated that it had six projects under construction or nearing the construction phase, totaling more than 800 megawatts (MW) of capacity, set to join its eight existing projects that currently support data centers, totaling more than 1,250 MW.

In May, the company announced that in 2024, it had increased its investment in American suppliers year-over-year by 16% to reach $4.3 billion and over 7,000 businesses spanning all 50 states. In the press release, Avangrid CEO Pedro Azagra said, “These figures are remarkable and demonstrate Avangrid’s commitment to supporting our domestic partner network. Year in and year out, our energy infrastructure projects not only enable Avangrid to deliver reliable and affordable power for homes and businesses but contribute to local and regional economies across the continent. Avangrid is proud to support American companies and jobs through our supply chain.”

The company’s commitment to American jobs is evident across an array of initiatives. Last June, Avangrid opened its National Training Center (NTC) in Sherman County, Oregon, where it will train over 200 employees annually to work with solar and wind technologies. Students can gain firsthand safety experience working on a 30-foot tower. Avangrid operates more than 14 wind and solar sites nearby in the state that support more than 60 full-time positions and generate over $140 million in property taxes over the projects’ lifetimes. The second cohort of students, including Wyatt Wall, graduated in December. Wall, who now works at a wind farm in Minnesota, said, “Hands-on is where I learn the best. It’s nice to come here to learn, practice, and get this experience.”

Additionally, the company’s philanthropic branch, the Avangrid Foundation, recently donated $100,000 to Maine’s Kennebec Valley Community College to help it acquire a Derrick Digger Truck for its Electrical Lineworker Technology Program. The digger truck will be used to train students to install utility poles. Pablo Colón, Avangrid Foundation executive director and Avangrid director of corporate citizenship, reflected, “Preparing the next generation of infrastructure workforce with new state-of-the-art resources is essential to maintaining and enhancing grid reliability and resiliency.” Many graduates of the program have gone on to careers at Central Maine Power.

Avangrid is also an essential partner to communities facing harsh winters. The company has built more than 30 energy projects between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. Those 4.5 GW of capacity can deliver power to about 1 million residences. During a wave of extreme cold in January, Azagra explained, “Even in the midst of freezing temperatures, our energy assets are proving to be an affordable and reliable source of electricity for thousands of people across the country. I am grateful for the hundreds of technicians who work at our projects all year to ensure we are providing electricity when it’s needed the most.”

Overall, the company is simply focused on doing good. In February, JUST Capital and CNBC included Avangrid on their annual JUST 100 list of the country’s best corporate citizens for the fifth year in a row. In March, Ethisphere included it in its list of the World’s Most Ethical Companies® for the seventh consecutive year. Notably, last year, Avangrid’s utility companies sent 198 lineworkers, damage assessors, and support staff to Virginia and South Carolina in the wake of Hurricane Helene to get power back on for millions of people left without electricity.

Innovation is often key to Avangrid’s impact. For example, the company teamed up with Boston Dynamics and Levatas on a pilot project that used an artificial intelligence-powered robot dog named “Sparky” to analyze equipment in substations and spot issues that could lead to outages before they ever occur. Last August, the company’s New York subsidiaries, New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E), launched an initiative that uses data analytics to prioritize maintenance of the 10,600 trees that they identified as an immediate risk. Furthermore, last July, Avangrid collaborated with a fifth-generation rancher named Cameron Krebs in Oregon to launch the biggest solar grazing operation in the Pacific Northwest, spanning two solar farms. Krebs’ sheep eat the vegetation growing around the solar panels. “By reducing the total vegetation on site, we’re significantly reducing the fuel load and fire danger as we move into the hot, dry summer,” Krebs described.

The company’s clean energy initiatives are both beneficial for the environment and for the company’s revenues. In the first eight months of 2024, Avangrid generated approximately 15,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of clean energy, eliminating over 23 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. That is the equivalent of the emissions produced by 2.5 million gas-powered cars in one year or from burning 11.5 billion pounds of coal. Plus, according to the company’s 2023 sustainability report, the company’s clean energy initiatives that year contributed to 18% growth in net income.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/516667669_1127450876072521_6382210404423559637_n-1-e1752843970924.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 12:05:46.717732

More coverage of how HR1 affects U.S. solar:","In the years since the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted, U.S. solar construction has seen consistent annual growth in both the commercial and utility markets; the latter charging forward and making solar the largest source of new electricity on the American grid in recent reports.

With the passage of HR1, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the subsidies bolstering U.S. solar output are slated to sunset with a significantly shorter runway than previously granted by the IRA. However, the fine details of these waning incentives are still in flux.

As it stands, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) — the primary subsidy for solar construction from the IRA — has a shortened effective length. Projects that start construction one year after HR1 was enacted, July 4, 2026, are still eligible for the ITC and must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

To understand the current status of additional large-scale solar incentives, Solar Power World corresponded with Raiza Kho, director of tax with Scrubbed, an accounting firm specializing in renewable energy financing and tax qualifications, among other fields.

SPW: Has safe harbor been affected by HR1?

Kho: HR1 threatens to eliminate the ITC for non-residential solar projects, which would affect the availability of safe harbor provisions. However, until any repeal or modification becomes effective, the current safe harbor provisions — including those for domestic content — remain in effect for projects that begin construction before the effective date of any legislative change. Practitioners should closely monitor legislative developments to determine the continued availability of the ITC and its associated safe harbors.

Do bonus adders still exist through the end of the ITC?

Yes, the bonus adders for the ITC, including the domestic content, energy community and low-income community bonus credits, still exist and are available through the end of the ITC period under HR1. There is no indication in the enacted law or legislative summaries that these bonus adders have been repealed or sunset before the end of the ITC period. They continue to apply to eligible projects, including those qualifying under the new technology-agnostic Sec. 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit for property placed in service after 2024.

Where does the domestic solar industry stand in the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) situation?

HR1 imposes strict prohibitions on the use of components or materials from prohibited foreign entities — including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran — for projects seeking federal tax credits under Secs. 45Y and 48E. Solar and other clean energy projects that include panels, inverters or other components manufactured, assembled or containing critical minerals from these entities are ineligible for credits if construction begins after December 31, 2025. The act requires taxpayers to obtain and retain supplier certifications and comply with new recordkeeping and reporting requirements, but it does not mandate a universal “FEOC-free supply chain” certification for all manufacturers. These new rules represent a significant tightening of eligibility and are expected to have a substantial impact on sourcing, supply chains and credit eligibility for the U.S. solar industry.

How has this affected direct pay and transferability?

HR1 did not repeal or materially change the direct pay (Code Sec. 6417) or transferability (Code Sec. 6418) provisions for the ITC as they apply to non-residential solar projects. Non-residential solar project owners can still utilize direct pay if they are an “applicable entity” (such as a tax-exempt organization or government entity) or transfer the ITC to an unrelated taxpayer for cash, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Opponents of the Dixie Valley geothermal project and federal wildlife officials have emphasized research showing the negative effects of other geothermal plants on groundwater-dependent springs in Nevada.
Ormat has also argued that federal wildlife officials used faulty data based on older geothermal technology when they determined the Dixie Valley geothermal project was a possible risk to the Dixie Valley toad.
Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.
Those projects include the Diamond Flat Geothermal Project near Fallon; the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project in Lander County; and the Pinto Geothermal Project along the Oregon-Nevada border.","Federal land managers are seeking to fast-track a geothermal project that would be built adjacent to the sole habitat of an endangered toad, a move conservation groups said they intend to challenge in court.

The “Dixie Meadows Geothermal Utilization Project” is one of nine geothermal projects in Nevada by developer Ormat Technologies that could soon be approved under the Trump administration’s new emergency permitting procedures, according to state records.

Three of those projects have already been approved under the new expedited rules, which aim to cut permitting timelines by up to a year or more for energy developments on public land.

Once approved, the Dixie Meadows geothermal project would be built directly adjacent to the only known habitat of the endangered Dixie Valley toad – a 760-acres of wetland habitat fed by hot springs in the remote Dixie Valley northeast of Fallon.

According to state records from the Nevada Department of Wildlife obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management plans to authorize the Dixie Meadows geothermal project under “emergency” permitting procedures within the next two months.

Federal wildlife managers have previously stated the project would likely adversely impact the Dixie Valley toad by altering groundwater at Dixie Meadows, a finding that led to the toad’s listing under the Endangered Species Act.

The Center for Biological Diversity sent a formal notice to the Bureau of Land Management last week announcing its intent to sue the Trump administration for violating the Endangered Species Act through the emergency permitting process.

During his first month in office President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” as grounds for fast-tracking lengthy environmental reviews and permitting processes for energy projects deemed critical to national security.

The Center for Biological Diversity said their formal notice was one of the first challenges to Trump’s executive order declaring an “energy emergency” as a means to expedite energy projects on public lands.

In their lawsuit notice, the conservation group said an emergency approval of the Dixie Meadows geothermal project would bypass required actions under the Endangered Species Act, including full consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Center for Biological Diversity also disputed the existence of an energy emergency and Trump’s authority to declare one under federal law.

“This fake energy emergency is being used to justify extinction, but in this country laws mean something and presidents can’t act with impunity,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Presidents don’t have unilateral authority to declare an emergency where one doesn’t exist so they can do whatever they want,” he added.

Energy production in the U.S. hit an all-time high in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Several energy sources—natural gas, crude oil, natural gas plant liquids, biofuels, solar, and wind—each set domestic production records last year.

Ormat did not respond to requests for comment on the possibility of the project’s approval under the new emergency permitting process.

Ormat has been locked in a legal battle over the Dixie Valley geothermal project since 2021, when the Center for Biological Diversity and the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe sued the federal government for approving the project.

The Bureau of Land Management initially approved the geothermal project in 2021, but the agency withdrew their approval after the Dixie Valley toad was listed as an endangered species following a federal review that determined the planned geothermal plant would likely threaten the toad’s survival.

“Since we successfully got the toad protected under the Endangered Species Act and BLM withdrew the project approval our lawsuit has been in suspended animation ever since,” Donnelly said.

Ormat responded to the toad’s endangered species listing by submitting a plan to significantly reduce the size of the project. Ormat also sued the Biden administration over its decision to list the Dixie Valley toad as endangered.

Geothermal power plants draw on wells drilled deep in the earth’s crust, pumping up steam and hot water to power giant turbines that generate electricity. Opponents of the Dixie Valley geothermal project and federal wildlife officials have emphasized research showing the negative effects of other geothermal plants on groundwater-dependent springs in Nevada.

One such plant is the McGinnis Hills geothermal power plant, managed by Ormat, where water flows in the Jersey Valley Hot Springs began declining not long after commercial power production started in 2012.

Ormat has repeatedly argued that newer technology pioneered by the company would eliminate the groundwater depletion attributed to older, outdated geothermal plants the company has since phased out.

Ormat has also argued that federal wildlife officials used faulty data based on older geothermal technology when they determined the Dixie Valley geothermal project was a possible risk to the Dixie Valley toad.

Geothermal is one the few renewable energy sources the Trump administration is promoting as part of its “American Energy Dominance” plan.

That could draw more geothermal development to Nevada, which is home to some of the largest undeveloped geothermal resources in the country.

Nevada is second only to California in geothermal electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.

A recent report released by the U.S. Geological Survey found that untapped geothermal energy in the Great Basin — which covers most of Nevada — could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply. Geothermal currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the EIA.

Nevada was also the first state to get geothermal projects approved under Trump’s new emergency permitting process after the three geothermal projects were fast-tracked in the state last month.

The storm threatened to bring flash flooding across the coast from Mississippi to the center of Louisiana.
Due to long-standing patterns of discrimination and inequitable infrastructure, Black communities in the U.S. are at greater risk from flooding events, both now and in the future.
In the South, where about 60% of Black people live, Black folks are nearly two times more likely than others in the region to experience severe flooding events, partly because many Black neighborhoods are located in low-lying, flood-prone areas.
To prepare for climate threats and flooding, Black communities need to continue building strong local networks and invest in resilience now, rather than waiting for outside help, Walton said.","One month before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Black residents across southern Louisiana braced for their first tropical disturbance of hurricane season. The storm threatened to bring flash flooding across the coast from Mississippi to the center of Louisiana. Thousands of residents stocked up with drinking water and sandbags in preparation for imminent power outages.

They were far from the only Americans experiencing the impacts of potentially catastrophic rains.

In a historic surge that’s being felt in cities and towns across the country, this year, the United States has experienced more flash flood warnings than at any time since records began in 1986, according to the National Weather Service.

July has been exceptionally wet — and deadly. There have been more than 1,200 reports of severe flooding in the first two weeks of this month, more than double the average amount, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records show. The floodwaters have led to more than 135 deaths in Texas and North Carolina, although the true number may rise as recovery continues and missing persons are accounted for.

Due to long-standing patterns of discrimination and inequitable infrastructure, Black communities in the U.S. are at greater risk from flooding events, both now and in the future.

In the South, where about 60% of Black people live, Black folks are nearly two times more likely than others in the region to experience severe flooding events, partly because many Black neighborhoods are located in low-lying, flood-prone areas. Within the next 30 years, communities with large Black populations, particularly along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts from Texas to Virginia, are projected to see their flood risk rise by at least 20% and potentially as much as 40%, a rate twice as fast as non-Black areas.

“When you think of climate threats, we’re the ones who are often on the front lines of it,” said Gloria Walton, the president of the Solutions Project, an organization focused on supporting local community groups focused on climate activism. During Hurricane Katrina, her family’s home in Jackson, Mississippi, was flooded, and the resulting toxic mold forced her mother to sell the house after she was unable to afford the necessary repairs. Two decades later, her mother has not been able to purchase another home, which made it particularly clear for her that “Black communities are often hit hardest by climate disasters and are the last to recover.”

“There’s so much fear and mayhem being sown, and climate change will make these events worse,” she added.

Flash floods typically happen in the middle of summer when the weather is hottest, but warmer air caused by climate change can hold more moisture, fueling heavier downpours and making flash flooding more likely and intense.

This year, the risk is even higher because the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than usual, adding even more moisture to the air.

A recent study found that human-driven climate change has already increased storm-related rainfall by nearly 20% in the southern United States, making flooding events like those experienced this July more frequent and severe.

To prepare for climate threats and flooding, Black communities need to continue building strong local networks and invest in resilience now, rather than waiting for outside help, Walton said.

“We have to show up for each other during these times, because weather conditions are getting worse and resources are getting gutted, leaving vulnerable communities that are already at risk, more at risk.”

This means supporting existing grassroots organizations, establishing resilience hubs, and creating mutual aid networks that not only respond to disasters, but actively fortify neighborhoods ahead of crises, she said. Building these connections and local infrastructures ensures that when extreme weather hits, the community is “always ready.”

“These threats are not something of the future. It is happening now,” she said.

How to prepare for flash floods

Create a family emergency plan

Know evacuation routes, designate meeting spots, and ensure all family members (including pets) know what to do and where to go in case of flooding or evacuation orders.

Build and maintain an emergency supply kit

Stock up on non-perishable food, water (at least 1 gallon per person per day for several days), medications, flashlights, batteries, and first aid supplies.

Monitor weather alerts and heed warnings

Sign up for local emergency alerts via your city or county website, watch NOAA’s Weather Radio stream, and promptly follow evacuation or shelter-in-place instructions from authorities.

Protect important documents and valuables

Store critical papers (such as identification, insurance, and medical records) in waterproof containers and keep digital copies stored securely.

Delivering on plan to further simplify and focus bp as part of the $20bn divestment programme announced in February

bp has agreed to sell its US onshore wind business, BP Wind Energy North America Inc. (bp Wind Energy), to LS Power, a leading development, investment and operating company focused on the North American power and energy infrastructure sector. After close, bp Wind Energy will be owned and operated as part of LS Power portfolio company Clearlight Energy, increasing its operating fleet to ~4.3GW.

bp Wind Energy has been marketed as an integrated business, with its experienced workforce expected to transfer to the new owner on completion of the deal. The business has interests in 10 operating onshore wind energy assets across seven US states, operating nine of them. The assets have a combined gross generating capacity of 1.7GW (1.3GW net to bp). All wind assets are gridconnected and are already providing power to over 15 off-takers.

The deal is part of bp’s focusing of its low carbon energy portfolio, prioritizing investment choices whilst delivering value for shareholders.

William Lin, bp EVP for gas & low carbon energy, said, 'We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused bp, we will continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio to generate value. The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward. I am pleased we have reached a mutually beneficial deal with LS Power and I look forward to working with them to support our people in maintaining safe and reliable operations as we transition ownership.'

LS Power will add bp’s US onshore wind business to an existing fleet of renewable, energy storage, flexible gas and renewable fuels assets, which comprise a 21GW operating portfolio and more than 780 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in operation as well as another 350+ miles currently under construction or development.

Paul Segal, CEO of LS Power, said, 'We are focused on a holistic approach to advancing American energy infrastructure that includes improving existing energy assets while investing in transformative strategies that make energy more efficient, affordable and available. Well-located with well-structured contracts, these new assets will expand our renewable energy presence and help to meet growing energy demand across the US. We look forward to welcoming the talented teams operating these assets to LS Power and partnering with them to drive value for our stakeholders.'

The deal is expected to conclude by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. It is the latest example of bp’s $20bn divestment program to simplify and focus the business. In its 1Q25 results, bp updated its divestment guidance to $3-4bn for 2025, with $1.5bn signed or completed to that date. Further progress on divestment proceeds will be provided as part of 2Q25 results.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion (€37.8bn) Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June.
LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions Experts say LNG purchasing agreements could slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.
The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic.
Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.","Asian countries are offering to buy more US liquefied natural gas (LNG) in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over US trade deficits and stave off higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more US LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. US efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub.

JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts in June to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of US gas annually starting around 2030.

LNG pipelines from Alaska

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transportation that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion (€37.8bn) Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The US president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal.

Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 1,300-kilometre pipeline that would funnel gas from Alaska's North Slope region.

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on US energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more US LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he added.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements could slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources, like solar or wind, that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favour their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG math doesn't add up

Experts said that although countries are signalling a willingness to import more US LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on US trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the US exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman.

Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the US twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the US exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that US gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete.

Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032.

Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term US LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the long-term stability of the US as a trading partner, said Overland. “The US is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out...But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, and earlier in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were re-routed to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/37/79/21/1200x675_cmsv2_e07b347e-d914-5682-a44d-7286d1dd413f-9377921.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:36:03.414431

Join us today to help defend America’s greatest fishery for generations.","The Trump Administration will defend Bristol Bay, America’s greatest salmon fishery.

The U.S. federal government is standing up for America’s greatest salmon fishery and against a foreign mining company. On July 17, the Trump Administration’s Department of Justice announced that it will defend both a 2020 decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a key Pebble Mine permit and the Environmental Protection Agency’s subsequent decision to protect Alaska’s Bristol Bay from future versions of Pebble Mine under the Clean Water Act.

“President Trump stands with Alaskans and with fishing communities nationwide today,” says Wild Salmon Center President and CEO Guido Rahr. “We applaud this decision to protect America’s greatest salmon stronghold, a place that supports tens of thousands of American fishing jobs and is revered by sportsmen and women across the nation.”

“We applaud this decision to protect America’s greatest salmon stronghold, a place that supports tens of thousands of American fishing jobs across the nation.”

Wild Salmon Center President and CEO Guido Rahr

Alaska’s Bristol Bay is the most productive salmon stronghold on Earth, returning an average of 40 million wild sockeye salmon every year and driving a $2.2 billion salmon fishery that supports tens of thousands of jobs. But in 2024, Pebble Mine backer Northern Dynasty moved to sue the U.S. government over its earlier decisions—decisions that reflected public opposition to mining in Bristol Bay from 63 percent of Alaskans and millions of Americans.

“We need to take care of our wild places and public lands heritage, for us and for future generations,” Rahr says. “President Trump has shown major leadership on this issue today.”

Now, with the power of the U.S. government backing Bristol Bay, Northern Dynasty’s lawsuit enters a new phase. Wild Salmon Center has joined the government’s case to defend both decisions and ensure that the toxic Pebble Mine project never again puts Bristol Bay at risk.

You know, as we do, that once we lose special places like Bristol Bay, we never get them back. That’s why we’re working on multiple fronts to keep Bristol Bay off-limits to any large toxic mine. Your support ensures that we can stay in this fight, protect past gains, and pursue even stronger safeguards for Bristol Bay.

""System responsibility means that the costs of grid expansion should no longer be borne solely by electricity customers through grid operators and general grid fees,"" Reiche said, as reported by Die Zeit.

Grids need to be expanded and updated to accommodate a growing number of decentralised renewable installations, which are increasingly replacing conventional power plants.

Reiche called for a ""fair distribution of responsibility"" for grid expansion costs, adding that renewable power operators should ""take responsibility"" and contribute to grid stability. The energy transition will succeed ""if we consistently combine the expansion of renewables with cost efficiency,"" the minister said.

Renewables have become the cheapest form of electricity generation. However, to ensure the lights stay on year-round, the electricity system needs to be upgraded and expanded to include cross-border infrastructure, storage, back-up capacity and encourage demand flexibility to make up for renewables’ intermittency. How efficiently this is done will largely determine future power prices.

Renewables in Germany have received guaranteed feed-in support payments for decades. The scheme is credited with powering the country's renewables growth but, as their share in the electricity mix grows, the country has to figure out how to bring integration costs down while spurring investments on.

In a discussion paper from May, Germany’s Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) called for a wide reform of the system of fees that finance the country's network of power lines, proposing an option where electricity producers pay to feed-in electricity into the grid.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-07-18 09:48:32.338891

The AD rates are well below the 800%+ rates requested by petitioner American Active Anode Material Producers (AAAMP).
What are battery active anode materials?
AAAMP claims that it represents the only domestic manufacturers of active anode materials.
But raw AAM, battery cells and battery modules are within the scope and subject to tariffs.","The Dept. of Commerce today revealed its preliminary antidumping (AD) rates in the trade case involving battery anode material from China. Almost every significant battery exporter to the United States, including Canadian Solar, LG Energy Solution, Panasonic, Saft, Samsung and Tesla, was given a 93.5% AD rate. The China-wide rate (for those who did not respond to the Commerce petition request) is 102.72%. A full list of exporters and producers under the tariff order can be found here.

The AD rates are well below the 800%+ rates requested by petitioner American Active Anode Material Producers (AAAMP). Commerce also released relatively modest countervailing duty (CVD) rates of 11.58% for most respondents, including dominant battery producer Panasonic. When the AD and CVD rates are combined, the preliminary duty reaches a range between 105.08% and 114.4%. Industry analyst Roth Capital Partners estimates this combined rate could add 11-12% to the cost of a lithium-ion cell and 5-6% to the cost of a DC block — amounts that are manageable and unlikely to impact industry demand, the firm stated.

The AAAMP requested the AD/CVD investigation, asking the government to look at active anode material (AAM) used in lithium-ion energy storage and EV batteries. AAAMP claimed that China’s dominance on AAM production has prevented the domestic market from establishing competitive operations. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary affirmative determination in January that imported active anode material from China was harming the U.S. industry.

The ITC indicated that the U.S. AAM industry has been “materially retarded” by dumped and subsidized imports from China. Whereas previous AD/CVD cases in the solar panel space could prove a clear “before” and “after” level of harm once dumped Chinese product entered the United States, the AAM industry does not yet have significant product output sampling to compare.

But Commerce has found that the injury was not that significant, based on the low preliminary AD/CVD rates that have been revealed.

What are battery active anode materials?

A battery needs both a cathode and anode to facilitate the flow of electric charge. During battery charging, electrons move from the positive cathode to the negative anode, and that electrical difference is what translates to stored energy. The stated “chemistry” of a battery is its active cathode materials — lithium iron phosphate (LFP) or lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), for example. Active anode materials are typically carbon-based — like graphite powder or silicon oxide. The materials are mined, ground to a fine powder and then coated on the anode (usually copper foil).

AAAMP claims that it represents the only domestic manufacturers of active anode materials. Membership consists of Anovion Technologies (Georgia), Syrah Technologies (Louisiana), NOVONIX Anode Materials (Tennessee), Epsilon Advanced Materials 5060 (North Carolina) and SKI US/Birla Carbon (Georgia/South Carolina). Most of these companies are still considered startups. AAAMP claims in its petition that the domestic AAM industry is struggling to get off the ground because of China’s oversupply.

Next steps

Customs and Border Protection has been collecting CVD on imported AAM since May and will now begin collecting the AD duties, in addition to the existing 40.9% tariffs already imposed on lithium battery imports from China.

Commerce clarified that EVs and completed battery energy storage system containers for both utility-scale and residential applications are excluded from the scope of the investigation. But raw AAM, battery cells and battery modules are within the scope and subject to tariffs. Domestic battery manufacturers will feel the tariff burden while BESS importers will not.

Commerce should release its final determinations in September/October, and the ITC is expected to issue its final determination around Nov. 13.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Alvin-Texas-e-storage-csi-stock-UBS-Asset-Management-battery.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 12:05:56.941218

But clean transport advocates said the ""half-hearted"" proposals revealed a lack of courage.

The Expert Forum on Climate-Friendly Mobility and Infrastructure (EKMI) – which included representatives from think tanks, research, and transport associations – presented 33 measures to better align the transport sector with climate, economic and social goals, based on agreements reached in the new government's coalition treaty.

Germany's transport sector is often referred to as the country's ""problem child"" when it comes to climate action, as emissions have remained stubbornly high for years. The EKMI's task was to explore policy measures which the transport ministry could use in an ""emergency climate protection programme"" to ensure the country can reach its climate targets.

Their proposals included:

Boosting the electrification of private mobility, for example by introducing tax incentives for EVs, increasing price transparency at charging stations, and improving conditions for bidirectional charging.

Reducing emissions in road freight transport by extending the industrial power price to the transport industry, excepting low-emission trucks from tolls, and supporting hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. But the expert forum didn't reach a consensus on the climate contribution of European CO2 limits for trucks.

Keeping the flat-rate ""Germany ticket"" for local public transport, supporting cycling and walking funding programmes, and creating more park-and-ride and car sharing opportunities in rural areas.

Modernising rail infrastructure and establishing waterway infrastructure as being of ""overriding public interest"" to accelerate construction projects.

The group could not quantify the carbon-saving effect of implementing the measures, it said. The transport ministry is set to present its proposals for a climate-friendly transport sector to environment minister Carsten Schneider by mid-September. The environment ministry is working on a new climate protection programme with measures to put the country on track to reaching sustainability targets, which it aims to present by the end of 2025.

Clean transport association VCD said the report was based on the mistaken underlying assumption that emissions could be sufficiently reduced solely by incentivising clean technologies, without touching fossil fuel subsidies or undermining combustion engines.

""The Commission does not want to touch the climate-damaging tax privileges for company cars, diesel fuel and mileage allowances,"" said VCD head Michael Müller-Görnert. He also criticised that the experts stuck to the ""illusion"" of synthetic fuels. ""This thwarts transformation measures, costs taxpayers a lot of money and ultimately cements the fossil fuel world of yesterday.""

""Most of what the EKMI has come up with has been on the table for years. There is still no plan for how to implement all this,"" Müller-Görnert said.

The report noted that economic uncertainty has returned to levels not seen since the pandemic, driven by volatile U.S. trade policy.","What began as a promising year for the North American auto industry is now being overshadowed by aggressive U.S. trade policies, with new tariffs expected to drag down vehicle sales and disrupt production across the continent.

According to TD Economics’ North American Auto Outlook 2025, the U.S. administration’s sweeping 25 per cent tariffs on imported vehicles and parts are already reshaping the automotive landscape. While partial exemptions have been granted to Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., the broader impact is expected to be significant — especially if the tariffs remain in place through the end of the year.

TD forecasts a 4.0 per cent decline in U.S. vehicle sales and a sharper 7.5 per cent drop in Canada on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis. The report warns that rising vehicle prices, slower economic growth, and reduced affordability will weigh heavily on consumer demand.

The U.S. tariffs, introduced in April and May, apply to both vehicles and parts, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant content. Canada responded with its own 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. vehicles, though it has introduced a quota-based offset for automakers that produce domestically — a move that could soften the blow for companies like Toyota, Honda, and the Detroit Three, the report noted.

Still, the uncertainty surrounding trade policy is expected to stall investment and production decisions. Automakers are hesitant to commit to new U.S. facilities, especially with the 2028 election cycle looming and the possibility of policy reversals.

While a full reshoring of auto production to the U.S. is unlikely due to cost and complexity, TD said it expects a moderate shift in output toward underutilized U.S. capacity. Canada and Mexico, which export the majority of their vehicle production to the U.S., are likely to see declines unless they can pivot to other markets or boost domestic demand.

An example of this shift is General Motors’ recent decision to cut a shift at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant while increasing output at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, facility — a sign of how production strategies are already adapting.

Sales outlook

The report noted that 2025 was poised to be the first “normal” year for auto sales since 2019, following years of pandemic-related disruptions and high inflation. But the new trade environment has changed that outlook.

In the U.S., vehicle prices are expected to rise by thousands of dollars due to tariffs, while broader economic impacts from trade policy could slow GDP growth to 1.5 per cent — half the pace of 2024. In Canada, where the economy is more reliant on U.S. trade, growth is expected to fall below 1 per cent.

TD also observed that early-year sales were likely frontloaded as consumers rushed to buy before tariffs took full effect. A slowdown is expected in the second half of the year as higher prices filter through the market.

The report noted that economic uncertainty has returned to levels not seen since the pandemic, driven by volatile U.S. trade policy. If current tariffs remain in place, TD expects a contraction in vehicle sales and a gradual reorientation of production toward the U.S. — a shift that could reshape the North American auto industry for years to come.",https://www.autoserviceworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Cars-lot-dealer-used-new-for-sale-Depositphotos_45450351_S.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 12:06:06.833475

CHICAGO, July 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Cars.com Inc. (NYSE: CARS) (d/b/a “Cars Commerce Inc.”), an audience-driven technology company empowering the automotive industry, reveals how federal policy shifts are reshaping the new and used car market in its Industry Insights 1H Report. This comprehensive report draws on consumer demand data from Cars.com’s more than 29 million in-market shoppers and vehicle supply and pricing data from millions of new and used vehicles on its marketplace. It is also informed by Cars Commerce’s aggregated platform data, which includes 140 million monthly consumer intent signals from more than 7,000 retail dealer websites and supply data from across the company’s retail websites, trade and appraisal solution and wholesale auction platform, providing broad automotive insights on supply and demand.

“The SAAR spiked above 17 million in March and April, but that pace has slowed, signaling the pre-tariff buying activity has passed,” said David Greene, industry analyst at Cars Commerce. “With price hikes on many imports starting to emerge, the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set to expire in September, and the entry-priced segment now shrinking for three consecutive months, affordability remains the biggest challenge to continued growth. How automakers respond in the second half — through pricing, production and incentives — will shape the road ahead.”

On a positive note, average new vehicle prices have increased only slightly — just under $100 since January. New U.S.-built vehicle prices are down nearly $200 on average. According to Cars.com data, more than half of consumers say tariffs have influenced them to seek out American-made vehicles, and over 73% would consider buying U.S.-built vehicles to avoid added costs.1 As affordability concerns persist, consumers are turning to tools like Cars.com’s American-Made Index, which helps shoppers know which vehicles contribute most to the local economy.

Tariff-related pricing impact is a mixed bag and varies by country. Imports from the U.K., a segment that accounts for just 1% of available inventory, saw the most significant jump of more than $10,000. EU imports, which makes up approximately 5% of inventory, rose by almost $2,500. Meanwhile, prices fell for vehicles from China, Canada, and South Korea.

Entry-Level Vehicle Segments Are Shrinking

Inventory of new vehicles priced under $30,000 — the most tariff-sensitive segment — averaged 13.6% share in the first half of 2025. This is down significantly from 2019, when entry-level vehicles made up 38% of the market and reflects the third consecutive month of declines. With 92% of these vehicles built outside of the U.S., tariffs are disproportionately affecting this entry-level tier, which relies almost entirely on foreign-built vehicles. Only two models in this segment are built in the U.S. – the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla – while some are also produced in Japan. While overall new car units grew 5.6% year over year in the first half of 2025, the entry-level segment lagged behind at just 3.9% growth in the same time period.

The mid-range new car segment ($30,000 to $49,000) accounts for nearly half of all inventory — and within this tier, 50% of the vehicles are imported. Within the $70,000-plus new car segment, the share of imported vehicles increased from 40% in May to 41% in June, suggesting automakers are adjusting for less price-sensitive consumers.

EV Incentives Expiring as Prices Climb

EV buyers face their own deadline with roughly 75 days left to save thousands before the federal EV tax credit for new and used vehicles is set to expire. With the average new electric vehicle priced at $65,000 —the federal EV tax credit is up to $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used– is a critical factor in purchase decisions. According to a Cars.com survey, 53% of current EV owners cited the credit as one of the main reasons they purchased their vehicle, and 48% of current EV shoppers say the incentive is influencing their decision.2

Used Market Rebounds With More ‘Young’ Trade-Ins

Amid rising new-car prices, used car prices rose nearly 3% in H1 QoQ, reflecting changes in supply dynamics and continued demand for more affordable vehicle options. Used inventory increased 2% year over year in the first half of 2025, largely driven by a wave of trade-ins during the new-car buying jump in March and April, which was prompted by tariff-related concerns. This influx brought newer, lower-mileage vehicles into the used market, contributing to a faster turnover rate: the average time on dealer lots is down nearly 5% year over year.

Air pollution in Guangxi significantly worsened at the end of January with the start of the Spring Festival period.
Industrial relocation and the risk of air pollution The upsurge in air pollution reflects the migration of China’s coal-to-chemical and steel industries towards energy-rich regions in the south-west.","By Chengcheng Qiu

hina has had astonishing success improving its air quality since declaring a “war on pollution” in 2013. From 2014 to 2022, average levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) dropped faster than in any other country, according to the University of Chicago’s Air Quality Life Index. Last year, nearly three-quarters of the country’s cities had average PM2.5 levels below the national standard limit. Taken together, the level of PM2.5 in China’s cities was 36% lower than it had been in 2015. This success followed a range of measures including retrofitting coal power plants.

China’s efforts at managing air pollution have hitherto focused on the eastern parts of the country. The national air pollution action plan that the State Council issued in 2013 set PM2.5 targets for cities clustered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, and in the deltas of the Yangtze and Pearl rivers. In 2018 came another action plan, this time focussed on improving air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze Delta and the Fenwei Plain on the middle reaches of the Yellow River. (The Pearl River Delta had been dropped due to its long-term good compliance with the national standard.) These three regions all have an energy mix dominated by coal, and significant air pollution issues connected with heavy industry.

But while in the first quarter of 2025, eastern China’s overall air quality improved, pollution rose in provinces to the south and west of the country. PM2.5 levels in Guangxi, Yunnan and Xinjiang were substantially higher than a year earlier, at 32%, 14%, and 8% respectively.

Apart from time-limited weather factors in several southern regions, this is largely the result of heavy industry, such as steelmaking and coal processing, moving to the south and west of the country where energy is more abundant. What is needed to improve the situation is better integration of renewable power into the grid, the electrification of industrial processes that currently rely on coal, and the continued expansion of clean-energy generation.

The westward shift

In the first quarter of 2025, the average PM2.5 levels of China’s cities was down 5% year on year. Levels of major pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10 particulates – which correlate closely with industrial activity and fossil fuel use – declined or remained stable. However, in some provinces to the west and south, air pollution went up.

Guangxi, Yunnan and Hainan in particular experienced large increases, with PM2.5 levels growing by 32%, 14% and 11% respectively. Xinjiang, with an 8% rise and a yearly average level of 70 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³), took over from Henan as the province with the worst airborne particulates problem. Its PM2.5 measure is now double the national standard of 35 µg/m³ and 14 times the guideline value adopted by World Health Organisation (WHO).

During that quarter, PM2.5 levels rose year-on-year by 22.6% in Kunming, Yunnan and by 10.1% in Urumqi, Xinjiang. These increases were primarily driven by anthropogenic emissions rather than meteorological conditions, according our analysis at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). In Kunming, 11.9% of the rise was down to anthropogenic emissions and 10.7% to the weather. In Urumqi, the share was 9.2% versus 0.9%. Anthropogenic emissions were also primarily responsible for the 12.6% and 5% increases seen in the cities of Yinchuan, Ningxia, and Xi’an, Shaanxi, despite overall levels in both those provinces falling. In addition, while levels are down in traditional industrial regions such as Shanxi, north-east China, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, anthropogenic emissions continued to exert a positive pressure on pollution levels. This suggests pollution levels may still rise in these regions when weather conditions are slightly adverse.

Where is the pollution coming from?

Across western and southern China, three main factors have driven the recent upturn in air pollution: increased output from energy-intensive industries such as steel, non-ferrous metals, and coal-to-chemical processing in the region; firework displays to celebrate national festivals; and burning of crop stubble in springtime to clear fields ready for new planting.

In the east, meanwhile, there has been a contraction of heavily polluting, energy-intensive industrial production, though this has been partly countered by increased output in the coal-to-chemical sector, which exacerbates the risk of air pollution.

In the first quarter of 2025, western China’s output of crude steel, pig iron and 10 non-ferrous metals increased year-on-year by 6%, 11% and 4% respectively, indicates data from the National Bureau of Statistics. This is compared with a slight decline in eastern China, the only part of the country where all three industries contracted. Output from infrastructure-related industries, such as cement and glass, declined in both the east and the west.

In terms of the share of electricity supplied by coal and other thermal power, western China experienced the biggest drop, with a 5.5% decline, which is more than the national average. However, in some parts of central, southern, south-western and western China, the proportion of clean energy has gone down in the past few years, bucking the national trend. In provinces rich in renewable-energy resources, such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, coal power is expanding at a faster rate than clean energy. So, despite thermal power’s declining share of the energy mix, the overall energy transition is still not enough to offset the additional pollution from expanded production in the steel, non-ferrous metals and related industries.

China’s National Development and Reform Commission has added a cleaner method of steelmaking to its 2025 Catalogue of Encouraged Industries for Western China. This is the electric arc furnace “short-process” method, which uses electricity to produce crude steel from scrap steel. The long-process method, by contrast, produces pig iron from iron ore in blast furnaces fired by large quantities of coal. It emits far more carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter pollution.

In central and western China, steel production mostly uses the long-process method, possibly due to the abundance of ores and coal in these regions and relative lack of scrap steel. Notably, in western China the growth of pig iron output in the first quarter of this year is nearly double that of crude steel, as calculated using National Bureau of Statistics data. This growth mainly occurred in Ningxia, Guangxi, and the Fenwei Plain – regions considered part of western China when formulating economic development policies.

In the east, pig iron output dropped further than did crude steel, reflecting an overt shift towards energy efficiency and carbon reduction among steelmakers in the region, including the widespread adoption of the short-process method. However, it remains to be seen how long this trend will last and whether it can be consolidated.

In the west, output from conventional coal-to-chemical processing is likewise on the up. Construction is speeding up for both modern and conventional coal-to-chemical projects, driven by falling coal prices and pressure for energy security.

Growth of the conventional industry, typically in the form of coke production and coal gasification, is mainly concentrated in western and central China, with quarter one growth rates of 2% and 6% respectively.

More modern forms of coal-to-chemical processing, seen for example in the production of ethylene (a gas used especially in the manufacture of polythene) are prevalent in the east and central regions. The chemicals sector, being one of the few energy-intensive industries that is still growing, is itself a significant driver of air pollution.

Guangxi in focus

There have also been tradition-related challenges affecting air quality in the south. Air pollution in Guangxi significantly worsened at the end of January with the start of the Spring Festival period. This was due to intensive firework use coinciding with stagnant weather conditions that trapped the resulting smoke. Guangxi’s PM2.5 level for the first quarter of 2025, at 41 µg/m³, was its highest in at least three years.

Inadequate efforts to mitigate the impacts of these weather conditions, coupled with weak enforcement of regional firework bans and joint control measures, contributed to heavy pollution in the autonomous region. On 29 January, the first day of the Lunar New Year, three cities in Guangxi recorded heavy pollution; in Nanning, the PM2.5 hourly concentration peak reached 1,632 µg/m³ at one point, while in Yulin, the daily average concentration reached 428 µg/m³.

On 11 February, six counties in south-eastern Guangxi were questioned about the severe air pollution. The subsequent report stated that all six are traditional agricultural counties where pollution was caused by straw burning, scattered coal use and fireworks. Beyond these, other sources of widespread and persistent local pollution include the open burning of agricultural residue, excessive emissions from industrial facilities, and delays in ending the use of small coal-fired boilers, the report noted.

Updated policies on crop-stubble burning are also bringing new seasonal challenges. This year, China’s key policy statement for rural development, the No. 1 Central Document, replaced the blanket ban on burn-offs with a more flexible mechanism for “restricted burning”. Several provinces are now piloting “time-limited, zone-specific” conditions for the activity. Stubble burning during spring ploughing has become a major source of particulates, and there is an urgent need for stronger policy oversight.

Industrial relocation and the risk of air pollution

The upsurge in air pollution reflects the migration of China’s coal-to-chemical and steel industries towards energy-rich regions in the south-west.

In 2020, China began ramping up efforts to develop the western regions. Projects geared towards exploiting energy and resources in those regions were encouraged and prioritised for approval. Under the State Council’s employment-first strategy, announced in 2024, proposals were introduced for steadily steering capital-, technology- and labour-intensive industries into the heart of China’s central and western regions. Electricity for large-scale industrial use is cheaper in western China than in the east due to more favourable conditions for generating power from diverse renewable resources, giving the region a competitive advantage, as China Energy News has noted. Given that energy generally accounts for over 10% of costs in conventional energy-intensive industries, there is an obvious incentive to relocate westwards.

In March this year, as part of preparations for China’s 15th five-year plan for economic development (in 2026-2030), the National Energy Administration presented a new formulation: “power from the west of the country, utilised in the west of the country”. This is clearly aimed at nudging energy-intensive industries to cluster where renewable-energy resources are at their most plentiful. Furthermore, carbon and environmental costs are set to rise for the steel, cement and aluminium smelting industries as carbon markets expand, and this too could drive a westward shift in the corresponding sectors.

The outcome of industrial relocation is beginning to take shape. In the first two years of the 14th five-year plan period (for 2021-2025), the average growth rate for industrial added value in western China was 5.2 percentage points above the national average – far higher than in 2016-2020. Yunnan, with its abundant hydropower, has attracted aluminium smelting projects from across China. Meanwhile, Xinjiang leads nationally in terms of the growing capacity of its coal-to-chemical sector, having attracted nearly CNY 500 billion (USD 70 billion) of investment. That figure is expected to surpass CNY 1 trillion during the 15th five-year plan period.

As the wave of industrial relocation to western China gathers momentum, multiple challenges remain in realising the goal of clean power from the west, utilised in the west. Grid planning for western China currently focuses on large-scale outbound transmission, Yue Hao, a senior expert at State Grid Jibei Electric Power Company, told China Power Enterprise Management. As more energy-intensive industries congregate there, the regional power grid becomes increasingly difficult to operate, he added. Electricity demand in western China, rising rapidly and at a higher rate than the national average, is expected to peak later than in eastern China. This places additional stress on the capacity of western regions to absorb and coordinate the supply and demand of their own clean energy, Yue further noted.

The original purposes of moving energy-intensive industries westwards was to coordinate the development of clean energy with industry needs, reduce overall carbon intensity, and meet the policy requirement for synergies in “cutting pollution and reducing carbon”. However, this throws up challenges in terms of managing the environment of areas not designated as critical for pollution prevention.

Green transition as the strategic crux

The central government has shown how determined it is to further improve China’s air quality. It has set a target for lowering the average annual PM2.5 level to less than 25 µg/m³ by 2035, a significant tightening of the current national standard of 35 µg/m³. Achieving it would necessitate a fall of more than 10% against the national levels seen in 2024.

With air pollution trending upwards in areas not designated as crucial for pollution control, national countermeasures during the 2026-2030 period will need to address the spatial distribution of energy-intensive industries and ensure coordinated regional planning for industrial development and air-pollution control.

With particular emphasis on high-emission industries such as steel, coal-to-chemical and non-ferrous metals, this would mean promoting low-carbon technology adoption, advancing industrial electrification and accelerating the clean transition of energy systems. Eastern regions would also be supported to help restructure green-industrial chains in central and western China by exporting capital, technology and governance capability, thereby shaping an architecture of governance based on cross-regional coordination.

Air quality has become a significant indicator of a region’s capacity for high-quality development. It relates directly to industrial transformation, talent gathering and levels of public health, and shows how effectively a region is managing its manufacturing sector’s green transition. Good air quality reflects how well a region adapts to environmental constraints and indicates that the region’s economic development can be resilient and sustainable. Going forward, inter-regional competition for economic success no longer has to mean sacrificing the environment for growth. Green development should be the strategic crux instead, so as to realise the synergies between environmental improvement and economic growth.

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries’ long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam’s Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they’ve gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia’s growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia’s sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG math doesn’t add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they’re unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out … But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

The sale of BP Wind Energy North America Inc. to New York City-based LS Power consists of 1.3 gigawatts (GW) net capacity from 10 projects in operation.

Five of the projects are wholly owned by BP: the 44-megawatt (MW) Flat Ridge I and 470-MW Flat Ridge II in Kansas, the 288-MW Fowler Ridge I and 99-MW Fowler Ridge III in Indiana, and the 25-MW Titan in South Dakota.

In each of the other five, BP owns 50 percent: the 21-MW Auwahi in Hawaii, the 248-MW Cedar Creek II in Colorado, the 200-MW Fowler Ridge II in Indiana, the 125-MW Goshen II in Idaho and the 141-MW Mehoopany in Pennsylvania.

All 10 projects, which can generate up to 1.7 GW gross, are grid-connected and signed to 15 offtakers, according to a joint statement Friday.

To be managed under LS Power’s portfolio company Clearlight Energy, the projects would grow the purchaser’s operating fleet to about 4.3 GW, the statement said.

“LS Power will add bp’s US onshore wind business to an existing fleet of renewable, energy storage, flexible gas and renewable fuels assets, which comprise a 21GW operating portfolio and more than 780 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in operation as well as another 350+ miles currently under construction or development”, it said.

The parties expect to complete the transaction by year-end, subject to regulatory approvals. The price was not disclosed. Employees will transfer to the new owner.

LS Power chief executive Paul Segal said, “We are focused on a holistic approach to advancing American energy infrastructure that includes improving existing energy assets while investing in transformative strategies that make energy more efficient, affordable and available”.

“Well-located with well-structured contracts, these new assets will expand our renewable energy presence and help to meet growing energy demand across the US”, Segal added.

William Lin, BP executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy, said, “We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused bp, we will continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio to generate value”.

BP expects to achieve $3-4 billion of a target of $20 billion in divestment proceeds by 2027, part of a “reset” strategy that involves scaling down renewables investment and cutting costs. BP signed or completed $1.5 billion of divestments in the first quarter, according to the company.

Project Blue For Arizona Data Centers

The Board of Directors of The Chamber of Southern Arizona has voted to support Project Blue, a more than $3.6 billion project consisting of a three-phase data center development in the Tucson/Southern Arizona region. Project Blue’s technology campus is intended to help meet the massive demand for digital infrastructure in the United States.

Data centers are critical infrastructure and support Tucson’s major industries, enabling both day-to-day operations and long-term innovation in Aerospace & Defense, Bioscience & Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing & Mining Operations, Financial Services, Education & Research, Tourism, and all levels of government.

To be developed by Beale Infrastructure, the first proposed Primary Project site will be located at Pima County’s Southeast Employment and Logistics Center (SELC) on South Houghton Road. The Initial Phase of the Primary Project could be operational as soon as 2027. The Primary and Secondary Projects of Project Blue, if fully built, are projected to create more than four times the number of full-time permanent jobs as those estimated for the Initial Phase.

Beale Infrastructure will invest more than $100 million in privately funded reclaimed water infrastructure — making it the largest public infrastructure project funded by a private developer in Tucson’s history. This includes:

An 18-mile reclaimed waterline extension that will be over-sized in capacity, enabling Tucson Water to facilitate sustainable growth in southeast Tucson and convert existing customers that use drinking water to non-potable sources.

A new 30-acre aquifer recharge facility that will improve system-wide supply reliability and offer recreation benefits similar to the existing SHARP facility.

Project Blue will ultimately utilize 100% renewable water resources for industrial purposes and has committed to water positivity: 100% water replenishment.

Additionally, Project Blue will fund all Tucson Electric Power (TEP) grid upgrades completed for its direct benefit. The rates paid by Project Blue will cover all of TEP’s associated costs of service.

2026 MLS All-Star Game To Play In Charlotte, NC

In partnership with Major League Soccer and the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Governor Josh Stein announced that Charlotte, NC will host the 2026 Major League Soccer All-Star Game. This announcement was made possible by a new fund authorized by the legislature and offered by the Department of Commerce – the Major Events, Games, and Attractions Fund. A grant of $2,028,950 will support the Charlotte Sports Foundation and other local partners as they host this major sporting event in 2026.

In addition to supporting Charlotte’s bid for the 2026 Major League Soccer All-Star Game, earlier in the year the Major Events, Games, and Attractions Fund provided a $2 million grant to the City of Winston-Salem in support of the NASCAR Clash race held February 2 at Bowman Gray Stadium. The fund also provided a $1.65 million grant to Richmond County in support of the NASCAR Xfinity, ARCA, and Truck series races held at the Rockingham Speedway in April.

The Commerce Department’s Major Events, Games, and Attractions Fund was created as part of a law passed in 2023 that established sports betting in the state (Session Law 2023-42/House Bill 347). Wager activities are subject to a state tax, with 30 percent of the annual revenues from these taxes earmarked to support the Major Events Fund. Local governments and locally authorized organizing committees apply for grants from the fund, which then reimburses qualified expenses incurred in both securing and executing a major event.

In Northwest Ohio, Grants Grow Small Businesses

Six small businesses across northwest Ohio received funding assistance in the second quarter of 2025 to help support their growing operations. The JobsOhio Small Business Grant provided funding toward these projects in the amount of $175,000, retaining or creating more than 225 jobs.

The companies, spread across this 17-county region, received assistance through the grant which provides support for companies planning an eligible investment and are able to demonstrate how the program is instrumental in moving the project forward. The Regional Growth Partnership, as the lead economic development organization serving 17 counties of northwest Ohio, has helped facilitate grant assistance through JobsOhio to communities and small businesses.

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG math doesn't add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out ... But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

CHICAGO, July 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cars.com Inc. (NYSE: CARS) (d/b/a ""Cars Commerce Inc.""), an audience-driven technology company empowering the automotive industry, reveals how federal policy shifts are reshaping the new and used car market in its Industry Insights 1H Report. This comprehensive report draws on consumer demand data from Cars.com's more than 29 million in-market shoppers and vehicle supply and pricing data from millions of new and used vehicles on its marketplace. It is also informed by Cars Commerce's aggregated platform data, which includes 140 million monthly consumer intent signals from more than 7,000 retail dealer websites and supply data from across the company's retail websites, trade and appraisal solution and wholesale auction platform, providing broad automotive insights on supply and demand.

""The SAAR spiked above 17 million in March and April, but that pace has slowed, signaling the pre-tariff buying activity has passed,"" said David Greene, industry analyst at Cars Commerce. ""With price hikes on many imports starting to emerge, the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set to expire in September, and the entry-priced segment now shrinking for three consecutive months, affordability remains the biggest challenge to continued growth. How automakers respond in the second half — through pricing, production and incentives — will shape the road ahead.""

On a positive note, average new vehicle prices have increased only slightly — just under $100 since January. New U.S.-built vehicle prices are down nearly $200 on average. According to Cars.com data, more than half of consumers say tariffs have influenced them to seek out American-made vehicles, and over 73% would consider buying U.S.-built vehicles to avoid added costs.1 As affordability concerns persist, consumers are turning to tools like Cars.com's American-Made Index, which helps shoppers know which vehicles contribute most to the local economy.

Tariff-related pricing impact is a mixed bag and varies by country. Imports from the U.K., a segment that accounts for just 1% of available inventory, saw the most significant jump of more than $10,000. EU imports, which makes up approximately 5% of inventory, rose by almost $2,500. Meanwhile, prices fell for vehicles from China, Canada, and South Korea.

Entry-Level Vehicle Segments Are Shrinking

Inventory of new vehicles priced under $30,000 — the most tariff-sensitive segment — averaged 13.6% share in the first half of 2025. This is down significantly from 2019, when entry-level vehicles made up 38% of the market and reflects the third consecutive month of declines. With 92% of these vehicles built outside of the U.S., tariffs are disproportionately affecting this entry-level tier, which relies almost entirely on foreign-built vehicles. Only two models in this segment are built in the U.S. – the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla – while some are also produced in Japan. While overall new car units grew 5.6% year over year in the first half of 2025, the entry-level segment lagged behind at just 3.9% growth in the same time period.

The mid-range new car segment ($30,000 to $49,000) accounts for nearly half of all inventory — and within this tier, 50% of the vehicles are imported. Within the $70,000-plus new car segment, the share of imported vehicles increased from 40% in May to 41% in June, suggesting automakers are adjusting for less price-sensitive consumers.

EV Incentives Expiring as Prices Climb

EV buyers face their own deadline with roughly 75 days left to save thousands before the federal EV tax credit for new and used vehicles is set to expire. With the average new electric vehicle priced at $65,000 —the federal EV tax credit is up to $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used– is a critical factor in purchase decisions. According to a Cars.com survey, 53% of current EV owners cited the credit as one of the main reasons they purchased their vehicle, and 48% of current EV shoppers say the incentive is influencing their decision.2

Used Market Rebounds With More 'Young' Trade-Ins

Amid rising new-car prices, used car prices rose nearly 3% in H1 QoQ, reflecting changes in supply dynamics and continued demand for more affordable vehicle options. Used inventory increased 2% year over year in the first half of 2025, largely driven by a wave of trade-ins during the new-car buying jump in March and April, which was prompted by tariff-related concerns. This influx brought newer, lower-mileage vehicles into the used market, contributing to a faster turnover rate: the average time on dealer lots is down nearly 5% year over year.

Should you rush to get solar panels before the tax credit expires?","A big federal tax credit for homeowners who get solar panels will end this year, meaning a window for significant savings on going solar is closing fast.

The 30% credit has long been the biggest single incentive for residential solar panel adoption, and its expiration is a significant blow for what has been a fast-growing industry. For homeowners, its elimination significantly changes the calculus of whether solar panels make financial sense compared with paying utility electrical rates. ""It's clear that as a result of this bill that we're going to see electricity bills spike all around the country,"" Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, said in an interview.

The residential clean energy credit, which provided taxpayers who bought solar panels using cash or a loan with a credit of up to 30% of the system's cost, expires at the end of 2025. It had previously been expected to run for nearly another decade, but congressional Republicans voted to end it early in a major tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed this month.

Can solar panels save you money?

Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we’ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.

For now, the end-of-year deadline means there will be a rush by consumers who want to go solar to get their systems installed and operational before 2026. Considering it can take months to get a system installed and connected to the grid -- and that installers will likely see a rush of clients that could drag things out -- experts suggested acting quickly if the tax credit is a must-have.

""If a homeowner is interested in going solar, they need to start the process right now,"" Walker said.

What happened to the solar tax credit?

The residential clean energy credit, which covers things like home batteries and geothermal heat pumps in addition to solar panels, has been around in some form or another since George W. Bush was president. The latest extension and expansion of it came in 2022 when President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. Congressional Republicans and President Trump saw the credit and other spending authorized by the IRA as a target for elimination this year to help pay for an extension of 2017's tax cuts in what Trump called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

This credit and a few others will be eliminated effective 2026, but other credits, including one that applies to companies that offer residential solar leases and power purchase agreements, will be phased out over the following years.

Walker said the energy policy changes in the latest legislation will likely lead to higher electric bills, because it discourages the development of clean energy like wind and solar -- the easiest and fastest way to get power on the grid. This comes at the same time that data centers for artificial intelligence are sucking up more and more energy.

With the current energy environment and the need for more generation, more energy efficiency and more energy independence, now isn't the time to scale back incentives, said Zach Pierce, head of policy at the nonprofit Rewiring America. ""This preemptive phasedown of these common-sense tax credits is a self-inflicted setback,"" he told me. ""These are the exact investments we should be leaning into, not preemptively eliminating.""

Should you rush to get solar panels before the tax credit expires?

A solar panel system can cost you tens of thousands of dollars, even with 30% off, thanks to the government. Don't feel like the disappearance of the credit is reason enough to go solar. But if you were already considering getting solar panels and you weren't sure whether you'd do it this year or next year, the credit's expiration may mean you want to act sooner.

One unanswered question is exactly what constitutes having a system installed by the end of the year. Does that mean panels are on the roof and sending electrons to an inverter and battery, or does it mean the system has been approved to interconnect to the grid? Waiting on interconnection can add more time, meaning it's even more important to act quickly, Walker said. Until more guidance on the tax change comes from the Internal Revenue Service, that's probably what you should assume, she said.

""Our best guidance right now is to have your system interconnected by the end of the year because that's the safest bet,"" she said.

There are also leases and PPAs, in which a third-party company owns the panels on your house and you either pay a monthly payment or a per-kilowatt-hour rate for the energy, respectively. For those systems, the credit expires in 2028, but it's the company that claims those credits, not you. Walker said those companies often have not been passing those savings down to consumers anyway.

The most important thing is not to rush too much. The solar industry has a problem with bad actors and questionable companies, and a brief gold rush like this might bring more out of the woodwork. Even though there is urgency, Walker said homeowners shouldn't rush and should still get multiple quotes and read the fine print.

What other tax credits are changing?

Other energy-related tax credits are also being eliminated sooner than planned.

The energy-efficient home improvement credit, which covers things like insulation and heating and cooling systems, also expires after this year. Rewiring America has resources available with details on how the credits are changing and how to take advantage of them.

States and utilities also have similar rebate programs, so the hit to your wallet from losing the federal credit is mitigated a bit. Still, if you're in the market for home energy efficiency changes, consider moving quickly. ""If you've been thinking about upgrading an appliance, now is the time as we get into the fall,"" Pierce said.

Energy efficiency incentives and programs can insulate you not just from the heat and cold, but from rising energy costs. ""Energy efficiency and insulation in the home, if you can afford it and find ways to overcome that up-front cost barrier, is pretty much a no-regrets thing,"" Pierce said.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/b283af51c5159ddfc82f28a0259a5bbde285720d/hub/2025/07/17/bec7580a-458b-43c7-aa18-4ffaa1aa8f4c/gettyimages-2224667276.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,N,,2025-07-18 10:10:02.410642

California Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom’s presidential aspirations are Washington’s worst-kept secret. More than three years before the next election, he’s on the campaign trail in South Carolina, protesting immigration raids on cannabis farms and even politicizing the Second Family’s visit to Disneyland.

Before Newsom gets anywhere near Washington, he must ""confront his California problem,"" as even Politico observed. Blessed with incredible natural resources, the Golden State has the highest living costs in the nation. Nowhere is this trend more evident than in energy, where there is a direct correlation between Newsom’s wrong-headed policies and overall unaffordability.

Here are three examples.

SOUTH CAROLINA GOP URGES TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO GIVE GAVIN NEWSOM A 'HUGE SOUTHERN WELCOME'

California gas taxes are going up

At $4.51 per gallon, California drivers already pay the most at the pump — that’s 45% higher than the national average, which hit a four-year low during the recent Independence Day holiday and kept dropping.

As bad as that sounds, the pain is only just beginning. On July 1, motorists were hit with another 1.6-cent gas tax, and overall gas taxes are expected to cost the average household $612 over the course of the year. A separate $0.05-$0.09 tax increase is expected not far behind. Newsom’s office touted the decline in gas prices by issuing a press release bragging about it.

California refineries are closing

Sadly, the latest gas tax could pale in comparison to other factors. Industry experts are projecting a gallon of gas potentially reaching $8 in the aftermath of California refinery closures.

GAVIN NEWSOM IS MAKING A STRATEGIC VISIT TO A KEY PRIMARY STATE, RAISING EYEBROWS

For crude oil to become a usable petroleum product like gasoline, it must go through the refining process. Earlier this year, the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles and the Valero refinery in Benicia announced plans to close by 2026, taking nearly 20% of the state’s total gasoline production with them, not to mention hundreds of jobs.

The trend is part of a sad and steady decline directly attributed to increasing red tape and regulations. During the 1980s, under the presidential administration of its former governor Ronald Reagan, California had as many as 43 operating refineries, a number that plummeted to just 14 last year, a drop of 67%. This is not for lack of resources. In fact, California has the fifth most oil reserves in the nation, outpacing places like Colorado and Oklahoma more often associated with the industry.

California is home to extreme green policies

Newsom has denigrated the oil and gas industry as the ""polluted heart of this climate crisis."" He accused them of ""lying and gouging Californians"" and blamed them for ""more kids getting asthma.""

Along the way, he pursued policies aimed at making his state ""carbon neutral"" by 2045. That’s political speak for ending oil and gas entirely in favor of ""cleaner"" forms of energy like wind and solar, which are unreliable, untested and often rely on products from China (where roughly 80% of the world’s solar panels are manufactured).

STEVE HILTON: GAVIN NEWSOM'S $9 GAS NIGHTMARE LOOMS OVER THE GOLDEN STATE

A lynchpin of Newsom’s scheme was forcing drivers into electric vehicles. By 2035, less than a decade from now, 100% of vehicles sold in California were to be electric under a Newsom administration mandate that the U.S. Senate thankfully overturned in May.

As painful as the edict would have been for California’s nearly 40 million residents, the shockwaves were set to extend far and wide. As many as 13 states were on a track to follow where California was leading.

NEWSOM DEBUTS RAPID-RESPONSE WEBSITE AS CRITICS ACCUSE HIM OF PRIORITIZING PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS

To his political credit, Newsom appears aware of the unpopularity of some of his policies. He went on Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk’s podcast and turned heads by calling the concept of biological men competing in women’s sports ""unfair,"" but that demonstrates the power the green movement.

Newsom is far more likely to flip-flop on cultural issues than admit the green agenda is failing his state. In the aftermath of President Donald Trump making the rollback of the EV mandates official, Newsom’s administration immediately took legal action and signed an executive order ""doubling down"" (his words) on his commitment to the nonsensical plan.

At the heart of the dissatisfaction with the Biden years was inflation and high costs of living, making it the top priority for more than six in 10 voters. Making energy expensive made life expensive and Americans could not afford another four years of Biden/Harris energy policies. Newsom’s stubborn commitment to the failed green agenda, which has failed California spectacularly, should send his White House bid sputtering before it gets out of the starting gates.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/thanks.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:01:51.112715

Special preference will be given to projects that are at least 90% located on agricultural land contaminated by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The chemicals are toxic to humans, even in trace amounts, and have contaminated dozens of farms across the state.

“By prioritizing projects on PFAS-contaminated agricultural land, we’re helping communities turn environmental challenges into opportunities for sustainable development and cost savings for ratepayers,” commission Chair Philip L. Bartlett II said in a written statement.

The move follows a 2023 law that called for renewable energy to be generated on contaminated farmland in an effort to restore the land’s value and provide new revenue opportunities for landowners. The law was amended during the last legislative session with procedural changes, including a requirement that the commission only approve contracts it finds likely to produce more benefits to ratepayers than additional costs.

The commission aims to procure up to about 1.6 million megawatt-hours in electric generation throughout the lifetime of any contracts awarded. Contracts will be for 20 years, but the commission has the right to offer longer terms if deemed useful.

All told, that’s enough electricity to power up to roughly 2.9 million Maine homes for a month, based on an average usage of 550 kilowatt-hours per month.

“The commission shall select only eligible resources or combined projects that will benefit ratepayers,” the RFP stipulates. “Only those benefits that reduce the cost of energy supply or delivery in a quantifiable way will be considered.”

Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office, praised the RFP and said the projects that come from it should help drive down Mainers’ energy costs.

“Quickly locking in these projects will reduce Maine’s reliance on fossil fuels, build energy affordability and security for the future, and create good jobs and investment in Maine,” Burgess said in a written statement.

The requested projects would produce roughly 13% of the state’s energy needs, the office said.

Last month, Gov. Janet Mills signed a new law codifying her administration’s goal of procuring 100% clean energy by 2040. Of that, 90% must come from renewables.

But then his successor, Ronald Reagan, shut down that process, going so far as to rip the solar panels off the White House roof.

China installed almost 100 solar panels a second in May, smashing its record.","The era of federal support for an energy transition, supposed to last a decade under the Inflation Reduction Act, will mostly come to a close on New Year’s Eve, when the cost of clean energy projects could rise by a third or more. This raises a question. Since the big domestic policy bill that was recently passed cut the knees out from under federal support for sun, wind and batteries, how long will that dark age last and how much damage will it do?

One potential answer — a foreboding one — comes from the 1980s. In one of his final budgets, President Jimmy Carter proposed funding to help America get 20 percent of its energy from the sun by 2000. But then his successor, Ronald Reagan, shut down that process, going so far as to rip the solar panels off the White House roof. It took more than 35 years to get us back on track, with the passage of the I.R.A. in 2022 under President Joe Biden.

Yet even though the damage from the congressional action will be very deep, it almost certainly won’t last as long this time. And that’s for two reasons.

For one, it wasn’t until 1988, Mr. Reagan’s last year in office, that the scientist James Hansen turned global warming into a political issue by declaring before Congress that there was an irrefutable connection between greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in the earth’s temperatures. The Trump administration scoffs at climate science, of course, but events will continue to make it relevant. Some will be sharp and shocking, like the Texas floods this month that drew their power from the kind of epic rainfall that a warmer atmosphere makes more likely. And some will be more grinding: the insurance crisis that has already begun to spread beyond California and Florida.

But the real difference between now and the 1980s is price. Back then, the solar cell capable of converting the sun’s energy into power was a relatively new invention, found mainly in calculators and wristwatches. Mr. Carter intended to drive the price down so that the cells would become more widely applicable. That eventually happened, but not because of the United States. Two decades later, wise policies in places like Germany and China touched off an engineering miracle that improved the technology and has lowered the cost of solar panels 99 percent since 1980. For the past three or four years we’ve lived on a planet where the cheapest way to generate energy is to point a sheet of glass at the sun.

The world also now has great ways to use that electricity: the electric vehicle and the electric bike to get around, the heat pump to warm or cool your home, the induction cooktop to replace the open gas flame in your kitchen. We’re at the point where human beings could dispense with burning fossil fuels, sparing us from not only the worst of the climate crisis but also the roughly nine million deaths a year that come with breathing the pollution from all that combustion. We would save money — most estimates of the cost of the recent legislation include more than $100 a year in extra electricity costs for American families, because we stay dependent on natural gas.

Rational decision makers around the world have noticed the possibilities. Last year almost 96 percent of new electricity generation globally came from sun and wind technologies and batteries. India, where coal-fired power declined 3 percent in the first half of the year, announced on Monday that it had met its 2030 goal of providing half its electric capacity from renewables five years early. China installed almost 100 solar panels a second in May, smashing its record. Even Poland, the heart of the European lignite belt, got more of its electricity from renewables in May than from coal.

You would say this is good news — unless you owned an oil or gas company, or a coal mine. Then you’d understand it as a threat to your business model, and if you lived in a country that allowed essentially unlimited political expenditures, you might try to use your existing cash flow to game the system.

You may recall that during his campaign President Trump reportedly told the country’s oil barons that if they donated $1 billion to help elect him, they could get a lot of what they wanted; in the end, they spent nearly half a billion in donations, lobbying and advertising during the election cycle, and that, apparently, was enough to very nearly win them carte blanche. Not only is the administration removing environmental regulations on oil and gas drilling and pulling the funding from anything remotely green, it’s also using the threat of tariffs to bully countries into buying America’s natural gas. It’s an all-out effort to slow down an inevitable transition.

I believe it is inevitable that our country will eventually follow the rest of the world and that in 40 or so years, America will run mainly on sun and wind. The problem, though, is that if it takes us anything like 40 years, then the world that runs on sun and wind will be catastrophically hot. Already the jet stream is bending and faltering, accounting for some of our erratic weather, and the Gulf Stream has begun to weaken, which could mean rapid rises in sea level along our shores. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change advised that we cut global emissions in half by 2030 to stay on anything like the path we set in the Paris climate talks, and we are far off that path.

And so people who care about climate change need to rouse themselves from understandable despair and make a new stand. Some of us are busy organizing a nationwide event called SunDay on Sept. 21. There will be electric-vehicle parades and solar-powered concerts, ribbon cuttings at solar farms — and protests at city halls and state houses demanding that they take the lead in shifting policies to make the energy transition easier. There’s an enormous amount that can be done, in red states as well as blue. (Texas leads the country in clean energy installation; Utah this winter became the first state in the nation to permit “balcony solar,” the small-scale units that hang from the verandas of millions of European apartments.)

The goal of all this work is to drive home the key message: Sun and wind are no longer “alternative energy” but the obvious path forward. And this effort can succeed, because of the force of economic gravity that is finally on the side of clean energy and because polls show that many people — despite every effort of the MAGA right — continue to love the idea of solar power. Whether or not we can move fast enough to change the eventual temperature of the planet is an open question, and our chances have clearly suffered a real setback. But given the stakes of the wager, doing what we can to shift the odds is clearly our job.

When Mr. Carter put those solar panels up on the White House roof, he hoped it would be “one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.” We still have, for a little while longer, the same choice. Now we need to shake off our weariness and summon the public passion to make it unavoidable.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/18/opinion/18McKibben/18McKibben-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:48:41.906615

""The refund for the nuclear PTC amount is equivalent to $53.83 for an average residential customer over the 12-month period,"" said Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart. She said it will be a separate, identified line item on the customers' bills.

Commission Chairman Randy Christmann voted for the credit. But he said the whole idea of providing production tax credits for existing nuclear power plants made no sense.

In a world where EVs are reshaping industries and geopolitics, the U.S. graphite market is no longer a niche sector—it's a battleground.","The U.S. graphite industry is undergoing a seismic shift as trade policies and geopolitical tensions converge to reshape the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain. At the center of this transformation is Westwater Resources (WWR), a company poised to capitalize on a newly protected domestic market for battery-grade graphite. With tariffs on Chinese imports soaring to 160% and a strategic pivot toward self-sufficiency, the stage is set for U.S. producers like Westwater to redefine their role in the global EV battery ecosystem.

The Tariff Catalyst: A 160% Wall Against Chinese Imports

The U.S. Department of Commerce's imposition of a 93.5% anti-dumping duty on Chinese graphite, combined with existing tariffs, has created an effective 160% tax on imports. This move, driven by allegations of unfair subsidies and dumping, is a direct response to China's dominance in the graphite market—accounting for 78% of natural graphite production and over 90% of battery-grade processing. For EV manufacturers and battery suppliers, this means a dramatic spike in material costs: analysts estimate an additional $7 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells, a burden that could erode margins for companies reliant on Chinese inputs.

While Tesla and Panasonic have publicly opposed the tariffs, citing the U.S. lack of a robust domestic graphite industry, the policy has inadvertently created a vacuum that companies like Westwater are rushing to fill. The stock price of WWR has surged 15% since the announcement, reflecting investor optimism about the company's potential to scale production and capture market share in a newly protected environment.

Westwater's Strategic Edge: From Alabama to the EV Supply Chain

Westwater's Kellyton Graphite Plant in Alabama is the linchpin of its strategy. The facility, now 85% equipped for Phase I, aims to produce 12,500 metric tons of coated spherical purified graphite (CSPG) annually by 2028, with plans to expand to 50,000 metric tons. This output is critical for EV battery anodes, where purity and performance are non-negotiable. The company has already secured off-take agreements with SK On (a key supplier to Ford, Hyundai, and Volkswagen) and Stellantis, ensuring a stable demand pipeline.

What sets Westwater apart is its vertical integration. The Coosa Graphite Deposit in Alabama provides a domestic source of flake graphite, reducing reliance on foreign imports and aligning with U.S. government incentives for critical mineral production. The Kellyton plant's ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications further underscore its commitment to quality and sustainability, traits increasingly demanded by EV manufacturers.

Navigating Risks and Rewards

Despite its strategic advantages, Westwater faces significant challenges. The company reported a net loss of $2.676 million for Q1 2025, with cash reserves declining to $3.262 million. Securing the $150 million debt facility to complete Phase I remains a critical hurdle, and delays in financing could strain operations. Additionally, the company's levered free cash flow (TTM) is -$8.75 million, highlighting its current burn rate.

However, the risk-reward calculus is compelling. The U.S. government's “Make More in America” initiative, including a letter of interest from the Export-Import Bank, offers a lifeline. If Westwater can finalize its debt financing and ramp up production, it could become a cornerstone of the domestic EV supply chain. The Kellyton plant's projected internal rate of return (IRR) of 31.8% for Phase II, as outlined in its feasibility study, further validates the long-term economic potential.

A Protected Market and Policy Tailwinds

The U.S. is not merely reacting to China's dominance—it is actively building a policy framework to insulate its supply chains. The Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for EVs using domestic materials, coupled with updated Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes to track battery components, signal a sustained commitment to reshoring. Westwater's alignment with these policies positions it to benefit from both financial incentives and regulatory tailwinds.

Critically, the U.S. is also pushing for international collaboration to standardize battery supply chain tracking. This effort, led by agencies like the Department of Energy, will create a more transparent and resilient market, further boosting the value of companies like Westwater that prioritize traceability and sustainability.

Investment Outlook: A High-Stakes Bet with Long-Term Payoff

For investors, Westwater represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. The company's ability to execute on its capital-intensive plans and secure off-take agreements will determine its success. However, the combination of a protected market, strategic partnerships, and a favorable policy environment makes it an attractive candidate for those with a long-term horizon.

The key metrics to monitor include:

1. Debt Facility Closure: A successful $150 million secured loan would accelerate Phase I completion.

2. Production Milestones: Scaling to 12,500 metric tons of CSPG by 2028 is critical for profitability.

3. Policy Developments: Updates on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credit eligibility for domestically produced graphite.

In a world where EVs are reshaping industries and geopolitics, the U.S. graphite market is no longer a niche sector—it's a battleground. Westwater Resources, with its Alabama-based operations and strategic partnerships, is uniquely positioned to thrive in this new reality. For investors willing to navigate the company's current financial challenges, the payoff could be substantial as the U.S. charts a path toward energy independence.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-18 15:46:03.824494

The newspaper explains that the move “threatens to trip up the approval process as wind and solar projects race to begin construction by a deadline next July to qualify for tax credits, which have been gutted by Trump’s signature ‘one big beautiful bill’”. Under the new process, any wind and solar projects being built on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by interior secretary Doug Burgum, according to the Associated Press. Renewable-energy companies pointed out that the move was at odds with Trump’s goal to slash excessive regulations and boost domestic energy, Reuters notes. The newswire says that “most US solar and wind facilities are built on private land because, historically, it has been costlier and more time-consuming to permit projects on federal lands”, although it adds that the previous Biden administration had sought to make it easier. Bloomberg says the new action “follows a deal struck with members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus” over subsidies for renewables in exchange for their support for Trump’s budget bill. Meanwhile, CNN has a piece titled “how the renewable energy industry lost a massive lobbying fight over Trump’s agenda bill”. The Hill explores “why Republicans voted for the megabill despite threats to local green jobs”. Bloomberg covers new analysis from BloombergNEF that finds US annual clean-energy installations will drop 41% after 2027, “due to the rapid phase-out of wind and solar tax credits in president Donald Trump’s sweeping economic legislation”. Meanwhile, US solar panel manufacturers have asked the federal government to impose tariffs on imports from Indonesia, India and Laos, “accusing companies there of dumping cheap goods in the market to undercut new American factories”, Reuters reports.

The Republican-controlled Senate has approved the White House request to cut $9bn for foreign aid and public media, slashing support for overseas clean energy projects, Semafor reports. The package has since been approved by the House of Representatives and will go to Trump to be signed into law, Reuters says.

Trump has granted two years of relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries from Biden-era regulations that he considers “overly burdensome”, the Associated Press reports.

The US has imposed tariffs of 93.5% on graphite – an “essential ingredient for batteries” that is largely sourced from China – placing “an additional cost on electric-vehicle manufacturers”, according to the New York Times.

The Trump administration’s defence spending boost will produce an extra 26 megatonnes of greenhouse gases, equivalent to the annual emissions of Croatia, according to the research covered by the Guardian.

Mining executives and former officials have “voiced concerns” about the “China-style” US government deal to buy into MP Materials, the nation’s only producing rare earth minerals company, the Financial Times says.

Monsoon rains in Pakistan’s Punjab province have killed at least 63 people and injured nearly 300 in the space of 24 hours, according to provincial officials quoted by Reuters. This brings the death toll from the extreme weather up to at least 159 since late June, the newswire says. It adds that the impact of monsoon rains in Pakistan has “worsened in recent years due to rapid urban expansion, poor drainage systems and more frequent extreme weather events linked to climate change”. Victims were “crushed by collapsing buildings… drowned or were electrocuted”, according to BBC News. Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper reports that prime minister Shehbaz Sharif made an explicit link between the rainfall and climate change in a visit to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). “Pakistan contributes minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions, but ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity to build a climate-resilient nation,” Sharif said, according to the newspaper. The Associated Press also has the story.

In the New York Times Climate Forward newsletter, David Gelles talks to his colleagues around the world about the extreme heat they are experiencing.

The Brazilian chamber of deputies – its lower house – has approved a bill to “ease environmental licensing” in a move widely considered “the nation’s most significant environmental setback in nearly 40 years”, Mongabay reports. The law, which NGOs have dubbed the “devastation bill”, changes several rules in the environmental licensing framework, “which is mandatory for all enterprises that use natural resources and may cause damage to the environment or local communities”, the article explains. The outlet adds that the law also creates a special environmental license for infrastructure projects deemed “strategic” by the federal government, “such as oil exploration on the Amazon coast”. Brazilian newspaper Folha de S Paulo says the move comes “amid silence” from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s administration – “even after appeals from the environmental wing, led by minister Marina Silva, for the bill to be rejected”. Reuters describes the bill as a “potential blow” to Lula as he “seeks to burnish his country’s green credentials” ahead of hosting the COP30 climate summit later this year. Among other things, civil society groups tell the Guardian that the bill will drive deforestation and threaten Indigenous communities.

The National Energy Agency (NEA) has said that the electricity load in China exceeded 1,500 gigawatts (GW) on Wednesday, with extreme heat across many parts of the country contributing to “record high” power demand for the “third time this month”, Reuters reports. It adds that extreme temperatures, which were thought to “reach as high as 50C” in some places, have “enveloped an area home to over 200 million people”. The newswire also notes that, at the provincial level, temperature records have been “broken 36 times” since the start of summer. Chinese news outlets BJX News, International Energy Net and CCTV also cover the NEA announcement.

President Xi Jinping questioned the “need for local governments…to crowd into the same emerging industries”, such as electric vehicles (EV), Bloomberg reports.

China will address “irrational competition” in its EV sector, according to Bloomberg coverage of a recent State Council meeting.

Xue Lan, dean of Tsinghua University’s influential Schwarzman College, writes in the China Daily that the “idea that China ‘wins’ when the US ‘loses’ in climate action is a geopolitical mirage”.

New research finds Chinese investment in “energy-related” projects under the ​​Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2025 was the “highest…since the BRI’s inception”, the Financial Times reports.

Xinhua reports that the number of patents China is granting for new “green and low-carbon technologies” has grown at an average of 19% per year since 2020.

The UK’s biggest clean-energy investors have “accused the Reform UK party of undermining the national interest” by threatening to remove public subsidies from renewables if it wins the next general election, the Guardian reports. The newspapers quote industry leaders who say such action would risk “thousands of green jobs and could push up energy bills for homes and businesses by making the UK more reliant on volatile global gas markets”. This comes after Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, gave “formal notice” to developers that the party would axe any deals struck in the upcoming renewables subsidy auction, known as allocation round 7 (AR7), this summer. The letter explicitly says “we will seek to strike down all contracts signed under AR7”. Despite this, Tice appears to have immediately backtracked when pressed on the issue in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s PM. He tells the programme: “I think some people may have misread the wording of the letter…A legally binding contract is a legally binding contract.” Meanwhile, Energy Monitor reports that the UK government has announced reforms for the AR7 “contracts for difference” subsidy scheme. This includes extending the contract terms for offshore wind, onshore wind and solar projects from 15 to 20 years, in a move the outlet says “is designed to distribute costs over a more extended period for consumers while providing increased certainty for investors”.

UK households with heat pumps could receive around £200 off their annual energy bills under new plans reportedly backed by energy secretary Ed Miliband, according to the Daily Express.

UK energy supplier OVO Energy plans to launch a new renewable energy arm to modernise ageing onshore wind farms, prolong their lifespan and boost output, Reuters says.

The Conservative party wants to end the “absurd” blocking of new nuclear power sites by “NIMBYs” through environmental impact assessments and regulations on habitats, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Another Daily Telegraph story reports that Miliband has “taken a bet on nuclear fusion one day powering Britain” by making it easier to build new reactors with minimal planning restrictions.

The Guardian has launched a new series profiling the climate plans of the world’s 10 highest-emitting countries. “Every climate summit is crucial but COP30 is taking place during extremely challenging times,” the newspaper’s environment team writes, in an article introducing the new series. It continues: “So we thought it was a good time to take a look at the world’s biggest emitting countries and their plans – constructive or otherwise – for addressing their carbon emissions. Some are autocracies, some democracies tumbling towards right-wing populism, some are straining to hold together a consensus on climate action.” Over the coming weeks, the newspaper will cover Russia, South Korea, India, the US, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, Japan, and Indonesia. (Carbon Brief has country profiles of nearly all of these nations.) As part of this series, the Guardian’s environment editor Fiona Harvey has an article about “how we can negotiate with autocracies” on climate change. She notes that “the bulk of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from countries that are not democratic”, as do much of the world’s fossil fuels. She adds: “The power over the planet wielded by a small number of autocratic states is greater than ever. Their actions could effectively determine whether the world succeeds in limiting global heating to less than catastrophic levels.” Harvey speaks to various senior figures in UN climate talks and other relevant areas about this issue, including former US lead negotiator Todd Stern, former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and director general of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.",,N,,2025-07-18 10:02:01.673913

“That basically wipes out profits for one or two entire quarters for the Korean battery makers,” Adham is quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
According to data from BloombergNEF, two-thirds of the almost 180,000 tonnes of graphite products imported into the USA came from China.","Reuters quotes from a Commerce Department fact sheet that the additional tariffs will apply uniformly, so the same rate will be levied on all Chinese manufacturers. Exceptions for companies that have not sold their materials below ‘fair market value’ in the USA are not envisaged. The tariffs apply to anode graphite with a minimum purity content of 90 per cent carbon by weight; however, no distinction is made between natural graphite, synthetic graphite or a mixture of both. The final decision is to be announced by 5 December.

The new duties will be in addition to the existing rates, so the effective duty rate will be 160 per cent, according to American Active Anode Material Producers, the trade group that filed the complaint. American Active Anode Material Producers includes companies such as Syrah Technologies (Louisiana), Novonix (Tennesee), Epsilon Advanced Materials (North Carolina), Anovion (New York) and SKI US (Georgia).

According to Sam Adham, Head of Battery Materials at the consultancy CRU Group, a tariff rate of 160 per cent corresponds to an additional cost of seven US dollars per kilowatt hour for an average electric vehicle battery cell. A battery with an energy content of 60 kWh would therefore cost 420 dollars more to buy, and a 100 kWh battery 700 dollars more.

According to Adham, the tariffs would be a “blow to battery manufacturers,” as the tariffs are equivalent to around a fifth of the tax credits for battery manufacturing from the Inflation Reduction Act. These tax credits are also included in US President Donald Trump’s budget proposal. “That basically wipes out profits for one or two entire quarters for the Korean battery makers,” Adham is quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

The problem is that China, as in other areas of battery production and primary products, also holds a leading global role in graphite processing. According to data from BloombergNEF, two-thirds of the almost 180,000 tonnes of graphite products imported into the USA came from China. Tesla, which manufactures battery cells at the Gigafactory in Nevada together with Panasonic, had spoken out against the graphite tariffs, arguing that it was dependent on Chinese imports because the US industry was ‘not developed enough to meet the quality standards and quantities required by the carmaker’.",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/01/vianode-anode-graphite.jpeg,N,,2025-07-18 09:54:50.254798

According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Science and Technology, battery positive electrode (cathode) material preparation technology is “increasingly being used in sensitive fields”.

The new catalogue of technologies prohibited and restricted from export as set by the Ministries in China does not prevent export of batteries once ready for use in vehicles, but the components critical to production.

This, to include new battery lithium iron phosphate (LFP) preparation technology, battery lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) preparation technology and phosphate cathode raw material preparation technology, means that transferring the technologies overseas will require a government-issued license.

These technologies are also important components of battery energy storage systems (BESS), for which supply chains are also being hit by global trade tensions. Based on data from Solar Media Market Research’s Battery StorageTech Bankability Ratings Report, there is an expected gradual move out of China for cell manufacturing for both EV and ESS. More coverage of this can be found on our sister site, Energy Storage News.

Tariffs imposed on Chinese OEMs have seen many aim to set up manufacturing outside of China—for example in the EU, where import tariffs were imposed to encourage manufacturing on the continent.

According to Ministry spokespeople, including the technologies in the catalogue will “help better coordinate development and safety and promote the safe and sustainable application and development of relevant technologies”.

CATL, the China-based OEM that is the largest global EV battery producer, supplying majors including Tesla, BMW and Volkswagen, has plants in Germany and Hungary.

Of the almost 22 million passenger EVs BloombergNEF predicts will be sold around the world this year, nearly two-thirds are expected to be sold in China, up from 65% of all EVs sold in 2024. By the year 2030, BloombergNEF estimates that China will have an EV penetration of 80%, while only 52% of European cars will be EVs.

The quarterly automotive industry demand forecast published by the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC) last month suggested a rise in imported vehicles may impact European production, with competitive challenges from Chinese, South Korean and Japanese OEMs growing.

Federal delays, unpredictable lease schedules and regulatory whiplash have taken a toll — not just on companies like mine, but on the workers, families and communities who depend on a steady offshore energy economy.

As a world leader, our nation cannot be run like this. Our economy deserves and requires certainty with its industries. The effort and capital that is invested in this industry is massive so seesaw policy decisions make us all losers.

That’s why two recent decisions by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum deserve real credit: advancing Gulf of America Lease Sale 262 and launching the process to develop a new five-year Offshore Leasing Program.

Together, they send a long-overdue message — one that offshore workers across the Gulf Coast have been waiting to hear: The Gulf of America is back on track! We have work-hardened, skilled mariners that get the “work” done and they are ready for more.

Our company, headquartered in Lafayette, has served the offshore industry for more than 40 years. Our U.S. built vessels transport workers, equipment and supplies to and from offshore platforms, facilitating successful shallow water and deepwater operations across the Gulf. We don’t drill wells — but we do help make offshore development possible.

When lease sales stall or permitting slows down, the impact hits our crews, our shipyards and the small businesses that keep us all moving.

That’s why stability matters. When the federal government offers predictable, regular lease sales — and lays out a clear long-term plan through a five-year leasing program — companies can invest with confidence. That investment ripples throughout the Gulf Coast economy. We hire more mariners. We buy more steel. We put more boots on deck. Any South Louisianan knows maintaining a boat costs money. Big steel ones cost even more and that means we are doing business with lots of vendors not only in Louisiana but all over the nation.

The scale of impact is enormous. National studies show the offshore oil and gas industry supports nearly 400,000 U.S. jobs and contributes over $30 billion to the economy annually.

In Louisiana, those jobs aren’t just statistics — they’re neighbors, friends and family members.

A single oil and gas project in the Gulf supports more than 200 different job types, many of which pay nearly 30% above the national average. One deepwater development alone can generate $295 million in annual spending, $100 million in direct wages and more than 1,400 direct jobs each year over a 30-year project life. That kind of economic engine doesn’t run without a reliable federal leasing process.

We’ve also seen how the industry continues to raise the bar. Offshore operations in the Gulf of America are among the most tightly regulated in the world. Safety and environmental performance are central to every operation and still continue to improve. At Aries Marine, we take pride in doing things the right way— because the Gulf is home. It’s where we live, work and play and where we produce the most delicious seafood available.

Sec. Burgum’s decisions to advance Lease Sale 262 and initiate a new leasing program are steps in the right direction. They show an understanding that offshore energy plays a vital role in America’s energy security, economic strength and lower-emissions future.

We urge continued bipartisan support for these efforts. When Washington delivers the stability our industry needs, Louisiana delivers results. Our state has the people, the infrastructure and the know-how to lead the way — and with a stable offshore policy, we’re ready to do just that.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/d7/2d7c3bd8-ea44-5b89-9a8b-4a02ac6565fd/6851adc79089a.image.jpg?crop=1753%2C920%2C0%2C130&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-18 10:09:03.391968

Panasonic Energy has commenced mass production at its new, state-of-the-art factory in De Soto, Kansas. This facility, one of the largest of its kind in North America, is set to become a cornerstone of the United States’ electric vehicle (EV) supply chain, significantly boosting domestic battery manufacturing capabilities.

Key Highlights

Mass production of 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion batteries has officially begun at the new De Soto, Kansas, facility.

The factory is projected to reach an annual production capacity of approximately 32 GWh, a significant step in localizing EV battery production.

This is Panasonic Energy’s second EV battery factory in North America, complementing the existing plant in Nevada.

The project represents the largest economic development initiative in Kansas’s history, expected to create up to 4,000 direct jobs.

The new plant will feature advanced, labor-saving production lines to increase efficiency.

Expanding North American Production

The Kansas factory is a critical component of Panasonic Energy’s strategy to bolster its manufacturing presence in North America. Spanning a vast 300-acre site, the facility will produce 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion batteries, which are essential for powering a growing number of electric vehicles.

This new plant joins the company’s established factory in Sparks, Nevada, which has an annual capacity of approximately 41 GWh. Once the Kansas location is fully operational, Panasonic Energy’s total U.S.-based production capacity is expected to climb to around 73 GWh. This increased output is crucial for meeting the surging demand from automotive partners who are expanding their EV production lines.

With nearly three decades of experience in lithium-ion battery manufacturing, including about eight years of high-volume production at the Nevada site, Panasonic Energy is leveraging its expertise to ensure a smooth and rapid ramp-up of operations in Kansas. The Nevada factory has already produced over 11 billion battery cells.

Technological Advancements and Economic Impact

The Kansas factory is designed for enhanced efficiency, with labor-saving production lines expected to yield a 20 percent increase in productivity compared to the Nevada facility. Looking ahead, Panasonic Energy plans to integrate advanced materials that will boost cell capacity by approximately five percent, further strengthening its competitive edge.

This development is not only a win for the company but also for the state of Kansas. The factory is considered the largest economic development project in the state’s history, with projections of creating up to 4,000 direct jobs and an additional 8,000 jobs through suppliers and related businesses.

“The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” stated Kazuo Tadanobu, CEO of Panasonic Energy. “Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent.”

Commitment to Sustainability and Innovation

Panasonic Energy is a leader in high-performance battery technology, with its cells boasting an industry-leading volumetric energy density of 800 Wh/L. To date, the company has supplied approximately 19 billion cells, powering around 3.7 million EVs without a single vehicle recall related to its batteries.

The company is also fostering long-term growth by collaborating with educational institutions like the University of Kansas. These partnerships are aimed at promoting technological advancement and developing a skilled workforce for the future of the battery industry.

WASHINGTON —Today, House Democrats exposed how Republicans’ Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee 2026 funding bill increases costs for American households, undermines infrastructure investments, and weakens our national security.

The bill:

Increases energy costs, jeopardizes energy independence, and hurts United States’ competitiveness by slashing the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs nearly in half, revoking more than $5 billion from the Department of Energy’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources, and eliminating funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Weakens national security and leaves Americans more vulnerable to nuclear threats by cutting the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account by 17 percent.

Abandons commitments to communities to clean up radioactive waste by eliminating funding for the Corps of Engineers’ Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and cutting the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management by 9 percent.

“Sadly, this Republican Energy and Water bill did not have bipartisan input, and does not meet the moment to set the course for our nation’s future in the new age frontiers of energy and water,” Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-09) said. “This bill cedes American leadership in the global energy race to adversaries including the Chinese Communist Party. It weakens vital nuclear nonproliferation programs that help keep our country and world safe. By turning their backs on communities suffering from the long lasting impact of our early atomic weapons programs, Republicans show the callous disregard they have for America’s forgotten communities. We must invest in energy independence in perpetuity — or we will live to regret it, as our children and grandchildren inherit a future devoid of opportunity. The passage of this ill considered, and careless bill will hurt our communities from coast to coast, and is a true disservice to all the generations to come.”

Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur’s full remarks are here.

“House Republicans are wrapping up a long, chaotic week by advancing yet another funding bill that increases costs. This time, they are raising energy costs for American families and businesses,” Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT-03) said. “Their cut of nearly half the budget for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is a direct attack on the programs that lower energy bills for working families, create good-paying jobs in our communities, and keep America competitive.Republicans’ funding bill undermines the very programs that help us stop the spread of nuclear weapons, detect nuclear activity, and uphold arms control efforts that make America and the world safer – and it underfunds efforts to clean up sites contaminated by our nation’s early atomic energy program.Instead of working with Democrats to lower prices and invest in technology that promotes our energy independence, House Republicans are pushing a bill that raises energy costs for families and businesses and eliminates good-paying jobs.”

Congresswoman DeLauro’s full remarks are here.

During today’s markup, Democrats fought to make changes to Republicans’ bill, including to:

Prohibit the implementation of tariffs that would raise consumer energy prices.

Prevent the Department of Energy and other agencies from terminating critical projects simply based on the alignment with administration policies.

Prohibit the Republican's Bonanza for Billionaires efforts to modify or terminate clean energy tax credits.

Increase funds for the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).

These changes were rejected by House Republicans.

Amid US tariff negotiations, the climate group warned against trade deals that would make Asian countries more dependent on US oil and gas imports. Reports say that Indonesia has agreed to import US$15 billion worth of US oil and gas to reduce tariffs. Reports also indicate that India is planning to increase imports of Liquefied Natural Gas and crude oil from the US as part of a trade deal.

“Our future is not for sale. Asian governments should not be arm-twisted into guzzling more US oil and gas when they have committed to phasing-out fossil fuels and tripling renewable energy by 2030. The complete disregard of climate commitments puts billions of Asians at greater risk of climate impacts as the planet approaches the dangerous 1.5°C limit. It also stunts the region’s vast renewable energy potential and undermines long-term energy sovereignty and security,” says Chuck Baclagon, 350.org Asia Regional Finance Campaigner.

In a webinar, 350.org Asia launched its REImagine Asia campaign which highlights successful stories of how community-led renewable energy initiatives across the region have led to access to clean and affordable energy, climate resilience, and better livelihoods.

“Communities in Indonesia have shown that renewable energy can be harnessed to uplift people’s lives. With adequate government support and financing, these initiatives could be replicated at scale. On the other hand, increasing imports of US oil and gas will move us further away from the goal of replacing planet-heating fossil fuels with renewable energy. This goal is the key to our very survival and the much-needed ‘energy independence’ promised by President Prabowo himself–it should not be abandoned or sacrificed on the altar of trade expediency,” says Sisilia Nurmala Dewi, 350.org Indonesia Team Lead.

As the COP30 UN climate summit draws near, 350.org Asia announced that groups across the region will take to the streets and join the global Draw the Line mobilisation in September to demand real, decisive, and urgent climate action from governments.

In Nepal, Omkar Subedi, a research fellow of Digo Bikas Institute, talked about how a solar micro-grid boosted livelihoods in Dhapsung Village, an upland community in Sindhupalchowk District. He says:

“Energy access is still a problem in Nepal. Having reliable, clean energy is the first step for communities to have a quality of life. We need people-oriented energy systems where people have ownership over climate solutions, not ‘solutions’ by private corporations that profit from electricity generation.”

In Indonesia, Arbatuun talked about how the Gunung Sawur Community Microhydro in Sumberwuluh Village, Lumajang has led to women’s empowerment. She says:

“Cooperation between the government and communities is needed for widespread adoption of renewable energy. The Indonesian government must take strategic steps to invest in green energy infrastructure. We have proven that renewable energy can create jobs and stimulate local economic growth. With energy independence, we can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and bring real sustainable development, especially in rural areas.”

In Japan, Erina Imai of Sun Sun Suita Community Power talked about how a nursing home in Suita City, Osaka uses community-owned solar energy. She says:

“Japan is facing serious climate impacts, especially typhoons. Even in a country with strong infrastructure, we need to prepare for more climate destruction, which is especially hard for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with disabilities. They cannot easily evacuate during disasters and need energy resilience.

1. Main points

Using our definition's industry approach, UK employment in green jobs was an estimated 690,900 full-time equivalents (FTEs) in 2023.

Employment in green jobs was an estimated 34.6% higher (177,600 FTEs) in 2023 than in 2015, when it was 513,300 FTEs.

Three activities within green industries (waste, energy efficient products group, and renewable energy) accounted for just over half (54.3%) of UK FTE employment in green jobs in 2023.

Using the firm approach, 12.5 million FTEs in the UK (46.0% of all FTEs) worked in the 10 industries with the lowest levels of non-household residence-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2023 (4.4% of all such emissions).

Around 4.3 million FTEs in the UK (15.8% of all FTEs) worked in the five industries with the highest level of non-household residence-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2023 (81.6% of all such emissions).

Approximately one in four East Midlands FTE employees (23.9%) were in the five highest-emission industries, whereas London had the lowest proportion of FTE employees in these industries (7.2%).

2. How we define green jobs

We define green jobs as ""employment in an activity that contributes to protecting or restoring the environment, including those that mitigate or adapt to climate change"". This definition is also outlined in our ""Green jobs"" update, current and upcoming work article, which was published in 2023, following substantial stakeholder engagement.

Our definition focuses on activities undertaken, rather than environmental impact. A full breakdown of the activities included in our definition can be found in our Developing estimates of green jobs in the UK methodology.

We provide estimates using three approaches, which are described in our methodology:

industry-based

firm-based

occupation-based

There will be overlaps between these approaches, so each should be considered distinctly and not added together.

3. Jobs in green industries

The industry-based approach includes all jobs in a green industry or sector, and provides our headline estimate of employment in green jobs.

This approach is based on existing estimates, primarily from Low carbon and renewable energy economy, UK: 2023 and UK Environmental Accounts: 2025.

In 2023, there were an estimated 690,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in green jobs in the UK. This represents a 34.6% increase (or 177,600 additional FTEs) compared with 2015 (the first available figures), when there were an estimated 513,300 FTEs in green jobs.

Looking at employment by activity within green industries (as discussed in Section 2: How we define green jobs), ""waste"" was the largest employer, with 158,400 FTEs, representing 22.9% of all green jobs in 2023. Together with ""energy efficient products group"" (145,800 FTEs) and ""renewable energy"" (71,100 FTEs), these three activities accounted for just over half (54.3%) of total green jobs in 2023.

Notes:

Estimates are subject to revision and to survey-based sampling uncertainty, as definitions, methods and data sources are reviewed. This should be considered when comparing estimates over time.

The “other” category is obtained by combining the remaining 16 activities, data for which can be found in our accompanying datasets.

Increases in the number of FTE employees were seen across several activities between 2015 and 2023. These included:

waste, which increased by 57,300 FTEs (56.7%)

renewable energy, which increased by 43,100 FTEs (153.9%)

low carbon transport, which increased by 24,800 FTEs (181.0%)

The recycling activity saw the largest decrease of 14,100 FTEs (51.1%), from 27,600 FTEs in 2015 to 13,500 FTEs in 2023. This could reflect a shift by employers towards more integrated waste management systems, rather than a reduction in recycling.

4. Jobs in green firms

Our firm-based approach measures all jobs in firms that can be considered ""green"".

We have initially focused on total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and employment at an industry level, as a measure of one aspect of firms' greenness.

We use residence-based emissions data, which are directly comparable with economic output, from our latest UK Environmental Accounts bulletin (excluding emissions from households, which these accounts consider as an industry). We also use employment data from our latest Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES) on Nomis. These data help us understand the number of FTE employees who worked in firms within the lowest-emission and highest-emission industries.

In 2023, 12.5 million full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, or nearly half (46.0%) of all UK FTEs, worked in firms in the 10 industries with the lowest residence-based emissions levels, which collectively accounted for 4.4% of total emissions. These 10 industries have not changed since 2020.

Firms in the 10 lowest-emission industries had an average of around 1.4 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide equivalent) per FTE employee in 2023, compared with an average of 77.6 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide equivalent) per FTE employee in firms across all industries.

In contrast, firms in five industries accounted for 81.6% of total UK residence-based emissions in 2023, and 15.8% of total employees (4.3 million FTEs).

Figure 3: Nearly half (46.0%) of all UK FTEs across the economy worked in the 10 industries collectively responsible for 4.4% of all UK residence-based emissions

Notes:

Number of FTE employees for industry; activities of households as employers; undifferentiated goods and services-producing activities of households for own use (industry ""T""), is not available.

The percentage of greenhouse gases has been calculated by excluding emissions from households from the total UK economy, to give an estimate of industry emissions.

Some FTE employees in these highest-emission industries may have what would be considered a green job occupationally, such as a clean-tech production engineer in a firm in the manufacturing industry. However, looking at highest-emission industries is one way of identifying the level of employment in firms that are more likely to experience changes as the UK transitions towards net zero.

At a regional level, nearly one in four FTE employees (23.9%) living in the East Midlands were employed by firms in the UK's five highest-emission industries in 2023. London had the lowest proportion of FTEs in these industries (7.2%).

At local-authority level, North Lincolnshire had the highest percentage of FTEs employed in high-emission industries, at 41.6%. These FTE employees were mostly in the manufacturing industry, and the transportation and storage industry.

8 of the 10 local authority areas with the lowest proportion of FTEs (all below 5%) in the highest-emission industries, were in the London region, with the remaining two being Cambridge, and Epsom and Ewell.

Emissions do not reflect all environmental impacts of industries' activity. In the longer term, we plan to explore alternative methods to identify ""green"" firms that look at other aspects of our green jobs definition.

We also provide quarterly insights on the actions that businesses report taking to protect the environment, reduce emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. More information is available in our Business insights and impact on the UK economy dataset.

5. Green occupations

The occupation-based approach measures all jobs that are ""green"", regardless of the industry or firm that they are in, based on the specific activities undertaken by those workers or the objectives of their work.

We published our Research into ""green jobs"": time spent doing green tasks, UK: 1997 to 2019 article in 2022. The article included experimental estimates of the time spent doing green tasks over time, by country and by industry. It used a new method, based on task-level data from a US database, O*NET. This found that between 7% and 8% of hours worked in the UK in 2019 were estimated to have been spent on green tasks, an increase of around 2 percentage points since 1997. All UK countries saw a similar trend in hours spent working on green tasks.

In our Experimental estimates of green jobs, UK: 2023 bulletin and our Experimental estimates of green jobs, UK: 2024 bulletin, we explored whether our Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) could help us understand the proportion of people who report having a green job, based on our definition. An estimated 12% of adults said they would describe any part of their job as a ""green job"", when asked between 4 to 14 January and 17 to 29 January 2024. In 2024, we introduced an additional validation stage to check if respondents felt they were employed within our defined green activities. We therefore do not recommend comparing with the results shared in 2023, which lacked this validation.

We are exploring the potential to undertake further work on this occupational approach, including opportunities for better-quality and timelier data.

7. Glossary

Employees

An employee is anyone aged 16 years and over who is directly paid by an organisation from its payroll or payrolls, in return for carrying out a full-time or part-time job, or being on a training scheme. It excludes those who are self-employed, voluntary workers and working owners who are not paid through Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

Employment

Employment is measured in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, where one FTE employee may be thought of as one person working full-time for one year.

Environmental goods and services sector

The environmental goods and services sector accounts, which follow the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), measure areas of the economy engaged in producing goods and services for environmental protection purposes. It also includes areas of the economy engaged in conserving and maintaining natural resources.

Green Job

Employment in an activity that contributes to protecting or restoring the environment, including those that mitigate or adapt to climate change.

Low carbon and renewable energy economy

Economic activities that deliver goods and services that are likely to help the UK generate lower emissions of greenhouse gases, predominantly carbon dioxide.

Residence-based Greenhouse Gas emissions

The following greenhouse gases (GHG) included in the atmospheric emissions accounts are those covered by the Kyoto Protocol:

carbon dioxide (CO2)

methane (CH4)

nitrous oxide (N2O)

hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)

perfluorocarbons (PFCs)

sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)

nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)

These gases contribute directly to global warming and climate change because of their positive radiative forcing effect. The potential of each GHG to cause global warming is assessed in relation to a given weight of CO2, so all GHG emissions are measured as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).

Unlike the emissions measure used to monitor net zero, estimates compiled on a residence basis include data relating to UK residents and UK-registered businesses, regardless of whether they are in the UK or overseas. Data relating to foreign visitors and foreign businesses in the UK are excluded. See our Environmental accounts on air emissions quality and methodology information (QMI) and our Measuring UK greenhouse gas emissions explainer article for further information.

8. Data sources and quality

These are official statistics in development and are therefore subject to revision as we review methods and data sources. This release updates our Estimates of green jobs, UK: 2024 bulletin and accompanying dataset.

We will continue to engage with stakeholders on the activities within our green jobs definition, and we welcome feedback. We will also be reviewing data sources to identify potential improvements to our methods, and whether alternative data sources are available. This work will focus on improving the timeliness of our estimates. More information on the quality of these estimates can be found in our Developing estimates of green jobs in the UK methodology.

Revisions

This release contains revisions to previous years of estimates. Revisions can result from a variety of factors, including from our survey-based estimates, where businesses add or revise previous years' data.

Quality

More quality and methodology information can be found in our Developing estimates of green jobs in the UK methodology.

Strengths and limitations

Our Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy (LCREE) Survey dataset and our Employees in Great Britain by industry bulletin and accompanying datasets, used in the estimation for a number of activities, are survey-based and gather information from a sample rather than the whole population. This means that they are subject to measurable sampling uncertainty, which affects how changes in the estimates across time should be interpreted. Estimates of the level of uncertainty associated with all figures (confidence intervals and coefficients of variation) can be found in our LCREE and our BRES datasets on Nomis to support interpretation.

More information can be found in our Uncertainty and how we measure it for our surveys methodology.

Industry estimates of green jobs

To provide an initial estimate of jobs in green industries, we have used publicly available data from:

our LCREE dataset

our Environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) dataset

our Employees in Great Britain by industry bulletin and accompanying datasets.

Our total estimates also exclude some activities for which we do not have a data source, most notably those working on decarbonising grid networks and in low-carbon travel other than low- and zero-emission vehicles. We will continue to explore whether more appropriate data sources are available.

We have also sought to minimise double counting when combining data sources. Some double counting may remain because of the complexity of underlying sources; work will continue to reduce the potential for double counting in any future releases.

Where data are not yet available for activities for 2023, these have been forecasted using average growth rates. See the notes in our accompanying dataset for more information.

Firm estimates of green jobs

To provide an initial estimate of jobs in green industries, we have used publicly available data from our UK Environmental Accounts bulletin and our latest Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES) on Nomis.

In our calculations, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a residence basis have been used, excluding emissions from households. This measure covers only direct emissions, and so excludes emissions related to supply chains.

Employment data are taken from the 2023 BRES and converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs). The BRES collects comprehensive employment information from businesses in England, Scotland and Wales, representing the majority of the economy in Great Britain. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) collects the same information independently in Northern Ireland. Both data sources are then combined to produce estimates on a UK basis.

Because of the unavailability of NISRA data for 2023, the figures for Northern Ireland have been modelled and should be interpreted with caution.

The BRES is a sample survey and produces estimated employment figures. These estimates are of a better quality at higher levels of geography (for example, country). The quality of the estimates deteriorates at lower geographical levels and this should be considered when using our subnational estimates.

In an interview with Bridging News during the International Forum on Regional Cooperation for Sustainable Development of Green Mountains—held from July 10 to 15 in Chengdu and Chongqing—delegates from Vietnam and Thailand highlighted the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a key platform for advancing sustainable innovation across Asia.

The forum attracted over 200 participants, including 12 international delegates from countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar. Discussions centered on clean energy technology, green finance, digital energy systems, and regional collaboration. Delegates also toured Chongqing's leading green enterprises, including Sanfeng Environment, New Century Electric, and HaiRun Energy. By the end of the forum, 15 preliminary international collaborations were announced, spanning solar investment, knowledge exchange, and sustainable development training.

Vietnam looks to China for waste-to-energy transformation

Lim Chor Ghee, senior advisor of ADK Law Firm in , highlighted the growing waste crisis in his country, where urban solid waste is increasing by 10–16% annually. Having lived in Vietnam for two decades, Lim is no stranger to the complexities of urban growth and the urgent need for sustainable waste solutions.

After visiting Environment's waste-to-energy facility in Chongqing, Lim admired what he called a ""park, not a plant,"" describing the site's cleanliness, green landscaping, and complete absence of odor. ""It was a surprise,"" he said. ""This is exactly the kind of infrastructure our rapidly expanding cities in Vietnam urgently need.""

He noted that China's advanced waste incineration technologies could serve as a blueprint for Vietnam, provided institutional cooperation supports the integration of supply chains and local regulations. ""What Chongqing has achieved in transforming urban waste into energy is inspiring and replicable,"" he added.

Thai solar pioneer eyes ASEAN via Chongqing

Dr. Subin Pinkayan, founder of GMS Power in and an energy visionary, drew on decades of engineering, academic and political experience at the forum. In Chongqing, he met with local partner Chongqing Tianhua New Energy Company to discuss manufacturing next-generation solar cells in Thailand—technology he says could slash production costs by 20%, a potential game-changer for ASEAN nations pursuing affordable renewables.

“China has everything—technology, capital, talent. Thailand can be a bridge, a launchpad to bring Chinese green innovation to the entire ASEAN region,” Dr. Subin said, praising Chongqing as a clean-energy trailblazer and calling for an ASEAN power-trading platform with China at its core.

A two-time visitor to Chongqing, he lauded the city’s dynamism and its proximity to Thailand—a mere four-hour flight away—making it an ideal strategic partner. “We want a win-win partnership. Fair and equal collaboration is key to real progress,” he emphasized.

Both Dr. Subin and his fellow speaker Lim identified financing and policy alignment as major hurdles for ASEAN’s green transition. Lim underscored the need for equitable development so that green-growth benefits reach all sectors of society, not just elites. Dr. Subin echoed those sentiments, advocating regionally integrated energy infrastructure and open access to China’s cutting-edge technologies.

Through site visits, candid exchanges and deepening trust, the forum illustrated how China’s green industry is evolving from technology exporter into co-creator of sustainable ecosystems. As the Belt and Road Initiative shifts from hard infrastructure to climate-smart collaboration, ASEAN voices are increasingly aligned with China’s green vision—not only for innovation, but for shared prosperity across Asia.",https://source.ichongqing.info/2025/07029e43746c7397ce8bfd059a52b68d961752831101.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:48:56.413616

Ohioans know how to build things. For generations, we have powered America’s growth from steel to solar, from airplanes to advanced batteries. In just the past few years, our state has attracted more than $18.6 billion in clean energy and manufacturing investments, resulting in over 14,000 good-paying jobs. We were on track to lead the next industrial boom, empowering Ohio's economy and our workers.

But Republicans in Washington just slammed on the brakes.

The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed by Congressional Republicans, does the opposite of what it promises. Instead of lowering energy costs and boosting energy production here in Ohio, it eliminates critical clean energy investments, guts support for in-state manufacturing and eliminates good-paying manufacturing jobs.

This isn’t theoretical. It’s happening right now:

$15.5 billion in clean energy investments have already been canceled.

More than 90,000 jobs are at risk of shifting overseas to China.

Electricity rates are spiking, with Ohio households expected to pay $180 more per year by 2030, and over $400 more by 2035.

At the center of this reversal is the repeal of the 45X manufacturing tax credit, a cornerstone of Ohio’s recent economic momentum. That credit helped make Ohio the No. 3 state in the nation for manufacturing jobs. Cutting this credit now is like taking the ladder away just as we were reaching the top. It's not just destructive — it's nonsensical.

While GOP politicians promise “energy independence,” they’re doing the opposite: making it harder to build solar, wind and battery storage right here in Ohio. These are the very projects that made up 93% of the new U.S. energy supply in 2024, making our grid more reliable, our air cleaner and our economy prosperous.

The passage of this legislation is a betrayal of Ohio's workers, our values and our potential. If politicians are serious about reviving American manufacturing, lowering energy bills and securing energy independence, we must double down on in-state clean power.

Yes, that means standing up for solar, wind, batteries and most importantly, for the workers who build them. Ohio families deserve bold leaders who will work to protect our finances and our future. Instead, we get political betrayal that increases costs and sends jobs overseas.

Ohioans are struggling to keep up with rising energy bills and bracing for grid failures. We didn’t cause this disaster, but we must demand better from those who did.

Politicians manufactured this crisis. Now we must fix it.

After close, BP Wind Energy will be owned and operated as part of LS Power portfolio company Clearlight Energy, increasing its operating fleet to around 4.3GW.

BP Wind Energy has been marketed as an integrated business, with its workforce expected to transfer to the new owner on completion of the deal.

The business has interests in 10 operating onshore wind energy assets across seven US states, operating nine of them. The assets have a combined gross generating capacity of 1.7GW (1.3GW net to BP). All wind assets are grid-connected and are already providing power to over 15 off-takers.

BP executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy William Lin said: “We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused BP, we will continue to rationalise and optimise our portfolio to generate value.

“The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward.

“I am pleased we have reached a mutually beneficial deal with LS Power and I look forward to working with them to support our people in maintaining safe and reliable operations as we transition ownership.”

LS Power will add BP’s US onshore wind business to an existing fleet of renewable, energy storage, flexible gas and renewable fuels assets, which comprise a 21GW operating portfolio and more than 780 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in operation. Another 350-plus miles are currently under construction or development.

LS Power chief executive Paul Segal said: “We are focused on a holistic approach to advancing American energy infrastructure that includes improving existing energy assets while investing in transformative strategies that make energy more efficient, affordable and available.

“Well-located with well-structured contracts, these new assets will expand our renewable energy presence and help to meet growing energy demand across the US.

“We look forward to welcoming the talented teams operating these assets to LS Power and partnering with them to drive value for our stakeholders.”

The deal is expected to conclude by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. It is the latest example of BP’s $20bn divestment programme to “simplify and focus” the business.

Here's where - The State","Lucy Valeski, Courtesy High Flyer",,,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article310726135.html,"The created energy will be sold to Dominion Energy, Richland County Council Chair Jesica Mackey said.
The new farm will be adjacent to the existing Eastover Solar farm and will be constructed by Pontiac Solar.
Local incentives Despite federal funding cuts, local governments can still provide incentives for renewable energy projects.
Richland County approved a fee-in-lieu-of-taxes incentive for the Pontiac Solar project during a July 8 meeting.
“After that, I think there’s going to be a lull.” The Pontiac Solar project is expected to be completed by the end of 2028.","Despite financial and regulatory changes hitting South Carolina’s renewable energy sector, Richland County’s utility-scale solar production will likely more than double, Columbia Area Development Partnership announced last week.

A new 75 megawatt solar farm will be built in Eastover, a rural area of Richland County. The farm could power 8,460 homes, according to calculations by the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The created energy will be sold to Dominion Energy, Richland County Council Chair Jesica Mackey said.

But the future of solar power in the county and state could be shaky. The federal government has stripped renewable energy tax incentives and grants, which could make financing projects more uncertain, said John Brooker, energy policy director at Conservation Voters of South Carolina.

The state also placed more regulations on solar farms this year and put more responsibility on utilities to fulfill their solar plans in the future.

“The state-level bill really provided a lot more certainty for procuring this renewable energy,” Brooker said. “...This was all thrown into disarray with the reconciliation package.”

However, because solar is often affordable to operate and diversifies the energy grid, solar farms could still see future investment, said Kumar Venayagamoorthy, the Duke Energy Distinguished Professor of Power Engineering at Clemson University.

“It’s just that amount of profit you make out of it might be reduced,” Venayagamoorthy said. “But still, I think at the end of the day, it still will turn out fine.”

The new development will be Richland County’s second utility-scale solar farm, Mackey said. The new farm will be adjacent to the existing Eastover Solar farm and will be constructed by Pontiac Solar.

Carrie Turner, the marketing manager at the Columbia Area Development Partnership, said the project team at Pontiac Solar was unable to answer questions about the project at this point.

Local incentives

Despite federal funding cuts, local governments can still provide incentives for renewable energy projects. Richland County approved a fee-in-lieu-of-taxes incentive for the Pontiac Solar project during a July 8 meeting.

The incentive gives Pontiac Solar a fixed tax rate for the next 30 years. The fee will be determined based on the company’s investment in real and personal property, according to Mackey. Pontiac Solar has committed to investing $112.5 million, according to the agreement. The project will be constructed on a 462.6 acre site, according to the Columbia Area Development Council.

Mackey said the incentive is a win-win for the company and the county. Pontiac Solar will be able to budget based on a set tax rate, and the county will be able to count on the fee for the next 30 years, she said.

“This is a commitment for you to stay and commit to Richland County, and we’re committed to you as well,” Mackey said.

State and federal legislation

Two pieces of legislation have impacted utility-scale solar production in South Carolina: The state passed the “South Carolina Energy Security Act,” which includes new rules for clean energy, and the federal budget reconciliation bill stripped tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Since the Inflation Reduction Act, clean energy investment has risen in the U.S., according to the Clean Investment Monitor. The investment tracker is conducted by economic researcher Rhodium Group and the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. It shows that investment in clean energy is nearly 2% of South Carolina’s gross domestic product over the last four quarters, the fourth highest of all states.

Many of the tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act have a new expiration date. The budget reconciliation bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”, places new rules on the clean energy tax credits for wind and solar. Solar projects will only be able to receive the incentive if it begins construction by June 4, 2026, or goes online by the end of 2027.

This could mean solar farms already in progress may be completed over the next few years, but development of new solar farms may dwindle, Brooker said.

“I think you’re going to see projects for the next year to year and a half, maybe two years max, which is essentially what the federal bill allows to earn the tax credits,” Brooker said. “After that, I think there’s going to be a lull.”

The Pontiac Solar project is expected to be completed by the end of 2028. That means the project would have to break ground in the next year or go online a year ahead of schedule to receive the tax credit.

Before the budget reconciliation bill passed, the renewable energy sector had more stability thanks to the state’s new energy law, Brooker said. The law requires state-regulated utilities to follow through on procuring the renewable energy sources outlined in its resource plan.

“This provides more certainty for that cost-effective solar,” Brooker said.

The state legislature also placed additional rules on new solar projects in counties without existing legislation this year. For example, solar facilities need to build a buffer, like a fence or wall, between the farm and the road, homes, schools or churches. The facility also must work to minimize glare on the panels and the solar farms must be set 50 feet away from adjoining property lines and 200 feet away from schools, homes or churches.","https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/qctavo/picture209964299/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Lexington%20Solar%20Farm%20IMG_4632,%20fromHighFlyer.jpg",N,,2025-07-18 09:54:53.816470

This milestone underscores Sineng’s commitment to accelerating the energy transition in North America and reinforces its position as a global leader in PV+ESS solutions.

The project features Sineng’s 3.2MW PCS MV Turnkey Station (EH-3200-HA-MR-US-34.5), integrating 16 units of 200kW String PCS (EH-0200-HA-M-US), a low-voltage switchboard, and a pad-mounted transformer. Its modular design enables rack-level battery management, boosting battery utilization by over 7%. With one-to-one pairing between PCS and battery clusters, each cluster operates independently—reducing downtime, enhancing energy control, and optimizing charge/discharge performance. This setup also improves SOC balance and minimizes the long-term impact of battery inconsistencies. Short-circuit current is limited to 10kA for safer operation. Modular design ensures system availability exceeds 99%. The system also allows seamless integration of additional battery clusters for future expansion. Now in operation, the facility will provide essential grid services including frequency regulation, peak shaving, and reserve capacity, contributing to grid flexibility and stability in one of the most dynamic power markets in the U.S.

Coordinated by the Headquarter Service Department, Sineng Electric worked closely with its U.S. local team to drive project delivery. Since late 2024, nearly 10 personnel were involved in both on-site and remote support, covering inspection, installation, and commissioning. Headquarter and local engineers provided rotating on-site support, joined by a third-party specialist.

The announcements come as the agency initiates “Phase 2” of its reorganization plans.

In a press release, the agency said that “changes” to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, which houses the agency’s environmental enforcement personnel, would be “re-aligning enforcement with the law to deliver economic prosperity” as well as compliance with regulations.

Previously, the administration indicated that it would steer its environmental enforcement away from energy companies. CNN further reported last month that EPA officials in the Midwest have told staff to stop pursuing violations made by fossil fuel firms.

Separately, the EPA is offering another round of buyouts to employees. Eligible employees include those in the EPA’s Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Mission Support and Office of Research and Development, the latter of which is the EPA’s science arm.

The latest reorganization also impacts offices beyond the enforcement office. The press release said that “updates” to the Office of Land and Emergency Management, which cleans up contaminated sites, “will better equip the agency to swiftly and efficiently fulfill statutory obligations like preventing contamination, cleaning up and returning land to productive use, and responding to emergencies.”

And the EPA is creating a new Office of Finance and Administration that it said will “create new efficiencies and improve coordination” of things like contracts, grants and “human capital.”

Private institutions and foundations all have current opportunities, which Project 46 is pivoting toward.","A little more than two years ago, the regional climate coalition Project 46 was formed in a bid to unite south-central Indiana communities in combating climate change and securing funds for local projects.

The project has seen some setbacks and some marginal success thus far, and is set to launch its website soon with more information. Most of the work so far has been organizational, positioning the climate alliance to get to work.

Government funding sources are harder to come by now, so the plan is pivoting toward other sources for grant implementation.

How does Project 46 work?

As it stands now, the members of the alliance are the Hoosier cities of Nashville, Columbus and Bloomington. Columbus' and Bloomington's mayors and Nashville’s town manager make up Project 46’s steering committee.

The goal of the coalition is to combine resources to make individually smaller communities stronger together. Shawn Miya, Bloomington’s assistant director of sustainability, said that allows them to be more competitive in grant funding, and to effectively fight climate change and its impacts.

Each municipality on the steering committee is expected to pay $0.50 per capita toward the plan’s funds. Private and nonprofit members of the project’s advisory committee are similarly expected to pay dues.

The funding is then pooled through the alliance’s fiscal sponsor, Heritage Fund – Bartholomew County’s community foundation. Miya said the foundation works as a sort of bank for Project 46.

Advisory committee members will be able to make subcommittees to focus on certain aspects of fighting climate change and create proposals.

What progress has it made so far?

Most of the progress up to this point has been organizational — in the steering committee’s next meeting on July 30, each member will vote on adopting long-term governance measures.

Project 46 also contracted with Farallon Strategies, which has helped it create interim governing measures and those aforementioned long-term documents.

A subcontractor for Farallon Strategies is completing a regional greenhouse gas inventory and high impact action analysis. The subcontractor, at the steering committee’s next meeting, will present its findings to help create a roadmap to large emission reductions.

Project 46 also crafted proposals for more tangible projects that could impact each community, such as solar, electrification of buses, EV charging and more. Part of that was applications for a part of the nearly $5 billion in funding for pollution reduction grants authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Project 46 sent 11 proposals to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which pooled submissions from throughout the state and submitted for the grants on their behalf. Indiana University also applied for several of the grants for its own climate action plan.

IDEM selected seven of Project 46’s proposals, but was unsuccessful in securing the grants.

“It’s too bad they didn’t get selected, but we still have all those 11 project proposals,” Miya said.

The proposals are still there, all listed on Project 46’s interim website, waiting for funding.

The alliance also is working on creating a dedicated new website that will launch in a few weeks. The new website will include the regional greenhouse gas inventory, information on joining and more.

Finally, project committee hopes to hire a full-time Project 46 coordinator, who will help with guiding the alliance and implementation of proposals.

Bloomington’s plan to combat climate change

Bloomington has already made solid inroads on cutting its emissions — the city is on track for a 25% reduction by 2030, starting from a 2018 baseline. Still, net zero is proving difficult.

The city is behind on its goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to its 2023 greenhouse gas inventory published in January this year.

Miya said Project 46’s goals will directly help Bloomington’s climate change and emission reduction goals. And beyond that, she believes it’s the city’s responsibility to share its expertise in sustainability programs.

“I'm hoping that what we've done here in Bloomington can be replicated across the region,” Miya said.

State and federal impacts

Columbus Mayor Mary Ferdon said in an email that funding opportunities from the state and federal governments are less available now. That doesn’t mean all funding is gone, though.

Private institutions and foundations all have current opportunities, which Project 46 is pivoting toward. Ferdon said that they’ll be working to connect residents in businesses in Columbus to existing funding.

“Now is not the time to slow down or give up on climate action,” Miya said. “In fact, now is the time to come together and do what we can to implement projects with regional funding so that when those federal grants come around again, we have proven ourselves to be an effective climate alliance.”

The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,"" the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order ""will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative"" on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.''

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

""This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.?

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,? or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

Section 48E Clean Energy Investment Credit The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) added the Section 48E credit for certain energy production or storage projects placed in service after 2024.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBB”), which was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, revokes or curtails the majority of energy credits and significantly curtails other credits. Though certain credits, including those related to “Clean Coal” and Nuclear Energy, are retained, credits related to solar, wind, and other common forms of clean energy were eliminated.

Terminated Credits

The following energy credits are revoked by the OBBB, as of the expiration date listed:

Terminated Deductions

The following deductions related to clean energy are revoked by the OBBB, as of the effective date listed:

Section 179D – Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction - As of June 30, 2026

Section 168(e)(3)(B)(vi) – Eliminates treatment of solar property as five-year cost recovery property eligible for Bonus Depreciation – For property built after December 31, 2024

Energy Investment Credits

Prior to the OBBB, taxpayers constructing certain energy property could claim a tax credit based on the cost of construction (“Investment Credits”). Specifically, taxpayers could claim an energy credit under Section 48 or a Clean Energy Investment Credit under Section 48E. The OBBB effectively eliminated each of these credits, though with different effective dates, as explained below.

1. Section 48 Energy Credit

Section 48 previously provided two tiers of eligible energy property: certain specifically identified energy property which was eligible for a six percent credit, and all other energy property, which was eligible for a two percent credit. Additionally, Section 48 provided significant increases in credit percentage rate for projects which met certain energy output thresholds, hired workers at prevailing wages, included use of apprentices, and used a certain percentage of domestically produced construction materials (“Rate Bonuses”).

In recent years, many of the six percent credit projects expired or fell out of favor, and the six percent credit is rarely claimed. However, credits in the two percent category were still commonly claimed, particularly in conjunction with the Rate Bonuses.

Though the OBBB did not modify the six percent credit rules, it effectively eliminates the two percent credit under Section 48. Specifically, the OBBB changes the two percent credit to a zero percent credit and prevents the use of any Rate Bonuses to increase the credit rate above zero percent. This change is effective for all projects which began construction after June 16, 2025.

The elimination of the two percent credit, as well the fact that most of the six percent credits have expired, renders the Section 48 credit effectively eliminated for any project which was not already under construction as of June 16, 2025.

2. Section 48E Clean Energy Investment Credit

The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) added the Section 48E credit for certain energy production or storage projects placed in service after 2024. The Section 48E Credits provides for a six percent credit, increased to thirty percent for projects meeting the requirements for Rate Bonuses.

The OBBB modifies the Section 48E credit in several ways. Effective January 1, 2026, the OBBB adds significant rules to prohibit “foreign influence” on qualified energy facilities (the “Foreign Entity of Concern,” or “FEOC Rules”). Specifically, the FEOC Rules preclude any prohibited foreign entity (i.e. China or Chinese entities) from having an interest or influence over energy property and prevent taxpayers from claiming the credit if such influence is found.

While the FEOC Rules prohibit obvious influence like direct ownership, they also prohibit less obvious connections like management contracts, loans, and foreign produced components. To claim the credit, any project would need certifications from all managers, contractors, subcontractors, and others that no such foreign influence exists. These rules add significant time and cost to claiming the Section 48E credit. Ultimately, it’s unclear how the FEOC Rules will be applied until additional guidance is issued by the Treasury Department.

Additionally, the OBBB terminates the Section 48E credit for any energy facility (other than certain geothermal facilities) not placed in service by December 31, 2027. In theory, the OBBB provides a slight reprieve by providing that December 31, 2027, placed in service date won’t apply to any facility that begins construction within 12 months of the signing of the OBBB (i.e. by July 4, 2026).

On July 7, 2025, however, the Trump administration issued an executive order titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources” (the “Executive Order”), which directs federal agencies, including Treasury, to interpret the OBBB strictly and take all necessary steps to eliminate energy credits quickly.

Therefore, though the OBBB technically provides that projects which begin within the next year might still qualify, the administration has made it clear that they will take any steps possible to prevent such projects from ultimately qualifying.

Clean Electricity Production Credit

As an alternative to Investment Credits (credits based on the cost of construction of clean energy property), taxpayers had been able to claim credits based on the amount of electricity produced by a qualified facility (“Production Credits”).

Prior to the IRA, Production Credits were allowed by Section 45, but those credits have generally expired and have been replaced with the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit.

The OBBB modifies the Section 45Y credit in several ways which mirror the changes to the Section 48E credit. The OBBB adds, effective January 1, 2026, FEOC Rules similar to those under Section 48E. These FEOC Rules add significant time, cost, and uncertainty to claiming the Section 45Y credit, particularly prior to the issuance of any regulatory guidance.

Additionally, the Section 45Y credit is terminated for projects (other than certain geothermal projects) placed in service after December 31, 2027.

As with the Section 48E credit, OBBB provides a slight reprieve by providing that December 31, 2027, placed in service date won’t apply to any facility which begins construction within 12 months of the signing of the OBBB (i.e. by July 4, 2026). However, the Executive Order indicates that the administration likely will attempt to prevent the Section 45Y credit from being claimed.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12641_1216.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:54:57.665150

In a press release on Thursday, the department said all “decisions and actions concerning wind and solar energy facilities will undergo elevated review by the Office of the Secretary.”

This includes decisions to lease new land or water for wind and solar, approving projects on that land and on other activities like grants and assessments of endangered species impacts.

Critics say the move is likely to slow down the process of approving renewable energy projects on public lands and represents a further attack on the sector by the Trump administration.

Laura Daniel-Davis, who was the department’s acting No. 2 during the Biden administration, told The Hill that “the bottleneck of having to have everything flow up through the secretary’s office is going to delay” renewable projects.

Daniel-Davis said that in her experience most energy projects — renewable and fossil fuel alike — did not go through the secretary’s office, and especially not at each and every waypoint outlined by the department.

The Interior Department has jurisdiction over energy production on public lands and offshore. This includes renewables like wind and solar, as well as oil, gas and coal.

“Today’s actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars,” acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess said in a statement.

The main manufacturing area is a class 10,000 clean room, equivalent to the cleanliness of an operating theatre.
The new facilities are part funded by the UK Government’s investment in the Cardiff Capital Region.
On a visit to KLA the Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said: “I’m delighted to see this investment into the world-leading compound semiconductor cluster in Newport.","Cardiff Capital Region (CCR), the regional body made up of the ten Local Authorities in South East Wales, supported US semiconductor equipment manufacturer KLA Corporation with a £6.25m grant to facilitate the expansion of its highly innovative new manufacturing and R&D centre in Imperial Park, Newport. An additional £750,000 was granted from Newport City Council for the same project, and the total sum of £7m will be committed over the next four years.

The new 237,000 sq. ft facility includes manufacturing space, a fabrication plant, as well as office space for 750 employees, and is located within the compound semiconductor cluster in Newport, next to CCR’s CSC Foundry. The grant supports the expansion of the existing KLA business footprint in the region, bringing new manufacturing innovations and adding significant value to the Semiconductor and Compound Semiconductor Industries’ contribution to the Welsh economy.

Known as the technical heart of KLA’s new building, the dedicated cleanroom infrastructure is split into two areas, – the ‘Fab’, where KLA R&D work is undertaken, and the manufacturing clean room where KLA produces its equipment. Both are supporting the development of cutting-edge technology and recognised globally as a ‘best of kind facility’. The main manufacturing area is a class 10,000 clean room, equivalent to the cleanliness of an operating theatre. The ‘Fab’ is a class 1000/100 cleanroom, meaning it filters out 99.997% of any contaminants, making it one of the cleanest environments possible.

The new facilities are part funded by the UK Government’s investment in the Cardiff Capital Region. On a visit to KLA the Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

“I’m delighted to see this investment into the world-leading compound semiconductor cluster in Newport. KLA’s new facilities mean they can expand and employ more highly skilled people.

“The UK Government’s funding for Cardiff Capital Region and the local Investment Zone is helping drive economic growth in a sector where Wales leads the way, delivering the plan that we have set out in our Industrial Strategy.”

Cllr Dimitri Batrouni, Leader of Newport City Council, commented:

“This investment from CCR represents a stake in the new industries of the future, the new advanced manufacturing that is being built here in Newport on a massive scale. To drive a semiconductor plant such as KLA’s, we need people, and we need skills and other companies in the local supply chain to make it all happen. 80% of these needs are coming from within the region and this is a great opportunity for the economy of South East Wales.”

The investment in infrastructure brings employment opportunities which support a number of new positions, some of which may be filled by newly qualified PhD graduates from multiple disciplines such as those from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Compound Semiconductors at Cardiff University, the Centre for Integrative Semiconductor Materials at Swansea University, as well as experts in digital and software disciplines.

Commenting on the investment, Andrew Evans, Senior Director, Commercial Legal, at KLA said:

“The investments from both KLA and CCR into this new site reinforce the importance of Wales to KLA’s global operations. The technologies created and developed in Wales are critical not only to our customers in Europe but globally too. The technology and infrastructure, combined with the skilled talent pool here continue to make this operation in Newport very competitive on the global semiconductor landscape.”",https://www.cardiffcapitalregion.wales/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kla.png,N,,2025-07-18 09:49:09.531656

The administration argues that subsidizing solar and wind projects—many of which rely on equipment from China—undermines national energy security, grid stability, and American jobs.","The U.S. Department of the Interior has enacted sweeping policy changes that dramatically reshape how federal agencies handle wind and solar energy development. In a July 15 memorandum, the Department imposed a broad mandate requiring top-level political review for nearly every federal decision related to renewable energy projects and eliminated longstanding subsidies, sparking sharp backlash from the clean energy industry.

The move stems from President Donald J. Trump’s “Energy Dominance” agenda and follows the signing of Executive Order 14315, titled Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources, as well as the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

According to the Department, the new directive requires all decisions, consultations, permits, plans, and environmental reviews related to wind and solar energy to be submitted to the Office of the Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, reviewed by the Office of the Deputy Secretary, and receive final approval from the Secretary of the Interior.“Today’s actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars,” said Adam Suess, Acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management. “American Energy Dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

An Extensive and Unprecedented Review Framework

The July 15 memo lists 69 categories of actions—from lease sales and construction approvals to environmental assessments and tribal consultations—that now require top-level signoff. The directive affects every stage of development for wind and solar facilities on federal lands, including:

Environmental impact statements (EIS, EA, FONSI, etc.)

Lease sales and rights-of-way (ROW) applications and grants

Tribal consultations and compliance with historic preservation laws

Wildlife and ecological assessments

Construction and operation plans (COPs)

Visual impact, oil spill, and cable burial reports

Permitting under the Endangered Species Act and other conservation laws

The Department asserts that these changes are meant to ensure “thorough and deliberative” oversight of projects previously fast-tracked or subsidized under earlier administrations.

Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act directs the Department to eliminate fee discounts for wind and solar developers, ending reduced charges for rights-of-way and project capacity that had previously made such projects more economically viable.

Industry Response: “This Isn’t Oversight. It’s Obstruction.”

The announcement was met with fierce criticism from clean energy advocates. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) denounced the changes as a deliberate attempt to slow down U.S. renewable energy deployment at a critical moment of rising energy demand.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a July 17 statement.

“The Secretary of the Interior will now be personally reviewing thousands of documents and permit applications—everything from the location and types of fences to grading access roads. It’s a bewildering departure from promises to reduce bureaucracy and compete with China in the global energy race.”

Grumet noted that electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to rise 35–50% by 2040, driven largely by the rapid expansion of AI technologies and data centers, which alone could require over 100 GW of new capacity.

He also emphasized that 93% of new power capacity added in 2024 came from clean energy sources, which remain the “fastest and most affordable” options for immediate grid expansion. ACP warned that restricting these sources could lead to higher energy prices for families and businesses, while weakening U.S. competitiveness.

A Shift Toward Fossil Fuels and ‘Dispatchable’ Power

The Department of the Interior maintains that the policy represents a return to “common-sense permitting standards” and a more secure energy strategy focused on “dispatchable” sources such as domestic natural gas, clean coal, and potentially nuclear energy.

The administration argues that subsidizing solar and wind projects—many of which rely on equipment from China—undermines national energy security, grid stability, and American jobs.

While proponents of fossil fuels have welcomed the policy, critics say it risks derailing the U.S. energy transition and undermines bipartisan efforts in Congress to streamline permitting across all energy sectors, including geothermal and nuclear.",https://www.review-energy.com/fileuploads/news/review-energy-noticias17528269371.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:49:22.686744

Have you been sitting on the sidelines, waiting to decarbonize your home and commute?

It may be time to jump into action.

The ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 sets early expiration dates for a slew of federal tax credits that have made it easier for millions of Americans to switch to clean and typically cheaper-to-run electric appliances and EVs, make efficiency upgrades to their homes, and put solar panels on their roofs. After the end of the year — and even sooner for EVs — none of those incentives will be available.

“We’re at a ​‘use it or lose it’ point,” said Skip Wiltshire-Gordon, director of government affairs for policy strategy firm AnnDyl Policy Group. He’s encouraging people to start talking to contractors to figure out which upgrades make sense for them and to get on installers’ schedules.

Besides improving indoor air quality, switching to a heat pump lowers energy bills by hundreds of dollars for the majority of households, according to electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Savings climb still higher by installing heat-pump water heaters and rooftop solar. These benefits are especially salient as utility bills rise nationwide, a trend that experts expect the new law to exacerbate.

In addition to the tax credits, households may also be able to access federal home-energy rebates, depending on their state; that Biden-era program was untouched by the new legislation.

Here’s a run-through of the federal incentives that are, for now, available to help you electrify your life.

Upgrade your home

The Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) can get you up to $2,000 off your federal taxes for a qualifying heat-pump heater/​air conditioner or heat-pump water heater, and separately, up to $1,200 on other energy-efficient upgrades, including insulation and air-sealing materials, windows, and exterior doors. The credit will even help you pay for an energy audit to diagnose your home’s biggest upgrade opportunities. You can claim a total of $3,200 this year. Under previous law, the credit renewed annually, so before the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill,” you could claim it every year until 2033. No longer. Expires: Dec. 31.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D) takes 30% of the cost of a clean energy installation off your federal tax bill, with the actual amount uncapped. What tech counts? Solar photovoltaic panels, solar water heaters, home battery storage, geothermal heat pumps, and even home wind turbines. Feel free to go wild; you can use the tax credit for multiple projects in the same year. Expires: Dec. 31.

Upgrade your ride

The New Clean Vehicle Credit (30D) can get you $7,500 off your federal tax bill for a brand-new, qualifying EV model. However, your household must earn less than $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, or $150,000 for single filers. You can get the discount on-site when you make your purchase. Expires: Sept. 30.

The Used Clean Vehicle Credit (25E) can lop up to $4,000 off your federal tax bill for qualifying pre-owned EVs. The income maxima are half of those for 30D: $150,000 for married couples filing jointly and $75,000 for single filers. You can get the discount right at the dealership. Expires: Sept. 30.

The Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) of up to $7,500 can’t be claimed by consumers directly but still gives them a fiscal advantage. Auto dealers are able to take the federal tax credit themselves and pass on the savings to leasing customers. Called the EV ​“leasing loophole,” the credit can be used for vehicles that don’t meet the stringent requirements needed to claim 30D. Expires: Sept. 30.

July, that is, bringing two of my least favorite events: summer's merciless heat and humidity, and the annual ""privilege"" for my wife and me to each pay an extra $50 to renew our hybrid vehicles' license plates. Our older son also drives a hybrid, so he gets slapped with the additional fee, too. Full-electric vehicle owners are billed $100 on top of their basic renewal costs.

Some states actually encourage hybrid and EV purchases--offering tax credits or other incentives-- recognizing that such automobiles conserve fossil fuels and other resources, plus release fewer air pollutants with their partial-zero or zero-emission engines. However, our self-proclaimed ""Natural State"" apparently can't be bothered with environmental and public health stewardship, especially with so many elected officials full of solutions looking for nonexistent problems. Besides being full of other things ...

Anyway, hybrid/EV owners tend to be woke liberals, and it's always open season on them in Arkansas. Well, OK, some wealthier MAGA cultists here and elsewhere probably rushed out to purchase Teslas after Donald Trump--using his presidential office--endorsed the brand of his then-BFF, Elon Musk, urging the faithful to boost the company's anemic sales. You, too, can receive a similar promotional shout-out--in exchange for a large-enough campaign contribution. Trump even said he would buy one himself.

My money says Musk comped it (and claimed it as a business expense).

Then, suddenly, there was an outbreak of buyers' remorse in Trump-Land after the two most powerful men in the country (the pecking order remains open for debate) staged a very nasty public break-up, followed by weeks of trading playground insults on social media.

Meanwhile, much of the rest of the world was dealing with trivial stuff like famine, disease, wildfires, floods, and wars.

The General Assembly's ""logic"" for its hybrid/EV surcharges presumes that since they use less (or no) gasoline compared to traditional internal-combustion engines, they generate fewer fuel-tax revenues, needed for highway construction and repair. I don't dispute the math. But saving gasoline means gas-guzzler owners can drive their behemoths a few extra years before petroleum becomes extinct. And by emitting fewer pollutants, hybrids and EVs keep everybody's air a little cleaner, possibly extending the general public's lifespan, and, particularly, for those with respiratory problems.

I don't pretend to know how to quantify those positive offsets compared to gasoline tax collections, but it seems they deserve some value--maybe as much or more than the extra $50-$100 in Arkansas license fees. However, for a majority of our Legislature, resource conservation and healthier lungs invariably take a back seat to money--or get kicked off the bus entirely.

Priorities. Tradition.

At the risk of triggering yet another public relations department missive from the trucking lobby, I'd suggest looking at tractor-trailers to make up revenue deficits. Yes, we've all seen those stickers on many 18-wheelers: ""This vehicle pays $ ____ in fuel taxes each year."" (I don't recall exact amounts, but they're usually in the four- or five-figure range.) What they don't mention is how much damage big trucks inflict on public roads.

A Government Accountability Office study concluded that although a large truck axle carrying 18,000 pounds is nine times heavier than a 2,000-pound automobile axle, the big rig causes 5,000 times more road damage than the car. It's unlikely the average 18-wheeler pays 5,000 times more in license fees than most passenger vehicles. (Using that standard, a tractor-trailer's tag would cost almost $400,000, as opposed to my $78 Arkansas license plate. Obviously, an impractical solution, but fodder for discussion.)

Doubtless, the trucking industry has financed its own studies disputing such damage calculations. (For decades, tobacco companies spent untold millions on ""independent scientific"" research concluding--surprise!--that cigarette smoking didn't cause cancer. Industry whistle-blowers and impartial real science eventually made it impossible for Big Tobacco to hide behind its lab coat-wearing hired guns.)

Trucking is vital to our nation's economy; businesses couldn't function without it. My beef is not with the hardworking over-the-road drivers, but it seems a case can be made that corporations receive a nice subsidy from the states and non-commercial motorists when it comes to licensing and fuel taxes. It's just another example of the myth that government regulations protect the common good.

Mega-corporations actually run things for their own benefit. No doubt there are fewer trucking corporations than Arkansas automobile owners, but the corporations enjoy preferential treatment. After a decade and a half, the U.S. Supreme Court's people-unfriendly Citizens United decision is still paying huge dividends for Big Business. The ultimate gift that keeps on giving ...

Annual registration fees will be $200 for each battery EV, $100 for each plug-in hybrid EV, and $50 for each hybrid EV, at least for the rest of FY 2026, which runs from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, in Rhode Island.
The FY 2026 budget law also raises the state fuel tax from 37 cents per gallon to 40 cents per gallon.
As of January 2024, Rhode Island had the 14th highest fuel tax of any state, just behind Ohio and slightly ahead of Utah, according to the Tax Foundation.
Rhode Island is facing an approximately $298 million state budget deficit for FY 2026, according to an analysis by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council.","Rhode Island state lawmakers in June approved a fiscal year 2026 (FY 2026) budget that set the first registration fees for electric vehicles (EVs) in the state’s history and raised the state’s gas tax by 3 cents per gallon.

Annual registration fees will be $200 for each battery EV, $100 for each plug-in hybrid EV, and $50 for each hybrid EV, at least for the rest of FY 2026, which runs from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, in Rhode Island. This is in addition to any existing state fees pertaining to gross vehicle weight.

“EVs don't pay gas tax, and that's what that's all about,” Southern New England Independent Automobile Dealers Association (SNEIADA) Executive Director Lou Tedeschi said of the EV provisions. “They're trying to level the playing field for the people that are paying taxes on the roads that the EVs are using, and EVs aren't paying anything.”

The budget law distinguishes hybrid EVs as vehicles primarily powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) in conjunction with an electric motor.

The same legislation defines “plug-in hybrid” EVs as vehicles that can deliver power to the drivetrain solely through a battery-powered electric motor but that also incorporates the use of another fuel to power a combustion engine. These are vehicles capable of receiving energy from external sources such as outlets or charging stations.

SNEIADA’s auto dealer members don’t like “EV mandates” because buyers return them more frequently than ICE vehicles, Tedeschi said.

About 40% of purchased EVs go back onto the market within a year of purchase, he added.

“The infrastructure wasn't there, so charging was always an issue,” Tedeschi said. “For people that especially live in apartment buildings and that type of thing, limited charging areas are part of the issue.”

EV registration fees could rise again in Rhode Island in 2027.

The FY 2026 budget legislation directs the administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles to submit a report to the state’s general assembly regarding “options to index or update” EV registration fees and any other charges for the three types of EVs outlined in the bill. The report must include information on EV fee practices in other states.

The FY 2026 budget law also raises the state fuel tax from 37 cents per gallon to 40 cents per gallon. The budget also changes how inflation will factor into any subsequent increases in the fuel tax.

Until this budget year, the tax has adjusted every two years based on inflation for the previous year. But starting July 1, 2027, the calculation will align with the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) determined as of Sept. 30 of the two prior years.

As of January 2024, Rhode Island had the 14th highest fuel tax of any state, just behind Ohio and slightly ahead of Utah, according to the Tax Foundation.

This collaboration marks a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery technology beyond EVs and builds on GM and Redwood's existing collaboration.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion and sustainability at GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars — we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications. The new MOU enables Redwood to pair that integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and new U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution from cell to system.

Already, GM second-life EV batteries are being repurposed to help power the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America, at Redwood’s 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, NV, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said JB Straubel, founder and CEO of Redwood Materials. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. As power consumption increases, there’s an expanding need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

Jeff Landry viewed as a threat to the state’s way of life.

Despite years of studies and reviews, the project at the center of Louisiana’s coastal protection plans grew increasingly imperiled after Landry, a Republican, took office last year. Its collapse means that the state could lose out on more than $1.5 billion in unspent funds and may even have to repay the $618 million it already used to begin building.

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group, a mix of federal agencies overseeing the settlement funds, said that “unused project funds will be available for future Deepwater Horizon restoration activities” but would require review and approval.

A plan to rebuild disappearing land

The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion Project aimed to rebuild upward of 20 square miles (32 kilometers) of land over a 50-year period in southeast Louisiana to combat sea level rise and erosion on the Gulf Coast. When construction stalled last year because of lawsuits, trustees warned that the state would have to return the hundreds of millions of dollars it had already spent if the project did not move forward.

Former Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who once led the state’s coastal restoration agency, said that killing the project was “a boneheaded decision” not rooted in science.

“It is going to result in one of the largest setbacks for our coast and the protection of our communities in decades,” Graves said. “I don’t know what chiropractor or palm reader they got advice from on this, but — baffling that someone thought this was a good idea.”

Project supporters stressed that it would have provided a data-driven, large-scale solution to mitigate the worst effects of an eroding coastline in a state where a football field of land is lost every 100 minutes and more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land have vanished over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The project, which broke ground in 2023, would have diverted sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River to restore wetlands disappearing because of a range of factors including climate-change-induced sea level rise and a vast river levee system that choked off natural land regeneration from sediment deposits.

“The science has not changed, nor has the need for urgent action,” said Kim Reyher, executive director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. “What has changed is the political landscape.”

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group last year had noted that “no other single restoration project has been planned and studied as extensively over the past decades.”

A perceived threat to Louisiana culture

While the project had largely received bipartisan support and was championed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, his successor has been a vocal opponent. Landry recoiled at the rising price tag and amplified concerns that the massive influx of freshwater would devastate local fisheries.

Landry has said the project would “break” Louisiana’s culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting and compared it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.

“We fought this battle a long time, but Gov. Landry is the reason we won this battle,” said Mitch Jurisich, who chairs the Louisiana Oyster Task Force and sued the state over the project’s environmental impacts, including likely killing thousands of bottlenose dolphins due to the onslaught of freshwater.

Landry said in a statement that the project is “no longer financially or practically viable,” noting that the cost has doubled since 2016.

“This level of spending is unsustainable,” Landry said. The project also “threatens Louisiana’s seafood industry, our coastal culture, and the livelihoods of our fishermen — people who have sustained our state for generations.”

The project’s budget had included more than $400 million for mitigating the costs to local communities, including to help the oyster industry build new oyster beds. Project proponents said that the rapid loss of coast meant communities would be displaced anyway if the state failed to take action to protect them.

“You either move oysters or move people, and there’s only one answer to that question,” Graves said.

State seeks a smaller, cheaper solution

Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, the lead agency overseeing the project, said in a statement that the project was “no longer viable at this time based on a totality of the circumstances” including costs, litigation and a federal permit suspended earlier this year after the state halted work on the project.

Chairman Gordon “Gordy” Dove said that “our commitment to coastal restoration has not wavered” and that the state plans to pursue a smaller-scale diversion nearby. Dove told lawmakers earlier this year that the state could save at least $1 billion with a different plan to channel river water into the Gulf Coast at a rate 5 to 30 times less than the Mid-Barataria project’s 75,000 cubic feet per second.

Conservation groups bristled at the change in plans. The Mid-Barataria project’s termination marked “a complete abandonment of science-driven decision-making and public transparency,” Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement, adding that the state was “throwing away” money intended to protect its coastal residents and economy.

The coalition said alternative measures proposed by the state, such as the smaller-scale diversion or rebuilding land by dredging, were insufficient to meaningfully combat land loss and did not undergo the same level of scientific vetting as the Mid-Barataria project.

“A stopgap project with no data is not a solution,” the coalition said. “We need diversion designs backed by science — not politics.”

Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries’ long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam’s Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they’ve gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia’s growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia’s sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG math doesn’t add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they’re unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out … But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

ACP Chief Executive Jason Grumet described the move as a significant setback for US energy policy at a time of growing electricity demand.

In a statement, Grumet said the new rules introduce “three new layers of needless process and unprecedented political review” for energy project approvals. He expressed concern that the Secretary of the Interior will now be personally involved in reviewing minor project details, such as fencing and road grading, across thousands of permit applications.

Grumet called the changes “a bewildering departure” from earlier commitments by the administration to reduce energy prices and streamline bureaucracy. He argued that the new rules risk delaying urgently needed infrastructure expansion. US electricity demand is forecast to rise by 35–50% by 2040, with data centres alone expected to require more than 100 GW of new capacity.

Clean energy technologies are currently a major contributor to new capacity, accounting for 93% of additions to the US grid last year. According to the ACP, halting or slowing these developments could lead to higher costs for households and businesses.

The ACP also pointed to the scale of clean energy already deployed. Utility-scale wind, solar, and storage now total over 320 GW in capacity—enough to power nearly 80 million homes. Furthermore, over 2,000 GW of new projects are awaiting grid connection, 95% of which are renewable or storage-based.

Grumet concluded that the new Interior Department policy amounts to obstruction rather than oversight and urged the administration to support ongoing bipartisan efforts in Congress to reform permitting across all forms of energy.",https://www.windtech-international.com/images/logo/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-18 09:49:47.062364

This enhanced oversight will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative.

“Today’s actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess. “American Energy Dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

As part of this effort, the Department will address provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to eliminate longstanding right-of-way and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar projects, bringing an end to years of subsidies for economically unviable energy development.

By removing these artificial advantages, the Department is levelling the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources, such as clean coal and domestic natural gas, after years of assault under the previous administration. These actions mark a return to common-sense permitting standards that support national security, grid stability and American job creation.

-As Prepared For Delivery-

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you, Chairman Fleischmann, Ranking Member Kaptur, and the subcommittee staff on both sides of the aisle for their diligent work, especially Scott McKee, Anisha Singh, and Adam Wilson.

I am opposed to this bill which will raise energy costs for American households and businesses, hurt our competitiveness, jeopardize our energy independence and weaken our national security.

Never mind the fact that we have still not received a complete budget from the White House, we are holding this markup in a completely unprecedented time, with the Congress’s authority being challenged by a lawless Administration.

Since taking office, the Trump Administration has stolen resources, appropriated by this committee, for programs and services across the federal government that help to grow the middle class, protect the working class, support small businesses, and make sure billionaires and corporations play by the rules and pay their fair share.

The cost-of-living crisis is felt by every American family – middle class families, working families, rural families, seniors and other vulnerable Americans. But the president is not laser focused on the cost-of-living crisis. Instead, he put billionaires like Elon Musk in charge of the government.

President Trump has attacked and destroyed programs created by Congress and funded by the Appropriations Committee that protect our national security and help increase domestic energy production.

They are substituting Congress’ decisions and judgment with their own, turning Article I of the Constitution on its head.

These cuts are not only felt in Washington, DC. They affect all of our constituents.

Just a few months ago, states across New England, including my state of Connecticut, were ready to begin an ambitious and collaborative effort to increase energy transmission capacity across our region, to build resiliency and lower energy bills.

Nearly $400 million was going to be invested through the Department of Energy’s Grid Innovation Program to provide onshore connections for offshore wind power, improve the electric grid, and install energy storage through a project called Power Up New England.

But the President’s Day One executive order abruptly halted offshore wind energy projects in their tracks, and the Department of Energy froze Power Up New England’s grant. That project was expected to bring enough energy online to power about 2 million homes, and reduce energy costs for customers by up to $1.5 billion per year.

The level of uncertainty and chaos now occurring is not an accident – it is a direct result of the Administration’s policies and lawlessness.

Energy demand is higher than ever and only increasing. Cheap, reliable energy is the basis of a successful economy, and the future lies with low-cost wind and solar, not more expensive oil, gas, and coal. We have to increase energy supply or costs will continue to rise for the American people – and we will be dependent on importing energy to meet our goals.

Instead of focusing on ways to help lower energy costs, House Republicans are using this bill to further gut critical federal resources and advance their own ideological agenda.

Their cut of nearly half the budget for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is a direct attack on the programs that lower energy bills for working families, create good-paying jobs in our communities, and keep America competitive.

Their bill revokes funding that supports hydrogen energy, battery recycling, and energy improvements in public schools, as well as support for public-private clean energy projects.

Their bill undermines the very programs that help us stop the spread of nuclear weapons, detect nuclear activity, and uphold arms control efforts that make America and the world safer – and it underfunds efforts to clean up sites contaminated by our nation’s early atomic energy program.

All of this mere days after Republicans passed and the President signed the Big Ugly Bill, a law that gives massive tax breaks to billionaires and the biggest corporations while driving up home energy bills for families by as much as 30 percent.

I cannot support this bill. Instead of working with Democrats to lower prices and invest in technology that promotes our energy independence, House Republicans are pushing a bill that raises energy costs for families and businesses, and eliminates good-paying jobs.

Thank you, and I yield back.

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.
Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.","HANOI, Vietnam -- Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he said.

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out ... But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said.","WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.

The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said.

Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet.

Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.""

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4b431e07-b713-45ac-b4f3-3dcabacf52b8/wirestory_7b800db8d6cf6fffbee28039f42d2daf_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-07-18 09:50:10.334300

Donald Trump signed his massive domestic policy and tax bill into law on Friday, July 4. As his administration celebrates, many Americans are contemplating its effects closer to home. With deep cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and renewable energy projects, the bill is likely to have a devastating effect on low-income and rural communities across the country.

But while Republican governors in states that rely on those programs have largely remained silent about the bill’s effects, tribal leaders across the country are not mincing words about the upcoming fallout for their communities.

“These bills are an affront to our sovereignty, our lands, and our way of life. They would gut essential health and food security programs, roll back climate resilience funding, and allow the exploitation of our sacred homelands without even basic tribal consultation,” said Chalyee Éesh Richard Peterson, president of the Tlingit and Haida in Alaska, in a statement. “This is not just bad policy—it is a betrayal of the federal trust responsibility to tribal nations.”

Tribes across the country are particularly worried about the mega-bill’s hit to clean energy, complicating the development of critical wind and solar projects. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, tribal households face 6.5 times more electrical outages per year and a 28% higher energy burden compared to the average U.S. household. An estimated 54,000 people living on tribal lands have no electricity.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden administration opened up new federal funding opportunities, increased the loan authority of the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program, and created new tax credits for wind energy, battery storage, large-scale solar farms, and programs to repurpose lands harmed by environmental degradation for related energy projects. Trump’s new bill largely dismantles these programs.

Historically, tribes have had limited access to capital to fund clean energy projects. Through the IRA, new projects were driven by tribes to address community and infrastructure needs on their terms. According to tribes and energy advocacy groups, these projects not only help build energy infrastructure for each tribal nation but also create jobs, boost local economies, and affirm sovereignty.

Crystal Miller, a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe who heads government affairs and policy at the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, underlined the existential outcomes for tribal communities. “It is extremely life or death if you’re talking about clean energy projects, in particular solar, which provide energy to homes, provide heat to homes that wouldn’t have it without, because they don’t have lines run to their community,” she said.

Prior to the House of Representatives vote on the bill, the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy was part of a broader group that sent letters to Congress warning of the consequences for tribes, treaties, and domestic energy priorities. These “are not only economic but also environmental and humanitarian,” they wrote, after the U.S. Senate narrowly approved the bill 51-50 earlier this week, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

Miller pointed out that tribes weren’t consulted on the terms of the bill before it headed to Trump’s desk, yet they will be forced to live with the consequences. Tribal leaders across the United States warned the legislation could jeopardize projects critical to their communities’ energy needs: A tribal village in Alaska’s attempt to curb high electricity costs by establishing a tribal utility; the Cheyenne River Sioux’s efforts to navigate long, harsh winters in South Dakota; and California tribes’ development of microgrids to offset power outages due to wildfires. The Hopi Tribe in Arizona said the sovereign nation’s microgrid would fail after a historic transition from coal.

Tribal leaders also warned there could be widespread job losses across the 574 federally recognized tribal nations, an outcome at odds with Trump’s economic promises. “When we talk about bringing jobs back to America and keeping them here domestically, that also includes tribal nations,” Miller said.

Kimberly Yazzie, a Diné professor at the University of British Columbia whose previous research focused on tribal clean energy development, called the legislation a big setback—though not entirely unexpected. “Tribes have been presented with challenges in the past hundred years and this is a challenge we’ll have to face,” she said. “It will come down to the tribal, entity, and individual level, and how they want to best move forward.”

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he said.

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

A Region 5 EPA spokesperson told the Morning Journal via email that the agency now plans to thoroughly investigate those decisions.
“We are very concerned by claims that have come to light over the past few months,” the EPA said.
It was about negligently allowing flawed testing to support the false and deceptive Norfolk Southern narrative,” said GAP Senior Environmental Officer Leslie Pacey.
This is smoking gun proof that EPA deceived the public by allowing Norfolk Southern to move the goal posts.” selverd@mojonews.com","EAST PALESTINE — The Government Accountability Project (GAP), a watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., continues to hold the feet of Norfolk Southern and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the fire for what the GAP has repeatedly called a fumbled response to the 2023 train derailment and one of the biggest chemical releases in U.S. history.

In its latest charge, GAP accuses the EPA of manipulating the scope of dioxin contamination in the village, citing an EPA letter dated one month after the derailment recently obtained by the group through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. According to the GAP, the letter proves the EPA directed Norfolk Southern to remove certain derailment chemicals from its sampling list and to collect more baseline soil samples – meant to reflect pre-derailment dioxin levels — at locations heavily exposed to the initial fire and the vent-and-burn of vinyl chloride.

“It is widely known that baseline samples must come from unpolluted areas to ensure an accurate measurement of normal environmental conditions,” the GAP stated in an emailed statement. “Otherwise, the ‘baseline’ is meaningless, making it impossible to meaningfully evaluate the presence, concentration, or danger of contaminants and chemical detections above, at or below normal levels.”

The U.S. EPA, which was under the direction of the Biden Administration when the letter was sent from East Palestine Lead EPA Incident Commander Ralph Dollhopf to a Houston-based environmental project management and consulting firm as well as Norfolk Southern Legal counsel but is now directed by President Donald Trump, deviated from its standard practice of defending its East Palestine response decisions when asked for a comment on the GAP latest charge. A Region 5 EPA spokesperson told the Morning Journal via email that the agency now plans to thoroughly investigate those decisions.

“We are very concerned by claims that have come to light over the past few months,” the EPA said. “The Trump Administration is committed to maximum transparency and as such we intend to conduct a thorough review of decisions made in the aftermath of the train derailment. We will work to ensure the health and safety of the people of East Palestine.”

The claim of the EPA covering up the full scope of the derailment contamination comes on the heels of a report last month that accused the Biden Administration of not disclosing health risks – chief among them “cancer clusters” – those exposed to the derailment chemicals face. The Trump Administration slammed the previous one for “another outrageous example of the gross mismanagement and poor treatment of Americans” when the GAP released internal Federal Emergency Management Emergency Agency (FEMA) emails in June that discussed the very-real impact of the derailment on public health.

As for the GAP’s most-recent accusation, the group said the EPA and Norfolk Southern failed to consider wind direction or acknowledged the winds changed near the time of the vent-and-burn, meaning deposits from the plume likely fell where baseline samples were taken.

The GAP insists the letter proves what whistleblowers, scientists and experts have been saying for over two years — the testing to determine the true extent of contamination following the derailment was at best inaccurate and at worst intentionally distorted.

“EPA’s soil sampling strategy was never about finding the truth. It was about negligently allowing flawed testing to support the false and deceptive Norfolk Southern narrative,” said GAP Senior Environmental Officer Leslie Pacey. “Because EPA ignored reverse wind patterns on the day of the vent and burn, the entire evacuation plan and soil sampling plan appears to be invalid, putting residents in harm’s way during the illegal open burn and concealing the full extent of dioxin contamination in East Palestine. This is smoking gun proof that EPA deceived the public by allowing Norfolk Southern to move the goal posts.”

Backed by $4 billion in planned investment and nearly half a billion dollars in state funds, the automaker was set to transform the site into an EV-making powerhouse.

But instead of mass-producing electric pickups, the plant is shifting gears toward a more familiar formula.

It’s now being retooled to churn out some of GM’s most powerful – and fuel-hungry – combustion models.

GM shifts focus to gas-powered trucks and SUVs at Orion

From 2027, GM’s Orion facility in Michigan will begin building the gas-powered Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra – three of its most iconic and high-profit vehicles.

That’s a big pivot from its original goal: transforming the factory into a clean-energy hub producing EV versions of the Silverado and Sierra.

The reason for the change?

EV pickup sales have been slower than expected, forcing General Motors to rethink its approach.

Now, the company says it’s simply responding to ‘continued strong customer demand’ for its combustion engine lineup.

It’s a bold move, especially considering GM received $480 million in state grants specifically to support EV production at the site.

But despite the shift in plans, Michigan officials say GM is still in compliance with its incentive deal.

The company hasn’t explained why production won’t start until 2027, but it likely needs time to retool the plant for gas-powered vehicles.

Switching from EVs to full-size trucks isn’t as easy as flipping a switch – it’ll take time to install new equipment and restructure the plant.

Either way, a plant once slated for electric vehicles will now be producing some of the most in-demand gas-powered trucks.

Orion’s role in GM’s expanding truck strategy

This move isn’t about swapping one plan for another – it’s about scaling up.

The Orion plant isn’t replacing truck production elsewhere. Instead, it’s being added to the lineup, alongside GM’s existing facilities in Texas, Indiana, Mexico, and Canada.

That means more capacity for gas-powered trucks and SUVs at a time when they’re still leading sales.

The Escalade, Silverado, and Sierra remain some of GM’s most popular and profitable vehicles, so increasing output where demand is strongest makes business sense.

It also highlights where the industry is right now. The transition to electric is still underway – just not at the pace many predicted.

Bringing Orion back into the fold for gas-powered models gives GM a way to stay competitive today, while still keeping one eye on the electric future.

The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.”

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.

The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden’s administration, the White House said.

Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,” the White House said in a fact sheet.

Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA’s offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help … unleash American energy,” Zeldin said.",https://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/preview-1321.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 11:03:46.640184

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan's largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska's vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he said.

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it's still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out ... But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out ... But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.

Uber announced Thursday it or its third-party partners will purchase and operate Lucid Gravity SUVs outfitted with Nuro Driver technology on its ride-sharing network. The company aims to launch the first vehicle later in 2026 in an unidentified major U.S. city, with plans to deploy at least 20,000 of the robotaxis over six years.

The ride-sharing company also announced it’s making separate multi-hundred-million dollar investments in both Lucid and Nuro. That funding will include $300 million for Lucid that will be used in part to upgrade to its assembly line to integrate Nuro hardware into the Gravity vehicles, according to the EV company.

Lucid soared 40% — the biggest gain in more than two and a half years — to $3.21 per share as of 1:12 p.m. in regular trading in New York. Uber shares were down 0.4% to $90.35.

Separately, Lucid also said it plans a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, subject to shareholder approval.

The Lucid-Nuro deal adds to more than a dozen partnerships that Uber has announced with autonomous vehicle tech developers and carmakers, including Waymo and Volkswagen Group of America, as it aims to be the go-to commercial app for robotaxis. Earlier this week, Uber announced a partnership with Chinese AV maker Baidu to deploy robotaxis in several non-U.S. markets. Currently autonomous rides are available through the Uber app in Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta and Abu Dhabi.

The substantial investments by Uber further underscore its strategy shift away from developing autonomous technology in-house, as it did under co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, in favor of partnering with and investing in firms that specialize in AV. Uber has monetized some of its equity stakes in firms such as autonomous freight company Aurora Innovation Inc. to fund future investments in the driverless ecosystem, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said.

Competition is intensifying in the still-nascent robotaxi market, with EV giant Tesla Inc. rolling out its long-promised service in Austin last month and CEO Elon Musk pledging to expand to other cities.

Uber first partnered with Nuro in 2022 on food delivery robots. The following year Nuro pivoted from building and scaling custom AVs to focusing on developing autonomous software.

The Uber partnership also adds a notable customer for Lucid, one of the few pure play EV makers in the United States, as it works to popularize Gravity, its second vehicle model. The company has been working to amp up production and deliveries, and has estimated it will produce 20,000 vehicles in 2025, more than double the year before.

Prototype robotaxis developed by Lucid and Nuro are already in operation on Nuro’s Las Vegas closed-circuit testing grounds.

Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said Uber chose its SUV because the company can integrate the necessary hardware at its factory. Nuro’s software will be added once Uber receives the vehicles. Winterhoff had said in a call with investors in May that the company was in advanced discussions with partners about using Gravity for autonomous vehicle purposes.

“This is a stepping stone on our journey to expand our tech leadership from electric vehicles and licensing into partnerships in other areas,” Winterhoff told Bloomberg this week. “A lot can happen in six years. I really see this as the first starting point.”

Lucid also has been working on advanced driver systems and announced earlier this year that it had partnered with King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.

Winterhoff said the company still plans to work on its own autonomous and driver assistance technology. This week Lucid separately announced it’s adding hands-free drive and lane change assist to its software suite.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/11/17/PDTN/71613958007-2024-la-auto-show-lucidgravityfr.jpg?crop=3999,2251,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-18 09:53:19.257254

Pacific Fusion announced this week that Albuquerque is one of two finalists for a $1 billion fusion research facility that would create more than 200 permanent jobs and hundreds of construction positions. The company expects to make a final decision by late September.

The 225,000-square-foot facility would be built in Mesa del Sol and focus on developing fusion energy technology — the same process that powers the sun by combining hydrogen atoms to create massive amounts of clean electricity.

“Albuquerque is an epicenter of advanced technology, and it makes perfect sense that Pacific Fusion would want to be part of our innovation ecosystem,” said Mayor Tim Keller in a statement. “This is a full-circle story, building directly on technology developed at Sandia National Labs.”

The announcement comes as Albuquerque’s technology sector is experiencing significant growth. The city has seen a 37% spike in AI-related job postings, with salaries ranging from $75,000 to $200,000 for relevant fields, according to recent employment data.

New Mexico ranks third nationally in clean energy job growth, expanding at 5.9% with over 13,000 clean energy workers statewide. The state’s clean energy sector is considered a strategic priority for economic development.

Unlike nuclear fission, which splits atoms and creates radioactive waste, fusion combines light atomic nuclei like hydrogen to form heavier elements, releasing enormous amounts of energy with minimal environmental impact. The process produces no long-lived radioactive waste and emits no carbon dioxide.

Pacific Fusion’s approach uses fast electrical pulses to create powerful magnetic fields that compress and heat fuel containers in less than 100 billionths of a second. The company aims to achieve “net facility gain” — generating more energy than the system consumes — a critical milestone for commercial fusion power.

The company’s technology builds directly on breakthrough research from Sandia National Laboratories’ Z Machine, a massive pulse-power facility that has helped advance fusion science for decades.

“New Mexico is a natural fit for this project,” said Keith LeChien, Pacific Fusion’s co-founder and chief technology officer, in a statement. “The Z Machine at Sandia National Laboratories helped lay the foundation for our approach, and the state’s legacy of applied physics innovation, deep talent pool, and business-friendly environment put it in a unique position to become a national leader in fusion energy innovation.”

Pacific Fusion was founded in 2023 and operates from Fremont, California. The company raised more than $900 million in Series A funding in October 2024 from investors including General Catalyst, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and tech leaders Eric Schmidt and Patrick Collison. The funding uses a milestone-based structure where money is released as the company achieves specific technical goals.

Albuquerque is competing against a location in the California Bay Area, where Pacific Fusion currently operates. The company has been working with the New Mexico Economic Development Department and signed a memorandum of understanding with the state to pursue the project.

“New Mexico is uniquely positioned to become a national leader in advanced energy and innovation, and initiatives like this are turning that potential into reality,” said EDD Secretary Rob Black. “Pacific Fusion is aligned with our priorities for sustainable energy solutions and long-term growth, as well as our commitment to building a future-focused economy that benefits all New Mexicans.”

The proposed facility would be a research center, not a power plant, and would “operate safely and quietly,” according to the company. The project would undergo environmental and planning reviews as part of the approval process.

“Projects like this bring high-quality jobs, drive new investment, create a supply chain, and show the world that our city is serious about building a clean energy future,” said Max Gruner, Albuquerque’s economic development director.",https://citydesk.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/07/Untitled-design-29.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:49:56.098123

When you are one of the wealthiest people in human history, naturally, you want more, more, more! His insatiable greed has inspired him to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build a new AI campus he claims will be nearly as big as Manhattan. Hosanna! What a wonderful world it will be; what a glorious time to be free!!

According to The Guardian, the first multi-gigawatt data center will be called Prometheus and is expected to become operational in 2026. A second supercalifragilisticexpialidocious data center will be a 5 gigawatt monstrosity called Hyperion that’s almost as big as Zuckerberg’s ego. According to industry publication SemiAnalysis, Meta was on track to be the first AI lab to bring a gigawatt-plus supercluster online. Oh, the rapture.

What is up with these tech bros? Elon Musk has Colossus, Zuck will have Prometheus and Hyperion. If we didn’t know better, we would say those two and Bezos are locked in little more than a dick-measuring contest. It might be funny if they were not gaming the system to limit their tax liability and supporting members of Congress who want to put disabled people to work picking crops in order to qualify for Medicare. None of them seems to have a shred of human decency or concern for their fellow passengers on Spaceship Earth. A pox on all their houses!

Zuckerberg said the cost of these new data centers would be swiftly offset by increases in advertising revenues. Last year, the company grossed $165 billion. Its newest division, known as Superintelligence Labs, will soak up even more ad revenue from the Meta AI app, image-to-video ad tools, and smart glasses. Of course, we could short circuit those plans by not using the Meta app, image-to-video ad tools, or smart glasses, but that’s not going to happen. We can’t afford groceries or a down payment on a home, but now, thanks to the brain of Zuckerberg, we can shop till we drop 24 hours a day. What a country. What a world.

Meta has already raised its 2025 capital expenditure predictions to as much as $72 billion in order not to be left behind by OpenAI, xAI, and Google.

Who Will Pay For The Energy For Data Centers?

When it comes to deciding who will pay for the grid upgrades needed to power these gigantic data centers, Zuckerberg, of course, has nothing to say. No doubt he thinks a half dozen nuclear or methane-fired power plants will just magically appear when needed — facilities that ordinary utility customers will pay for over the next 30 to 40 years while he continues to funnel billions into his overstuffed pockets.

According to a report released today by MeteoMatics, “the pressure that comes with powering AI is now mixing with pressure from increasing events like heatwaves, causing significant strain from both the business and consumer sector for grids.” The report says 65 percent of energy leaders are concerned about their ability to meet the increase in energy demand.

These data center operators are slick. They are demanding that utility companies and grid operators step up to the plate to meet their expected needs — which could require billions in commitments to new generating facilities and transmission lines — but they want to hedge their bets, in case the AI craze doesn’t happen the way they think it will. It’s a classic “heads we win, tails you lose” situation that could put ratepayers on the hook for tens of billions of dollars worth of new electricity infrastructure upgrades.

Ohio PUC Sets New Policy For Data Centers

This week, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, in a 99 page unanimous decision. said data enter operators had to commit to paying for at least 85 percent of the upgrades they say they will need, even if the demand they expect doesn’t materialize.

In an email to CleanTechnica, Inside Climate News reported that the case before the Ohio PUC consumed more than a year of hearings and public comment, with American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, claiming the data center operators like Google and Meta want a get out of jail free card that would allow them to walk away without penalty if they wanted to.

In its decision, the Ohio PUC created a new rate structure for data centers, based on its finding that they “pose a different type of risk,” as well as an increased amount of risk. Dan Gearino of ICN said the new policy “probably is a win for consumers … and it’s a loss for data centers, since the commission rejected an alternative plan from the companies along with the companies’ main arguments.”

The new rate structure applies only to new data centers with a peak demand of at least 25 megawatts. If a data center is already built or already has an agreement with AEP to receive power, this policy doesn’t apply. Under the new rule, data centers will need to pay for at least 85 percent of the energy they sign up to use, even if they end up using less. That provision helps to cover the costs of building infrastructure to serve the new development and protects other ratepayers from having to shoulder an extra burden.

The requirements would last for 12 years in a typical example, which would include a four-year ramp up to full capacity. After that, the contract between AEP and the data center would automatically continue unless either side gives three years’ notice of an intent to terminate. The policy also allows for a data center to immediately end the contract after eight years by paying an exit fee equivalent to three years of electricity use.

“I think this is an improvement on the status quo,” Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, told ICN. But he thinks consumer protections should be even stronger. “My view is that the data centers are underpaying,” he said, because data centers are going to require grid upgrades that are paid for by all of AEP’s Ohio customer base. Many of those costs will be paid by data centers themselves since they will be major electricity consumers, but there is nothing in the new rules specifying that data centers must cover all of the costs needed to serve them.

Ideally, Gearino said, the regulations mean some of the most speculative data center plans will never reach the stage of making a power agreement with the utility. That, in turn, will make it easier for AEP to plan for its future needs.

A Moratorium

AEP put a moratorium on new data center connections in 2023, when companies already in the process of building data centers in its area said they would need 5,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity by 2030 — more than the current peak demand of the entire Columbus metro area. In addition, the utility says it received inquiries about whether it could provide an additional 30,000 megawatts of electricity — a number larger that the total demand for the entire New England region.

Lucas Fykes, director of energy policy for the Data Center Coalition, a membership organization for the data center industry, told ICN in an email his group was disappointed with the Ohio ruling. “The decision is a stark departure from solutions enacted in other key data center markets and, more consequentially, is a deviation from the long established, sound rate making principles that have carried both Ohio and the nation through periods of electricity demand growth and flat demand,” Ohio has now joined Indiana in having similar approaches to data center policy, and both states did so in response to requests from AEP subsidiaries.

Suzanne Glatz, an energy policy consultant in Pennsylvania, told ICN the Ohio and Indiana policies can be replicated elsewhere because they provide clear consumer benefits but remain within the range of what many businesses would view as reasonable. “The states that are facing [data center development] will be looking at what Ohio has done and what’s happened in Indiana, and will figure out what fits and what elements make the most sense,” she said.

“We could end up all paying an awful lot more for our electricity if it’s not done well, and those costs might be also more unevenly spread,” she said. “The other risk is … reliability, because if we don’t do this right, and we don’t recognize where data centers are going to be developed, we could be facing a mismatch of where the generation and transmission are needed versus where the [demand] is.”

Demand Bigger Than Expected

One of the big questions about the current boom is how large it will be. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory issued a report in December showing huge differences in forecasts for data center electricity demand, which indicates a lot of uncertainty. On the high side, forecasters have said data centers may consume more than 400 terawatt-hours by 2030 — nearly 10 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States last year.

Gearino said the forecasts for data center power keep growing, “which suggests the actual numbers in 2030 may be a lot higher than even the highest forecasts.” And all so Mark Zuckerberg can get richer and richer selling ads for things we don’t need. It is at times like this that we should be paying more attention to the writing of Lloyd Alter and his thoughts on sufficiency. Are there any rational limits on the growth of digital technology? If so, they are not yet apparent.

If somebody said we needed 30,000 megawatts of new generating capacity to charge electric cars, people would be trooping up Main Streets all across America carrying torches pitchforks.

First, the Republican Party for the most part has tried to sell-off or give away our precious and ecologically important public lands. The House of Representatives attempted to do this via a 500,000 acre sell-off and were stopped cold recently.

Now at the end of June 2025, the Senate has rejected Senator Mike Lee’s (Utah) proposal to sell-off several million acres of our recreationally important public lands, as the budget bill is being debated and voted on.

10,000’s of U.S. citizens let their Representative and Senators know that any sell-off was a bad idea and the “People” won! Thanks to those Senators from both parties who stated publicly that they would vote against the entire bill if this bad proposal was kept.

But mostly, thanks to all Sierrans, other conservation and environmental organizations, and citizens who loudly and clearly stated that such impoverishment of our natural heritage and legacy wouldn’t be tolerated.

The second big victory is that the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to listen to ExxonMobil’s shouts for more pollution in the Baytown and Houston Area. The Sierra Club, Environment Texas, and Public Interest Network have waged a 15-year lawsuit to get ExxonMobil to pay fines for thousands of violations of air pollution laws and air permit requirements. ExxonMobil will now have to pay $14.25 million dollars in penalties, the largest citizen’s lawsuit federal Clean Air Act penalty ever assessed.

By doing this, ExxonMobil will have publicly admitted and paid for its callous indifference for People’s health all so that it could save money force its air pollution the Public.

Keep fighting the good fight. Never give in! Always believe in good and the need to protect our environment’s nest from pollution, degradation, and destruction.

US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration, announcing two years of regulatory relief for coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters.
Back in April, the EPA granted 70 coal-fired plants a two-year reprieve from federal mandates targeting toxic emissions.
In a broader push, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March an ambitious plan to repeal dozens of major environmental regulations covering air, water and climate protections.
“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.","Donald Trump plans to reverse Biden's environmental regulations, granting two years of relief to coal-fired plants and chemical manufacturers, citing national security. These exemptions allow industries to comply with older EPA standards, which Trump deems less expensive and more attainable. Environmental groups condemn the move, fearing increased pollution and health risks, while industry associations applaud the deregulation.

US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration, announcing two years of regulatory relief for coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters. The decision, framed as a national security measure, was revealed through a series of presidential proclamations issued late on Thursday. The exemptions apply to a broad range of facilities, including taconite iron ore processors critical to steel production, and chemical manufacturers involved in making semiconductors and sterilising medical devices. These industries will now be permitted to comply with older Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards that were in effect prior to the Biden-era rules, the White House confirmed. Trump criticised the regulations imposed under President Joe Biden as prohibitively expensive and, in some cases, impossible to meet. A White House fact sheet claimed the exemptions would allow “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs.” During his previous term, Trump’s EPA had already granted waivers to numerous coal-fired plants, citing similar reasons. The agency also gave polluting industries a chance to apply for relief from rules aimed at limiting emissions of hazardous chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. To streamline the process, the EPA introduced a dedicated email system that companies could use to seek presidential exemptions under the Clean Air Act. Environmental groups have strongly condemned the move, branding the new EPA contact point a “polluters’ portal” that could enable widespread avoidance of environmental laws. Advocates warned of the dangers associated with exposure to toxic substances, especially mercury, which can lead to brain damage in children and birth defects in unborn babies. Industry associations representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical firms quickly mobilised to request blanket exemptions from federal pollution controls. Under the Clean Air Act, the president has authority to grant such temporary exemptions if required technologies are not broadly available and the exemptions serve national security interests. Back in April, the EPA granted 70 coal-fired plants a two-year reprieve from federal mandates targeting toxic emissions. According to a list published on the agency’s website, 47 power providers operating at least 66 coal plants have already received exemptions from Biden-era regulations. In a broader push, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March an ambitious plan to repeal dozens of major environmental regulations covering air, water and climate protections. Zeldin hailed the move as the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.” However, news agency AP warned of the potential consequences. as the targeted regulations could have prevented an estimated 30,000 deaths and saved $275 billion annually. “Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.

What sense does it make for this Energy and Water Bill to slash the Department of Energy's vital research and development programs?","WASHINGTON — Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-09), Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, delivered the following remarks at the full committee’s markup of its fiscal year 2026 bill:

Thank you very much, Chairman Cole. Ranking Member DeLauro, my dear friend, Chair Fleischmann and all the members as we gather today to mark up this Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development Bill. I have to restate, Chairman Fleischmann, I have truly appreciated working with you. You are always open to suggestions and, to all of our colleagues on this subcommittee that is a very, bipartisan subcommittee to develop and pass these bills, and our committee has long had this practice. We affect every single Congressional District in this country.

I'm truly saddened that this vital subcommittee is, being steered yet again to return to a partisan process not caused by our subcommittee, but as we move forward with this Fiscal Year 2026 House bill.

I would like to begin by thanking our diligent staff for all their hard work on this bill from the minority staff Scott McKee, Anisha Singh, and Adam Wilson, and on our personal staff, Kaitlin Ulin, TJ Lowdermilk, and Margaret McInnis. Truly thank you to you all.

Engineered energy and water systems undergird America's way of life. They are not optional, but essential to sustaining life. Of late, we have been piercingly reminded about our subcommittee's purpose, especially as related to water management by the extreme flash flooding and tragic loss of over 132 lives, and with over 101 missing, in the Guadalupe River catchment area in Texas.

The deadly West Virginia flash flooding this past month significantly damaged over 100 homes. Unfortunately, taking the lives of at least nine people, including a three year old, in Valley Grove, West Virginia. And we've seen flooding events in central North Carolina and New Mexico. All our hearts go out to the families of the victims and their communities. These tragedies inform us of the power of water and wild energy in our atmosphere. Not because of cloud seeding, but because of nature's awesome power generated inside the thin seven layer atmosphere surrounding our spinning and rotating earth. Let me be clear. No matter how much members on the other side of the aisle want to pretend that the climate isn't changing, for the record, the last ten years are the ten hottest in recorded history.

So many have been held up on their plane flights back here. It’s an unusual change in the weather across this country, and members are personally experiencing these delays, as are the American people. These recent floods are made worse by the heating atmosphere. We had four 1,000 year floods last week alone. That is a record.

So far in July, our country has seen over 1,200 flooding events, more than double the normal for an average July, and we're just halfway through the month. Constitutionally, it is our sworn duty to prepare and protect the people in our communities, and it is hard to accept that no warning sirens had been installed along the Guadalupe River, despite prior tragedies along that very treacherous corridor. Our nation needs to install warning systems and build resilient infrastructure, and we are behind.

For example, in a district like mine, we had to bring funding for tornado sirens many years ago. I was shocked that they didn't exist. And in Ohio, we do zone to prevent flooding from threatening human life. But many places in our country do not, and we cannot keep bailing out places that are irresponsible in their behavior. My home in the City of Toledo has gone into Billions of dollars of debt to build new sewers, along with gigantic underground catchment basins, some as large as two football fields in size, in order to handle increasing water loads.

We are making investments all over our district to protect Lake Erie shoreline and its tributaries. But in places where infrastructure investments aren't cost effective, how does our nation make sure that families will be protected with adequate local planning and disaster warning systems? America needs more rigor in land and water planning systems, and my friends, quite frankly, we as a nation don't get a grade A on that.

It is our awesome responsibility as public servants to address the structural shortcomings at the federal, state, and local level that contributed to the recent loss of life. Sadly, this Republican energy and water bill does not meet our nation's imperative for the future. It's over $700 Million below last year. We must invest faster in modern infrastructure, and become energy independent in perpetuity. That is our responsibility. In a nation of 350 million people headed to 500 million people, we must make energy cost less and invest in grid resilience, which is sadly behind what this country needs.

I find it interesting that Russell Vought, the chief architect of the budget cuts that we are being asked to endure in this bill, claims that he's so savvy. But how is it possible? He's supposed to be known as a budget cutter, right? But how is it possible that he has added $3.4 Trillion, despite our cuts to the national debt over the next ten years? Over 20 years, he's adding $9.5 Trillion, and $18.7 Trillion by 30 years out. So that's a total of $32 Trillion, if temporary measures are extended permanently. Think about that one. So if they're doing such a good job over there at the Executive Branch and OMB, how come the national debt is rising when we're cutting every single bill that we are discussing today, and those that will follow?

This bill fails to address the cost of living crisis. The price of electricity has risen 5.8% over the last year. Every family in this country knows that, and even higher energy bills lie ahead for families and businesses. China is investing record levels in energy, my friends. But this bill retreats from US global leadership in the future in the form of a diversified and clean energy economy. This energy and water bill cuts $1.6 Billion, or 47%, from the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The adage analysis prevention is worth a pound of cure applies to our nation's imperative to deliver clean, affordable, and secure energy to the American people and to ensure our nation leads, not lags, in the global race toward energy independence in perpetuity, including an abundant clean energy future.

Our mom and dad taught us how to be thrifty and not wasteful. Dad would say, “it's not how much you make, it's how much you save,” and that applies to energy and fresh water. Conservation are good goals for the future of our children and grandchildren, and we've made some strides toward those horizons. The United States on the oil front is producing more than ever before, record high levels of production, but we are still tethered to a volatile global energy market dominated by cartels and petroleum dictators like OPEC. We must advance an all of the above energy strategy to be successful long term. Europe learned the hard way about being too reliant on one source of energy, Russian gas. In their case when Russia invaded Ukraine. Let us heed that chilling warning.

China aims to be the OPEC for the next century, and gain dominance in clean energy, and they are well on their way. Their investments dwarf the rest of the world's. A Chinese company has developed an EV battery. Are you ready for this? That can travel 1,800 miles in a single charge and recharge in just five minutes. Think about that. What sense does it make for this Energy and Water Bill to slash the Department of Energy's vital research and development programs?

The Republican plan cripples America's energy future by awarding giant tax breaks to Millionaires and Billionaires in the Big Billionaire Bonanza Bill that's creating the big, huge additions to the debt. America must focus on building an economy that works for everyone, especially our working families and retirees, not just the wealthy few. The bill this bill eliminates funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and worse, it revokes $5.1 Billion of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources from the Department of Energy that will cede the US global lead in hydrogen, direct air capture, battery recycling, and energy savings in every public and private structure. Already, US businesses have canceled. This is shocking number. More than $15 Billion in investments in new factories and electricity production projects this year, as a result of the Republican Bonanza for Billionaires Bill. Those canceled projects were expected to create nearly 12,000 new jobs, all now gone.

I can remember when we brought back the heavy Ford heavy truck line from Mexico to the region that I represent, and I stood next to the CEO of the company at that time, and I said, what can I do to keep these jobs anchored here in Northern Ohio? And he looked at me and he didn't waste a moment. He said, cut my energy bills by a third. Well, think about that one.

Thus I strongly oppose the Republican cuts to vital energy production and conservation and our future through the US Department of Energy. Shortchanging these advances pushes our nation backwards and raises already high energy prices for consumers. Why drive America backwards by slow walking energy innovation and failing to modernize our nation's electric grids, which are old.

In other areas, this bill dangerously short changes our national security, and this is really critical. The bill slashes $412 Million from the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account. This effectively guts our efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, detect covert nuclear threats, and uphold arms control agreements that keep us safe. All a big gift for Iran, Russia, China, Belarus, and North Korea. Think about that Spiderweb of Tyranny.

Additionally, this bill turns its back on communities still living with the toxic legacy of America's atomic past. Zeroing out the Army Corps program to clean up radioactive waste at early nuclear sites. It slashes $779 Million from the Department of Energy's nuclear cleanup efforts. Delaying the cleanup of these communities have been promised for decades. I'll note for the committee that one of these sites is in the village of Luckey, Ohio, not so far from my district, and believe me, you don't want to breathe in or ingest atomic waste anywhere in the world. Finally, this bill includes numerous controversial poison pill riders that sadly show some extremists among us are not interested in real bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.

In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. America can, and must meet the new age frontiers of energy and water. We owe it to the future. Nature is signaling, times are changing. And it's good to remind ourselves, 200 years after Daniel Webster stated this, that is up on the wall in the House of Representatives chamber. “Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether also we in our time and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.” That is our mandate today.

Thank you, and I yield back.

The upper chamber’s version of the bill, H.R. 4, now heads to the House, where Republicans will race to meet a Friday night deadline.

Senators voted 51-48 to advance the bill after eliminating or narrowing the scope of some of the White House’s requested cuts Tuesday, and after hours of consecutive amendment roll calls Wednesday. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republican no votes.

None of the amendments passed, but they served as another opportunity for Democrats to put Republicans on the record opposing public broadcasting funds and foreign aid that Congress appropriated last year.

“Think about what we are doing; think about the example we are setting,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), before the Senate voted on his amendment to strike a rescission of $496 million for international disaster assistance.

“I can think of few more despicable acts on this floor in my 15 years,” he said. His amendment failed 49-50, with Collins, Murkowski and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) joining Democrats.

The package would repeal well over half a billion dollars in already approved funding for overseas disaster aid, myriad climate programs abroad, and the implementation of multilateral environmental initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol and the Clean Technology Fund.

More broadly, the bill targets about $7.9 billion in current funding for the State Department and $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which would impact local PBS and NPR stations.

Republicans say the funds in question are a waste of taxpayer dollars. Democrats insist the funds save lives and serve American interests abroad. They have also said the rescissions threaten to derail the appropriations process.

Still, the Senate Appropriations Committee plans to finish marking up its Commerce-Justice-Science spending bill Thursday, along with its Military Construction Veterans-Affairs bill.

House appropriators will mark up their Energy-Water and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development bills, and continue debating their Defense bill on the floor.

Multiple unsuccessful amendments to the rescissions package Wednesday targeted the public broadcasting cuts, with some Democrats noting the impact the cuts could have on emergency alerts and weather forecasting during natural disasters.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the proposed reductions would “starve local news and radio stations that are so essential, particularly in rural areas, for people hearing about weather events.” He added that they would “cripple disaster alerts.”

During the vote series, a 7.3-magnitude earthquake prompted public broadcasters to issue emergency tsunami warnings in Alaska instructing people to evacuate. Murkowski highlighted the alerts as a case study in the effectiveness of public broadcasting funding.

“The tsunami warnings are now thankfully canceled, but the warning to the U.S. Senate remains in effect,” Murkowski said on social media. “Today of all days, we should vote down these misguided cuts to public broadcasting.”

Senators rejected 47-52 an amendment from Schumer that would have removed a rescission of funds supporting U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific against “aggression” by the Chinese government.

“The U.S. and [China] are racing for access to critical minerals that power the most important technologies,” Schumer said on the floor. “U.S. development programs are critical for accessing these materials, but Senate Republicans want to ax these vital funds and therefore hand the keys over to Beijing.”

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), the Senate sponsor of the rescissions package, countered that senators already tweaked the bill Tuesday to protect the “[People’s Republic of China] Influence Fund.”

Amendments that didn’t make the cut

Democrats filed numerous amendments to try to protect funding for global energy, climate and agriculture programs, but most of them never came to the floor for a vote.

Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) each filed an amendment to prevent the rescission of the United States’ $125 million contribution to the Clean Technology Fund for fiscal 2025.

An amendment from Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) would have removed all sections rescinding funds for the United Nations. It could have spared the U.S. contribution to the Montreal Protocol, the agreement that scientists say has played a significant role building up the ozone layer.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) proposed language to protect global water and sanitation programs. Several amendments aimed at protecting global food security initiatives similarly did not get votes.

A proposal from Sen. Rubén Gallego (D-Ariz.) would have excluded funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency from the rescissions.

Hickenlooper also had an amendment to protect the State Department’s “Economic Support Fund.” The bill rescinds $1.65 billion of the $3.6 billion appropriated for the fund for fiscal 2025. The Office of Management and Budget said in its original rescissions request that the fund “has been used to fund radical gender and climate projects.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) proposed an amendment to prohibit the use of funds to subsidize the Grain Belt Express, one of the largest transmission projects in U.S. history, which has received a conditional loan guarantee from the Department of Energy.

Hawley said last week that Energy Secretary Chris Wright committed to “putting a stop” to the project that would run through Missouri farmland. DOE has not made a formal announcement to that end.

The amendment did not get a vote, Hawley said, because “technically in the rules you can’t add new rescissions; you can only withdraw ones that are currently there, sadly.”

Rescissions face House test

The House must pass the package before midnight Friday in order for the rescissions to take effect. Failure to meet that deadline would force the White House to spend the funds in question.

Final passage may not come easily. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus warned they could oppose the rescissions bill if it got watered down. Senate leaders and the White House agreed to remove the clawback of AIDS funding.

Further, House action ground to a halt earlier this week and only advanced late Wednesday as some of the same conservatives ultimately relented on a threat to tank a procedural vote on the Defense spending bill and cryptocurrency legislation.

White House budget director Russ Vought told reporters Tuesday that the OMB would respect the rescissions’ statutory 45-day window for passage, saying, “We will not implement the cuts if this vote doesn’t go our way.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/5f/ef/f043985b4c3b9f804c24d7bfb08a/u-s-congress-00650.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:51:22.347351

New Jersey LCV hails bold multi-state effort to reform broken PJM, calls for passage of clean energy bill to lower electric prices

TRENTON, NJ – As the PJM capacity auction starts this week, New Jersey LCV Executive Director, Ed Potosnak, has issued the following statement in response to a newly announced multi-state effort to reform PJM, the entity that manages the electric grid of New Jersey and 13 other states:

We commend Governor Murphy and his counterparts in states across the PJM grid for advancing bold new initiatives designed to reform the out-of-control grid operator and rein in skyrocketing costs. PJM has grossly mismanaged our grid, denying consumers cheaper clean energy solutions and helping drive energy prices even higher.

The recent PJM auction, which saw prices jump by 29%, only underscores the importance of bold action. This increase is because of the dismal outlook caused by Donald Trump’s policies doubling down on dirty, more expensive energy to enrich billionaire oil and gas CEOs on the backs of working families. Washington DC is driving prices higher by undercutting access to cheaper, faster, healthier, and local clean energy options.

We are calling on Governor Murphy and the legislature to continue the momentum putting New Jersey in charge of our own energy future by passing landmark legislation committing us to 100% clean energy by 2035 this year. This bill will ensure that our state becomes a national leader in 21st century clean energy, creating union jobs, reducing air pollution and delivering lower costs for working families in the face of Trump’s attacks.",https://www.njlcv.org/sites/default/files/images/facebook/facebook-share-image.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:50:03.984511

Geothermal energy and other non-solar and non-wind clean energy sources, however, have been spared in at least some ways, as Canary Media reported.

According to Inside Climate News, the budget bill draft, released by the Senate Finance Committee in June, outlined Congress' plan to eliminate the residential clean energy tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act — legislation that allows homeowners to claim 30% off the cost of qualifying clean energy systems on their federal taxes.

The draft of the Big Beautiful Bill threatened not only the wind and solar industries but also the geothermal industry, a lesser-known sibling of wind and solar that has great potential for consistent, renewable, clean energy.

Larger-scale geothermal energy generally involves drilling holes to source thermal energy from the Earth's subsurface that heats water and eventually releases steam. This steam is used to power turbines that power generators, creating electricity.

Geothermal energy is considered a cleaner energy source — emitting less heat-trapping pollution than dirty fossil fuels — and also exceeds solar and wind performance, which are intermittently productive.

Smaller-scale geothermal power often refers to ground-source heat pumps that capitalize on the relatively consistent temperature of the Earth at shallow depths to heat up or cool down buildings.

Following the bill's draft release, geothermal industry leaders — including ground-source heat pump manufacturers — were prompt to urge Congress to reconsider, at least for geothermal efforts. Leaders cited geothermal energy's potential to stabilize the energy grid amid increased energy demands from artificial intelligence while investing in American manufacturing and labor.

""Every 1,000 homes that install a geothermal heating and cooling system, on average, would eliminate 10 megawatts of winter peak heating load of an air source heat pump,"" said John Thomas, CEO of WaterFurnace International, per Inside Climate News.

Whether Congress was swayed more by the investment in American labor or the similarities and overlap between the large-scale geothermal industry and the natural gas and oil industry, which uses similar drilling techniques and equipment (as noted by Canary Media), legislators decided to spare geothermal energy after rescinding support for other renewable energy sources.

Unlike for large solar and wind projects, which, according to Canary Media, must be operational by the end of 2027 or must begin construction by the summer of 2026 to qualify for the tail end of a tax credit, the Big Beautiful Bill extends the sunset date for geothermal energy, beginning to decrease incentives in 2033 and ending in 2036.

From now until 2033, new geothermal projects will qualify for the full investment tax credit (48E) of 30%. In 2034, the tax incentive rate drops to 75%, to 50% in 2035, and to 0% in 2036.

Meanwhile, the Canary Media article noted that the residential tax credits from the federal government for geothermal heat pumps will end after this year.

Homeowners looking to install solar may want to get started as soon as possible to take advantage of the federal solar tax credit while it's still available through the end of the year.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/geothermal-energyimage-rec9Z18D3gTdwlsYW.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:03:02.416432

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE REPUBLICANS RELEASE ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILLS: House Republicans released text for several anti-environmental appropriations bills. These bills propose billions of dollars in cuts to vital programs that protect our clean air and water, help deploy cost-saving clean energy, maintain our public lands, address a legacy of environmental injustice, and tackle the climate crisis.

OUR TAKE: LCV Legislative Director David Shadburn said, “On the heels of Congressional Republicans passing polluters’ wishlist and a massive utility rate hike in the Big Ugly Bill, they are doubling down on making costs higher and harming communities. Their extreme spending bills will raise energy costs for families and businesses by banning affordable clean energy and blocking fuel efficiency standards. They take a sledgehammer to EPA’s scientific capacity, prohibit the agency from doing its job of protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink, and cut investments in water infrastructure and our natural resources. These bills also contain extreme partisan poison pill provisions routinely rejected by Congress, which will further harm communities by attacking racial justice, the LGBTQIA+ community, humane treatment of immigrants, access to abortion, and more of our fundamental rights.

“Instead of raising energy costs, mandating drilling on public lands, and defunding national parks, water infrastructure, and public transportation, Congress should be safeguarding our communities and ensuring basic environmental protections are adequately funded. Congress must reject these draconian spending cuts and outlandish poison pill riders and get serious about protecting our communities, our environment, and our health.”

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Director of Judiciary and Democracy Doug Linder said, “Emil Bove is exactly the kind of nominee the Senate was intended to block. Bove has shown repeatedly and recently that the people cannot trust him to follow the Constitution and pursue equal justice under law. Reports of his repeated, unprecedented abuses of power at the Justice Department over the last six months are absolutely disqualifying, especially for a lifetime seat on a powerful federal appeals court. The laws that protect our environment and our freedoms need judges who act in good faith, and Senators must not allow a nominee who thoroughly fails that test to be confirmed.”

Earlier this week, LCV joined over two dozen organizations in a letter urging the Senate to reject Emil Bove’s nomination.

COALITION TAKE: From the letter, “Congress has a sworn duty to serve as a vital check on the power of the executive. We write today not because we disagree with President Trump’s politics. Or because we seek a political ‘win’ by seeing one of his nominees fail to be confirmed. Or because we fear we might disagree with decisions a potential Judge Bove could make in the future. We write today because Mr. Bove has demonstrated that every time he’s put in a position of authority, he abuses it. Every opportunity to uphold the Constitution has been met with decisions that serve his political goals over legal principles. His record is not one of missteps—it is a pattern of disqualifying conduct.”

SARA SCHREIBER JOINS LCV AS SVP OF CAMPAIGNS: Sara Schreiber has joined LCV as the new senior vice president of campaigns, succeeding Pete Maysmith who was recently named the new president of LCV. Schreiber previously served as the chief of staff for the Biden-Harris and Harris-Walz presidential campaigns and as the executive director of America Votes.

OUR TAKE: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “As threats against our environment and democracy continue to mount, we are thrilled to have Sara, a true campaigns and mobilization pro, joining LCV. President Trump and the Republican Congress have launched a full-on attack against the common-sense policies and safeguards that lower energy costs, create family-sustaining jobs, and protect the air we breathe and water we drink. Sara’s experience packs a one-two punch–she’s a savvy political strategist who knows the national landscape, has worked with key national and state organizations, and is deeply connected to voter education and turnout. As we look to make sure those who voted for the Big Ugly Bill hear from their constituents in the coming months and look ahead to the 2026 Midterm elections, her expertise in large-scale engagement and voter mobilization will be invaluable.”

TAKE 2: Incoming LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber said, “I am thrilled to join the team that has been on the frontlines of defending climate progress and making strides toward a clean energy future, both nationally and in the states. The League of Conservation Voters plays a crucial role in protecting our environment for future generations and working to improve the quality of life of all Americans. I grew up in the West and have seen firsthand the impact that climate change is having in our communities — from rising energy costs to wildfires and extreme weather. I have also seen the long-term economic opportunities we can create if we tackle these challenges head on. I can’t wait to hit the ground running to build on LCV’s work by leading impactful campaigns across the country.”

Jeff Landry viewed as a threat to the state’s way of life.

Despite years of studies and reviews, the project at the center of Louisiana’s coastal protection plans grew increasingly imperiled after Landry, a Republican, took office last year. Its collapse means that the state could lose out on more than $1.5 billion in unspent funds and may even have to repay the $618 million it already used to begin building.

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group, a mix of federal agencies overseeing the settlement funds, said that “unused project funds will be available for future Deepwater Horizon restoration activities” but would require review and approval.

A plan to rebuild disappearing land

The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion Project aimed to rebuild upward of 20 square miles (32 kilometers) of land over a 50-year period in southeast Louisiana to combat sea level rise and erosion on the Gulf Coast. When construction stalled last year because of lawsuits, trustees warned that the state would have to return the hundreds of millions of dollars it had already spent if the project did not move forward.

Former Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who once led the state’s coastal restoration agency, said that killing the project was “a boneheaded decision” not rooted in science.

“It is going to result in one of the largest setbacks for our coast and the protection of our communities in decades,” Graves said. “I don’t know what chiropractor or palm reader they got advice from on this, but — baffling that someone thought this was a good idea.”

Project supporters stressed that it would have provided a data-driven, large-scale solution to mitigate the worst effects of an eroding coastline in a state where a football field of land is lost every 100 minutes and more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land have vanished over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The project, which broke ground in 2023, would have diverted sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River to restore wetlands disappearing because of a range of factors including climate-change-induced sea level rise and a vast river levee system that choked off natural land regeneration from sediment deposits.

“The science has not changed, nor has the need for urgent action,” said Kim Reyher, executive director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. “What has changed is the political landscape.”

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group last year had noted that “no other single restoration project has been planned and studied as extensively over the past decades.”

A perceived threat to Louisiana culture

While the project had largely received bipartisan support and was championed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, his successor has been a vocal opponent. Landry recoiled at the rising price tag and amplified concerns that the massive influx of freshwater would devastate local fisheries.

Landry has said the project would “break” Louisiana’s culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting and compared it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.

“We fought this battle a long time, but Gov. Landry is the reason we won this battle,” said Mitch Jurisich, who chairs the Louisiana Oyster Task Force and sued the state over the project’s environmental impacts, including likely killing thousands of bottlenose dolphins due to the onslaught of freshwater.

Landry said in a statement that the project is “no longer financially or practically viable,” noting that the cost has doubled since 2016.

“This level of spending is unsustainable,” Landry said. The project also “threatens Louisiana’s seafood industry, our coastal culture, and the livelihoods of our fishermen — people who have sustained our state for generations.”

The project’s budget had included more than $400 million for mitigating the costs to local communities, including to help the oyster industry build new oyster beds. Project proponents said that the rapid loss of coast meant communities would be displaced anyway if the state failed to take action to protect them.

“You either move oysters or move people, and there’s only one answer to that question,” Graves said.

State seeks a smaller, cheaper solution

Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, the lead agency overseeing the project, said in a statement that the project was “no longer viable at this time based on a totality of the circumstances” including costs, litigation and a federal permit suspended earlier this year after the state halted work on the project.

Chairman Gordon “Gordy” Dove said that “our commitment to coastal restoration has not wavered” and that the state plans to pursue a smaller-scale diversion nearby. Dove told lawmakers earlier this year that the state could save at least $1 billion with a different plan to channel river water into the Gulf Coast at a rate 5 to 30 times less than the Mid-Barataria project’s 75,000 cubic feet per second.

Conservation groups bristled at the change in plans. The Mid-Barataria project’s termination marked “a complete abandonment of science-driven decision-making and public transparency,” Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement, adding that the state was “throwing away” money intended to protect its coastal residents and economy.

The coalition said alternative measures proposed by the state, such as the smaller-scale diversion or rebuilding land by dredging, were insufficient to meaningfully combat land loss and did not undergo the same level of scientific vetting as the Mid-Barataria project.

“A stopgap project with no data is not a solution,” the coalition said. “We need diversion designs backed by science — not politics.”

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.
Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.

The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.

The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden’s administration, the White House said.

Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,” the White House said in a fact sheet.

Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

Within weeks of the EPA’s offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.

The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer.

“President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.”

In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.

“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help … unleash American energy,” Zeldin said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.”

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

A Proclamation

1. The use of ethylene oxide is critical for the sterilization of medical equipment, which protects patients against infection and the transmission of disease. The continued utilization of ethylene oxide by commercial sterilization facilities is essential to ensuring that our Nation provides its sick and injured with the best outcomes possible — an objective that is at the forefront of the Federal Government’s responsibility to the American people.

2. On April 5, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412, titled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities Residual Risk and Technology Review, 89 FR 24090 (EtO Rule). The EtO Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on commercial sterilization facilities.

3. The EtO Rule places severe burdens on commercial sterilization facilities. About 50 percent of all sterile medical devices in the United States are sterilized with ethylene oxide, and sterilization with ethylene oxide may be the only method of sterilizing many medical devices without damaging them. By requiring compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not exist in a commercially viable form, the EtO Rule risks making critical sterile medical devices unavailable to care for patients in our civilian and military medical systems. The current compliance timeline as set forth at 89 FR 24101-24103 of the EtO Rule will likely force existing sterilization facilities to close down, seriously disrupting the supply of medical equipment. Our Nation would be unable to adequately supply the sterilized medical equipment that medical personnel need to safely treat their patients in hospitals, operating rooms, and other medical facilities. In short, the current compliance timeline would undermine our national security.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the EtO Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the EtO Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the EtO Rule’s relevant compliance dates (Exemption). This Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines established under the EtO Rule applicable to the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each such deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such deadline. The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year period, these stationary sources will remain subject to the emissions and compliance obligations in effect prior to the issuance of the EtO Rule. In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:

The technology to implement the EtO Rule is not available. Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the EtO Rule by the compliance dates set forth in the EtO Rule.

It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

For facilities, compliance will require testing of current controls to determine if additional controls are needed, the installation of new controls, and other associated activities.
As some of these measures can only be performed sequentially, the EPA determined facilities required additional time for compliance.
As such, the EPA determined additional time for compliance was necessary amending the deadline to provide additional time to July 7, 2027.","The EPA on July 2 issued a finalized interim rule, published six days later in the Federal Register, which delays implementation of certain National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requirements for coke oven manufacturing facilities.

According to the EPA, hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from these coke oven manufacturing facilities can include benzene, mercury, lead and arsenic. Coke at these facilities is produced using coal and coke-oven batteries (which is a group of connected coke ovens). From there, coke in blast furnaces then converts iron ore to iron, which in turn is used for steel production.

The interim finalized rule comes in response to petitions for reconsideration submitted on September 3, 2024 by various industry groups and coke oven facilities, “detailing alleged errors, requesting corrections, and expressing concerns regarding the technical feasibility of certain new requirements and the timing of compliance.”

The EPA responded to these petitions on March 20, granting discretionary reconsideration on the issues of Fenceline Monitoring, Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards, leak limits for doors, lids, and offtakes and regulations regarding leaks for oven doors. As a result, the EPA has now amended the compliance date to July 5, 2027, for the following requirements:

Fenceline monitoring and leak limits: Fenceline monitoring determines the concentration ground level of pollutants at a facility’s fence line, which can occur due to leaks at doors, lids, and offtakes. Leak limits were revised previously with a former compliance date set for July 7. For facilities, compliance will require testing of current controls to determine if additional controls are needed, the installation of new controls, and other associated activities. As some of these measures can only be performed sequentially, the EPA determined facilities required additional time for compliance.

Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards (MACT): MACT represents air pollution standards under the Clean Air Act to reduce HAP emissions. To comply with these standards, additional controls and operational changes at the facilities may be necessary, which can include lengthy permitting processes and extensive engineering, among other items, all of which were not previously evaluated for feasibility under the previous 18-month deadline set for January 6, 2026. As such, the EPA determined additional time for compliance was necessary amending the deadline to provide additional time to July 7, 2027.

Requirements for Oven Doors at Heat and Non-Recovery (HNR) Facilities: Certain monitoring requirements for oven doors at HNR facilities needed clarification pursuant to the petitions for reconsideration, including who would generate the performance testing to calculate leak averages, the methodology and frequency of monitoring, and more specific information for certain plant components. After clarification, it was submitted that facilities could comply within one year. The EPA stated it will provide clarification on these issues by June 2026. Accordingly, the EPA revised the deadline from July 7, 2025 to July 5, 2027.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16177_1251.png,N,,2025-07-18 09:52:06.422373

The “big, beautiful bill” isn’t perfect on permanence.","Signing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law at a White House ceremony on Independence Day may go down as the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s second term – and not just for the obvious reasons.

Yes, the bill includes many provisions that conservatives consider beautiful. It takes welfare benefits from illegal immigrants, implements reasonable work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, phases out many “Green New Deal” subsidies, and prevents a massive $4 trillion tax hike scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1.

But some conservatives have criticized the legislation for being, well, big. Why, they ask, should any bill exceed 800 pages?

It’s a reasonable question. But if they think that bigger bills usually aren’t better, they may be pleased to learn that the “big, beautiful bill” will reduce the pressure for large, “must-pass” bills in the future.

TRUMP JUST SCORED THE BIGGEST CONSERVATIVE VICTORY IN THREE DECADES

It does so by locking in most of the tax code permanently.

It may seem like common sense that whatever tax changes Congress enacts should apply to all future years, not just a few years. But that’s not how things have worked in Washington for a long time.

Since the 1990s, both parties in Congress have piled up more and more tax provisions with expiration dates attached. Most such provisions are then continued indefinitely with periodic “tax extenders.”

The “big, beautiful bill,” more than anything else, dealt with a massive $9 trillion confluence of expiring tax provisions ($4 trillion of expiring tax cuts on net). Lawmakers stepped up and brought resolution to a tax code that has long needed it. The biggest resolution to the tax code involved making 2017 tax cuts permanent.

Not a temporary extension, a permanent one.

HOW THE CBO GOT IT WRONG AGAIN: TRUMP’S ECONOMIC BILL SET TO GENERATE TRILLIONS IN SURPLUS, NOT DEBT

Americans no longer have an enormous and perennial potential tax increase looming over their heads. Congress averted higher tax rates across the board, the halving of the child tax credit and standard deduction, expansions of the alternative minimum tax and death tax, and the return of punitive tax treatment for investments in business equipment and machinery, among other things.

The “big, beautiful bill” also took huge steps toward resolving the trillion-dollar “Green New Scam.” There, though, Congress resolved to end many of the subsidies.

The “big, beautiful bill” isn’t perfect on permanence. A handful of new tax provisions were set to expire after 2028 or 2029, and some green energy subsidies were given a few years to phase down instead of simply being terminated. But the bill brought resolution to 90% of the unresolved parts of the tax code, so future lawmakers face a much cleaner slate.

Congress’ typical practice of making tax cuts and subsidies temporary minimizes the appearance of deficits according to government forecasters’ scoring, even when there’s every reason to believe that Congress will keep extending “temporary” changes indefinitely.

And in the world of budgetary politics, appearance matters more than reality.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY

When government forecasters suggest a bill’s deficits are small or that it reduces deficits, it can provide cover to lawmakers who support it, even if government estimates have little bearing on reality. Favorable government scores also streamline the budget reconciliation process for significant tax and spending bills.

Temporary policies have been key for past lawmakers to unlock good budget scores.

Never mind that overreliance on temporary policy is disruptive and economically harmful to everyone except the D.C. lobbyists who thrive when tax policies and government programs are in limbo.

Rewarding perennial extensions of temporary policies is like signing a lease to pay rent month-to-month and celebrating all the money you save each month by not paying for a year-long lease.

This shell game has long masked America’s difficult fiscal position.

And now some will criticize Congress for adding to the deficit with the permanent tax extensions of the “big, beautiful bill.”

But while the bill won’t fix the federal overspending that drives America’s deficits, it does include about $1.2 trillion in spending cuts and will stop $500 billion more in green tax credits.

By rejecting the temptation of temporary policy extensions, the bill will help bring to light future deficits that were already there but that were hidden in plain sight from the naïve budget outlooks of the Congressional Budget Office.

Honesty may be the best policy, but, sadly, in the D.C. Swamp, getting back to honest accounting may come with a price.

When will Coloradans feel the impact of Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill?'

Brandon Richard

Kris Tallent owns Excited Energy, a solar energy company in Loveland.

“I think that solar is a remarkable way of making electricity,” said Tallent. ""To me, it's magic to have all of this energy lying around us, and all we need to do is put a collector out and capture some of that energy that was going to lay on your roof, maybe go unnoticed on a nice sunny day.""

He’s seeing an uptick in business right now as people learn that a federal tax credit that reduces the cost of installing solar panels and water heaters by 30 percent will expire soon.

The tax credit, which was originally set to expire in 2032, will now expire on December 31.

Tallent said homeowners who want to take advantage of the tax credit must have solar panels installed by that date.

“September, October is really when you want to sign a contract and get that moving,” said Tallent.

The ‘big, beautiful bill’ also removes a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Will Toor, the executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said when combined with a state tax credit, the federal tax credit helps cut the cost of buying an electric vehicle by $11,000.

“In Colorado, we've been seeing huge consumer interest in electric vehicles,” said Toor.

The federal electric vehicle tax credit was also originally set to expire in 2032, but will now expire on September 30.

He added those in the market for an EV should act now.

With the launch of its Mumbai experience center, Tesla has taken its first official step into India.","MUMBAI (Diya TV) — American electric vehicle giant Tesla has officially entered the Indian market with the launch of its first experience center in Mumbai. Located in the upscale Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), the showroom opened its doors to the public on July 15, 2025, marking a major milestone for the company in one of the world’s fastest-growing automotive markets.

Tesla’s first retail space in India spans 4,000 square feet in BKC. The location sits in Mumbai’s prime Central Business District, known for housing leading financial and business institutions. The showroom is designed as an “experience center,” allowing potential customers to explore Tesla’s electric vehicles in a high-end setting.

According to reports, Tesla has leased the space for approximately ₹4 crore (nearly $500,000) per year. The company’s entry into India has been long anticipated, and the BKC showroom signals the start of a phased rollout across major Indian cities.

Tesla has imported five Model Y electric SUVs from its Shanghai Gigafactory for display at the Mumbai showroom. These cars give Indian customers a first look at the brand’s signature technology and design. Each Model Y is expected to be priced around ₹50 lakh, though the final pricing may vary depending on demand and import duties.

Additional Tesla models may be introduced based on market interest, according to company insiders. While the brand has not disclosed an official launch schedule for other vehicles, industry experts expect offerings to expand gradually.

Tesla currently has no plans to manufacture cars in India. However, industry analysts suggest that production plans could be considered if trade relations between India and the United States improve. A possible Indo-U.S. trade deal may reduce customs duties on American products, including electric vehicles, making Tesla cars more affordable for Indian consumers.

This move could help Tesla navigate around existing import tariffs, which were tightened under the former Trump administration and remain a barrier to cost-effective entry into foreign markets.

Tesla’s Mumbai showroom is only the beginning. Sources indicate the company plans to open its second experience center in New Delhi. Other metro cities are also likely to follow, aligning with Tesla’s global strategy of targeting urban markets with high purchasing power and infrastructure readiness.

India’s rising demand for electric vehicles—especially in the premium segment—makes it an attractive market for Tesla. The Indian government has also been pushing for faster adoption of EVs to reduce carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.

Even before the showroom’s launch, Tesla had already made its way into the fleets of some of India’s most prominent business figures. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries, and Prashant Ruia, Director of the Essar Group, reportedly own Tesla cars. Their early adoption highlights growing interest in electric mobility among India’s elite.

Tesla’s presence in India could also spark further investment in charging infrastructure, battery technology, and sustainable energy solutions.

Auto analysts see India as a key growth opportunity for Tesla. The country’s expanding middle and upper classes, combined with rising fuel prices and urban pollution, have fueled a steady increase in demand for electric vehicles.

Although Tesla faces competition from local players like Tata Motors and international brands such as BYD, its strong global brand and cutting-edge technology give it a unique advantage.

What’s changing: President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law on July 4, nixing EV tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
In June, average EV incentives hit an “all-time high”—14.8% of the average transaction price, according to Cox Automotive.
July’s EV lease deals include the Hyundai Kona EV for a monthly payment of $189, according to US News & World Report.
“There [are] going to be folks that want to get into the vehicles before the tax credit goes away,” she said.","Now’s the time to buy.

That’s the message Ford is pitching amid a bevy of EV deals industrywide ahead of the Sept. 30 expiration of tax credits on EV purchases and leases.

The automaker recently extended through the end of September its Ford Power Promise, which aims to promote at-home charging by providing EV buyers with complimentary home chargers and installation.

“With everything that’s happening in the marketplace, not only the incentives that we have…and the fact that tax credits are still out there for some of these makes and models, now is the time to really double down and get as much as you can as a consumer,” Stacey Ferreira, Ford’s director of US sales strategy, told Tech Brew.

What’s changing: President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law on July 4, nixing EV tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Those include a $7,500 tax credit for qualified new EV purchases, a $4,000 credit for qualified used EVs, and a “leasing loophole” that allows automakers to pass on incentives for some models that don’t qualify for the other credits.

EV deals were already plentiful. In June, average EV incentives hit an “all-time high”—14.8% of the average transaction price, according to Cox Automotive.

After a Q2 EV sales slump, analysts expect to see a Q3 surge as buyers interested in going electric look to lock in savings.

“With government-backed incentives set to end in September and economic pressures mounting, the second half of the year will be a critical test of EV demand,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox, said in a statement. “Q3 will likely be a record, followed by a collapse in Q4, as the electric vehicle market adjusts to its new reality.”

Deal? July’s EV lease deals include the Hyundai Kona EV for a monthly payment of $189, according to US News & World Report. Lexus is offering 0% financing on its electric RZ, consumers can get a 2025 Kia Nero EV lease for $129 per month for 24 months, and GM is offering 0% interest for 60 months to buy the Chevy Equinox EV, per the outlet.

“There is no better deal than leasing an EV,” Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, told us. “You can easily get a vehicle that has an MSRP of $15,000–$20,000 more than its ICE equivalent, yet the payments might be the same or lower.”

Though he hasn’t seen many automakers using the looming tax credit expiration to advertise incentives, Drury expects a bigger push closer to September. But consumers shouldn’t wait, he said: “If you were looking at this like, ‘Wow, I want to scoop up a $150-a-month Equinox EV,’ you better get to it.”

Promise extended: The Ford Power Promise is available to retail customers who buy or lease a new 2024/2025 Mustang Mach-E, 2025 F-150 Lightning, or 2024/2025 E-Transit cargo van from a participating Ford dealer.

“The idea was, how can we make that barrier to entry extremely simple for our customers?” Ferreira said. Since debuting the program in October, Ford has installed more than 10,000 home chargers.

Ford didn’t extend the program specifically to align with the end of the tax credits, Ferreira said, but she expects to see higher sales in Q3 and for some EV fence-sitters to take the leap before Oct. 1.

“There [are] going to be folks that want to get into the vehicles before the tax credit goes away,” she said. “So we’re excited for Q3. We think it’s going to be strong.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/91e226fbdb5af9e6d7b73d0b45f90474b7736d88-5812x3875.jpg?rect=0,411,5812,3051&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-18 09:47:38.694535

The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) said Thursday it was adding ""enhanced oversight"" of agency decisions about new wind and solar projects in an effort to end ""favoritism"" of these ""unreliable"" and ""subsidy-dependent"" energy systems from the previous administration.

The new directive updates review procedures that will require senior leadership at the Interior Department, including the office of the secretary, to conduct a final review of any relevant decisions, including leases, rights-of-way, construction and operation plans, grants, consultations and biological opinions.

""Today’s actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess.

""American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.""

DOUG BURGUM EXPLAINS HOW WIND AND SOLAR DO NOT ‘RUN AMERICA’

A source familiar with the DOI's new enhanced oversight directive said the agency had serious concerns the Biden administration gave preferential treatment for permitting to new wind and solar projects, which a DOI press release Thursday described as ""unreliable"" forms of energy.

The press release argued that, with the removal of ""artificial advantages,"" the Trump administration is ""leveling the playing field"" for ""dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources, such as clean coal and domestic natural gas.""

""These actions mark a return to commonsense permitting standards that support national security, grid stability and American job creation,"" the press release says.

WHAT AI'S INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR POWER MEANS FOR OUR FUTURE

The actions are in alignment with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month, ""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources"" and other presidential directives, while also serving to implement certain provisions of the newly passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The ""big, beautiful bill"" provisions that the directive supports ask the Interior Department to eliminate right-of-way and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar projects, which the DOI said Thursday will end ""years of subsidies for economically unviable energy development.""

""For too long, the federal government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,"" Trump's executive order says. ""The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.

Strengthening American agricultural supply chains and supporting rural communities

Reducing dependence on foreign fossil fuels and boosting U.S. energy security

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (NASDAQ:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Synthetic Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") today announced that its supply chain features domestically sourced feedstocks for producing its renewable fuels during the ramp-up process, reinforcing the company's support for American farmers, strengthening rural economies, and advancing U.S. energy independence.

XCF's New Rise Reno facility is designed for flexibility, capable of processing a variety of waste- and residue-based feedstocks into renewable fuels. These feedstocks, which are not suitable for direct human consumption, include waste oils, agricultural residues, animal fats, and co-products from industrial agriculture. Currently, New Rise Reno uses ISCC-certified distillers corn oil (""DCO""), a byproduct of U.S. ethanol production, to produce SAF and crude degummed soybean oil, a co-product of the U.S. oilseed supply chain, to produce renewable diesel.

Distillers corn oil is recovered at ethanol plants after corn has been processed into fuel ethanol and animal feed. By converting this low-value agricultural byproduct into SAF, XCF is turning a waste stream into valuable, low-carbon fuel.

Crude degummed soybean oil supports U.S. farmers and helps reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels; it is a widely available co-product that plays an important role in building domestic renewable fuel supply chains.

Today, XCF's feedstock supply chain is strengthened by its partnership with Phillips 66 (""P66""), which provides reliable access to these critical, domestically produced feedstocks. This partnership ensures stable sourcing, quality control, and scale, underpinning XCF's support for U.S. agricultural communities while maintaining robust production reliability.

""We're proud to put American farmers at the center of our supply chain,"" said Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair of XCF. ""Our supply chain supports domestic jobs and rural economies, while strengthening our nation's energy independence. XCF's approach ensures that the U.S. leads the clean energy transition on our own terms - by using American resources to power American innovation.""

By sourcing feedstocks domestically and partnering with P66 for consistent supply, XCF:

Provides new income streams for U.S. farmers and ethanol producers

Strengthens American supply chains for renewable fuels

Reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels

Supports domestic jobs in agriculture, engineering, logistics, and technology

XCF's New Rise Reno facility, commissioned in February 2025, is designed to flexibly process a variety of feedstocks into drop-in SAF and renewable diesel. The company's planned expansion sites in Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida are expected to replicate New Rise Reno's patent-pending modular design, enabling rapid scale-up of renewable fuel production. Each additional site is expected to have a nameplate production capacity of 40 million gallons of neat SAF bringing XCF's total expected production capacity to ~160 million gallons of neat SAF by 2028.

The Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station in Salem Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania generates more than 1,000 megawatts of electric power, while the Guernsey Power Station is a 1,875 megawatt plant located in southern Guernsey County in Southeastern Ohio.
The net acquisition price is $3.5 billion after adjusting for estimated tax benefits, or approximately $3.8 billion gross.
Talen said that the highly efficient plants add both baseload generation and cash flow diversification.
Their highly efficient dispatch profile results in significant energy margin and strong cash flow conversion and increases our annual generation by 50% from approximately 40 TWh to 60 TWh, it said.","Talen Energy on July 17 announced that it has signed definitive agreements to acquire Caithness Energy’s Moxie Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and Caithness Energy and BlackRock’s Guernsey Power Station in Ohio, both combined-cycle gas-fired plants located within the PJM Interconnection power market.

The Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station in Salem Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania generates more than 1,000 megawatts of electric power, while the Guernsey Power Station is a 1,875 megawatt plant located in southern Guernsey County in Southeastern Ohio.

The net acquisition price is $3.5 billion after adjusting for estimated tax benefits, or approximately $3.8 billion gross.

The net purchase price reflects an attractive acquisition multiple of 6.7x 2026 EV/EBITDA for two of the most efficient natural gas plants in PJM, at a material discount to current new-build CCGT costs, the company said.

“This acquisition enhances Talen’s fleet by selectively adding modern, highly efficient baseload H-class CCGTs in Talen’s key markets, where we are an innovator in data center contracting,” said Mac McFarland, Talen President and Chief Executive Officer. “The transaction is immediately and highly accretive, maintains our balance sheet discipline, and adds more than the equivalent of another Susquehanna nuclear plant to our platform, further enabling large load service.""

Talen said that the highly efficient plants add both baseload generation and cash flow diversification. The plants have an average heat rate of 6,550 Btu/kWh. Their highly efficient dispatch profile results in significant energy margin and strong cash flow conversion and increases our annual generation by 50% from approximately 40 TWh to 60 TWh, it said.

The plants benefit from an advantaged location and reliable access to gas pipeline infrastructure from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, with their rich natural gas reserves and interconnects to primary natural gas pipelines, Talen said.

The addition of the facilities to Talen’s portfolio ""enhances Talen’s ability to offer reliable, scalable, grid-supported and regionally diverse low-carbon capacity to hyperscale data centers and large commercial off-takers. With greater operational flexibility, proximity to key load pockets, and proven track record in bilateral contracting, the proforma company will be well positioned to meet the evolving needs of high-growth, 24/7 power demand sectors,"" it said.

Talen expects to issue approximately $3.8 billion in new debt to fund the acquisitions and refinance target debt, using both secured and unsecured instruments.

The Moxie and Guernsey transactions are both expected to close in Q4 2025.

Each transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino act, and regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other regulatory agencies.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-18 09:50:29.828437

The 2026 Subaru Uncharted seats up to five, but rear-seat room is limited.","NEW YORK – Subaru of America unveils the all-new 2026 Subaru Uncharted, a compact, 4-door, crossover-styled battery-electric vehicle that’s slated to be the third of three BEVs to be offered within the Subaru brand, all developed jointly with partner Toyota Motor Corp.

Across the industry, while there’s long-term demand for BEVs, the near- to medium-term outlook for electric-car demand is taking a beating. The Trump Admin. is raising tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts, and it’s set to kill the $7,500 tax benefit for new BEVs on top of pre-existing worries about range and charging infrastructure.

Still, range, power and charging specifications for the 2026 Subaru Uncharted, going on sale in early 2026 in the U.S., are impressive. Trim levels at introduction are Premium FWD, Sport and GT.

Estimated range for the new BEV is from 290 miles (467 km) to “more than 300” miles (483 km), Subaru says, depending on trim and equipment. Dual-motor models produce up to 338 hp and can go 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in less than 5 seconds.

The higher driving range of 300 miles is for the Premium FWD variant. The front-drive trim level is a lower-priced variant, with one electric motor on the front axle. At launch, Subaru says it expects to offer limited numbers of the front-drive model. The higher-performance Sport and GT trim levels, which have an electric motor on each axle, are rated at 290 miles of range.

Subaru estimates it will take around 30 minutes to charge the CUV’s battery pack at DC fast chargers, taking it from 10% charge to 80% charge in the timeframe, even in cold weather -- known to slow charging sessions. The charge port, Tesla’s NACS standard, is compatible with Tesla Supercharger stations nationwide.

Late to the Party? That’s OK

The 2026 Subaru Uncharted was developed jointly with the Toyota C-HR, which also goes on sale in 2026.

Consumers, auto industry analysts and some U.S. dealers for Subaru and Toyota criticized the two brands in the recent past for being late to the party with BEVs. Other brands were quicker to embrace all- or nearly all-electric lineups, while Toyota and Subaru stuck with what have become “traditional” hybrids, fuel-efficient internal-combustion engines and affordable, compact passenger cars.

As a result of Subaru's relatively low-effort BEV push, some 12,447 Solterras were sold in the U.S. in 2024, per Subaru data. While that represented a 40.3% increase from 2023's 8,872, it still placed Subaru far from the top-selling BEV in the U.S. last year, the Tesla Model Y, which tallied north of 372,000 deliveries, per industry estimates.

But a more cautious BEV approach – and choosing to share development between Subaru and Toyota – looks smart today, with demand for BEVs looking shaky.

Joint Development

The first full-fledged -- and currently the only -- Subaru BEV, is the Subaru Solterra, launched in 2022. Compared to the 2026 Subaru Uncharted, it’s 7 ins. (178 mm) longer, Subaru says.

The Solterra was jointly developed with the Toyota bZ4X. Starting with the 2026 model year, the Toyota bZ4X gets a significant mid-product-cycle update and becomes the Toyota bZ.

The 2026 Subaru Trailseeker is slated to be the second BEV in Subaru’s U.S. lineup when it goes on sale in 2026, with exact timing to be announced later. The all-new Subaru Trailseeker was developed jointly with the all-new Toyota bZ Woodland crossover.

On the Outside

All three Subaru BEVs for 2026 get the automaker’s new “lighting signature,” which features distinctive headlamps and an extra-large, illuminated version of the six-star Subaru logo.

In a video released in advance of the unveiling, and like some other BEVs around the industry, all three Subaru models exterior design reveals no traditional grille above the front bumper.

The Uncharted has short overhangs front and rear. With wheels pushed to the corners, that creates more interior room, and a more stable ride, due to a longer wheelbase, Subaru says.

The rear door handles are high on the vehicle and backed up almost to the C-pillars, above the sheetmetal, where a glass rear-quarter window might be. That creates a large, smooth expanse of sheetmetal on the sides, almost like a coupe.

On the Inside

The 2026 Uncharted gets electronics that customers are learning to expect, notably a standard, 14-in. (36-cm) touchscreen for infotainment, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.

Dual wireless phone chargers are a prominent part of the center console. Rear-seat passengers get dual USB-C chargers.

The 2026 Subaru Uncharted seats up to five, but rear-seat room is limited. Like many of today’s CUVs, its exact segmentation is up for debate. Subaru calls the new BEV a compact model, while others classify it a subcompact.

The Subaru Solterra has been assembled in Japan (at Toyota's Aichi plant), and a Subaru spokesman tells WardsAuto on the sidelines of the vehicle's unveiling here that the Uncharted and Trailseeker also will be Japan-built models.

Pricing and other details of the Uncharted will be released closer to the vehicle's on-sale date, Subaru of America says.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt7121b6ec5c11097b/blt6a29818248680204/68796d57114ce46852097bb8/3_of_3_EMBARGO_717_730PM_EDT_Subaru-Uncharted.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-18 10:03:11.582548

And so I think for a long time, people thought, ‘we’re cute and furry and beautiful to hold, no one hates clean energy.’ Well, there are people who actually hate clean energy.
He said the clean energy part of this bill is more about cultural issues than economic ones.
And what lessons do you take from it for the clean energy industry?
I think it’s important to acknowledge, yes, the clean energy industry is at war with this administration, and yes, the clean energy industry has what it needs to thrive in this moment.","On July 3, the US Congress passed President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, a huge package of economic and tax legislation that’s meant to reorganize American society. The bill gave tax breaks to corporations and to the richest Americans, while cutting into budgets for medical programs, food aid and most importantly, for this show, clean energy spending. The US Office of Budget Responsibility estimates that the bill, which we’ll call O triple-B, will cut $488 billion in clean energy spending over the next 10 years, and that’s only the government spending part. The $488 billion was supposed to be matched many times over by private investment, which may not happen now as a result. It is a dire prognosis for the US, which only just started to take its climate goals seriously. So has the US given up on green tech? Jigar Shah doesn’t think so.

The moment that we’re in is the exact same moment that the fracking industry was in in 2014 when the Saudi Arabians decided to declare war against the fracking industry in the United States. And the fracking industry didn’t cry in their beer. They came out of that stronger than they went into that battle. But I think at the time, all of the stock analysts and all of the big newspapers were saying the fracking industry was dead.

Jigar Shah spent the last two decades in the clean energy industry in the US, and most recently, he was the head of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office. He’s also a previous guest on Zero, when he came on to announce a $9 billion loan to Ford Motors to help the company build out its electric vehicle battery manufacturing. So I got to ask him, What does the passing of the O triple-B mean for the US’s climate goals, whether US climate innovation is now dead in the water, and what does the bill’s passing mean for US-China clean tech competition?

Well, let’s start with the headline, because President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill has now become an act, and according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, it means $488 billion worth of clean energy spending that’s gone. Much of it was linked to President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. And of course, you served under the Biden administration. So let’s look at the big picture first, and we’ll come to the nitty gritty later. Biden set out a goal that the US will cut its emissions in half by the end of the decade, relative to 2005 levels. Do you think the O triple-B has killed any hope that the US will meet those goals?

I think that the people who voted for the O triple-B believe that they intended to kill those goals. I think that we’ve seen this before, right? I’m not going to sugarcoat it. This is obviously a huge setback for our industry. And I would say that this is the first time that a sitting president has gone to war with clean energy. But I think at the same time, when you think about where our industry was in 2017, when Trump first came into office, it was quite nascent. Solar panels were not necessarily fully bankable, battery storage was a gleam in people’s eye.

Today, I would suggest that we are now in a place where Pakistan is deploying 12 gigawatts of solar a year. And you see many other countries doing the same thing around the world. I think you’ve got folks who are installing balcony solar at record levels in Germany. Battery storage has clearly saved the Texas grid every single day, and as a result, the O triple-B has not touched battery storage. And so I would suggest to you that the industry has to recognize it has now gotten targeted, and so it needs to invest the money required to actually defend itself, right?

So today, the clean energy industry in the United States invests double the amount of CapEx that the oil and gas industry does each year. And that’s a big number, because remember, the US is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, so I’m not referring to a small industry. But we’re double the amount of CapEx every year that the oil and gas industry does, and we spend 1/20 of the amount of money on influence and political power. And so as a result, we have very little of it. And so I think for a long time, people thought, ‘we’re cute and furry and beautiful to hold, no one hates clean energy.’ Well, there are people who actually hate clean energy. And so I think we all need to acknowledge the humbling nature of what’s happened here, and recognize that this is all solvable, right, that we can build political power. We provide a huge amount of local benefits. And I would say this is the first time in my lifetime that so many elected officials deliberately tried to sabotage their own constituents in service to a party leader. So we’ll see how durable this war against clean energy really is.

So I spoke to one analyst, and he basically put it in the simplest way. He said the clean energy part of this bill is more about cultural issues than economic ones. At a time, as you noted, the rest of the world is doubling down on clean energy, this bill will pull the US back from investing in it. His read was that the US is actually acting like a petrostate, not a country that wants to dominate on energy. Is that a fair read?

I find that people have a lot of these hot takes, and I think it’s important to start with just saying what I did before, which is that we were targeted as an industry, and we were unprepared for that targeting, and so we lost. That being said, we have an affordability crisis in the United States. What this bill has done is stripped 17 million people of Medicaid. If you look at the way the President has operated our economy, we started his administration with a 2% average tariff on all incoming goods. In the United States today, our average tariff is 15% and with all the announcements happening as we speak, that number might be 25%. That is generally on the back of poor people. And so that means a bunch of people are going to spend an extra $1,800- $5,000 per year on stuff, depending on what they’re buying.

And so you could imagine how quickly this will change in a year. If a year from now people’s electricity bills are up 9% because of all these bad decisions, you could imagine them reversing them very quickly after the midterm elections. And so I want to make sure that people recognize this for what it is, which is a stunning defeat of the clean energy industry and a wake up call to the fact that, yes, we have extraordinary solutions, and they are by far the easiest way to reach energy dominance and to reach affordability for consumers. But we did not do the work to make sure that everyone understood that.

So let’s get into the details, and I’ll just list a few things, because they’re worthy of noting. We know that EV tax credits that take $7,500 off the sticker price of a car are going away later this year, a whole bunch of incentives that would have made it cheaper for people to electrify their home. Rooftop solar, that’s going away. But there are some tax credits for clean energy that have been protected. So when you look at the bill, is there any good news for climate tech in there?

Yeah, so let’s be very specific about what’s in the bill, because I think that people get very confused. We are going to have a boom in residential solar this year, as people try to install solar before the 25d tax credit expires at the end of the year. So everybody I know of that I’ve talked to is fully sold out through the end of the year. They’re working as hard as they can for the large scale projects, or this is commercial and utility scale projects. All of the companies who’ve already started construction of projects will be given the ability to finish them within 2027 without any additional foreign entities of concern language; any of the other poison pills don’t apply if the project’s already under construction. And so that takes us all the way through 2027.

So I just want to make sure that we’re crystal clear that solar and wind are going to have bumper years this year, next year, probably in 2027 as well. Then there’s a drop off. And so this is what you call a cold water approach to phasing out subsidies. Now you’ve got a lot of less mature sectors that have been given much more runway, and batteries are included in that. So I think that’s a good news story, and the vast majority of the battery developers are all solar and wind developers. Those divisions of their companies will grow, while the other divisions of their companies might go slightly flat.

Then you’ve got a huge push around nuclear, which I think was largely started by the Biden administration. And I think that currently, the Trump administration is just using the work that we did. I don’t think they’ve actually done their own work yet, but I’m hopeful that they will, right. They’ve promised to streamline regulations and make it easier to do stuff, but when I talk to investors, their spreadsheets haven’t resulted in any reductions in costs in the spreadsheet. So we’ll see whether that comes through. I think enhanced geothermal is on its way. I think that was already on its way with the geothermal liftoff report that we wrote and all the other things that we’ve done. I think the oil and gas industry is very interested in investing in that space. I would suggest that they’re actually not being ambitious enough in the enhanced geothermal space on the private sector side. I think that this administration desperately wants to help them more, and they’re not being more vocal about how they might be able to receive or utilize that help. So I think there’s some communication challenges there.

There was a huge amount of additional resources provided to hydro power. We have 37,000 megawatts of old hydro that is going to be retired over the next five to eight years, right? So relicensing all that hydro, putting in next generation technology, could get 50% more power output out of all of those existing sites, right? So that’s a huge source of clean firm power that could come forward. There was an extension of the fuel cell tax credits, which I’m not quite sure is amazing, but it’s great. There’s some good stuff in there, right and around the commercialization of technology. But I do think that the intention of this, which I think will remain to be clear, is a phase out of tax credits for mature technologies and more of a focus on immature and commercializing technologies.

You know, we wrote a lift off report at my insistence that we published right before we left office. And to summarize, it basically says the EU refuses to allow any crops to be used in their SAF production, right? So to the extent that you’re making SAF, you’re making it for the EU, they will not allow corn ethanol to be used in any of that SAF. So I don’t really understand why you would do it. I think the Japanese program does allow for these sorts of feedstocks, but I think you could dwarf the Japanese market pretty quickly by the existing plants that we’ve already funded right out of the Loan Programs Office. And so I’m a big fan of biomethanol for shipping. I do think that clean hydrogen is largely going to go into ammonia, which is what we always predicted at the Loan Programs Office.

So I think a lot of these clean fuels fights that people were having the last four years are starting to resolve themselves as to which feedstocks go into SAF, which feedstocks go into shipping, you know, which feedstocks go other places. And so we’re trying to figure all that stuff out. The US is clearly blessed with an extraordinary agriculture industry. But I think, as you also know, agriculture is not devoid of climate impacts. And so I do think that from a climate perspective, we’re going to all have to be a lot more thoughtful about whether this is really serving us well on the climate side, or whether this is really just a push.

And speaking of the Loan Programs Office, last time you were here on Zero, almost exactly two years ago, you were talking about the $9.2 billion loan to Ford to build batteries for electric cars. How much of the progress you made at the LPO will be undone by this bill, or what has been done by the Trump administration so far?

I think it depends on what you mean by undone. I would say that to date, they have not undone anything, right? So all of the loans that we issued have been honored to date. None of them have been unfairly rescinded or whatever you would suggest. I do think they’ve been slow to close the loans that I had laid for them to close, and so I’m shocked at how long it’s taken for them to take the wins that we gave them. If you look at the O triple-B, it has more resources for the Loan Programs Office that’s very specific. Relabeling the 1706 program, which was energy infrastructure reinvestment program, into the energy dominance financing, and they’ve relabeled some other stuff. So they have a lot of resources, and the resources that they have remaining could match our production, so they could do another $108 billion worth of loans over these next four years, presumably in their preferred sectors, like nuclear or geothermal or some of these other areas. But to date, they have not shown that they have a clear mandate around where to put that money.

You had about $400 billion when initially we talked about it. And there has been a certain amount of rescinding happening, right? $3.6 billion for the title 17 loan guarantee program. $3 billion for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing, $5 billion for the energy infrastructure reinvestment program. So current loans that you have given out, those haven’t been rescinded, but there are future loans that could have been given out under those programs that are gone now.

Yeah, but I don’t think it really matters all that much. I mean, this is all money that was set aside to do certain things, right? It was very clear that elections have consequences, and they were not going to do those certain things. And so having the money sit there and them not putting it out the door doesn’t make any sense. And so they’ve rescinded it, fine, and they’ve provided an additional billion dollars of new money for things that they do want to do. So they took some away, they put some more back in, and they can give us the Loan Programs Office more money in the funding bills that will be passing later this year, right? So that part I’m not concerned about. I do think that they have the resources to do the same amount of loans that we did, but in their preferred sectors.

Coming back to the politics of it, and I think you put it well, which is that the clean energy industry in the US doesn’t spend much, a very small fraction, 1/20th, of what the oil and gas industry spends on lobbying. But in the thinking of the Inflation Reduction Act and of the Biden administration, there was always this goal that if you bring both red states — Republican-led states — and Democrat-led states together, and you provide these tax credits going to all states… And especially in the IRA, much of it was going more than the majority was going to the Republican side. That is what will hold these politicians to account, and they won’t cause self harm by rescinding these things. So where did that fail? And what lessons do you take from it for the clean energy industry?

I think there are two different questions. So I think we need to be very careful about what we’re concluding in these data points. I mean, President Trump is a very unique individual, like when you think about his poll numbers and his actual voting numbers, he really won the working class in a very big way. But more than that — since 2017 he has remade the Republican Party so that he is the only dominant force and that everyone should fear him. When you have that much power over individuals, then they do things that are blatantly in disregard for their constituents.

And so whether it’s out of fear, fear for their family, fear for re-election, fear for whatever it is, that does not invalidate the thesis behind the Inflation Reduction Act. When you think about 20 plus people on the Republican side in the house that signed the letter, plus you had four or five Republican senators that were genuinely looking to try to save all the incentives. So when you think about where this whole thing landed, right, it is terrible for the clean energy industry, and it was so much better than it could have been. And so I don’t think that we should take from this that this is not a durable solution. In a million years, no one would have suggested that elected officials would actively sabotage manufacturing facilities in their community. No one would have guessed that. This is the single largest assault on working class people that we’ve had in I don’t know, since Ronald Reagan was promising to do that in the 1980s.

We are also in this period where the US and Europe and the Western world in general, is seeing electricity consumption rise at a level that it hasn’t seen in decades. Much of what would have happened under the IRA would have enabled the rollout of clean energy. But crucially, it would have rolled out cheap electricity to these data centers that are consuming huge amounts of it. How do you think O triple-B affects the scaling up of data centers in the US?

I think that the economic development story in the United States is something that’s very strong, and it’s one that the utilities want to support. The governors want to support their utilities in getting those things done. And at least in rhetoric, the President of the United States also wants to make sure we win the AI race and all that stuff, right? So I think that we’re going to win that race. I think what’s going to likely occur is we’re going to move much faster than even I imagined, into the, you know, distributed capacity procurement that Sparkfund is doing in Minnesota, the virtual power plant programs that are being done across the country. I think what you will see in this moment is an enormous deployment of demand flexibility enabled by the batteries that got full subsidization within the O triple-B.

No, local content, they don’t. So they no longer have to buy lithium or graphite or battery separators or whatever from local companies. But there’s a production credit. So for every megawatt hour of batteries that they made, they got a payment. They still get those. And most of the existing battery manufacturing facilities in the US are EV battery manufacturing facilities. So they will continue to be put into EVs. And then I think some of the battery manufacturing facilities that were built a little more slowly are converting themselves into utility scale battery manufacturing facilities. So making LFP batteries, making batteries that are for utility scale applications, and so that conversion is happening now.

So BloombergNEF’s modeling shows that the manufacturing capacity increase in battery making in the US is going to be much lower, because a lot of the electric vehicle battery manufacturing is not coming online. But overall, trying to actually build out a supply chain in the US for batteries is going to be a harder challenge than it was before the O triple-B. Is that not right?

Yeah, that’s right. So battery manufacturing was on track to reaching 400 gigawatt hours worth of production in the US. I still think we’re going to reach that target, to be clear. But I think what’s happening is, for the plants that were being built more slowly, they have an opportunity today to convert them to serve the utility scale battery market and not the electric vehicle market, and all of those conversions are being made. So I think we’ll still get to 400 gigawatt hours, but it’ll be a bigger mix between utility scale versus electric vehicle batteries. But the electric vehicle batteries will still be, I don’t know, 270 gigawatt hours or so. So that’s why I’m saying like, I don’t think we know how this is going to play out. I feel like the O triple-B was so randomly constructed that I think people are still trying to figure out exactly how they’re going to implement all these provisions.

So on EVs, the projections before O triple-B was that the US would have reached half of new sales being EVs by 2030. That’s now dropping, according to BloombergNEF estimates, to 37%. Fast forward 15 years, let’s not worry about what is going to happen tomorrow. But given the rest of the world is speeding up on EV transition, it’s not just China, it’s also India, it’s also Europe, even Africa, you’re seeing two wheeler electric vehicles take off. Do we end up in this situation where the US still remains the place where the gas guzzler is king and everybody else is zipping around in EVs, breathing clean air?

Both my in-laws and my parents just bought a plug-in hybrid vehicle. They’re both the same exact one, actually, and it was 33 or 34 miles electric. Almost all new models are heading towards 40-45 miles electric for these plug-in hybrid vehicles. And I think the vast majority of people are gonna move to these 30-40, mile plug-in hybrid vehicle batteries. And my parents get that light that shines, that says your gas is getting stale because you haven’t used it in two months. So it meets 100% of their needs. And I put in a level two charger for them, but they won’t use it, so they’ll just plug it into the wall using level one, because it’s only a 34 mile range. And they’re like, it works fine, like, we don’t need that. So I think you will see that America, because of the long distances that we drive, what you will find is that the vast majority of people will find comfort with a plug-in hybrid, and then they will solve their range anxiety by just using gasoline when they go beyond that period. And that will still result in 90% of that family’s vehicle miles traveled going to zero emission.

So if we split the energy transition into these mature technologies and these maturing immature technologies, we looked at how much of the tax rates for the mature technologies are being taken away. On the maturing side, we talked through nuclear, geothermal, maybe some biofuel for SAF, but those, as you said, are not being done thoughtfully. There’s no real proactive nature to try and build those out. Sitting here outside the US, it does feel like the US, at least under Trump, will have given up on competing with China on the mature technologies, right? You’re going to have some solar and some batteries, and they’ll grow, but really that supply chain is not going to get built in the US in the next four years, you’re going to have to depend on foreign entities.

Yeah, of course. Look, I think that the thing that people got wrong before, and I think what they’re getting wrong now is that while I loved serving the last four years within the Biden administration, we were always private-sector led, government enabled. I think people thought that that was a throwaway line, but it really wasn’t. Everything in the United States is driven by the private sector. And if you look at this next week, there’s a big conference in Detroit, of all the major venture capital funds and others who voted for Trump, and they are all talking about putting up 10s of billions of dollars into re-industrializing our country. And so they’re looking to pick up all these projects and to continue to build them? And so we’ll see which ones succeed and which ones don’t succeed, and what they decide to do and what they don’t decide to do.

But that’s the private sector leading. Trump is not going to stop them from leading. If they want to build something here in the United States, because we did 90% of the work under the last administration, and they want to take it the last 10% of the way, they’re going to do that right? And so I just think that people thought that there was this imperial presidency within the Biden administration, and now an imperial presidency within the Trump administration. And for these issues, neither is true. Now, you know, we could talk about immigration or we could talk about other issues, but for these issues, neither was true, right? This was always private-sector led, and those people continue to do it.

Now, have we taken a gut punch, like a huge gut punch, yes, right after we thought that we had aligned the interest of everyone in the political spectrum around figuring out how to diversify supply chains from China. People are saying, well, we’re going to say all the right things, but we’re not going to do all the right things in the O triple-B. That sucks, but hopefully it’s a wake up call to our industry that, look, these technologies continue to be the way of the future. If you can’t do it in the United States, you can go to the UK, you can go to the EU, you can go to Canada, go to Australia. They still have all their programs in place. They want you to go there to do that work. And some folks are just stubborn, so they’re going to keep trying to do it here in the United States. And I’m here for it.

Although it’s not spending that way, right? It’s more about the fact that we have projects in communities around the country, and most of those communities don’t even know that we’re there, right? We need to fund the T-ball team, we need to fund the local high school. We need to do all of the things that you have to do. But remember, the moment that we’re in is the exact same moment that the fracking industry was in in 2014 when the Saudi Arabians decided to declare war against the fracking industry in the United States. And the fracking industry didn’t cry in their beer. They woke up and said: all right, let’s figure out how to right size our supply chains. Let’s figure out how to get all of our suppliers to cut their costs. Let’s figure out how to do all these things to continue to stay alive. And they came out of that stronger than they went into that battle. But I think at the time, all of the stock analysts and all of the big newspapers were saying the fracking industry was dead.

And so I think that when you think about all the times that I have been left for dead on the side of the road, whether it was in 2008 after the global financial crisis, whether it was after the Spanish program collapsed upon itself in 2009 and 2010 and people said, people are never going to invest in Spain ever again. Whether it’s in Germany and the manufacturing collapse of the solar panel industry there. There’s lots of times that our industry has been left for dead and we have risen and become stronger for it.

I think it’s important to acknowledge, yes, the clean energy industry is at war with this administration, and yes, the clean energy industry has what it needs to thrive in this moment. But you know, along the way, 50% of our companies may go bankrupt. The ones that weren’t well capitalized, the ones who weren’t run well et cetera, may go bankrupt, and then the other 50% are going to probably thrive out of this, and take the rest of the market share and continue to succeed. It is still the case that our technology is the best in the world, and it is the only way we’re going to achieve energy dominance. It’s the only way we’re going to unlock all these economic opportunities. But you know, I think you can hold both of those ideas in your head at the same time.

That’s the sound of rockfall on the main climbing route up Mont Blanc. For the first time in recorded history, during this European heat wave in June, the summit of Mont Blanc, at a height of 4800 meters, remained above freezing for a full 24 hour period. Warmer temperatures are leading to more rockfall across the Alps as permafrost melts. If you liked this episode, please take a moment to rate and review the show on Apple podcasts and Spotify.

These incentives, which have been available for several years, are set to end due to changes introduced by President Trump's new legislation.

The bill reverses the Inflation Reduction Act enacted under President Biden, which provided tax credits for home solar installations. As a result, homeowners have only a few months left to benefit from these government incentives. The solar tax credit, which offers up to 30 percent off the cost of installation or equipment, will expire on December 31.

""If you're interested in doing solar, it would be good to get it done at this time because you can still get that 30 percent off,"" said Terry Huff, CEO of TopHat Energy.

Additionally, the ""Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit"" will also be discontinued later this year. Currently, some electric vehicle buyers can receive tax credits of up to $7,500 for purchasing or leasing a new EV. However, these incentives will end after September 30.

The passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Washington’s latest sweeping tax legislation, has sent a jolt through the electric vehicle (EV) market. From new restrictions to expanded credits, the law represents a major overhaul in how taxpayers—and automakers—interact with EV incentives. Whether you’re a current EV owner, considering a purchase, or a business investing in clean vehicle fleets, understanding these changes is crucial to maximize your tax savings and avoid costly missteps.

This blog breaks down the major tax-related implications for EV buyers and businesses under the new bill, offers a timeline for action, and provides practical advice on how to benefit before certain credits fade into the sunset.

EV Tax Credits: What’s Changing Under the Big Beautiful Bill

The Clean Vehicle Credit, formerly known as the Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit, has been reshaped. Previously offering up to $7,500 for qualifying EVs, this credit now comes with stricter requirements, income limits, vehicle price caps, and battery sourcing rules—and it’s just the beginning.

Here’s what you need to know.

1. The New EV Tax Credit Structure

Under the new bill:

Up to $7,500 is still available for qualifying new EVs.

$3,750 applies if the battery components are sourced in North America.

$3,750 applies if critical minerals used in the battery are sourced from the U.S. or a U.S. trade partner.

A separate $4,000 credit is available for qualifying used EVs.

For the first time, the credit can now be applied at the point of sale—you don’t have to wait until tax season to benefit.

Commercial EVs are eligible for a credit of up to $40,000, depending on weight and battery specs, making this attractive for business owners.

2. EV Credit Restrictions and Phaseouts

Here’s where the “beautiful” part gets a little murky:

Price Caps:

Sedans must cost $55,000 or less.

SUVs, trucks, and vans must cost $80,000 or less.

Income Limits (for individual filers):

$150,000 for single filers

$225,000 for heads of household

$300,000 for married couples filing jointly

Final Assembly: The vehicle must be assembled in North America.

Battery and Mineral Sourcing: Vehicles using components from “foreign entities of concern” (e.g., China) may be disqualified starting in 2025.

Manufacturers’ Cap Lifted: Previously, once a manufacturer sold 200,000 units, the credit phased out (e.g., Tesla, GM). That cap has been removed, bringing those brands back into play—but only if their vehicles meet new criteria.

3. Timeline: When These Changes Happen

4. Tips to Take Advantage Before Credits Vanish

If you’re considering an EV purchase or tax strategy that involves electric vehicles, here are our key recommendations:

A. Act Fast Before Eligibility Shrinks

Buy or lease your EV before December 31, 2024, to maximize your chances of claiming the full credit—especially if the vehicle might not qualify under 2025 rules.

B. Verify VIN Eligibility

The IRS offers a VIN lookup tool to confirm whether your EV qualifies for a credit under current rules.

C. Consider Leasing Instead of Buying

Some foreign-made EVs that don’t qualify for the consumer credit may still qualify for a commercial lease loophole. Leasing might still give you a tax advantage if the lessor passes the savings to you.

D. Plan Around Income Limits

Your adjusted gross income (AGI) affects your eligibility. If you’re near the cap, consider tax planning strategies (like retirement contributions or deferrals) to lower your AGI.

E. Used EVs: A Smart Play

The new $4,000 used EV credit applies to vehicles at least two years old, sold under $25,000, and purchased from a dealership. It also comes with lower income limits, so check before you shop.

5. For Business Owners: Big Commercial EV Benefits

If you’re a small or mid-sized business considering fleet upgrades, the Big Beautiful Bill’s commercial EV credit is incredibly attractive:

30% of vehicle cost, up to $7,500 for vehicles <14,000 lbs and up to $40,000 for heavy-duty vehicles.

No income limits or MSRP caps.

Eligible for both electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Vehicles must be used primarily in the U.S.

Tip:

Consider the Section 179 deduction for accelerated depreciation in combination with the EV credit for even greater savings.

6. Tax Filing Implications and Paperwork

Under the new structure:

You’ll need to file Form 8936 (Clean Vehicle Credit) or Form 8911 (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit).

Dealerships must now register the sale with the IRS and provide the buyer with documentation to claim the credit.

The credit is non-refundable—so if your tax liability is less than the credit, you forfeit the remainder (unless future tax rules change).

This makes tax planning critical: Know your liability before you purchase.

7. What Credits Are Going Away?

The Big Beautiful Bill phases out or modifies several older credits:

Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) credits will be harder to qualify for unless battery size and sourcing comply.

The Alternative Motor Vehicle Credit for hydrogen and fuel cell cars may be revamped or replaced entirely after 2026.

The EV home charger installation credit will sunset in 2026, unless extended.

If you’re planning to install an EV charger at home or work, now is the time.

Final Thoughts

The Big Beautiful Bill represents a monumental shift in how EV tax credits work—expanding opportunities for some while narrowing eligibility for others. For consumers, timing and planning are everything. For businesses, the enhanced commercial EV credit can translate to tens of thousands in savings. The new law rewards domestic production, high-efficiency batteries, and structured tax planning. Whether you’re buying a family car or a fleet of trucks, taking proactive steps now will help you stay ahead of the curve—and keep your wallet charged.

Subaru Subaru Subaru","As other automakers start to shy away from electric vehicles, Subaru seems to be going all in on BEVs. Its latest creation, the 2026 Uncharted, is a tiny electric crossover with a lot of range on one end of the spectrum and a lot of power on the other. No matter how you slice it, though, the new Uncharted (I'm still not sure about the name) will come packed with all the off-road-ish stuff to keep most Subaru die-hards happy.

The Uncharted is Subaru's version of the upcoming electric Toyota C-HR, and its underpinnings are shared with Subaru's two other EV offerings, the recently refreshed Solterra and the new Trailseeker. Subaru says it'll offer up to 338 horsepower from two electric motors, which is enough to move the little guy from 0 to 60 mph in under 5 seconds, and it'll be able to fast-charge its 74.7-kWh battery at up to 150 kW, going from 10% to 80% in 30 minutes. That's not exactly world-beating, but it'll be enough for most buyers. It comes standard with a NACS charging port that'll let you pump in electrons at Tesla Superchargers, too. With Symmetrical All-Wheel-Drive, Subaru says the Uncharted will be able to travel around 290 miles. In addition to dual-motor Sport and GT models, there will also be a single-motor front-wheel-drive Premium trim, sold in limited numbers, that will beat that mileage figure and offer 221 hp.

Subaru claims the Uncharted will have ""responsive handling"" and ""dynamic performance,"" citing lightweight and rigid steel in the construction, structural support from the underfloor batteries, aerodynamic enhancements and specifically tuned suspension components to achieve this. Sounds enthralling, doesn't it? Don't worry, though. It's still a Subaru. The automaker says its engineers put a bit of emphasis on the Uncharted's straight-line stability, handling and grip on loose surfaces like gravel, dirt and snow. I'm sure that's something Subaru loyalists will be glad to hear.

The new Toyota C-HR is a small car, and thus the Uncharted is as well. Don't think that means it's tiny on the inside, though. Subaru says the Uncharted is nearly 7 inches shorter than the Solterra, but it boasts has more than 25 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. Its turning radius is basically the same as a Crosstrek's, and while we don't have exact measurements for the Uncharted just yet, it should be basically identical to the 177.9-inch-long C-HR. For comparison, the Crosstrek is only about an inch shorter. Its face is aligned with the Solterra and Trailseeker, more distinctive than that of the C-HR, and the Subaru has a unique rear bumper, taillights and other details.

Inside, the Toyota underpinnings really come through. It's got the exact infotainment screen and gauge cluster you'll find in many 'Yota products these days. Hell, it's even got the same steering wheel. I'm not sure if that really matters, though. I mean, the 14-inch infotainment screen is very intuitive and easy to use, and the gauge cluster gives you more information than you'll know what to do with. The rest of the touchpoints are also very Toyota, including the gear shifter. I mean, this is to be expected. All three of Subaru's EVs are based on — and borrow heavily from — Toyotas.

Regardless of who designed the interior, you still get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two wireless phone chargers in the center console and dual USB-C chargers for rear seat passengers, all as standard. It also comes with Subaru's EyeSight driver-assist tech suite that gives you stuff like automated emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, front cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise control.

Every trim level of the Uncharted comes with Subaru's All-Weather Package that gives buyers heated front seats, heated exterior mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, a power tailgate and ambient interior lighting. The Sport also comes with Subaru's X-Mode off-road system that adds grip control, a heated steering wheel, and Star-Tex water-repellent upholstery. The top-trim GT adds a panoramic roof, 20-inch wheels (other models get 18s or optional 20s), ventilated front seats, a Harman Kardon stereo system and a rearview camera mirror. Other available features include traffic jam assist, lane change assist and a 360-degree camera.

Right now, there's no word on how much the Uncharted will cost. Subaru says pricing and more detailed specs will be released closer to when it goes on sale in early 2026. Until then, we're just going to have to enjoy its rugged but cute looks from a distance.

What happened to the solar tax credit?

Should you rush to get solar panels before the tax credit expires?","A big federal tax credit for homeowners who get solar panels will end this year, meaning a window for significant savings on going solar is closing fast.

The 30% credit has long been the biggest single incentive for residential solar panel adoption, and its expiration is a significant blow for what has been a fast-growing industry. For homeowners, its elimination significantly changes the calculus of whether solar panels make financial sense compared with paying utility electrical rates. ""It's clear that as a result of this bill that we're going to see electricity bills spike all around the country,"" Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, said in an interview.

The residential clean energy credit, which provided taxpayers who bought solar panels using cash or a loan with a credit of up to 30% of the system's cost, expires at the end of 2025. It had previously been expected to run for nearly another decade, but congressional Republicans voted to end it early in a major tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed this month.

Can solar panels save you money?

Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we’ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.

For now, the end-of-year deadline means there will be a rush by consumers who want to go solar to get their systems installed and operational before 2026. Considering it can take months to get a system installed and connected to the grid -- and that installers will likely see a rush of clients that could drag things out -- experts suggested acting quickly if the tax credit is a must-have.

""If a homeowner is interested in going solar, they need to start the process right now,"" Walker said.

What happened to the solar tax credit?

The residential clean energy credit, which covers things like home batteries and geothermal heat pumps in addition to solar panels, has been around in some form or another since George W. Bush was president. The latest extension and expansion of it came in 2022 when President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. Congressional Republicans and President Trump saw the credit and other spending authorized by the IRA as a target for elimination this year to help pay for an extension of 2017's tax cuts in what Trump called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

This credit and a few others will be eliminated effective 2026, but other credits, including one that applies to companies that offer residential solar leases and power purchase agreements, will be phased out over the following years.

Walker said the energy policy changes in the latest legislation will likely lead to higher electric bills, because it discourages the development of clean energy like wind and solar -- the easiest and fastest way to get power on the grid. This comes at the same time that data centers for artificial intelligence are sucking up more and more energy.

With the current energy environment and the need for more generation, more energy efficiency and more energy independence, now isn't the time to scale back incentives, said Zach Pierce, head of policy at the nonprofit Rewiring America. ""This preemptive phasedown of these common-sense tax credits is a self-inflicted setback,"" he told me. ""These are the exact investments we should be leaning into, not preemptively eliminating.""

Should you rush to get solar panels before the tax credit expires?

A solar panel system can cost you tens of thousands of dollars, even with 30% off, thanks to the government. Don't feel like the disappearance of the credit is reason enough to go solar. But if you were already considering getting solar panels and you weren't sure whether you'd do it this year or next year, the credit's expiration may mean you want to act sooner.

One unanswered question is exactly what constitutes having a system installed by the end of the year. Does that mean panels are on the roof and sending electrons to an inverter and battery, or does it mean the system has been approved to interconnect to the grid? Waiting on interconnection can add more time, meaning it's even more important to act quickly, Walker said. Until more guidance on the tax change comes from the Internal Revenue Service, that's probably what you should assume, she said.

""Our best guidance right now is to have your system interconnected by the end of the year because that's the safest bet,"" she said.

There are also leases and PPAs, in which a third-party company owns the panels on your house and you either pay a monthly payment or a per-kilowatt-hour rate for the energy, respectively. For those systems, the credit expires in 2028, but it's the company that claims those credits, not you. Walker said those companies often have not been passing those savings down to consumers anyway.

The most important thing is not to rush too much. The solar industry has a problem with bad actors and questionable companies, and a brief gold rush like this might bring more out of the woodwork. Even though there is urgency, Walker said homeowners shouldn't rush and should still get multiple quotes and read the fine print.

What other tax credits are changing?

Other energy-related tax credits are also being eliminated sooner than planned.

The energy-efficient home improvement credit, which covers things like insulation and heating and cooling systems, also expires after this year. Rewiring America has resources available with details on how the credits are changing and how to take advantage of them.

States and utilities also have similar rebate programs, so the hit to your wallet from losing the federal credit is mitigated a bit. Still, if you're in the market for home energy efficiency changes, consider moving quickly. ""If you've been thinking about upgrading an appliance, now is the time as we get into the fall,"" Pierce said.

Energy efficiency incentives and programs can insulate you not just from the heat and cold, but from rising energy costs. ""Energy efficiency and insulation in the home, if you can afford it and find ways to overcome that up-front cost barrier, is pretty much a no-regrets thing,"" Pierce said.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/b283af51c5159ddfc82f28a0259a5bbde285720d/hub/2025/07/17/bec7580a-458b-43c7-aa18-4ffaa1aa8f4c/gettyimages-2224667276.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,N,,2025-07-18 09:55:23.084415

Jeff Landry viewed as a threat to the state’s way of life.

Despite years of studies and reviews, the project at the center of Louisiana's coastal protection plans grew increasingly imperiled after Landry, a Republican, took office last year. Its collapse means that the state could lose out on more than $1.5 billion in unspent funds and may even have to repay the $618 million it already used to begin building.

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group, a mix of federal agencies overseeing the settlement funds, said that ""unused project funds will be available for future Deepwater Horizon restoration activities” but would require review and approval.

A plan to rebuild disappearing land

The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion Project aimed to rebuild upward of 20 square miles (32 kilometers) of land over a 50-year period in southeast Louisiana to combat sea level rise and erosion on the Gulf Coast. When construction stalled last year because of lawsuits, trustees warned that the state would have to return the hundreds of millions of dollars it had already spent if the project did not move forward.

Former Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who once led the state's coastal restoration agency, said that killing the project was “a boneheaded decision"" not rooted in science.

“It is going to result in one of the largest setbacks for our coast and the protection of our communities in decades,” Graves said. “I don't know what chiropractor or palm reader they got advice from on this, but — baffling that someone thought this was a good idea.”

Project supporters stressed that it would have provided a data-driven, large-scale solution to mitigate the worst effects of an eroding coastline in a state where a football field of land is lost every 100 minutes and more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land have vanished over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The project, which broke ground in 2023, would have diverted sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River to restore wetlands disappearing because of a range of factors including climate-change-induced sea level rise and a vast river levee system that choked off natural land regeneration from sediment deposits.

“The science has not changed, nor has the need for urgent action,” said Kim Reyher, executive director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. “What has changed is the political landscape.”

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group last year had noted that ""no other single restoration project has been planned and studied as extensively over the past decades.”

A perceived threat to Louisiana culture

While the project had largely received bipartisan support and was championed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, his successor has been a vocal opponent. Landry recoiled at the rising price tag and amplified concerns that the massive influx of freshwater would devastate local fisheries.

Landry has said the project would “break” Louisiana’s culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting and compared it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.

“We fought this battle a long time, but Gov. Landry is the reason we won this battle,"" said Mitch Jurisich, who chairs the Louisiana Oyster Task Force and sued the state over the project's environmental impacts, including likely killing thousands of bottlenose dolphins due to the onslaught of freshwater.

Landry said in a statement that the project is “no longer financially or practically viable,"" noting that the cost has doubled since 2016.

“This level of spending is unsustainable,” Landry said. The project also “threatens Louisiana's seafood industry, our coastal culture, and the livelihoods of our fishermen — people who have sustained our state for generations.”

The project's budget had included more than $400 million for mitigating the costs to local communities, including to help the oyster industry build new oyster beds. Project proponents said that the rapid loss of coast meant communities would be displaced anyway if the state failed to take action to protect them.

“You either move oysters or move people, and there's only one answer to that question,"" Graves said.

State seeks a smaller, cheaper solution

Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, the lead agency overseeing the project, said in a statement that the project was “no longer viable at this time based on a totality of the circumstances"" including costs, litigation and a federal permit suspended earlier this year after the state halted work on the project.

Chairman Gordon “Gordy” Dove said that “our commitment to coastal restoration has not wavered"" and that the state plans to pursue a smaller-scale diversion nearby. Dove told lawmakers earlier this year that the state could save at least $1 billion with a different plan to channel river water into the Gulf Coast at a rate 5 to 30 times less than the Mid-Barataria project's 75,000 cubic feet per second.

Conservation groups bristled at the change in plans. The Mid-Barataria project's termination marked “a complete abandonment of science-driven decision-making and public transparency,” Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement, adding that the state was “throwing away” money intended to protect its coastal residents and economy.

The coalition said alternative measures proposed by the state, such as the smaller-scale diversion or rebuilding land by dredging, were insufficient to meaningfully combat land loss and did not undergo the same level of scientific vetting as the Mid-Barataria project.

“A stopgap project with no data is not a solution,"" the coalition said. “We need diversion designs backed by science — not politics.”

Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,"" the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order ""will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative"" on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.''

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

""This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

'Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

A Proclamation

1. Coal-fired electricity generation is essential to ensuring that our Nation’s grid is reliable and that electricity is affordable to the American people, and to promoting our Nation’s energy security. The Federal Government plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the Nation’s power supply remains secure and reliable. Forcing energy producers to comply with unattainable emissions controls jeopardizes this mission.

2. On May 7, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412, titled National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review of the Residual Risk and Technology Review, 89 FR 38508 (Rule), which amended the preexisting Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule to make it more stringent. The Rule’s effective date was July 8, 2024. Id. Its compliance date is July 8, 2027, 3 years after its effective date. See 89 FR 38519.

3. The Rule places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants and, through its indirect effects, on the viability of our Nation’s coal sector. Specifically, the Rule requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form. The current compliance timeline of the Rule therefore raises the unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk, and threatening broader, harmful economic and energy security effects. This in turn would undermine our national security, as these effects would leave America vulnerable to electricity demand shortages, increased dependence on foreign energy sources, and potential disruptions of our electricity and energy supplies, particularly in times of crisis.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the Rule’s compliance date — i.e., for the period beginning July 8, 2027, and concluding July 8, 2029 (Exemption). The effect of this Exemption is that, during this 2-year period, these stationary sources are subject to the compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the MATS as the MATS existed prior to the Rule. In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:

a. The technology to implement the Rule is not available. Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the Rule by its compliance date of July 8, 2027.

b. It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.

At their meeting last night, Council members voted 5 to 2 to reject a plan struck by Kraham to bring nearly 40 public E-V charging stations to a variety of public areas including parks, the new downtown parking garage, Mirabito Stadium, Ely Park Golf Course, the Discovery Center and more. Republican Kraham issued a news release slamming the Democrat-controlled Council for blocking the deal which would have been supported in part by a 165 thousand dollar NYSERDA grant.

The Mayor says the project would have also provided energy efficiency upgrades to city buildings as part of the city’s Climate Action Plan. Kraham says that with climate change causing devastating impacts locally, the vote was both careless and deeply disappointing. Democrats shot back that the Mayor is not telling the full story. Majority Leader Rebecca Rathmell says the proposal would have tied the city to a 20 year, 3 point 7 million dollar energy contract with Siemens Industry.

Rathmell says that while Council members support the installation of more E-V chargers, the deal did not include responsible bidding protections, local labor priorities and thoughtful cost considerations. Democrats say they have more than 2 years remaining to use the NYSERDA funding in a manner that doesn’t commit the city to large expenses for decades to come.",https://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2025/07/ev.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-18 09:54:08.819315

A Proclamation

1. The United States relies on a strong chemical manufacturing sector to support industries like energy, national defense, agriculture, and health care. These facilities produce essential inputs for critical infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, medical sterilization, semiconductors, and national defense systems. Maintaining a robust domestic chemical industry is vital to safeguarding the supply chains that underpin our economy and to reducing the Nation’s dependence on foreign control over materials critical to national resilience. As adversaries expand influence over key inputs, continued domestic production is essential not only to economic resilience but also to military readiness, public health, and national preparedness.

2. On May 16, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule titled New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry, 89 FR 42932 (HON Rule). The HON Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on certain chemical manufacturing facilities, some of which were promulgated pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412.

3. The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations. Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions. For many facilities, the timeline for compliance as set forth at 89 FR 42953-42955 would require shutdowns or massive capital investments before any proven pathway to compliance exists. The HON Rule imposes requirements that assume uniform technological availability across facilities, despite significant variation in site conditions, permitting realities, and equipment configurations. A disruption of this capacity would weaken key supply chains, increase dependence on foreign producers, and impair our ability to respond effectively in a time of crisis. These consequences would ripple across sectors vital to America’s growing industrial strength and emergency readiness.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the HON Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with those aspects of the HON Rule that were promulgated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412 for a period of 2 years beyond the HON Rule’s relevant compliance dates (Exemption). This Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines established under the HON Rule applicable to the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each such deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such deadline. The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year period, these stationary sources will be subject to the emissions and compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the applicable standard as that standard existed prior to the HON Rule. In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:

a. The technology to implement the HON Rule is not available. Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the HON Rule by the compliance dates in the HON Rule.

b. It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

Utilities are set to accelerate the development of their renewable energy projects in order to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act tax credits within the new one-year safe harbor period set by the Republican megabill that passed earlier this month, according to a July 10 report from investment bank Jefferies.

Jefferies anticipates utilities “with renewables-heavy plans” – like Xcel Energy, WEC Energy Group, CMS Energy, and Ameren – “to accelerate projects originally slated for 2030–31 into 2027–28 … While affordability concerns linger, we believe investors are too focused on potential capital pullbacks and not enough on who’s actually accelerating spend.”

“The provisions of the new law provide a sufficient path for us to continue delivering new, affordable, clean energy to our customers through the end of the decade,” said Theo Keith, a senior media relations representative at Xcel Energy. “Our well-established planning process ensures we can manage policy changes while working to meet our states’ energy goals and keeping bills as low as possible for our customers.”

Dive Insight:

“Meeting the unprecedented demand for energy in the U.S. to support our growing economy will require a wide range of energy sources and strengthened infrastructure,” Keith said. “While we supported a longer-term phase-down of the wind and solar tax credits, we recognize that budgets require compromise … we remain focused on an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach for the energy we provide.”

The Republican budget megabill, which President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, stipulates that wind and solar projects must start construction within a year of the law’s enactment to qualify for the IRA’s clean electricity production and investment tax credits, or be subjected to an end of 2027 “placed in service” deadline to be eligible.

As part of a reported deal with the Freedom Caucus, Trump also issued an executive order July 7 instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to publish guidance within 45 days “to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented” by wind and solar projects that saw their eligibility for the 45Y and 48E clean energy tax credits slashed by budget legislation signed into law on July 4.

“There is existing IRS guidance but the question is what the Freedom Caucus deal with the Administration entailed,” Jefferies said in a July 7 report. “The focus could be to prevent stockpiling and constraining the safe harbor window. Technical but adds uncertainty in the sector in our view … This adds a renewed sense of scrutiny where many had thought the resolution of OBBBA could provide an opportunity to ‘get back to business’.”

Jefferies noted that Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the House Financial Services Committee and Freedom Caucus, said Trump promised to “make sure that [wind and solar developers are] doing what they say when they say they’ve started construction.”

Brendan Conway, director of media relations at WEC Energy, said, “we are focused on executing our current capital plan, which includes projects pending regulatory approval. We will continue to work with regulators, lawmakers and other stakeholders to ensure our customers have the safe and reliable energy they depend on.”

The Mansfield plant, which was the largest coal-fired power plant in Pennsylvania, closed about half a decade ago.

""That affected everybody, not only just this little town, but all throughout these little communities,"" said David Trevino, borough council president in neighboring Midland, which has a population of 2,400.

Many jobs were lost when the coal plant shut down, said Shippingport Mayor John Erickson. Both towns took a hit.

Shippingport went from a budget of $6 million in 2006 to a budget of around $1 million this year, Erickson said. They've had to cut back on city services like police.

It was part of a larger industrial trend.

""We took a beating, this town took a beating, every town has the same story,"" Trevino said.

That story, however, could soon be changing. The town has needed good-paying jobs, Trevino said. The new power plant, which is being built by Frontier Group, and what's built around it could offer that.

""It will financially help us out, and it will create some jobs down here,"" Erickson said.

The small town of just over 150 people is no stranger to big investments in power generation. The world's first nuclear power plant was built in the town in the 1950s

Three hundred jobs would be permanent, and there would be 15,000 construction jobs. The plant would use natural gas instead of coal. It's not as clean as the nuclear power plant down the street, but it would be an improvement over coal, Erickson said, explaining that at one point, a black material from the plant rained down on the town.

The plant will power the electric grid along with a new artificial intelligence data center.

In total, the redevelopment will create $6 billion in economic activity. Trevino used to work at the Bruce Mansfield plant and said he looks forward to seeing the new one.

""I'm going to see this thing reborn, and add an influx of money and opportunities for young people to come, and it's going to do nothing but enhance the whole community,"" Trevino said.

One neighbor who lives near the plant shared the concern that a representative of the power plant's property owner approached him about selling his property to them. He said he felt they were not offering him the amount of money his property is worth.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/17/efc9f715-97c4-4ac1-b941-5115ff344c35/thumbnail/1200x630/dec3e02d6bc376d0faf29c452b5d6240/snapshot-2025-07-16t233323-736.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:50:42.475242

Heatmap Illustration/Getty Images

1. St. Croix County, Wisconsin - Solar opponents in this county see themselves as the front line in the fight over Trump’s “Big Beautiful” law and its repeal of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

Xcel’s Ten Mile Creek solar project doesn’t appear to have begun construction yet, and like many facilities it must begin that process by about this time next year or it will lose out on the renewable energy tax credits cut short by the new law. Ten Mile Creek has essentially become a proxy for the larger fight to build before time runs out to get these credits.

Xcel told county regulators last month that it hoped to file an application to the Wisconsin Public Services Commission by the end of this year. But critics of the project are now telling their allies they anticipate action sooner in order to make the new deadline for the tax credit — and are campaigning for the county to intervene if that occurs.

“Be on the lookout for Xcel to accelerate the PSC submittal,” Ryan Sherley, a member of the St. Croix Board of Supervisors, wrote on Facebook. “St. Croix County needs to legally intervene in the process to ensure the PSC properly hears the citizens and does not rush this along in order to obtain tax credits.”

2. Barren County, Kentucky - How much wood could a Wood Duck solar farm chuck if it didn’t get approved in the first place? We may be about to find out.

The Geenex solar project got predictably panned at the Kentucky State Board of Electric Generation and Transmission Siting Board, which I previewed earlier this month.

At the heart of the matter is that a multitude of irritated residents spanning various backgrounds there simply do not want it, and a National Park Service letter opposing the project has added fuel to that fire.

The outpouring of anger means regulators very well may say no here, but we’ll have to wait until a final decision comes in October.

3. Iberia Parish, Louisiana - Another potential proxy battle over IRA tax credits is going down in Louisiana, where residents are calling to extend a solar moratorium that is about to expire so projects can’t start construction.

Iberia Parish enacted a one-year ban last year that was intended to bide time so local officials could craft a restrictive ordinance that allowed for some solar projects to come and provide new revenues to the community while appeasing solar opponents.

Residents packed a parish council meeting last week, however, calling for the moratorium to be extended — which, if they succeed in getting a one-year extension, would effectively mean any developers eyeing the area would have to wait too long to receive the tax credits.

4. Baltimore County, Maryland – The fight over a transmission line in Maryland could have lasting impacts for renewable energy across the country.

The Piedmont Reliability Project would connect data centers in Virginia to power plants in Pennsylvania by criss-crossing Maryland. Its construction has engendered rampant opposition across the political spectrum, largely because of potential impacts to farmland.

What does this have to do with all-American renewable energy? Well, in a previously unreported letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins earlier this month, activists opposed to the Piedmont project called on the agency to “issue federal guidance discouraging the siting of non-agricultural infrastructure” on “productive or conserved farmland.”

This sounds eerily similar to the direction I reported in May that USDA was heading in, implementing regulations and guidance to clamp down on solar and wind on farmland. Given the high level of opposition to the Piedmont project, I’m a little concerned the fight over these wires could open a portal to broader action.

5. Worcester County, Maryland – Elsewhere in Maryland, the MarWin offshore wind project appears to have landed in the crosshairs of Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency.

EPA’s Region 3 office told the state of Maryland it must re-issue its final approval of the project last month and amend it to clarify federal authority over its appeal process. The letter stated that Maryland issued the permit “under federal law authority,” and that “failure to rectify this error could result in invalidation of the permit on appeal.”

Why would the EPA care about who will be appealing this permit decision? The amendments EPA is asking for would allow challenges to the permit to go through federal processes, which have proven more hostile to offshore wind than the state’s regulatory appeals route.

TL;DR, in the words of the Maryland Association of Counties, EPA is now “challeng[ing] the validity of a state permit.”

6. Clark County, Ohio - Consider me wishing Invenergy good luck getting a new solar farm permitted in Ohio.

Invenergy held its first public event on the Sloopy Solar project in the township of Harmony, and it doesn’t seem to have gone well: It was met with considerable organized opposition, as it appears a grassroots organization — the Harmony Farmland Preservation Coalition — had already been laying groundwork to make life more difficult for solar in this county.

Apparently, Invenergy plans to submit its formal application to the Ohio Power Siting Board by the end of this year. I’m not entirely sure that will work out in the company’s favor as staunch opposition may result in a protracted appeals process, especially if townships start passing resolutions against the project.

7. Searcy County, Arkansas - An anti-wind state legislator has gone and posted a slide deck that RWE provided to county officials, ginning up fresh uproar against potential wind development.

Arkansas has become one of the most hostile states to wind energy in the U.S., this year passing one of the first state-wide restrictive laws on the sector in modern history.

One of the legislators supportive of that push was Arkansas State Senator Missy Thomas Irvin, who seems to be picking fights with individual projects, too. Most recently, she posted to Facebook a slide deck for the Chief Wiley wind project submitted to local regulators for which there is little information online. RWE had recently visited Searcy County to meet with local landowners about the prospective plans, but I have trouble finding out much else about the project (so I can’t blame locals for being surprised by it).

Trump has the worst idea for how to fix that.,Paul Waldman,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-energy-summit-pennsylvania-china-rcna219338,"Speaking at the “Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit” in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, Trump chose the latter fantasy.
Wind power does work just fine, as many of Trump’s red-state allies could tell him.
In Trump’s telling, China powers its economy with glorious coal, while building wind and solar energy equipment to sell to other countries; those countries then destroy themselves by using renewable energy.
Contrary to Trump’s belief that China has no windmills, China generates more wind power than any other country on Earth.
This May, the country added a gigawatt of solar power (enough for a midsize American city) every eight hours.","Depending on how President Donald Trump is feeling at the moment, he will tell you either that the U.S. is about to embark on a “golden age” in which Americans will prosper beyond our wildest dreams, or that we’re already there. Speaking at the “Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit” in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, Trump chose the latter fantasy. “One year ago you had a dead country, we were dead. We didn’t think you could ever come back,” he said. “And now today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world.”

But if anything is heating up in the U.S. other than the temperature, it’s inflation. The consumer price index rose 0.3% last month, with the annual rate of inflation jumping to 2.7%. Trump’s tariffs are beginning to show up in consumer prices, with more increases to come as companies’ pre-tariff stockpiles run out. Meanwhile, Trump continues to threaten tariffs on whatever and whoever happens to anger him that day. Remember the “90 deals in 90 days” he promised? Not so much. Instead, we’re looking at three and a half more years of tariff chaos, increasing economic instability and raising prices.

Wind power does work just fine, as many of Trump’s red-state allies could tell him.

But with no attendees at the event in Pittsburgh willing to bring up the economic warning signs, Trump’s rambling stream of consciousness came repeatedly back to a question: If tech companies are going to build all these sprawling data centers, some of which will demand as much power as a large city, where will that power come from?

It’s an important query: More large computing facilities means more demand for power, which means higher prices for consumers unless the U.S. generates more energy. Trump often frames this issue in terms of competition with China, which isn’t wrong. Unfortunately, the president’s answer — “more fossil fuels” — means that the U.S. will almost certainly lose that competition and Americans’ energy bills will increase still further.

In Trump’s telling, China powers its economy with glorious coal, while building wind and solar energy equipment to sell to other countries; those countries then destroy themselves by using renewable energy. But if we just double down on fossil fuels, we can triumph. “I saw a board outside and it showed how much electricity China is making,” he told the audience. “Well, we just started, but we’re going to actually end up doing more than them and it’s going to be done privately and you’re going to own your own electric plants and they’ll be powered by maybe nuclear, maybe gas, maybe coal. You know, we brought coal back in. They won’t be powered by wind because it doesn’t work.”

Wind does work just fine, as many of Trump’s red-state allies could tell him; the four states that generate the most power from wind are Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Kansas. Yet Trump is convinced not only that wind power is an abomination, but that China doesn’t use any. “They build the windmills, sell them into our country, sell them all over the world and they ruin their fields and ruin their valleys. And then you look at China, where’s your wind farm?” he asked. “No, the whole thing is crazy. But they use coal and they’re building right now about 52 power plants, all of coal.”

China does use lots of coal power, which is one reason it has overtaken the U.S. as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. But it has also made massive investments in renewable energy — $625 billion in 2024 alone. Contrary to Trump’s belief that China has no windmills, China generates more wind power than any other country on Earth. Its investment in solar power is even more impressive; by the end of 2024 it had installed five times as much solar capacity as the United States, and three-quarters of all the solar projects under construction in the world are in China. This May, the country added a gigawatt of solar power (enough for a midsize American city) every eight hours.

China dominates the solar panel industry, and it is far ahead of the U.S. in the production of batteries and electric vehicles.

Yes, as Trump said, they make wind power equipment and sell it to other countries. But Trump’s scorn for this fact is bizarre. Why wouldn’t any country want to supply the world with the machines it needs for the energy sources of the future? Doesn’t he want to promote American manufacturing? China dominates the solar panel industry, and it is far ahead of the U.S. in the production of batteries and electric vehicles. In short, as MIT Technology Review recently reported, “China is the dominant force in next-generation energy technologies today.”

The last administration tried to do something about that; Joe Biden signed legislation that included a long list of programs, loans and incentives to promote industrial revitalization through green technology. The reconciliation bill recently passed by Republicans and signed by Trump will attempt to undo that, by rolling back subsidies, shutting down worthwhile programs, and clawing back money targeted for renewables.

As a result, Americans will face higher energy bills. We’ll also get lower economic growth as we turn away from dynamic industries, less international competitiveness as China supplies the world with the equipment it needs, and more pollution (including carbon emissions) as we burn more fossil fuels.

The political reality is that many of those effects won’t be visible to the public. At the very least, the connections to Trump’s policies will be hard to discern. Most voters will never know the economic opportunities lost, or grasp how Trump’s promotion of coal and oil are worsening natural disasters. The price increases produced by his deranged tariff policies are much more likely to hit home in the short run.

But in the long run, Trump’s backward ideas will profoundly damage our country, our economy and our environment. China’s leaders may not be happy about his tariffs, but they couldn’t be more pleased with the way he’s turning America away from the energy of the future. A bunch of data centers in Pennsylvania won’t change that.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250717-donald-trump-vl-221p-7656ac.jpg",N,,2025-07-18 09:50:51.917974

Chairman Gordon “Gordy” Dove said that “our commitment to coastal restoration has not wavered” and that the state plans to pursue a smaller-scale diversion nearby.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Louisiana on Thursday canceled a $3 billion repair of disappearing Gulf coastline, funded by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement, scrapping what conservationists called an urgent response to climate change but Gov. Jeff Landry viewed as a threat to the state’s way of life.

Despite years of studies and reviews, the project at the center of Louisiana’s coastal protection plans grew increasingly imperiled after Landry, a Republican, took office last year. Its collapse means that the state could lose out on more than $1.5 billion in unspent funds and may even have to repay the $618 million it already used to begin building.

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group, a mix of federal agencies overseeing the settlement funds, said that “unused project funds will be available for future Deepwater Horizon restoration activities” but would require review and approval.

A plan to rebuild disappearing land

The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion Project aimed to rebuild upward of 20 square miles (32 kilometers) of land over a 50-year period in southeast Louisiana to combat sea level rise and erosion on the Gulf Coast. When construction stalled last year because of lawsuits, trustees warned that the state would have to return the hundreds of millions of dollars it had already spent if the project did not move forward.

Former Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who once led the state’s coastal restoration agency, said that killing the project was “a boneheaded decision” not rooted in science.

“It is going to result in one of the largest setbacks for our coast and the protection of our communities in decades,” Graves said. “I don’t know what chiropractor or palm reader they got advice from on this, but — baffling that someone thought this was a good idea.”

Project supporters stressed that it would have provided a data-driven, large-scale solution to mitigate the worst effects of an eroding coastline in a state where a football field of land is lost every 100 minutes and more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land have vanished over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The project, which broke ground in 2023, would have diverted sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River to restore wetlands disappearing because of a range of factors including climate-change-induced sea level rise and a vast river levee system that choked off natural land regeneration from sediment deposits.

“The science has not changed, nor has the need for urgent action,” said Kim Reyher, executive director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. “What has changed is the political landscape.”

The Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group last year had noted that “no other single restoration project has been planned and studied as extensively over the past decades.”

A perceived threat to Louisiana culture

While the project had largely received bipartisan support and was championed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, his successor has been a vocal opponent. Landry recoiled at the rising price tag and amplified concerns that the massive influx of freshwater would devastate local fisheries.

Landry has said the project would “break” Louisiana’s culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting and compared it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.

“We fought this battle a long time, but Gov. Landry is the reason we won this battle,” said Mitch Jurisich, who chairs the Louisiana Oyster Task Force and sued the state over the project’s environmental impacts, including likely killing thousands of bottlenose dolphins due to the onslaught of freshwater.

Landry said in a statement that the project is “no longer financially or practically viable,” noting that the cost has doubled since 2016.

“This level of spending is unsustainable,” Landry said. The project also “threatens Louisiana’s seafood industry, our coastal culture, and the livelihoods of our fishermen — people who have sustained our state for generations.”

The project’s budget had included more than $400 million for mitigating the costs to local communities, including to help the oyster industry build new oyster beds. Project proponents said that the rapid loss of coast meant communities would be displaced anyway if the state failed to take action to protect them.

“You either move oysters or move people, and there’s only one answer to that question,” Graves said.

State seeks a smaller, cheaper solution

Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, the lead agency overseeing the project, said in a statement that the project was “no longer viable at this time based on a totality of the circumstances” including costs, litigation and a federal permit suspended earlier this year after the state halted work on the project.

Chairman Gordon “Gordy” Dove said that “our commitment to coastal restoration has not wavered” and that the state plans to pursue a smaller-scale diversion nearby. Dove told lawmakers earlier this year that the state could save at least $1 billion with a different plan to channel river water into the Gulf Coast at a rate 5 to 30 times less than the Mid-Barataria project’s 75,000 cubic feet per second.

Conservation groups bristled at the change in plans. The Mid-Barataria project’s termination marked “a complete abandonment of science-driven decision-making and public transparency,” Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement, adding that the state was “throwing away” money intended to protect its coastal residents and economy.

The coalition said alternative measures proposed by the state, such as the smaller-scale diversion or rebuilding land by dredging, were insufficient to meaningfully combat land loss and did not undergo the same level of scientific vetting as the Mid-Barataria project.

“A stopgap project with no data is not a solution,” the coalition said. “We need diversion designs backed by science — not politics.”

“It is our understanding that a signed contract is required to qualify for the federal tax credit, and that the contract date serves as the determining factor,” a spokesperson for Honda told Gizmodo, while noting the government is still working it out.
With no clear guidance from the Treasury Department or IRS, consumers are left in the dark just as they’re being asked to make expensive decisions.
The Inflation Reduction Act created a powerful incentive structure for EV adoption, including: $7,500 tax credit for qualifying new EVs.
$4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs under $25,000.","If you’re thinking about buying an electric vehicle, brace yourself: the federal tax credits that offer up to $7,500 off new EVs and $4,000 off used ones could change as soon as September 30.

But here’s the real issue: Nobody knows for sure what happens next.

Carmakers, consumers, and even some dealerships have been operating under the belief that a signed contract before September 30 locks in the credit. But now, some automakers are quietly admitting that the IRS has not finalized that rule.

“It is our understanding that a signed contract is required to qualify for the federal tax credit, and that the contract date serves as the determining factor,” a spokesperson for Honda told Gizmodo, while noting the government is still working it out.

That caveat is huge. With no clear guidance from the Treasury Department or IRS, consumers are left in the dark just as they’re being asked to make expensive decisions.

What’s Actually at Stake?

The Inflation Reduction Act created a powerful incentive structure for EV adoption, including:

$7,500 tax credit for qualifying new EVs.

$4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs under $25,000.

Income limits for buyers.

Strict final assembly and battery sourcing rule.

These benefits have helped reduce upfront costs for many buyers, but they come with fine print, and that fine print may be changing soon.

September 30 has become an unofficial deadline based on how the law was initially interpreted. The industry believed that signing a contract by then would preserve your eligibility, even if the car arrives later. Now, that interpretation may no longer be reliable.

Automakers Stay Quiet as Consumers Scramble

Gizmodo reached out to several car companies. Most pointed to the IRS website and declined to provide clarity beyond current offers. Nissan confirmed that vehicles like the Ariya and new LEAF—built in Japan—don’t qualify under current rules, and had nothing to share about what will happen beyond September.

“We can only provide information on our current offers,” one spokesperson said. “At this time, we don’t have anything to share regarding additional incentives or rebates.”

This silence has left buyers confused. Many still assume any EV qualifies, but that’s not the case. In fact, most foreign-made models don’t, and even domestic ones may only qualify for partial credits based on battery sourcing.

The IRS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

What About Used EVs?

The lesser-known $4,000 credit for used EVs applies to:

Vehicles priced under $25,000

Purchased through a dealer (not private party)

With at least two prior model years

Income-qualified buyers only

But just like the new EV credit, it could be impacted by any regulatory shifts post-September.

Bottom Line: Act, But Cautiously

This is about timing. For buyers, a delay of even a few weeks could mean the difference between a five-figure incentive and nothing at all.

With the government still working out the final rules, the best advice is to stay alert and sign your contract before September 30 if you’re planning to buy. If you wait, you might not just miss the credit. You might miss the window entirely.

According to a fact sheet reviewed by Reuters, the 93.5% duty applies across the board to all Chinese producers of this type of graphite.

China currently dominates the global graphite market, especially in processing capacity.
Despite ongoing efforts to develop alternative materials, graphite is expected to remain the main anode material for lithium-ion batteries until at least 2030.","The US Commerce Department announced on Thursday that it will impose a steep 93.5% anti-dumping tariff on anode-grade graphite imported from China. Anode-grade graphite is an important material used in making batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). The decision came after the department found that Chinese companies were selling this graphite in the US at prices lower than fair market value.

According to a fact sheet reviewed by Reuters, the 93.5% duty applies across the board to all Chinese producers of this type of graphite. These graphite imports were worth around $347 million in 2023 alone.

The affected graphite is defined as having a carbon purity of at least 90% by weight. It can be natural, synthetic, or a blend of both. These materials are used specifically in battery anodes, the part of a battery that stores and releases energy.

A separate investigation into government subsidies for Chinese graphite producers is also underway. In that case, the Commerce Department issued a preliminary ruling in May, setting countervailing duties of 6.55% for most producers. However, some companies—such as Huzhou Kaijin New Energy Technology Corp and Shanghai Shaosheng—were hit with massive duties of over 700%.

Final decisions on both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs are expected by December 5, 2025.

US BATTERY MAKERS SEEK PROTECTION

The request for the duties was made by a group called the American Active Anode Material Producers. This coalition includes several US-based companies like Anovion Technologies in New York, Syrah Technologies in Louisiana, Novonix Anode Materials in Tennessee, Epsilon Advanced Materials in North Carolina, and SKI US Inc in Georgia.

These companies argue that Chinese firms are flooding the market with cheap graphite, making it harder for American businesses to compete. The tariffs are meant to level the playing field and protect US jobs and production capacity.

“Dumping graphite at unfair prices hurts American manufacturers and weakens our domestic battery supply chain,” said a spokesperson for one of the petitioning companies. “This step by the Commerce Department is a crucial move toward securing the future of clean energy in the US.”

GRAPHITE SEEN AS HIGH-RISK MATERIAL

Graphite is essential in producing anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the type commonly used in EVs. The US imported around 180,000 metric tons of graphite in 2023, with nearly two-thirds of it coming from China, according to BloombergNEF.

China currently dominates the global graphite market, especially in processing capacity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently warned that graphite is among the raw materials most at risk of supply disruption. The IEA called for urgent efforts to diversify sources of graphite to avoid over-dependence on any single country.

Despite ongoing efforts to develop alternative materials, graphite is expected to remain the main anode material for lithium-ion batteries until at least 2030. After that, silicon may start gaining more market share, the IEA noted in a May report.

The act repeals key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including longstanding renewable energy tax credits, and imposes stricter construction timelines to qualify for remaining incentives (Figure 1).

Despite these rollbacks, the OBBBA preserves tax credit transferability and extends direct pay options for critical credits for CCUS (45Q), green hydrogen (45V) and clean manufacturing (45X). It also overhauls clean fuel (45Z) and hydrogen credits, disadvantaging green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel while favoring renewable diesel, biodiesel, ethanol and RNG. Some 65% of planned clean hydrogen projects in the U.S. must accelerate timelines to ensure project competitiveness. These faster construction schedules necessitate developers to prioritize technology like biomass gasification over green hydrogen to preserve access to lucrative tax credits. Producers must integrate technologies and diversify revenue pathways to position themselves for success in an evolving market. The OBBBA delivers a significant setback to the wind and solar sectors by repealing the investment tax credit and production tax credit. Still, our analysis finds that 30% and 57% of the respective L48 queued solar and onshore wind capacity remain economically viable even in the absence of these credits. Taken together, the legislation represents a dramatic reconfiguration of federal energy incentives.

Burgum will now have ""final review"" of leases, rights-of-way, construction plans and every other aspect of the Interior Department's federal permitting process for wind and solar projects, according to an internal memo published by the department on Thursday.

The Interior Department said in a statement that it is ""levelling the playing field"" for coal and natural gas ""after years of assault"" by Biden administration. The renewable industry's main lobby group the American Clean Power Association said the action amounted to politically motivated obstruction.

""The Interior Department adds three new layers of needless process and unprecedented political review to the construction of domestic energy projects,"" ACP CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement.

""This isn't oversight. It's obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,"" Grumet said.

Interior is adding bureaucracy and red tape that will slow electricity production growth at a time when demand is rising from artificial intelligence data centers, said Stephanie Bosh, a spokesperson at the Solar Energy Industries Association.

""It is deeply unfortunate that this administration's energy policy continues to favor specific technologies rather than advance true American energy dominance,"" Bosh said in a statement.

Interior's action is the latest blow delivered to the renewable energy industry by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act terminates key tax incentives that have supported the growth of wind and solar projects in the U.S.

Trump issued an executive order shortly after the legislation passed that called for Interior ""to eliminate preferential treatment for wind and solar facilities compared to reliable, dispatchable energy sources,"" a reference to coal, natural gas and nuclear power.

An Illinois-based safety science company that certifies products that meet its safety requirements, UL is a globally recognized standard.
The company noted UL has not given any guidance for lithium-ion battery fires with the certification.
Full Circle said in 2024 its product passed the NTA 8133, a Dutch standard for portable extinguishers of lithium-ion battery fires.
Over the horizon, Full Circle will continue to pursue regulatory and industry certifications, the company said, including those specific to lithium-ion battery fire suppression.","Full Circle Lithium Corp. (FCLI-X) has announced its FCL-X lithium-ion battery fire extinguisher has been certified by Underwriters Laboratories Solutions (UL) for taking on class-A fires in Canada and the U.S.

The certification is expected to widen the market reach for the product. Full Circle's extinguisher is one of the few measures designed to assist in fighting these types of fires, which burn much hotter than most traditional materials and are becoming more common due to the massive growth in the lithium-ion battery industry.

An Illinois-based safety science company that certifies products that meet its safety requirements, UL is a globally recognized standard. After passing a series of UL tests, Full Circle’s FCL-X was recognized as a water-based agent that can extinguish class-A fires, which are fuelled by ordinary combustibles such as paper, wood, rubber and cloth.

The company noted UL has not given any guidance for lithium-ion battery fires with the certification.

Called a “major inflection point” for the company, founder and CEO Carlos Vicens said the recognition “opens the door to accelerated revenue growth and a broader commercial footprint in the U.S. and globally.""

FCL-X is now open to broader adoption in environments with common combustibles, the company said. Those include new markets in the industrial, commercial, retail and military sectors, plus government transportation agencies.

Full Circle is a Toronto-based company with manufacturing operations in Georgia. With the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) and consumer electronics – cars, trucks, bikes, scooters, cellphones – battery fires have been identified as a growing safety problem by fire departments around the world.

Such blazes – which can reach a staggering 2,760 C – burn more than three times hotter than a fire from a gas-powered car due to the battery chemicals, leading to thermal runaway.

Full Circle's sales and plans

FCL-X is a water-based chemical agent made from recycled batteries. By opting for water rather than foam or gel, the agent can “penetrate everywhere,” Vicens previously told Sustainable Biz Canada.

In a past test, around 120 gallons of FCL-X stifled an EV battery fire that reached approximately 800 C within 15 minutes, without re-ignition. A similar result was found when the product was tested by a large EV manufacturer and a fire department in Georgia.

Full Circle said in 2024 its product passed the NTA 8133, a Dutch standard for portable extinguishers of lithium-ion battery fires.

Sold in 2.5-gallon extinguishers and bulk containers and tanks, the company has already secured some customers.

In 2024, it signed a global distribution agreement with US Fire Pump Company, made its first sale to a fire department in Georgia, and inked its first master distribution agreement in the U.S. with AEST Fire and Safety, a North Carolina-based firefighting equipment firm.

Over the horizon, Full Circle will continue to pursue regulatory and industry certifications, the company said, including those specific to lithium-ion battery fire suppression.

In March 2025, the company unveiled a memorandum of understanding with Japanese firm ITOCHU Corporation to bring FCL-X to Japan and South Korea. From those two countries as a starting point, the hope is to expand to other Asian markets.

In its Q1 financials announced April, the company reported US$384,749 in revenue from its initial quarter of FCL-X marketing and sales in North America.

The retail launch of a smaller FCL-X extinguisher designed for fires that emerge from electronics, e-scooters and e-bikes is expected to be launched by the end of Q3 2025.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025071630-fclx-extinguisher-400x300.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:03:37.069306

While it’s unclear what research projects at PNNL could be at risk, the spending bill will result in significant cuts to research grants — especially those related to health and medicine.","The Tri-Cities has a thriving energy sector with billions of dollars in planned investments that is now at risk with the President Trump’s signing of the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

It slashes research grants, eliminates tax credits for solar and wind projects and threatens to slow down radioactive waste cleanup at the Hanford nuclear site.

The Tri-Cities will take a much harder hit to science and research projects than most areas of the country with an economy rooted in billions of dollars to Hanford cleanup work and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland.

The massive bill is guided by spending requests from the White House. It will extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, while cutting billions of dollars in social program funding. It’s been described as the largest cuts to social welfare programs since at least the 1990s, and according to some experts the most severe in modern history.

Energy funding

Major cuts to green energy funding could impact the Tri-Cities area.

Several major wind and solar projects are proposed in the region, but the spending bill all but eliminates incentives for wind, solar and other clean energy projects.

It’s unclear if any projects currently being developed will be impacted by these reductions, but they’re sure to factor into any future considerations for similar energy initiatives in the area.

Tax credits for buying electric vehicles and residential solar panels also are eliminated.

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, saved some tax credits for energy projects that were set to be eliminated. The credits are highly sought after by companies looking to build small modular nuclear reactors in the Tri-Cities area. Loss of these credits could have cost the region billions of dollars in projects to power data centers.

Hanford nuclear site

While the budget at the Hanford site isn’t being cut, lawmakers say the funding is inadequate to achieve cleanup goals.

The Washington state Department of Ecology, a Hanford regulator, estimated in 2024 that a budget of almost $4.7 billion would be needed in fiscal 2026 to meet legal deadlines for environmental cleanup of the site.

The proposal for FY 2026 would provide just under $3.1 billion for environmental cleanup work at the nuclear site in Eastern Washington, where about 13,000 are employed.

LIGO Observatory

The cuts slated for the National Science Foundation could shutter one of the nation’s two LIGO sites.

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatories, LIGO Hanford, is about 10 miles from Richland on unused Hanford nuclear site land, and its twin, LIGO Livingston is in Louisiana.

The two observatories work in tandem to study gravitational waves. Confirming findings at each site is key to their research.

The Trump proposal calls for not only closing one of the two U.S. observatories in fiscal 2026 but also reducing LIGO spending for technology development. Their total budget would be reduced by 40% from $48 million in fiscal 2024 to $29 million in fiscal 2026.

It’s unclear what that means for planned upgrades slated for 2026, or which site is being considered for closure.

Scientific research grants

The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory employs more than 6,000 scientists, engineers and other professionals engaged in cutting edge research.

Research at the laboratory covers a wide array of disciplines with work on everything from hazardous waste cleanup to national security technology and medical advances.

While it’s unclear what research projects at PNNL could be at risk, the spending bill will result in significant cuts to research grants — especially those related to health and medicine.

Estimates from a new group called Friends of PNNL, places the price tag of lost research funding as high as $250 million. Those cuts are just from work on renewable energy and biological and environmental research. The group is made up of supporters and retired lab workers advocating to save the funding.

The National Institutes of Health has already canceled or delayed thousands of grant projects.

The most recent round of NSF grant cuts included will lead to less opportunity for women and minorities in STEM. An analysis by the Hechinger Report listed cuts of:

$28 million to biological science research

$45 million for computer and information science and engineering

$36 million for geosciences

$61 million for technology, innovation and partnerships.

More than $773 million in grants for STEM education were also cut.

The analysis said these cuts largely focused on efforts to increase participation of women and Black and Hispanic students in STEM fields.

Total cuts to science and education grants could reach as high as 50%, according to the University of California. Such drastic cuts would see China overtaking the United States in total research and development funding by 2027.

National Weather Service

The National Weather Service office covering the Tri-Cities area already has been impacted by DOGE cuts. Earlier this year the office had to eliminate overnight staffing due to job cuts and a federal hiring freeze.

The office in Pendleton, Ore., serves one of the largest areas outside of Alaska. Its Washington state service area includes Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla, Yakima, Columbia, Kittitas and Klickitat counties. It also covers 11 counties in Eastern Oregon, including Umatilla and Morrow counties.

The office will still have limited staffing during emergencies.

At the end of the month the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees the NWS, will lose access to the Department of Defense satellites that enable it to track real time atmospheric conditions. This data is key to NWS hurricane forecasting, say officials.

Weather balloon launches, another tool in tracking real time weather conditions, have also been cut back at several locations. NASA has a balloon launch site in the Pacific Northwest in Burns, Ore., about 5 hours south of the Tri-Cities.

While the NWS has acknowledged earlier job cuts went too far, it is expected to only fill 126 of the estimated 600 positions cut nationwide.

In the shadow of San Francisco's Transamerica Pyramid, three corporate titans unveiled a mobility revolution that could fundamentally alter how urbanites navigate their cities. Uber, Lucid Motors, and autonomous technology pioneer Nuro announced yesterday a sweeping partnership to deploy over 20,000 driverless electric vehicles across Uber's global platform, beginning next year in a major U.S. metropolis.

The alliance—backed by hundreds of millions in Uber's direct investment into both partners—isn't merely another autonomous vehicle experiment. With Lucid's premium electric SUVs equipped with Nuro's proven Level 4 autonomy system, the program represents the largest commercial robotaxi commitment to date, dwarfing Waymo's current 1,500-vehicle fleet.

""We're done with the science projects and ready for mass deployment,"" said a senior executive close to the partnership, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the announcement. ""This isn't about tech demos anymore—we're talking about transforming the economics of urban transit at scale.""

The Full-Stack Revolution: When Silicon Valley Meets Detroit

What distinguishes this partnership from previous autonomous ventures is its vertical integration across the entire mobility value chain. Lucid contributes its Gravity platform—a spacious electric SUV with approximately 450 miles of range and redundant architecture designed specifically for ride-sharing. Nuro's battle-tested autonomous system, already deployed in commercial delivery services, provides the AI-powered brain. Uber brings its global dispatch network and operational expertise.

Market analysts note that the partnership creates a closed-loop system where each participant contributes critical expertise while addressing traditional weak points in autonomous deployment.

""Previous attempts at robotaxi services suffered from piecemeal approaches—either great autonomy with mediocre vehicles, or excellent vehicles with unproven software,"" explained an industry consultant who advises multiple mobility startups. ""This triumvirate potentially solves the integration challenges that have plagued earlier efforts.""

The $17 Billion Race: Why This Time Is Different

The global robotaxi market is projected to exceed $17 billion by 2029, growing at over 70% annually, according to industry forecasts. This explosive growth potential has attracted numerous players, but the Uber-Lucid-Nuro coalition brings unique advantages to the intensifying competition.

First is scale. At 20,000+ vehicles, Uber's commitment represents an order magnitude larger than existing pilots. Second is the economic model—by removing human drivers, operational costs could drop by up to 70%, allowing for both competitive pricing and healthy margins. Third is the strategic investment component—Uber's equity stakes in both Lucid and Nuro (reportedly totaling $300 million for Lucid alone) align incentives across the partnership.

For Lucid, struggling with consumer EV sales in a brutally competitive market, the deal provides crucial revenue visibility, explaining the nearly 40% jump in its stock price following the announcement. For Nuro, it offers unprecedented validation of its autonomous technology beyond last-mile delivery applications.

Behind Closed Doors: The Strategic Calculus

The partnership didn't materialize overnight. Sources familiar with the negotiations describe an 18-month courtship marked by intense technical validation, regulatory navigation, and financial structuring.

A venture capitalist with knowledge of the deal's mechanics revealed: ""Uber needed to secure not just vehicles, but influence over the technology roadmap. Taking equity positions in both companies gives them a seat at the table for critical decisions around safety protocols, feature prioritization, and cost management.""

The transaction structure also reflects lessons learned from previous autonomous driving partnerships that disintegrated due to misaligned incentives. By becoming a significant shareholder in both technology providers, Uber creates mutual dependencies that may prove more durable than mere contractual arrangements.

The Urban Battleground: Where Rubber Meets Road

Implementation will begin in a yet-unnamed ""major U.S. city"" in early 2026, with gradual expansion to global markets over six years. This phased approach acknowledges the complex regulatory landscape governing autonomous vehicles.

The program faces formidable challenges. Regulatory frameworks remain fragmented across jurisdictions, with each U.S. state maintaining distinct requirements for autonomous vehicles. Public acceptance remains tentative, with surveys showing mixed attitudes toward driverless transportation. And competition is intensifying, with Waymo expanding operations in multiple cities, Tesla piloting limited robotaxi services in Austin, and Amazon-backed Zoox targeting Las Vegas despite recent regulatory setbacks.

""The winner in this space needs three things: regulatory savvy, technological excellence, and operational efficiency,"" noted a transportation policy expert who has consulted for multiple municipalities on autonomous vehicle integration. ""This partnership appears designed to address all three pillars simultaneously.""

The Investment Calculus: Risk and Reward

For investors eyeing exposure to the autonomous mobility revolution, the partnership creates multiple entry points with varying risk profiles.

Uber represents the most accessible play, with its established business providing downside protection should the robotaxi initiative face delays. The $1.6-1.9 billion contract value for Lucid (based on an estimated $80,000-95,000 per vehicle) offers substantial revenue visibility, though execution risks remain significant.

Industry observers suggest a measured approach. ""Consider a 10% overweight position in Uber equity, complemented by a smaller tactical allocation to Lucid shares,"" recommended a portfolio manager specializing in mobility technologies. ""But hedge your exposure with options strategies to mitigate downside from potential regulatory or technical delays.""

Investors should remain cognizant that autonomous technology timelines frequently slip, and that a single safety incident could trigger regulatory interventions affecting the entire sector. Past performance of autonomous vehicle investments has demonstrated substantial volatility, and future results cannot be guaranteed.

The Road Ahead: Transformation or Mirage?

As cities worldwide grapple with congestion, emissions, and transportation inequity, the promise of electric, autonomous mobility services presents a tantalizing solution. Yet the graveyard of mobility innovations is filled with promising technologies that failed to navigate the complex interplay of regulation, consumer acceptance, and economic viability.

For the Uber-Lucid-Nuro coalition, success will depend not merely on technological excellence, but on creating a service that seamlessly integrates into existing urban transportation ecosystems while delivering tangible benefits to cities and citizens alike.

The 20,000-vehicle commitment represents both audacious ambition and calculated risk. Whether it marks the turning point for mass robotaxi adoption or becomes another costly detour on the autonomous journey remains to be seen. What's certain is that the stakes—and potential rewards—have never been higher.

They say it jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights-of-way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.”

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies what for he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. They say it jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/preview-1299.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:05:35.871088

A flight corridor for testing drones and electric aircraft will link the University of Michigan’s one-of-a-kind autonomy research and proving ground facilities in Ann Arbor to Michigan Central’s real-world, urban testbed and innovation district in Detroit.

Announced July 17 by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the roughly 40-mile research skyway will be the centerpiece of M-Air, a new public-private partnership U-M is launching for advanced air mobility. M-Air is to be part of the existing public-private partnership Mcity, which provides a connected and automated vehicle test facility under the U-M Transportation Research Institute.

The state of Michigan is providing $1 million in anchor support for M-Air as part of a broader advanced air mobility initiative.

“The next frontier of mobility is moving from land to sky, where drones and electric aerial vehicles can transform how we move people and goods. Michigan Engineering’s M-Air partnership will play an important role in propelling the state to national leadership in advanced aviation technology and developing the workforce we need to sustain it,” said Karen Thole, the Robert J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering and a professor of mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering.

The M-Air public-private partnership

M-Air will enable advanced air mobility researchers and companies to test their technologies in realistic environments, with a particular focus on beyond-line-of-sight operation of autonomous aircraft as well as battery powered aircraft that use vertical take off and landing (VTOLs), like helicopters. Current regulations restrict most drones to within the range a pilot can see unaided, which limits their usefulness. Both drones and electric VTOLs have been identified as national priorities in a recent White House executive order.

“It is an exciting time in aerospace with the confluence of electric powertrain, distributed-propulsion-enabled new aircraft designs and autonomous operation. There is an enormous cross-over of talent and technology between electric and automated vehicles and electric aircraft and drones,” said Venkat Viswanathan, director of M-Air and an associate professor of aerospace engineering.

“Drones are already used in agriculture, insurance and infrastructure management, and as the tech stack matures, drones have the potential to be the cheapest, fastest way of transporting goods. M-Air will help solve technical problems and help answer regulatory questions that will enable advanced aircraft to fulfill their potential.”

The effort is funded through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), with infrastructure support from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). It will be an expansion to the Mcity test facility, which provides physical, remote, mixed-reality and fully simulated environments for testing connected and automated vehicles. In addition to building and managing ground testing facilities, Mcity will manage user access for the flight corridor in partnership with MDOT and Michigan Central.

“MDOT continues to deliver on its mission to connect people and serve communities across all modes of transportation, and we are particularly excited to explore the safe integration of this novel aviation technology as one more mobility option for the citizens of Michigan,” said Bryan Budds, director of the MDOT Office of Aeronautics. “Additionally, we look forward to working with the University of Michigan and communities along the corridor to ensure the thoughtful deployment of this technology in the region.”

M-Air corridor and ‘iron bird’

M-Air’s new “iron bird” testbed facilities will enable users to demonstrate the flight performance of new batteries and motors on the ground before trial runs in the air. The flight corridor will be outfitted with a drone traffic management system that meets national safety standards, enabling drones to share low-altitude airspace even beyond the operator’s line of sight. It will also support swarm operations testing, with multiple drones working together on a shared objective.

The corridor will run through U-M Dearborn, providing access to the state-of-the-art facility to faculty and students at a second U-M campus.

At its other end point, Michigan Central is a business incubator focused on advanced mobility, supporting start-ups and small businesses that may benefit from easy access to flight testing. It’s also home to the Advanced Aerial Innovation Region, which focuses on commercial drone development.

“M-Air is Michigan’s launchpad for the next wave of autonomous flight,” said Ben Marchionna, chief innovation ecosystem officer at the MEDC. “It gives researchers and founders a real-world airspace testbed to safely deploy, learn fast and get hardware ready to power Michigan’s next generation of innovative industries. That’s the ‘Make It in Michigan’ promise: invent it, build it and grow it—without leaving the state.”

One way that U-M intends to use M-Air is to help advance Michigan Medicine’s Survival Flight service, which transports patients and carries organs for transplant. Already, helicopters could benefit from drone detection systems to prevent collisions in case drones stray into the wrong airspace. And in the future, Survival Flight may use electric aircraft or smaller, lighter drones to transport organs and medicines.

“As an air medical team, Survival Flight is proud to support the launch of M-Air, which strengthens Michigan’s leadership in advanced mobility and supports a future where every second saved has the power to save a life. By enabling real-world testing of beyond-line-of-sight and VTOL capabilities, M-Air will help ensure drones are safely and effectively integrated into critical response operations,” said Donna Robinson, director of Survival Flight.

Among its educational initiatives, M-Air will participate in the Perot Jain TechLab series, which enables students to collaborate with entrepreneurs. That’s just one of the ways it will help incubate, attract and nurture aerospace startups and improve student experiential learning from K-12 to graduate education.

M-Air is currently finalizing its founding industry members. Members of M-Air will help guide the initial research directions as well as the construction of the testing facilities and corridor, identifying use cases and collaborating on grant proposals.

In addition to the $1 million from MEDC’s Office of Future Mobility and Electrification, U-M will contribute $1 million.

Previously, the M-Air name belonged to a netted outdoor drone testing space near the aerospace engineering and robotics departments. That facility will now be called M-Air Net.",https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mc-image-cache/2025/07/michigans-air-mobility-research-corridor-to-advance-electric-air-travel-and-beyond-line-of-sight-drones-M-Air-drones-robots.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:54:23.708086

The order ""will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative"" on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.
The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,"" the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order ""will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative"" on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.''

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

""This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

'Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

The BRIC program serves as the cornerstone of FEMA’s mitigation efforts.
This decision has jeopardized important infrastructure projects in Maryland, such as flood mitigation efforts in Crisfield and South Baltimore.
Attorney General Brown and the coalition contend that FEMA’s decision to abruptly terminate the BRIC program violates clear Congressional directives to fund pre-disaster mitigation.","BALTIMORE, MD—Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown has joined a coalition of 20 states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its decision to halt the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, alleges the termination of the program, designed to protect communities from natural disasters, is unlawful.

The BRIC program has operated for three decades, providing resources for communities nationwide to proactively strengthen infrastructure against natural disasters. Proponents of the program argue it has protected property, reduced post-disaster costs, and saved lives by focusing on preparedness.

“Any community in Maryland can be struck by a devastating natural disaster that forever changes the lives of those who live there,” Attorney General Brown said in a statement. “BRIC funding was intended to pay for critical flood protection projects in Crisfield and South Baltimore and is now in jeopardy because of the Trump administration’s funding cuts. With the deadly flooding we’ve recently seen in New Mexico, North Carolina, and Texas, this is the worst possible time to cut life-saving disaster preparedness funding.”

Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress passed legislation mandating FEMA protect communities through four functions: mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery. The BRIC program serves as the cornerstone of FEMA’s mitigation efforts. A recent study cited in the lawsuit suggests that every dollar FEMA spends on mitigation saves an average of six dollars in subsequent disaster costs.

The program supports various projects, including the construction of evacuation shelters and flood walls, safeguarding utility grids against wildfires, protecting water infrastructure, and fortifying bridges, roadways, and culverts.

According to the lawsuit, the program’s termination has forced communities across the country to delay, scale back, or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects, some of which had been in development for years with significant prior investment. This leaves communities at a heightened risk of harm from natural disasters.

Nationwide, FEMA had selected nearly 2,000 projects to receive approximately $4.5 billion in BRIC funding over the past four years. Maryland alone was awarded more than $80 million in BRIC funds from 2020 to 2023, though much of that money became unavailable after FEMA’s purported termination of the program earlier this year. This decision has jeopardized important infrastructure projects in Maryland, such as flood mitigation efforts in Crisfield and South Baltimore.

Attorney General Brown and the coalition contend that FEMA’s decision to abruptly terminate the BRIC program violates clear Congressional directives to fund pre-disaster mitigation. They also assert that the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act and that the program’s termination was unlawfully executed because Cameron Hamilton, who they argue was never Congressionally confirmed or qualified to be FEMA Administrator, issued the directive.

The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the Trump administration from redirecting BRIC funds for other purposes and a permanent injunction to reverse the program’s termination, demanding the restoration of these funds to the communities that rely on them.

States joining Maryland in the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, along with the governor of Pennsylvania.",http://www.nottinghammd.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Anthony-G-Brown.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:03:43.245535

Another key provision of the legislation is the withdrawal of tax incentives for investments in clean energy projects.
“The early termination of many clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will diminish future incentives for banks to engage in clean energy projects,” LeDonne said.
Further, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing treasury to strictly enforce phase-outs of clean energy tax credits.” The result, she said, is that “any future treasury guidance will likely not be favorable.
That will provide a clearer picture on the full impact of the tax changes such as with accounting for clean energy credits.","In Brief:

100% bonus depreciation benefits LI capital investments

SALT cap raised to $40K helps Long Island taxpayers

Tip and overtime tax breaks support local service workers

Clean energy credits end, affecting LI investment plans

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” signed into law this month by President Trump promises tax relief for tip workers and small businesses, while ending clean energy incentives—and leaves many details as questions to be answered later on.

The result: Tax policies established in 2017 will now continue, but even deeper cuts some had hoped for did not pan out.

Considered to be President Trump’s signature legislation starting his second term, the bill—in addition to the tax and economic provisions—also provides significant new spending for military and immigration enforcement. Additionally, it introduces significant new work and reporting requirements for Medicaid which analysts believe will reduce spending on the program by almost

$1 trillion.

“I just had a client recently say…well, half a loaf of bread is better than no bread,” said Jess LeDonne, director of tax technical with The Bonadio Group, which has offices in new York City. “You know…where we landed with this was, again, not as impactful, maybe as we thought, feared, hoped, depending on the situation.”

Dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” by President Trump, it passed both houses of Congress this month along party lines. Tax and accounting experts consider, among its highlights:

One hundred-percent bonus depreciation returns: Businesses can now immediately expense qualified assets (computers, machinery, furniture, vehicles) placed in service after January 19, 2025, rather than depreciating them over time. This provides significant tax savings and better cash flow alignment for capital investments.

SALT deduction cap increased: The State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction limit increases from $10,000 to $40,000 for taxpayers with income up to $500,000, effective 2025 through 2029. This particularly benefits Long Island residents with high property taxes, though it reverts back to $10,000 in 2030.

No tax on tips and overtime: New above-the-line deductions facilitate up to $25,000 for qualified tips and $25,000 for overtime pay (joint filers) for tax years 2025-2028, with phase-outs starting at $150,000-$300,000 income levels. This provides significant tax relief for service industry workers.

“The most impactful and beneficial business tax provision change relates to the reinstatement of immediate expensing of qualified assets placed in service on or after Jan. 19, 2025 [also known as 100 percent bonus depreciation],” said John Ingrassia, managing director of the Long Island tax practice at the accounting firm UHY.

“Another significant change relates to the immediate expensing of domestic research costs, which had been previously capitalized and amortized over five years,” Ingrassia said.

He added: “Both provisions are permanent, which will facilitate taxpayers to better plan for tax savings in the foreseeable future.”

As a result of changes to business deductions permitted in the law, businesses may need to consider reconsidering recent expenditures.

“Companies should revisit their capital expenditure budgets for computers, machinery, furniture, vehicles, other fixed asset purchases and plant expansions to align with this enhanced depreciation benefit,” said Michael Rubin, a partner with CPA firm DDK & Company, which maintains a Jericho office.

The precise details of a number of aspects of the legislation won’t be fully known until after the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Treasury finalizes and publishes tax rules to be used when filing.

Another key provision of the legislation is the withdrawal of tax incentives for investments in clean energy projects.

“The early termination of many clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will diminish future incentives for banks to engage in clean energy projects,” LeDonne said. “For new deals, there are key transition dates for the start of construction and placed in service that will now become critical as to whether any credit is allowed under the phase out transition rules. Further, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing treasury to strictly enforce phase-outs of clean energy tax credits.”

The result, she said, is that “any future treasury guidance will likely not be favorable. While transferability is retained for applicable credits until they are phased out, banks that invest in new deals going forward need to be especially careful with the transition rules.”

The law changes what has been known as GILTI: the Global Intangible Low Tax Income, which was enacted to provide a minimum tax for multinational corporations when filing. First, GILTI will now be renamed “net CFC” or Net Controlled Foreign Corporation Tested Income.

“Effective for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, the bill makes permanent a 40 percent net CFC tested income deduction for an effective tax rate of 12.6 percent and 33.34 percent foreign-derived eligible income for an effective tax rate of 14 percent,” Rubin said.

Ultimately, the devil will be in the details and those details will be spelled out by the IRS in forthcoming guidance and rules. That will provide a clearer picture on the full impact of the tax changes such as with accounting for clean energy credits.

“We need more guidance,” LeDonne said. “We’re just going to await that and see when we get some clarity.”",https://libn.com/files/2025/07/focus718.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:55:53.935582

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm.

Market Access: The New Gatekeeper At the same time, Chinese automakers face significant headwinds in entering the U.S. market.
In this context, Mexico may become a critical point of entry for U.S. legacy automakers for a much larger strategic incursion.
Four Strategic Futures: Scenarios for 2035 Plotting EV adoption against Chinese market access yields four plausible future scenarios:","In 2014, China’s automotive industry was nearing a structural inflection point. Growth had slowed from an explosive 25% compound annual growth rate to a more GDP-aligned 6% range, while the product lifecycle (number of vehicles produced) and industry lifecycle (number of independent automakers) were beginning to decouple. As a result, overcapacity was rising—along with mounting pressure on margins and costs—and competitive dynamics were shifting.

At the same time, demand was differentiating between major metropolitan areas and smaller cities. In major cities, saturation and wealth effects led to slower growth and a shift toward premium and replacement vehicles. In contrast, smaller cities saw continued growth from first-time buyers. Regional fragmentation in consumer preferences, combined with a shift from compact cars to SUVs, suggested the need for dual business models and multi-brand portfolios. Success would require stronger regional marketing and sales capabilities.

As the market matured, profit pools began to shift. Used vehicles from larger cities started cannibalizing new vehicle demand in less-populated regions. The aftermarket was emerging as a critical source of profitability, though its most lucrative segments risked being captured by independent players and global suppliers. Increasingly, lease and finance products were becoming essential sales enablers, especially for younger consumers.

Altogether, the business model was evolving from a “hunter-gatherer” paradigm focused solely on new car sales to a “seed-harvest” model. In this new context, capabilities such as cross-selling, used vehicle management and aftermarket service and parts became essential. Retailers and dealers, in turn, would require far more robust OEM support.

Perhaps the most radical notion at the time was that some Chinese automakers could become global category killers following a five-stage process: gain domestic dominance, leverage cost advantages, drive innovation through relentless cost focus, expand internationally and move upmarket via R&D and strategic partnerships.

To many industry executives, this sounded fanciful. A decade later, it’s clear that’s exactly what has happened.

From Doubt to Dominance: The Rise of BYD

By 2025, several Chinese automakers, most notably BYD, have indeed emerged as formidable global competitors. Originally a battery maker, BYD has become the world’s leading EV manufacturer. A 2023 UBS teardown of the BYD Seal—a sleek, high-performance sedan - revealed not only a vehicle superior in build quality to its Western rivals but also up to 25% cheaper to produce.

BYD’s growing portfolio includes budget-friendly models such as the Seagull (under $12,000) and Dolphin, as well as larger electric SUVs like the Song and Tang. These models deliver a compelling mix of value, design and performance—qualities that are resonating well beyond China’s borders.

To support its global ambitions, BYD is aggressively localizing supply chains, manufacturing and talent. Its four existing overseas knock-down (KD) plants each exceed 40% localization rates. New facilities in India, Turkey and Mexico are expected to surpass that benchmark.

However, caveats remain. BYD’s core strengths—agility, vertical integration and risk tolerance—are deeply embedded in China’s business ecosystem. Whether these advantages will translate abroad remains uncertain. Challenges around brand management, regulatory hurdles and geopolitical tensions could all slow the company’s advance. And then there are questions regarding the firm’s financial health, including speculation that it might even become the next Evergrande. Still, the parallels with the rise of Japanese automakers in the 1980s are striking: a new competitor, operating on a different productivity frontier, is resetting global expectations.

Strategic Thresholds: Will the Threat Materialize?

Whether Chinese EV manufacturers represent an existential threat to U.S. legacy automakers hinges on two key variables: the pace of EV adoption in the U.S. and the degree of market access available to Chinese firms.

EV Uptake and the Adoption Chasm

The U.S. EV market is currently experiencing a familiar phenomenon in technology adoption: the “chasm” between early adopters and the early majority. Sales have slowed as the latter group—who prioritize cost, convenience and reliability—remains unconvinced. These adoption “saddles” are common, often lasting several years and delaying mass-market penetration. It remains to be seen whether EVs will fully replace internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, or whether the market will segment into a mix of powertrains based on region, duty cycle and use case.

Market Access: The New Gatekeeper

At the same time, Chinese automakers face significant headwinds in entering the U.S. market. From tariffs to national security concerns, the political environment is increasingly adversarial. Yet Chinese OEMs are not standing still. Mexico is emerging as a strategic beachhead.

By leveraging USMCA trade protections, Chinese automakers are building capacity in Mexico to potentially target underserved white space at the bottom end of the U.S. market, namely ICE passenger cars and trucks priced below $30,000. This strategy allows them to build local credibility, scale operations and establish cost advantages before launching a full EV offensive when market conditions permit.

In this context, Mexico may become a critical point of entry for U.S. legacy automakers for a much larger strategic incursion.

It's another way the federal government is pulling back support for cleaner cars.

The Trump administration just told automakers not to worry about paying those pesky fines they've racked up for making cars that pollute excessively.

According to a letter to car manufacturers from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that was seen by The Detroit News, the government is wiping away penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program dating back to the 2022 model year.

The Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed early this month, reduced fines under CAFE regulations to zero, effectively neutering the longstanding rules that push automakers to sell increasingly fuel efficient cars over time. Now it's clear that the federal government is reaching back in time as well, nullifying any infractions that automakers may have committed in years for which the fines haven't been tallied up yet.

It's just one move of many from the Trump administration and Congress aimed at eliminating support for electric vehicles and making it easier for car companies to continue selling gas-guzzling vehicles.

In February, the Department of Transportation suddenly cut off billions of dollars earmarked for building out EV charging infrastructure. This month, Congress voted to axe EV tax credits after September 30—eight years early. The Environmental Protection Agency is working to relax the previous administration's rules that restrict harmful tailpipe emissions.

Gutting CAFE regulations will likely make cars more expensive to operate, experts say, since Americans will have to buy more gas over time. Climate and clean-car advocates have railed against the move too.

Another consequence: The market for carbon credits that automakers can buy to avoid paying fines has evaporated. That'll hit a significant source of revenue for Tesla, America's leading EV maker.

The 2025 Wey Lanshan is now available in China starting at $41,520.","China's Great Wall Motors (GWM) has recently announced a new SUV under its Wey brand, according to CnEVPost.

The Lanshan is a six-seat, plug-in hybrid SUV with all-wheel drive, refreshing last year's model, CnEVPost reported. The new Lanshan will be available in three variants: Max, Ultra, and Ultra Black Knight. Battery capacities are available up to 52.3 kWh, with the range topping out at 834 miles, or 136 miles if going all-electric. GWM says the Lanshan can hit 62 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds.

As for bells and whistles, a video tour posted to YouTube shows that the Lanshan has a rear entertainment system, passenger tray tables, seat massage, autopilot, wireless phone charging, and a driver's side heads-up display.

Upgrading to an electric vehicle is also a massive leap in quality from a gas car.

For starters, burning gas produces loads of health hazards for those in the car. Plus, light-duty vehicles like passenger cars are responsible for a large portion of American emissions. This atmospheric pollution exacerbates destructive weather patterns like floods and droughts. It also speeds up polar ice cap melt, which, in turn, raises sea levels. Going electric helps push back against those consequences.

Hybrid vehicles are a comfortable middle ground for those with range anxiety, but carry with them a loss in efficiency for juggling two systems. When the option is available, it's worth going all-electric. Either way, studies show that most buyers of both pure electric and hybrid vehicles don't want to go back to gas cars.

One major reason to go all-in with electric is the ability to charge your EV at home with solar power. This reduces costs even further in the long run. EnergySage has a free online tool that can connect homeowners to vetted local solar installers. With their help, homeowners can save up to $10,000 in installation costs thanks to rebates and credits.

The 30% solar tax credits in the United States are on the way out at the end of the year, though, so it's best to jump on them while they're available.

“He said, ‘Well, let’s just resolve this now,’” Mr. Hawley said.
A person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed that Mr. Trump had called Mr. Wright while Mr. Hawley was in the Oval Office.
The Energy Department has said Mr. Wright is currently reviewing all loans and loan guarantees it has made, including the commitment to Invenergy.
“Grain Belt Express seeks to bring an end to the A.G.’s unlawful and politically motivated investigation.”","Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said he had secured a commitment from Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a conditional loan guarantee that the federal agency had granted to the developers of an $11 billion transmission line in the Midwest, with an assist from President Trump.

The line, known as Grain Belt Express, is designed to transport electricity generated by wind farms in Kansas across four states, including Missouri, to more densely populated regions in Indiana and Illinois. It would be the largest privately funded transmission line in the country’s history, said Invenergy, its developer.

In the works for more than a decade, the project appeared in recent months to have everything it needed to proceed, according to Invenergy. Approvals from the four states were in hand, contractors were ready to begin construction and the loan guarantee from the government provided critical financial support.

It was just the kind of project that utilities and energy experts say is needed, a way to deliver new sources of energy to meet spiking demand for electricity around the country.

But in recent weeks, challenges in Missouri appeared.

Mr. Hawley began to question the viability of the project, saying it did not benefit Missouri residents and that farmers were upset that Invenergy was using eminent domain in some cases to run high voltage lines and place transmission towers on farmland. In March and again in June, Mr. Hawley called on the Energy Department to cancel the $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the project, which was awarded during the final months of the Biden Administration.

This month, the Missouri attorney general, Andrew Bailey, a Republican, opened an investigation into the project and requested that the state’s Public Service Commission reconsider its approval.

Then, last Thursday, Mr. Hawley was in the Oval Office, speaking with Mr. Trump when the conversation turned to the Grain Belt Express, Mr. Hawley said.

He said he explained his concerns to the president, who has repeatedly expressed his distaste for wind power, saying he would not permit any new wind projects during his administration.

“He said, ‘Well, let’s just resolve this now,’” Mr. Hawley said. “So he got Chris Wright on the line right there.”

Mr. Hawley said he repeated his concerns to the energy secretary and that the president asked “several searching questions.”

Mr. Hawley said that Mr. Wright announced that he intended to cancel the loan guarantee, and that he predicted it would happen in a couple weeks.

A person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed that Mr. Trump had called Mr. Wright while Mr. Hawley was in the Oval Office.

The White House and the Energy Department both declined to comment.

The Energy Department has said Mr. Wright is currently reviewing all loans and loan guarantees it has made, including the commitment to Invenergy.

In a statement posted on X, Invenergy called Mr. Hawley’s actions “bizarre.”

“Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history, which is already approved by all four states and is aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda,” the statement said. “Senator Hawley is trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability and national security, all in an era of exponentially growing electricity demand.”

The company also wrote a letter to Mr. Wright pleading its case and noting that Grain Belt Express has broad bipartisan support.

The Missouri Public Service commission on Wednesday said it could not repeal its approval for the project. Also on Wednesday, Invenergy pushed back against the investigation by Mr. Bailey, filing a petition in county court in Missouri calling on the judges to “quash and set aside” the legal challenge.

“The attorney general has no authority to interfere with the Missouri Public Service Commission or its final approval of this project,” Catherine Hanaway, the lead counsel for Grain Belt Express, said in a statement. “Grain Belt Express seeks to bring an end to the A.G.’s unlawful and politically motivated investigation.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/17/multimedia/17cli-hawley-kjpq/17cli-hawley-kjpq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 10:05:58.061965

This is particularly difficult for battery storage and solar projects, which often rely on minerals and components mined in or manufactured in China.
The rapid sunset has resulted in a short-term boom in requests for solar projects, according to Windfree Solar CEO Eric Heineman, whose Chicago-based company installs solar for commercial and residential projects.
That state law significantly expanded programs like Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, which provide incentives to individuals and solar developers.
Industry experts credit the state’s policies generally, and CEJA specifically, for positioning the Illinois solar industry well as Trump’s policies threaten solar broadly.","President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans earlier this month curtailed federal tax incentives for the solar energy industry and for individuals and companies that purchase solar panels.

The move sent shock waves through the industry nationwide, pulling key incentives for major projects and residential rooftop solar alike.

But in Illinois, members of the industry say state policy gives a bit of cover. While they have seen a wave of business before Biden-era tax breaks sunset, solar companies are left with uncertainty in the long-term.

Others fear Trump’s actions will drive up prices by slowing the pace of renewables entering the market as fossil fuels exit for economic reasons.

The spending plan that Trump signed into law on July 4 will end several decades-old tax incentive programs between now and 2027. Those programs, which offer credits for rooftop solar systems and investment in large-scale projects, were expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act, a major initiative of former President Joe Biden.

Trump followed the bill signing with a July 7 executive order aimed at quickly ending any subsidies for “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.”

Between the spending bill and the executive order, the federal government will also stop offering a tax credit for the manufacture of wind power components and instead offer a similar subsidy to the coal used in steel production.

The new law also denies incentives to any projects owned by certain foreign entities or that use a significant amount of supplies from those entities, such as the Chinese government and its affiliated businesses.

This is particularly difficult for battery storage and solar projects, which often rely on minerals and components mined in or manufactured in China.

This leaves many consumer advocates and energy experts looking to Illinois to further insulate the industry, which is a key part of how the state plans to replace fossil fuel-generated electricity with carbon-free sources by 2045 as required by state law.

Energy price increase

Trump’s bill likely will result in higher energy prices across the country, according to an analysis from the REPEAT Project, a joint research effort by Stanford Professor Jesse Jenkins’ Princeton Lab and Evolved Energy Research.

A separate analysis from think tank Energy Innovation, whose CEO was a senior Biden adviser involved in drafting climate change-related legislation, links the cost increases to a reduction in the number of renewable power plants that will be built under the new law.

This will affect electricity capacity markets directly as well as increase the wholesale price of natural gas due to the power sector’s increased reliance on it. Federal data indicates natural gas currently is used for about 17.3% of all electricity generation in Illinois.

Estimates of the scale of the electric bill cost increase for a typical household vary. REPEAT pegs the increase at $280 per household per year by 2035 nationwide. Energy Innovation’s model suggests $170 annual increase by 2035 and $180 in Illinois.

A spokesperson for the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group in Illinois, echoed the sentiment and said ending the tax credit programs “is a gut punch to consumers and our economy.”

Solar industry ‘uncertainty’

Jon Carson, the managing partner at Trajectory Energy Partners, said the law is another part of the “solar coaster” — an industry euphemism about the ups and downs of solar tax credits. This part of the coaster, Carson said, will result in less investment.

“This change in law and the uncertainty from the president's executive order, it just means that less projects are going to get built in the short term,” Carson said.

Carson, a longtime campaign and White House staffer under former President Barack Obama, founded Trajectory Energy Partners in 2017.

“We fundamentally believe that this is a real bump in the road for solar, it's a bump in the road for individual projects, but that ultimately the United States needs more power, and it's going to come from wind, solar and battery storage,” he said, referencing three technologies Trump is against.

Others in the industry have raised flags that the “bump in the road” may be more obtrusive for some companies.

The investment tax credit that’s ending under the new law offers a credit of 30% of project costs, with an optional 10% on top of that if a project meets certain labor standards. A similar tax credit exists for both residential and commercial projects.

Brian Haug, president of Oak Brook-based Continental Energy Solutions, said the credit is a “critical” part of Continental’s business model.

“The investment tax credit is a perfect tool that we use to make these projects financially interesting for larger companies,” Haug said.

Continental works on microgrids, rooftop solar and battery storage projects for commercial and industrial customers and claims to be the largest solar installer in the state.

Solar installation companies, customers and individuals still have time qualify for tax credits at the higher, Biden-era rates. Eligible projects must commence construction within the next 12 months or be placed in service by the end of 2027, almost a decade ahead of what was outlined in the IRA.

The rapid sunset has resulted in a short-term boom in requests for solar projects, according to Windfree Solar CEO Eric Heineman, whose Chicago-based company installs solar for commercial and residential projects.

“We don’t know how it’s going to impact us in the long term. What we know in the short term is that we know we have buyers who have been dragging their feet, they’ve got proposals for years with us, and now they’re just coming out of the woodwork,” Heineman said. “They’re signing up left and right.”

But even for projects started today, there’s not a guarantee they will receive any tax benefits from the federal government. Trump’s executive order signaled that his administration could revise guidance on what counts as the “beginning of construction.”

Illinois’ renewable haven

Illinois increasingly has subsidized the solar industry in recent years, most notably through the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA. That state law significantly expanded programs like Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, which provide incentives to individuals and solar developers.

At a campaign stop while the Trump-backed spending plan was being considered in Congress earlier this month, Gov. JB Pritzker said Illinois’ policy wouldn’t be affected by the feds’ repeal of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

“We put that bill together before the IRA was passed at the federal level, and so we anticipated that we needed to incentivize clean energy, and we did,” Pritzker said on July 2.

Industry experts credit the state’s policies generally, and CEJA specifically, for positioning the Illinois solar industry well as Trump’s policies threaten solar broadly.

Heineman, who was former Gov. Pat Quinn’s director of sustainability, pointed to the state’s solar renewable energy credit, or SREC, programs as a driving factor.

“Our sales are our revenue. Sales are driven by SRECs. If we don’t have revenue, we go out of business,” Heineman said. “Illinois is more insulated than any other state in the country.”

Heineman estimated that a typical solar project takes three years to pay for itself with current incentives. After the federal credit is repealed, it might take five years. Without state incentives, though, it could be as much as 10 years.

Battery credits

Some of the same lawmakers who were involved in passing CEJA are now pushing for a follow-up bill to offer incentives to the battery storage industry. That bill, a version of which was considered in the spring legislative session, also could include regulations of data centers, which are a major contributing factor to decreasing grid reliability and increasing energy prices.

Some environmental groups are using the federal spending plan as leverage to further push state lawmakers into supporting the initiative.

Illinois Environmental Council Senior Policy Manager Cate Caldwell said the state has “long led” on environmental issues and that lawmakers should act in their shortened October legislative session.

“While this federal budget threatens to reverse that progress, Illinois can instead double down on its climate commitments and invest in real, bold climate solutions that modernize our grid, ensure energy-hungry data centers act as good neighbors, and deliver cost savings to hardworking families across the state,” she said last week.

Hiccups in Illinois’ climate record

Despite the overall positive sentiments from the renewable energy industry and environmental lobby, the state has failed to live up to the promises it made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, according to a report from the state’s auditor general.

That audit report, released last week, found that the state’s Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity failed to properly implement requirements for at least four jobs or workforce programs outlined in CEJA, including ones aimed at finding jobs for people returning from prison and to help communities disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution.

A DCEO spokesperson said the department has made “substantial progress on key initiatives” since the audit was conducted, including approving grant recipients in many of the programs listed in the report and launching community-hubs for people seeking jobs in the renewable sector.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=ebabea7e-1976-56d4-95c8-adbe9358bbe8&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-07-18 10:04:14.663808

Congress’ Struggle with the Pass-Through Entity Tax and the One Big Beautiful Bill: U.S. Senate Edition.","With a name like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), you know two things right away: (1) it’s a mouthful, and (2) you’re going to have to wade through a lot to find the useful parts. Fortunately, two tax lawyers already did.

While opinions on OBBBA may vary, the legislation includes several corporate tax provisions that could be valuable for manufacturers, capital-intensive businesses, and others positioned to benefit. Below, we’ve highlighted 10 key takeaways, plus a bit of commentary.

1. QSBS (Section 1202) Expansion

Bigger Breaks, Faster Fortunes for Founders and Investors

One of the biggest wins in the OBBBA for venture-backed startups, angel investors, private equity, and family offices planning multi-year exits is the overhaul of Section 1202 qualified small business stock (QSBS) rules.[1] The bill raises the per taxpayer gain exclusion from $10 million to $15 million per issuer for QSBS issued on or after July 5, with annual inflation adjustments starting in 2027.

Prior to the OBBBA, taxpayers had to hold QSBS for a full five years to exclude any gain from a sale. The OBBBA introduces a phased system for QSBS issued on or after July 5, allowing:

50% exclusion for stock held at least three years,

75% for four years,

100% for five years or more.

The OBBBA also clarifies that gains excluded under the new three- and four-year tiers won’t count as AMT preference items, avoiding additional alternative minimum tax burdens.

The OBBBA also raised the gross asset threshold from $50 million to $75 million, with inflation adjustments beginning in 2027. For purposes of the Section 1202 gross asset test, all assets, including tangible and intangible assets such as goodwill, are included. Self-created goodwill typically has zero basis, while purchased goodwill has a basis equal to the allocated purchase price.

Taken together, these updates mark a significant expansion of QSBS eligibility and flexibility – especially for investors and founders navigating longer growth timelines and larger cap tables. We unpack the full QSBS glow-up in One Big Beautiful Bill Act Doubles Down on QSBS Benefits for Startup Investors – worth a read if you’re tracking exits or equity.

2. Permanent 100% Expensing for Capital & “R&D”

R&D Expensing Gets a Makeover (and a Win for U.S. Innovation)

The OBBBA introduces a brand-new Section 174A, which permanently restores immediate expensing for 100% of qualified research and experimentation (R&E)—commonly known as R&D—expenses in the year incurred in the U.S. for starting after December 31, 2024.[2] Under the prior Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), taxpayers had to capitalize and amortize those costs over five years (domestic research expenses) or fifteen years (foreign research expenses). Now, U.S.-based R&D can be fully deducted in the year incurred—a major win for IP-intensive and product-driven companies. However, foreign R&D still gets the 15-year amortization treatment.

For R&D expenses amortized after December 31, 2021, and before January 21, 2025, taxpayers may have as many as two options, depending on their size:

Elect to accelerate the remaining deductions over a one–two-year period.

Alternatively, small businesses with annual gross receipts of $31 million or less can retroactively apply these changes to post-2021 tax years filing amended returns within one year of OBBBA’s enactment.

What should you do now? This is an “it depends” moment. Taxpayers should take a closer look at their specific tax situation to determine what path makes the most sense. For eligible small businesses, filing an amended return could mean a refund, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. And for companies deciding where to invest in R&D, the OBBBA may have tipped the scales in hiring domestically, though companies should look at their specific expenses associated with foreign R&D.

3. International Tax Overhaul & New Global Minimums

Reshaping GILTI, FDII, BEAT, and Global Tax Strategy

The OBBBA makes measured adjustments to the international tax regime: it lowers the deduction on global intangible low-taxed income, now called Net Controlled Foreign Corporation Tested Income (CFC), from 50% to 40%, and the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) to from 37.5% to 33.34%.[3] These changes postpone deeper cuts that were originally scheduled, giving businesses a bit of temporary breathing room. It also increases the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) marginally from 10% to 10.5%.[4] Additional changes to the foreign tax credit and CFC rules tighten the regimes, consistent with the current administration’s focus on domestic production.

4. Revised Section 163(j) Business Interest Rules

Interest Deduction Adjustments for Capital-Intensive Sectors

Since 2022, businesses have been feeling the squeeze from the Section 163(j) interest deduction limitation, which excluded depreciation, amortization, and depletion from adjusted taxable income (ATI) when calculating business interest. The OBBBA provides welcome relief to businesses by modifying the Section 163(j) interest deduction limitation. The OBBBA eliminates this restriction meaning, ATI once again includes these add-backs, raising the 30% threshold and allowing businesses to deduct more interest expense.

This is an important window for businesses to optimize their debt structures and take advantage of higher deductible interest before the tighter rules snap back into place after this year.[5]

5. Permanent Paid Family Leave & Enhanced Meals Deductions

Strengthening Talent Incentives and Employee Spending

In a move that’s likely to win points with HR and talent teams, the OBBBA permanently extends the paid family and medical leave credit. This gives employers a long-term incentive to support employee retention and attract top talent in a competitive market.

The OBBBA also brings back the 100% deduction for certain business meals for tax years—a familiar COVID-era perk—for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2027. To be eligible for the 100% deduction, meals must be provided to employees by businesses that also sell food, like restaurants, including takeout, dine-in, and delivery. The exception also includes commercial vessels and fishing boats. Other employer-provided meals don’t make the cut—they’re still subject to the 50% deduction limit or nondeducibility, depending on the situation.[6]

6. SALT Deduction Tweaks with Big PTET Boost

Enhanced SALT Deduction Cap and No changes to SALT Workarounds for Flow-Through Entity Owners

The OBBBA largely preserves the framework of the TCJA but introduces a temporary increase to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. Starting with tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, the SALT deduction cap jumps to $40,000 annually (or $20,000 for married filing separately. This amount is inflation-adjusted, reaching $40,400 in 2026 and increasing 1% annually thereafter. However, taxpayers shouldn’t get too comfortable, as the extended cap is set to sunset in 2030, when it reverts to the original $10,000 limit.

Additionally, taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000, will see their SALT cap reduced by 30% of the excess MAGI, but not below the $10,000 floor.

The OBBBA doesn’t touch the pass-through entity tax (PTET) regime, meaning that it remains a viable workaround for many taxpayers grappling with the SALT cap.[7]

For more information on how the PTET fits into the bigger picture, check out Is PTET Alive? Congress’ Struggle with the Pass-Through Entity Tax and the One Big Beautiful Bill: U.S. Senate Edition.

7. 199A QBI Deduction Made Permanent

Long-Term Tax Relief for Pass-Through Business Owners

The OBBBA cements the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A, making it a permanent fixture for pass-through businesses, like S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships. This move adds long-term clarity for owners of closely held businesses, and will continue to influence entity choice—especially for service-oriented or highly leveraged businesses that don’t qualify for the Section 1202 gain exclusion. For many, the QBI deduction remains a key factor in weighing pass-through status versus C corporation treatment.[8]

8. Permanent Community Incentives with Green Rollback

Support for Low-Income Projects While Cutting Clean Energy Incentives

The OBBBA locks in long-term support for several cornerstone community investment tools, making the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, New Markets Tax Credit, and Opportunity Zones permanent. This permanence brings welcome clarity for investors and developers planning multi-year projects in underserved areas, providing additional certainty for long-term investments.[9]

While one set of incentives got a lifeline, another saw the plug pulled. The bill simultaneously phases out or eliminates a range of clean energy credits—including those for renewable electricity, clean vehicles, hydrogen, and energy-efficient construction.

There is No Sunset in the Land of OZ – Opportunity Zones Renewed by The One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

9. Special Depreciation Deduction for Production Property

Extended Bonus Depreciation under Section 168(k) and Creation of New Section 168(n) for Qualified Production Property

The OBBBA permanently extends the 100% bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for most new and used tangible property with a recovery period of 20 years or less. After this date, the deduction will begin to phase out.[10]

But, there’s a new player on the field: Section 168(n). Tailored for manufacturers that build, extract, or grow their own assets for internal use, this provision allows a full deduction in the year incurred for “qualified production property.” That includes tangible personal property and certain other assets that are manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of its trade or business and placed in service in the U.S. after December 31, 2023.[11]

With both 168(k) and 168(n) in play, businesses have a window to strategically combine third-party purchases with self-produced assets—maximizing deductions before the 2026 sunset. Careful timing of these projects can help companies fully leverage both provisions while laying the groundwork for a smooth transition as Section 168(k) begins to phase out.

10. Tip Income and Overtime Pay Deduction

Allows Eligible Workers to Deduct Up to $25k of Cash Tips and $12.5k ($25k for Joint Filers) of Overtime Pay from Federal Income

The OBBBA introduces two temporary deductions in newly added Sections 224 and 225, available for tax years 2025 through 2028, aimed at boosting take-home pay for eligible workers.[12]

Section 224 allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000 of cash tips—defined as tips received from customers that are paid by cash or credit card, or shared through tip pools. To prevent double dipping, these tips are excluded from “qualified business income” under Section 199A. Section 225 offers eligible workers a deduction of up to $12,500 (or $25,000 for joint filers) in qualified overtime wages – defined as the pay that exceeds the employee’s regular rate of pay, as mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act.

To qualify, workers must have a Social Security Number and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) under $150,000 (or $300,000 for joint filers). Both deductions phase out gradually – by $100 for every $1,000 over the income threshold. For the tip deduction, the job must be one where tipping was customary prior to December 31, 2024 and cannot fall under a specified service trade or business (as defined in Section 199A(d)(2)).[13]

Employers still need to report total tops and overtime on employees’ W-2s and withhold payroll taxes accordingly. But for eligible workers, these new deductions could offer meaningful relief, at least for the next few years.

Conclusion: Strategic Planning Required as OBBBA 2025 Takes Shape

The OBBBA might be a mouthful, but it packs a punch—reshaping key areas like R&D expensing, startup equity, and cross-border tax rules. From reviving immediate R&D expensing to expanding QSBS benefits and fine-tuning international tax levers, OBBBA delivers a mix of relief, recalibration, and long-term signals.

But with sweeping changes come new complexities. Many provisions apply prospectively, while others may reach back retroactively—making timing and structure more important than ever. Whether you’re modeling future exits, optimizing global tax footprints, or planning multi-generational wealth transfers, now is the time for proactive scenario planning. The right moves today could shape outcomes for years to come.

For founders, investors, and companies navigating growth, these changes offer new tools—and new tradeoffs. As always, the fine print matters. But if you’re building, scaling, or investing in innovation, this bill is worth more than a skim.

In the second DTECH Midwest keynote, utility regulators from Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana shared insights on the most pressing challenges facing electric utilities, from uncertainty around data centers to a new administration that wants to shake things up dramatically.

So what does the energy landscape look like in the Midwest?

Katie Sieben, Chair – Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, argued that overall things are “proceeding nicely” in the Commission, although the state has been experiencing changing weather patterns, not only in the form of extreme weather, but also from impacts from Canadian and northern Minnesota wildfires. In early 2023, the Minnesota legislature established a standard requiring 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, which the Commission is in the process of implementing. Additionally, through the Minnesota Energy Infrastructure Permitting Act passed last year, the state hopes to see time savings of 9-12 months for permitting and building renewable energy and transmission projects. But recent federal efforts have created uncertainty.

A not-so-beautiful bill

“The thing that has been increasingly challenging for our Commission and policymakers here in Minnesota, is a real dramatic shift in the federal policy landscape and the impact that will have not only on our dockets and how we process them, but also on costs,” Sieben said. “All of those new renewables that we are trying to see permitted and come online to ensure more robust and reliable energy supply here in Minnesota, are jeopardized I think, because of the loss of tax credits.”

Sieben said ratepayers in the state could see up to a 28% increase in their bills, stemming from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), within the next few years.

Dan Scripps, Chair – Michigan Public Service Commission, argued that efficiency efforts over the last several years in Michigan have avoided the need to scrounge up an addition 2 GW, which has provided some extra breathing room. But now, Scripps said, the federal government is “substituting it’s judgement” in a role that states have traditionally played.

Doug Scott, Chair – Illinois Commerce Commission, boasted that Illinois has recently made some strides in the clean energy space: The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, passed in 2021, mandated 100% clean energy in the state by the mid-century. The bill also kept three nuclear plants open for five years, while requiring the state’s coal and natural gas plants to decarbonize or close by 2045. The bill provided over $80 million per year for solar and energy workforce development, expanded the Illinois Solar for All program, and offered electric vehicle and transportation incentives.

However, the Trump administration has seemingly thrown a wrench in the works regarding renewable energy development, not just in Illinois, but nationwide. A new report from Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR) predicts that in the U.S., the majority of solar projects and nearly half of wind projects in the queue won’t survive the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Only an estimated 30% of solar and 57% of onshore wind capacity are considered “resilient” to the removal of investment and production tax credits.

“The IRA was tremendously helpful and would have been even more helpful in a lot of different areas to help speed up what we were doing, and allow us to spend some of our dollars on accelerating different areas of clean energy,” Scott said. “It looks, for at least the next couple of years, like that’s going away in different parts following the Big Beautiful Bill.”

Data center fog of war?

After years of flat load growth, there’s been a flurry of activity and discussion in the energy sector surrounding data centers and how they threaten to overburden the grid. However, we may not be getting the full picture as data center developers shop around for attractive home states and keep tight lips.

“We’re not sure exactly how much of that load is real,” Scott argued. “We know the data centers are talking to different utilities – they’ll only build one data center – but they’re talking to three different utilities in three different states. That may or may not show up in three different sets of load forecasts.”

With many of these projects developed under non-disclosure agreements, the waters are only further muddied. It’s an issue to under-build, Scott argues, because if the load growth is real, ratepayers will suffer from reduced reliability. If over-building happens, on the other hand, ratepayers will still suffer, this time from higher costs with nothing to show for it.

A clearer picture could emerge over time, but for now the uncertainty remains.

What challenges remain?

“It’s a whole bunch of little things that add up to real barriers,” Scripps said. “Interconnection continues to be a challenge, not having every resource get the full scrutiny when we know from experience around the country and around the globe that fast-track processes can work, do work, and are consistent with that focus on safety and the underlying architecture. I think compensation is a big issue. I don’t think we want to overcompensate these resources, but understanding the full value stack that they provide – that’s not subsidization, that’s just the cost of service and accurately reflecting what they can provide in terms of grid services as well as energy capacity.”

Efforts to keep the grid up to date with demand can have a hefty price tag. But even without a push for increased renewables, many parts of the grid are starting to show their age and are well past their prime, necessitating upgrades anyway.

“As a regulator, it’s important to always keep in a mind a very long term view,” Sieben said.” When you think about what’s really driving a lot of cost increases right now, in Minnesota and probably in the country, are transmission upgrades that are desperately needed. Not only because of increased renewables coming on to the grid, but also just because it’s time for these big transmission lines to be replaced anyway.”

That long term view has gotten a bit more complicated thanks to the White House, Sieben argues.

“Not to bang on the [Trump] administration too much, but I will,” Sieben said. “Despite this long range planning, and despite efforts to lead to the clean energy transition and plan very carefully for resource adequacy – now to have the federal government come down and say ‘we are going to try to do this better from Washington’ is really astounding, and should be something of concern.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/keynote-2-1024x768.png,N,,2025-07-17 13:59:43.556423

The federal incentives include a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used models, is set to phase out with the implementation of the recently passed so-called 'Big, Beautiful Bill.'

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, emphasized the urgency for potential buyers. ""I would really encourage anybody who has been thinking or wondering about getting an EV now is the time to do it,"" Toor said. ""The next three months are going to be the best that you get for a long time.""

While federal credits will soon be unavailable, Colorado residents can still take advantage of state incentives ranging from $3,500 to $6,000, depending on the type and price of the vehicle. Additionally, there is a program for low-income families that allows them to trade in an old gas vehicle for an electric one.

Despite Colorado's status as a leader in EV sales, according to the governor's office, Toor expressed concern that the loss of federal incentives could dampen enthusiasm among potential buyers. He said the state is looking at options to address the gap. He acknowledged the tight state budget and that they are exploring creative solutions, but didn't have details on that quite yet.

Denver7 also reached out to the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association. They shared this statement:

""With the federal EV tax credit expiring in September, we expect EV sales will drop. Affordability is the most important part of the buying decision for consumers. Our dealers are coordinating a response with industry to create options that keep vehicles in reach for those Coloradans who rely on credits to make a new EV a reality.

Still, tax credits didn’t live in a vacuum. High interest rates and regulatory requirements continue to drive costs on all new cars.

In a review of 75 different installer websites across 10 different states, pv magazine USA found some quick responses to the repeal of the tax credit, meant to generate a sense of urgency to sign solar contracts.

A few companies posted warnings about the loss of the ITC even before the bill had been finalized.

StarAlt Solar in McAllen, Texas, warned that “Federal tax credits and incentives are on the chopping block in Congress,” noting that customers could still capture “up to 60% cost reductions from a combination of federal and local incentives.”

Phoenix-based Harmon Solar’s website splashed “NO MORE ITC?” in bold red lettering on their homepage as the bill made its way through Congress. Once the bill was signed into law, the website included an entire page of its website explaining how “the clock is ticking” for taking advantage of the ITC.

The homepage of Clean Solar, a San Jose, California installer, went all-out on shock value. Against a background of dark clouds, the homepage featured the stunned face of someone reacting to the passage of the OBBB, with bold text in a very large font warning that “The 30% Federal Tax Credit is ENDING this year.”

By contrast, Jacob Watkins, General Manager of Tampa-based Transform Solar, took a more muted approach to the news. In a long blog post on its website, Watkins recommended diligent financial planning with a tax professional rather than hastily paying an inflated price for a poorly executed installation project.

A few installer websites updated their discussion of tax incentives merely by removing any mention of federal incentives or by removing their financial incentives page entirely. Nearly half of the websites pv magazine USA reviewed had some mention of the 30% federal tax credit still mentioned, though some installers may be waiting until the end of the year to update their websites.

Given the ebbs and flows of federal policy, some websites keep the vague content that they currently have, retaining evergreen statements such as: “Many governments offer tax credits, rebates, and incentives for installing solar systems.” But far too many sites have outdated information mentioning a “26% tax credit” that was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Perhaps these installers were too swamped with business following passage of the IRA to update their websites, but doing so now would be doing a service to the customers they hope to serve.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/rooftop-pv-1-1200x900.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:58:53.379973

Redwood, which Straubel cofounded in 2019, recycles used lithium-ion cells to recover valuable raw materials and also makes components for new batteries.
The closely held company estimates it’s processing more than 20 gigawatt-hours of used battery cells–equivalent to 250,000 EVs–annually.","General Motors, which has poured billions of dollars into producing electric vehicle batteries at U.S. plants, is partnering with Redwood Materials to use some of its cells for stationary energy storage systems for the power grid as well as AI data centers.

The Detroit-based automaker, which already supplies battery scrap materials to Redwood for recycling, plans to supply both new and used U.S.-made battery cells that Redwood will package as large stationary packs, the companies said. The move comes after Reno-based Redwood, founded by Tesla cofounder and current board member JB Straubel, last month created a new unit to supply energy storage packs called Redwood Energy.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s battery chief. “Electricity demand is climbing and it’s only going to accelerate.”

Finding additional uses for battery cells beyond EVs can help GM maximize its investment in R&D and production of that technology as Trump Administration policies, distilled in the just-enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, darken the outlook for not only EV sales but large-scale wind and solar projects. Pursuing new applications for cleaner, less-polluting energy technology is exactly what many investors are encouraging companies to do.

“Someone said, ‘climate tech has gone from green to khaki,’ because it's not just about green tech anymore. It's all about domestic security and domestic supply chains,” Nicole LeBlanc, a partner at Toyota’s Woven Capital venture fund, recently told Forbes. “From an investment perspective, that mitigates some uncertainties around the climate element in terms of the scaling of these technologies. Because now they have a second market that is accelerating and has more money in it.”

GM is one of the fastest-growing sellers of electric vehicles in the U.S., posting a 104% gain in the first half owing to new models like the battery-powered Chevrolet Equinox, second only to Tesla in total volume. That growth pace isn’t expected to continue later in the year.

“With government-backed incentives set to end in September and economic pressures mounting, the second half of the year will be a critical test of EV demand,” said Cox Automotive analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty. “Q3 will likely be a record, followed by a collapse in Q4, as the electric vehicle market adjusts to its new reality.”

Data Centers

Data centers are a particularly fast-growing source of electricity consumption, likely to use 12% of U.S. power generation by 2028, according to the Energy Department. In June, Redwood said it supplied a 63 megawatt-hour battery microgrid for use by Crusoe, an AI infrastructure company, that’s operating at its Nevada headquarters. That installation includes used GM batteries.

GM already makes lithium-ion batteries for its electric models and this week announced plans to also make lower-cost lithium-iron phosphate cells at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant. The company also recently announced plans to begin producing lithium-manganese-rich cells, a new cell chemistry expected to shave at least $6,000 off the cost of electric truck battery packs.

GM and Redwood declined to provide financial details of the partnership, but will share more information later this year, they said in a statement.

Redwood, which Straubel cofounded in 2019, recycles used lithium-ion cells to recover valuable raw materials and also makes components for new batteries. The closely held company estimates it’s processing more than 20 gigawatt-hours of used battery cells–equivalent to 250,000 EVs–annually.

Straubel and Kelty worked together at Tesla, building up the EV company’s battery operations from its earliest days until 2017, when Kelty departed. Straubel, formerly Tesla’s CTO, left the company in 2019 to focus on Redwood.

GM shares rose about 1% to close at $53.18 in New York.

In the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, EPA said unspecified changes to its operations “will better address pollution problems that impact American communities by re-aligning enforcement with the law to deliver economic prosperity and ensure compliance with agency regulations.”

The agency did not share further details about the reorganization. EPA earlier this year told staff to reduce enforcement and compliance actions against energy facilities, reducing oversight to prioritize “violations that threaten human health and safety or risk releases or accidents that would disrupt energy production or power generation.”

The agency on Thursday also announced additional unspecified changes to the Office of Land and Emergency Management, which oversees the sprawling Superfund program as well as EPA’s response to disasters.

“Did gas prices go up by 65 cents at the pump?” his office asked in a press release July 2.
As a result, California’s gas prices have been roughly 5-8 cents per gallon higher at the pump since then, despite the underlying regulations not taking effect until this month.
The low-carbon fuel standard is one of the only remaining major planks of California’s climate policies that Trump hasn’t touched.
And carbon prices fell after Trump asked the Justice Department to specifically block the state’s carbon-trading program, among other laws.","A state Republican lawmaker launched a petition to “repeal Gov. Newsom’s 65-cent gas price hike,” and a gubernatorial candidate held a press conference at a gas station to propose repealing the rules. Even Democrats couldn’t resist introducing a bill to freeze prices under the program, which sets a steadily tightening emissions limit and lets producers buy and sell credits to meet it.

After the augured price hike failed to materialize, Newsom took a victory lap. “Did gas prices go up by 65 cents at the pump?” his office asked in a press release July 2. “No.”

But according to two industry sources granted anonymity to discuss proprietary market data, refiners started incorporating the new rules into their prices in January. As a result, California’s gas prices have been roughly 5-8 cents per gallon higher at the pump since then, despite the underlying regulations not taking effect until this month. And drivers are out roughly $300 million that they shouldn’t have been charged, according to their calculations.

State officials confirmed the error to me on Wednesday, the same day they sent a memo to board members detailing the findings — and said it shows the program is ultimately working as intended, price-wise.

“It does sort of validate the points that we were making over time,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph. “The pricing has played out in pretty much the way we anticipated.”

The episode illustrates the degree to which rhetoric and reality are almost entirely divorced in California’s interminable gas-price wars — and the difficulty of puncturing the curtain that separates the two.

“It was priced in on Jan. 1, and no one really knew about it,” said Will Faulkner, a carbon market analyst.

California gas prices have long been a topic of fascination and speculation, thanks to perpetually high costs that exceed even the levels predicted by the low-carbon fuel standard, the state’s 61-cent gas tax and another trading program that covers all industrial emissions. (A state analysis in 2019 pinned some of the responsibility on drivers, who “continue to purchase higher-priced brands despite having many options.”)

And while California’s climate policies are a perennial culprit, the low-carbon rule has been a particular lightning rod. Part of the reason is that it’s been twisting in the wind: The CARB began updating it in mid-2023 and didn’t finish until the end of 2024 — a long time even by California standards — as environmental groups and industry fought over how stringent it would be and which fuels it would incentivize.

That left a lot of time for politics — like a bill by state Republicans to freeze the program, a publicity campaign by Chevron at its gas stations and a proposal by Newsom to boost in-state gasoline’s ethanol content — and a lot of time for policy analysis.

After the CARB produced — and then walked back — an estimate that the changes could raise gas prices by 47 cents per gallon, climate economist Danny Cullenward released an analysis that found worst-case estimates of 65 cents per gallon in the near term, 85 cents by 2030 and nearly $1.50 per gallon by 2035. Another academic, University of Southern California professor Michael Mische, produced an estimate of $8.43 per gallon by 2026 based on refinery closures plus the rules. (Newsom’s office responded last month: “Why not $10 by 2026? $12? Just because one crackpot ‘expert’ says something does not make it true.”)

At the same time, Newsom, already acutely sensitive to gas prices after they spiked to $6.44 per gallon in 2022, was picking a separate fight with oil companies over price spikes related to refinery outages. That culminated in a pair of laws giving the state more power to investigate price gouging and oversee refineries’ maintenance schedules — and pulled neighboring governors into the fray over concerns that they could raise prices in their own states.

Given all the scrutiny, it’s fairly stunning that no one pointed out that the program was already priced in at the pump starting in January. That’s not even accounting for the fact that since it wasn’t in effect, refiners kept the extra money that they would have spent on buying credits. At an average of 7 cents per gallon over 4.3 billion gallons of gas sold, they collected roughly $300 million before the rules actually kicked in.

“No one’s paying attention,” Faulkner said. “The No. 1 thing in Sacramento is affordability, and $300 million just went poof.”

The actual process that led to the snafu was largely due to an administrative hiccup. After the CARB approved the amendments in November, they submitted them to the Office of Administrative Law, a final step before they took effect. But OAL rejected them over technical issues, so the CARB had to resubmit them — and it wasn’t clear whether they would take effect retroactively, on Jan. 1 or whenever the agency approved them.

Enter the Oil Price Information Service, an oil price reporting service owned by Dow Jones that performs the function of converting the carbon price into the cents-per-gallon price for fuel trading purposes. OPIS started incorporating the new numbers in January, on the assumption that the amendments would take effect retroactively. It didn’t remove the added cost until late May, once regulators said the rules would take effect in July, so for five months OPIS’s price incorrectly reflected the tighter rules.

“OPIS started 2025 using the proposed targets based on communications from CARB that the agency planned to implement the targets retroactively to Jan. 1,” spokesperson Lauren McCabe said in an email. “Once CARB indicated on May 16 that it was targeting a July 1 implementation, we updated the LCFS pricing methodology to reflect the outgoing targets, effective May 27. After the amendments were finalized on June 27, we updated our LCFS pricing methodology to reflect those targets, effective July 1.”

Randolph said the CARB had alerted Newsom and other officials in the spring, when the premature pass-through became apparent. “When we saw what was happening in the data, we certainly let the governor’s staff know, and we certainly let [the Division of Petroleum Market Oversight] know,” she said. When asked for comment, Newsom’s office referred me to the CARB.

State officials say they’re looking into it. “The Division of Petroleum Market Oversight (DPMO) is aware of this issue and, in collaboration with other state agencies, is engaging with market participants to resolve this fairly for California consumers,” California Energy Commission spokesperson Niki Woodard said in an email.

Bigger picture, this is good news for California at a fairly dark time for U.S. climate policy (although environmentalists are decidedly split on the program’s climate bona fides). The low-carbon fuel standard is one of the only remaining major planks of California’s climate policies that Trump hasn’t touched. He signed a law last month removing California’s ability to enforce its electric vehicle sales targets. Renewable energy targets are going to get harder to meet with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s rollback of federal tax incentives. And carbon prices fell after Trump asked the Justice Department to specifically block the state’s carbon-trading program, among other laws.

When it comes to the politicians who have been sparring for months over climate priorities and the cost of living for Californians, this debacle leaves both sides looking hollow.

“It was a rhetorically useful bit of data for people to support the messages they wanted to put out anyway,” said Colin Murphy, deputy director of University of California, Davis’ Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy. “And that’s politics.”",https://static.politico.com/f0/61/0a22e8014829b7aaa231ea7126c1/gas-prices-memorial-day-52813.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:45:44.221506

While we don’t have a Bronco Sport PHEV yet, Ford has been bringing in hybrid models over the past few years.
And speaking of a mid-cycle refresh…it has been almost five years since Ford launched the Bronco Sport in the U.S. market.","Meet the Ford Bronco New Energy: a Bronco-Sport like crossover for China.

While we have both the Bronco SUV and the “baby” Bronco Sport here in North America, there’s a new kid on the block. Ford just debuted this funky take on the Bronco Sport, but it’s not anything like the model you can currently buy from your local dealership (at least not yet). This is the Ford Bronco New Energy: It’s destined for China and its name gives a strong hint toward what it’s all about. Namely, this small SUV brings in both a range-extended plug-in hybrid and a fully electric option for Chinese customers.

Before we dive into the powertrains, though, you likely noticed some notable styling changes from the Bronco Sport we’ve had for nearly half a decade now. The front clip is a bit different, featuring new headlights and a lower profile “BRONCO” grille, as is the hood. In profile, this model gets flush door handles and what looks like more glass area behind the C-pillar rather than a triangular trim element like we get on our Bronco Sport. Out back, the New Energy gets different taillights, a spare tire carrier and a swing-out tailgate.

As far as propulsion’s concerned, the Ford Bronco New Energy touts up to 404 miles or 650 kilometers on a charge (most likely using the more generous, China-focused CLTC testing standard). Underneath, this SUV packs a 105.4-kWh battery pack, which in itself is fairly remarkable for a Bronco Sport-sized model. While the Bronco New Energy supports high-voltage DC fast-charging, Ford did not provide specifics on that front, nor did the company mention performance specs outside battery capacity and range.

The plug-in hybrid version, for its part, cuts the battery size by a little more than half, to 43.7-kWh, and brings in a gas engine to extend the overall driving range. And that range is impressive, per Ford’s claims: the all-electric range is up to 220 km/137 miles (again, using the CLTC standard), while the company says the total driving range is up to 1,220 km/758 miles. The idea is that, being a range extender, the gas engine works as a generator to offer the extra distance on weekend adventures. Then during the week, Chinese drivers can commute on electricity alone.

Here’s my hunch about this Bronco New Energy…

Ford plans to launch this model in China later this year. Of course, since we are specifically talking about the Chinese market, there’s no inclination of the company’s plans to bring the Bronco New Energy to North America. However, there are a couple caveats to that.

While we don’t have a Bronco Sport PHEV yet, Ford has been bringing in hybrid models over the past few years. Word has it that the smaller Bronco Sport and potentially the big Bronco could each see a hybrid option, so I wouldn’t rule out seeing that sort of option with the Bronco Sport’s mid-cycle refresh (possibly using the Escape Hybrid/PHEV’s powertrain for a potential American launch).

And speaking of a mid-cycle refresh…it has been almost five years since Ford launched the Bronco Sport in the U.S. market. Yes, we did get a minor refresh for 2025 including the new Sasquatch Package for the Badlands, but the automaker could go a bit farther in the next couple years with a more comprehensive update. At least on the styling front, its feasible Ford could borrow some elements from this Chinese model, if not actually bring a full-blown EV into the mix. Given the current state of affairs for electric models in America, it’s unlikely Ford’s business case for this car is actually worth it here, but never say never.",https://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ford-Bronco-New-Energy-1.webp,N,,2025-07-17 13:46:40.215925

""The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that by 2030, U.S. data centers will consume more electricity than production of aluminum, steel, cement, chemicals and all other energy-intensive goods combined,"" according to a copy of the report first obtained by FOX Business.

The report also warns that the U.S. is losing the energy race with China.

The council estimates that the U.S. will need to invest about $1.4 trillion between 2025 and 2030 to keep up with growing power demand.

""Once higher demand from industrial electrification and reshoring of manufacturing is added in, the total increase in power demand would require an estimated $1.4 trillion of investment between 2025 and 2030 - than the industry’s investment over the previous decade,"" the report says. ""Continued electrification of the economy and reshoring of energy-intensive manufacturing will contribute additional demand for electricity.""

Without new investments in energy, the council finds there will be price increases of anywhere between 9% and 58%.

""Using elasticity estimates from economic literature, electricity prices in 2030 could be 9 to 58 percent higher as a result of higher demand for power if lower-cost providers don’t come online,"" the report says.

The report found that a fragmented power grid is putting pressure on making electricity prices higher:

""One important barrier to lower electricity prices for consumers is the fact that the U.S. electricity grid is highly fragmented,"" the report says. ""Studies have shown that linking regional grids would reduce price differentials across regions by letting power flow where it is most needed, lowering production costs and increasing resiliency.""

The White House Council of Economic Advisors recommended increasing access to energy resources on federal lands and waters.

""Domestic uranium mining carries strategic importance because the United States currently imports nearly all of the uranium that it uses in nuclear generation,"" the report says. ""In 2023, about half of uranium purchased by U.S. nuclear plants came from Canada and Australia, and another 44 percent was supplied by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.""

After decades moving away from coal to oil and gas, nuclear power, and renewable alternatives, the Trump administration is once again putting coal on its energy agenda.
As the U.S. energy demand rises, and is expected to continue increasing, there are growing fears around meeting this demand.
We need those to be clean, reliable, and affordable.” Routh added, keeping the coal plants in question open, “results in the exact opposite.","Under the Biden administration, the United States made strides in its green transition, supported by policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The U.S. renewable energy capacity increased significantly, and a long-term shift away from coal was in the works. However, since President Trump came into office, his administration has begun to undo much of the green progress made over the last four years and is once again looking to coal to meet the domestic power demand.

Coal is widely considered the “dirtiest fossil fuel”, as burning it is the single largest contributor to global warming, accounting for 41 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, as well as high levels of methane, according to the non-profit Ember. One 2023 study suggested that in the United States, approximately 460,000 deaths in the Medicare population were attributable to coal electricity-generating emissions from the country’s 480 coal-fired power plants between 1999 and 2020.

For years, various countries around the globe shifted away from a reliance on coal to other less-polluting fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and renewable alternatives. Across the 38 OECD countries, coal generation declined by 52 percent on average between 2007 and 2024. It was mainly replaced with new solar and wind power capacity. Meanwhile, U.S. coal generation fell by over 50 percent between 2008 and 2023.

After decades moving away from coal to oil and gas, nuclear power, and renewable alternatives, the Trump administration is once again putting coal on its energy agenda. In April, Trump signed the Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order.

The order states, “We must increase domestic energy production, including coal.” It goes on to say, “America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness.”

Coal-burning plants produce less than 20 percent of U.S. electricity at present, according to the Energy Information Administration. However, Trump’s support for coal could soon change this. Upon signing the April order, Trump stated, “We’re bringing back an industry that was abandoned.” He added, “We’re going to put the miners back to work.”

Since coming into office, Trump has rolled back environmental regulations and vowed to increase domestic energy output, with a focus on fossil fuels. As the U.S. energy demand rises, and is expected to continue increasing, there are growing fears around meeting this demand. Trump aims to boost oil and gas production, as well as halt retirement plans for ageing coal plants and lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands, to meet this demand.

Other more extreme steps may be taken to encourage coal use in the coming years, such as the potential designation of coal as a “critical mineral” when used for steel production. The Department of Energy (DoE) also recently announced $200 billion in funding for its loan programmes office, including for new coal technologies.

In late June, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright announced the renewal of the charter for the National Coal Council (NCC), a Federal Advisory Committee that was terminated during the Biden administration, to strengthen the coal industry. The DoE also recently ordered the JH Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan to stay open beyond its 31 May closure date, and may extend the life of the Monroe power plant on Lake Erie in Michigan, which is scheduled to close in 2028. Based on Trump’s energy agenda, other coal plants destined for decommissioning are likely to continue operating.

Despite the Trump administration’s best efforts to garner support for coal, not everyone is willing to backtrack on its energy goals. In recent months, several state regulators, regional grid operators, environmental groups, and consumer groups have challenged the legality of the DoE’s stay-open orders. In June, state utility regulators and environmental groups filed rehearing requests with the DoE over the halted closure of JH Campbell and the Eddystone oil and gas-burning plant in Pennsylvania, arguing that renewable energy could better fill the growing energy demand.

Robert Routh, the climate and energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defence Council, stated, “We need to get more electrons on the grid. We need those to be clean, reliable, and affordable.” Routh added, keeping the coal plants in question open, “results in the exact opposite. It’s costly, harmful, unnecessary, and unlawful.”

President Trump has taken U.S. energy in the opposite direction from his predecessor, Joe Biden, by halting green energy progress and introducing policies to support higher coal output. Several coal plants destined for retirement in the coming years will likely remain open, as Trump strives to save them, and new mining projects could be in the works in certain states. However, several state governments, utilities, and environmental groups will continue to battle against the expansion of the coal industry in favour of cleaner alternatives that can also meet the growing U.S. energy demand.

The issue has industry experts divided with some voicing concerns about family sustaining jobs and environmental impact, and others believing an affordable, safe, and reliable energy future is attainable.

A growing trend is co-locating data centers with onsite energy generation, thereby producing their own electricity and potentially sending surplus power back to the grid. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PUC, is considering making this a requirement, along with covering the cost of infrastructure upgrades, as it develops a model tariff.

Currently, nuclear-powered Amazon Susquehanna campus is the only operational example of this in Pennsylvania, while two others – Homer City Energy Campus (natural gas) and Beaver Valley (nuclear) – are under development.

Co-located generation is nothing new, says Lehigh Valley engineer and IEEE Standards Association member James Daley.

Daley told The Center Square that the demands of large data centers are comparable to major industrial complexes the grid has historically served – like Bethlehem Steel, for example.

Built in the late 1800s, Bethlehem Steel’s furnaces were primarily powered by steam engines fueled by coal. By the 1910s, they began drawing electricity from local utilities, but as demand increased, dedicated substations and new grid connections were added – costs that the company helped cover. To further reduce demand on the public grid, they eventually built on-site power plants.

Co-located generation is one way to resolve energy demand issues while protecting existing ratepayers, Daley said. Other options include serving the facilities from transmission or sub transmission stations, and the use of nuclear power.

“Diligence and oversight of proposed projects require multiple input sources – not the least of which is the PUC,” said Daley.

Rest assured, he added, locating and powering an IT Center poses no different challenge than large-scale projects successfully handled over the past century. “The PUC makes sure rate payers are not unfairly charged for grid alterations that do not benefit them directly.”

The mix of energy sources is crucial to grid reliability, which Daley says needs to be 24/7, “and you can’t do that with renewables.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, in 2023, 60% of electricity generated was from fossil fuels – natural gas, coal, and petroleum. Additionally, 19% came from nuclear, and renewable energy sources accounted for approximately 21%.

He noted the lower capacity ratings of renewable energy sources compared to those of fossil fuels, citing figures from the US. Department of Energy.

The capacity rating for nuclear is 92.3%, followed by geothermal (65%), natural gas combined cycle (59.9%), and coal (42.6%). Hydro and wind are rated at around 34%, while solar and natural gas simple cycle are 23.4% and 17.2% respectively.

Daley’s comments are supported by a 2024 report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, warning that the substitution of intermittent renewable energy for baseload 24/7 power has made the nation’s electric grids less resilient, less secure, and less reliable.",https://www.bradfordera.com/bradfordera/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/data-center-1024x576.webp,N,,2025-07-17 13:50:36.419811

It now goes to the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has 15 working days to either approve or veto it.
“We’re seeing the implosion of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, that is going to become full self-licensing, where a company just clicks a button and the permit gets printed,” said Araújo, who served as president of Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama, from 2016 to 2018.
Tuxá says Lula should veto the bill, but recognises that in a predominantly opposition-led congress, the president’s decision is likely to be overturned.
Resistance to the bill was primarily confined to the environment minister, Marina Silva, who described it as “the burial of environmental licensing”.","Brazilian lawmakers have passed a bill that drastically weakens the country’s environmental safeguards and is seen by many activists as the most significant setback for the country’s environmental legislation in the past 40 years.

The new law – widely referred to as the “devastation bill” and already approved by the senate in May – passed in congress in the early hours of Thursday by 267 votes to 116, despite opposition from more than 350 organisations and social movements.

It now goes to the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has 15 working days to either approve or veto it.

Even if he vetoes the legislation, there is a strong chance that the predominantly conservative congress will overturn that, triggering a likely battle in the supreme court, as legal experts argue that the new law is unconstitutional.

“Either way, its approval is a tragedy,” said Suely Araújo, public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory civil society group, arguing that the legislation would, among other serious consequences, drive large-scale deforestation and heighten the risk of human-caused climate disasters.

“There’s no precedent for how damaging this law is,” she said, describing it, as have several other environmental organisations, as “the greatest setback to Brazil’s environmental legislation” since the 1980s, when licensing first became a legal requirement in the country.

One of the main points of criticism of the law is that it allows projects classified as having “medium” polluting potential to obtain an environmental licence through a self-declared online form – without prior impact studies or regulatory review. Previously, this fast-track process was limited to low-risk activities.

According to Araújo, this will affect about 90% of licensing procedures in Brazil, including those for mining companies and the vast majority of agricultural activities.

“We’re seeing the implosion of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, that is going to become full self-licensing, where a company just clicks a button and the permit gets printed,” said Araújo, who served as president of Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama, from 2016 to 2018.

The law also states that agencies responsible for protecting the rights of Indigenous and quilombola communities will only have a say in licensing processes for projects located on officially recognised territories – excluding more than 30% of Indigenous lands and over 80% of quilombola areas that have been awaiting official titling for years.

“Many of these lands are already under dispute or being targeted by exploitative companies,” said Dinamam Tuxá, executive coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib), who described the law’s approval as “the legalisation of a process of extermination of Indigenous peoples”.

Tuxá says Lula should veto the bill, but recognises that in a predominantly opposition-led congress, the president’s decision is likely to be overturned. “That’s why civil society must remain organised to pressure lawmakers not to overturn the veto,” he said.

If the law does come into force, it is likely to trigger a wave of legal challenges, as activists and legal experts argue that it violates the constitution and previous rulings by the supreme court.

Some activists have criticised Lula’s administration for not doing enough to prevent the bill’s approval, and even for giving it a free pass, as reported by the news outlet Sumaúma. Resistance to the bill was primarily confined to the environment minister, Marina Silva, who described it as “the burial of environmental licensing”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4676f60220453780caa9585cd45415eb08799e58/453_0_2740_2193/master/2740.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8e42f71a8f70d2661794f47798b6997",N,,2025-07-17 13:45:50.750150

The leaders appeared before the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment during a hearing titled, Beyond the Blue Bin: Forging a Federal Landscape for Recycling Innovation and Economic Growth.

The subcommittee, which focuses on regulating solid, hazardous, and nuclear waste — Including mining, oil, gas, and coal combustion waste — heard testimony highlighting the packaging industry's sustainability efforts and policy recommendations.

US Rep. Gary Palmer, R-AL, who chairs the Subcommittee on Environment, emphasized the need for regulatory reform.

""It's time to ensure that government red tape isn't preventing investments in new technologies and methods that can help support recycling here at home,"" Palmer said. ""Today's hearing was an opportunity to discuss these issues and look at long-term solutions that support both mechanical and advanced recycling in the United States. Finding ways to harness e-waste recycling will be critical as we look to find new sources of critical materials to support our economy and national security, and we cannot afford to let these vital materials go to waste.""

Advocating for flexible packaging industry

Felton, president and CEO of the Flexible Packaging Association (FPA), introduced his organization as the leading advocate for the growing US flexible packaging industry. He provided an overview of flexible packaging applications and emphasized its environmental benefits.

""Flexible packaging is one of the most sustainable packaging types, as it reduces water and energy consumption, improves product-to-package ratio, enhances transportation efficiency, minimizes food waste, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions,"" Felton stated.

Felton outlined several public policy priorities that could benefit from federal support:

""FPA is deeply committed to solving packaging waste issues and increasing the recyclability and recycling of flexible packaging,"" Felton testified. ""We are collaborating with manufacturers, brand owners, recyclers, retailers, waste management companies, and other organizations to continue making strides toward total packaging recovery.""

The FPA submitted written testimony providing additional details on the industry's sustainability initiatives and policy recommendations.

""Recycling supports multiple domestic manufacturing industries while at the same time reducing our collective environmental impact,"" Felton concluded. ""Carefully crafted investment by the US government into supporting the highest and best use of materials for remanufacturing can result in significant advantages to our country, while helping industry to create new high-tech jobs at the forefront of AI, robotics, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).""

ACC's position

Ross Eisenberg, president of America's Plastic Makers at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), also addressed the panel.

""The US plastics and chemical sectors play an important role in maintaining America's competitive edge in global markets and driving innovation, while keeping prices low for consumers,"" he said.

Eisenberg noted that nearly 27% of US manufacturing output comes from industries highly reliant on plastics.

""The industry is a driver of US economic growth, generating $46 billion in economic output, supporting nearly five million American jobs and more than $391 billion in wages, and providing feedstock for American industries, including automotive, construction, packaging, electronics, and healthcare,"" he said. ""The plastics manufacturing sector itself employs 670,000 Americans, pays nearly $50 billion in wages, and holds a $22 billion trade surplus — making it one of the few US industries that exports more than it imports.""

Eisenberg emphasized that the ACC and its members are committed to a more circular economy for plastics and helping to end plastic waste. He outlined three critical steps the federal government should take:

""Under most EPR systems, product makers are charged a fee to support the recycling infrastructure and public education,"" he explained. ""We believe an industry-led EPR framework designed to drive innovation, support local infrastructure, and minimize taxpayer burden can be a powerful tool to improve recycling outcomes without stifling economic growth.""

Supporting RIAA

The ACC has also endorsed the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act, sponsored by US Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-IA.

""Approximately 40% of Americans lack ready access to recycling,"" Eisenberg said.

The Big Beautiful Bill is a big win for American energy and our national security.","Fueling The Conversation, Week of July 14th, 2025

After decades of wind and solar tax credits distorting energy markets, raising energy costs, and hurting the reliability of our electric grid, the end is finally near, thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). With wind and solar projects’ eligibility for the production and investment tax credits now depending on a 2027 placed-in-service deadline, Congress has acknowledged that intermittent energy is not sufficient to meet the growing needs of artificial intelligence and electrification and should no longer be subsidized by the American taxpayer.

Of course, the bill is not perfect. The 12-month “under construction” loophole agreed to by the Senate at the last minute will allow projects that commit 5% of the funding within that timeframe to receive a four-year safe harbor to continue receiving tax credits. This is a clear giveaway to wind and solar companies, but it is important to acknowledge victories when they occur.

When the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed, its generous taxpayer green energy subsidies were sold as investments that would help lower inflation and electricity prices. However, had Congress just looked to other countries already living the green subsidy lie, like Germany, they would have known it was just wishful thinking. As we stated when the IRA was passed, “At a time when energy bills are already soaring thanks to the Biden administration’s war on affordable energy, the taxes and distortions to energy markets in this legislation could not come at a worse time.” Unfortunately, just as we predicted, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022. Any actual drop in the overall inflation rate has had more to do with higher interest rates, lower oil and gas prices, and the mitigation of supply chain issues than the IRA.

If Republicans failed to pass the OBBB with the changes they made, it would have had drastic consequences for the federal budget and the electric grid. Thankfully, congressional energy champions like Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX), Josh Brecheen (R-OK), and others fought against attempts to institute soft phase-outs by demanding a firm placed-in-service deadline for solar and wind projects.

According to the Cato Institute’s budgetary analysis, maintaining IRA tax credits could have cost $1.97 billion over the next ten years and $4.67 trillion by 2050. One of its most egregious provisions was the phase-out mechanism that required the U.S. electricity sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, based on 2022 levels, before the tax credits would expire. Expecting the electricity sector to achieve these levels was illogical at best, but most likely a cynical attempt to make the tax credits last indefinitely.

The powerful wind and solar lobby is decrying the Big Beautiful Bill, claiming that, by eliminating their lavish federal subsidies, electricity prices will increase. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is, higher energy prices are the result of the decades-long subsidization of these resources. By eliminating them, wind and solar will eventually have to compete just like everybody else and will no longer be able to distort energy markets (look for more on this from IER in the near future) and make them less reliable.

The Big Beautiful Bill has taken a tremendous step towards preventing runaway spending by eliminating the emissions provision from the IRA, but the winning doesn’t stop there. The bill also eliminates the federal $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicle (EV) purchases and the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs. Like the wind and solar subsidies, EV tax credits were another special interest giveaway, ballooning our deficit and making American consumers worse off. As I stated in our press release on the bill, “Eliminating the EV tax credit marks a major win for those of us who have been advocating for years that consumer choice—not government mandates—should shape the American auto market.”

The bill also repeals the IRA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund, supporting EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s efforts to claw back the $20 billion in “walking around money” the Biden administration attempted to pass around to politically favored green groups.

Besides cutting the IRA, the Big Beautiful Bill supports reliable energy production by eliminating some of the barriers imposed on natural gas, oil, and coal. It delays the methane emissions tax until 2035, restores royalty rates to their pre-IRA levels, and mandates that at least four million additional acres of federal land be made available for coal mining. By removing red tape and keeping federal lands open to reliable energy production, Congress is giving American energy producers more opportunities to drill, baby, drill.

Projected electricity demand increases and decreasing grid reliability made overturning the IRA more than a simple political win. It was an essential step towards protecting the American people against high energy costs and a failing grid. We should commend Congress for striking back against the green energy agenda while forwarding a policy of energy abundance. Thank you, President Trump and the Congressional Republicans (well, most of them anyway). The Big Beautiful Bill is a big win for American energy and our national security.

The Ford F-150 Lightning continues to be the best-selling electric pickup in the United States, a title it earned in the previous quarter. With 5,842 units sold, the Lightning is also on a downward trend, with sales going down for the second quarter in a row.

Meanwhile, combined sales of the GMC Hummer EV SUV and pickup surpassed the Tesla Cybertruck and landed the GM-made duo in the second spot on the list with 4,508 sales. That’s up from the previous quarter’s 3,479 units.

The Chevrolet Silverado EV is also slightly up, with 3,056 sales in Q2. That’s 673 more units quarter-over-quarter and 860 more year-over-year. At the bottom of the list is the Rivian R1T, which barely managed to find more buyers in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Rivian sold just 1,752 R1Ts in Q2, an increase of just 25 units over the previous quarter, but a massive 47% drop year-over-year. In last year’s second quarter, Rivian sold 3,309 R1Ts.

The idea of capturing the wind energy produced by airplanes during takeoff might sound like a scene from science fiction, but it is fast becoming a reality. At the forefront of this innovation is JetWind Power Corporation, a start-up that has made significant strides in developing this unique technology. Their approach involves recycling the intense gusts of wind generated by aircraft, turning what was once wasted energy into a valuable resource. This initiative not only highlights the potential of renewable energy but also the importance of innovative solutions in our quest to combat climate change.

Innovative Mini-Wind Turbines on the Runway

JetWind’s vision has come to life at Dallas Love Field Airport, where the start-up has installed prototype mini-wind turbines. These compact devices, resembling small wind turbines enclosed in a mesh container, are strategically placed near boarding gates rather than directly on the runway. This placement is crucial as airplanes generate winds of approximately 43 miles per hour during the start-up phase, lasting around five minutes. By capturing this energy, JetWind’s installations are already producing enough electricity to power a home, although currently, the energy is redirected to power two cellphone charging stations within the terminal.

The project began with pilot testing in 2021, and today, five installations are operational. This innovative approach is particularly significant in Texas, where extreme weather conditions, from scorching summers to harsh winter storms, place immense stress on the power grid. Every kilowatt of renewable energy counts, and by repurposing the energy lost in airplane takeoffs, JetWind is contributing to a more sustainable future.

A Global Potential: 100,000 Flights a Day

The vision for JetWind Power extends far beyond Texas. With plans to add eight more containers at Dallas Love Field in the next two years, the company is also exploring international expansion. The founder, who remains an active surgeon, believes this technology can be easily implemented worldwide. Discussions are already underway with airports in Canada, Europe, Brazil, and Australia. Given that over 100,000 airplanes take to the skies daily, the potential for harnessing this lost energy is immense, presenting an untapped opportunity for renewable energy solutions globally.

This expansion aligns with the global push for sustainability and highlights the untapped potential of airport environments. As airports are hubs of constant activity and energy use, JetWind’s technology offers a new dimension to airport sustainability initiatives, transforming them into powerhouses of renewable energy.

The Visionary Behind JetWind

The concept of harvesting wind energy from airplane takeoffs was first envisioned by Dr. Souryal, an orthopedic surgeon from Dallas, 25 years ago. Inspired during a flight from Burbank Airport in Los Angeles, he witnessed the powerful jet streams produced by aircraft engines and wondered if this energy could be captured and utilized. Years of research and development led to the creation of JetWind Power Corporation, where Dr. Souryal now leads a team dedicated to bringing this vision to life.

Dr. Souryal’s dual expertise in medicine and renewable energy highlights the interdisciplinary nature of innovative solutions in today’s world. His journey from a conceptual idea to tangible, operational technology underscores the power of visionary thinking and persistent innovation in addressing global energy challenges.

Funded through the Clean Technology Innovation program, the grants support ideas that aren’t yet available in the market but show potential to reduce emissions and support NSW’s goal of reaching net zero. The program is part of the broader $275 million Net Zero Manufacturing Initiative.

Among the 13 recipients is HydGene Renewables, based in Lane Cove, which is working on a way to turn farm waste into clean hydrogen and ammonia – offering a low-emissions fuel option that can be produced directly on farms. The project received $2.5 million to demonstrate a scalable system suited to agricultural use.

Novalith Technologies, located in Alexandria, is scaling up a cleaner process for lithium extraction. This method, which avoids the use of harsh chemicals, could reduce both costs and environmental impact in battery production. The company received $1.5 million and has attracted strong private backing.

“Australia has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the global energy transition, not just by exporting minerals, but by exporting the technology that makes them cleaner, cheaper, and more sustainable to produce,” Novalith CEO and company founder Steven Vassiloudis said.

Ship-related emissions are also being tackled by Hullbot, which has secured nearly $2 million to further develop its underwater robotic hull cleaners. These robots reduce fuel use by keeping ship hulls clean without toxic coatings and also help stop invasive species from spreading.

Other initiatives include:

5B Holdings, in Mascot, developing a more efficient and transportable solar panel system.

Onori (Azione): “A mistake that undermines our strategic autonomy.”

Decoding the news. Italy is among the EU countries where the pro-Russian discourse still finds political traction. In recent days, pro-Moscow narratives have resurfaced, also focused on energy.

On one side, minority parties are ramping up political pressure to resume Russian gas imports, citing high domestic energy costs as justification.

On the other hand, Eni has signed a major long-term agreement with Venture Global in the US to secure liquefied natural gas.

Division in progress. The Five Star Movement, a populist opposition party led by former prime minister Giuseppe Conte, has openly backed last month the idea of restoring Russian gas supplies in the name of energy security and lower costs.

The Democratic Party, also in the opposition, stops short of endorsing it — but its recently published “Green Paper” frames the reopening of flows as a possible bargaining chip in a broader diversification strategy.

Party leader Elly Schlein denies any intention to backtrack. Still, on page 12, the document refers to “further considerations […] given the not implausible possibility of a resumption of flows from Russia.”

The Meloni government, by contrast, is doubling down on structural disengagement from Russian energy, focusing on alternative agreements in North Africa and with transatlantic partners.

Minority Report. Positions within the parliamentary minority are far from aligned. Federica Onori, MP and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the liberal-centrist party Azione, strongly criticizes the prospect of returning to Russian gas, warning it would signal Moscow’s structural weakness.

“Returning to buying gas from Moscow today would be a terrible mistake. After years of work to break free from that dependency, it would mean once again bowing to an authoritarian regime that bombs Ukraine and uses energy as a geopolitical weapon,” she tells Decode39.

“Re-engaging with the Kremlin on energy is a short-sighted move that damages our credibility and undermines Europe’s strategic autonomy.”

The broader context. According to the latest data, the European Union has reduced its dependence on Russian gas from 45% in 2021 to 19% in 2024. This is the result of Brussels’ political response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine: a deliberate shift away from energy imports that could finance the Kremlin’s war economy.

The 2025 target is 13%. Yet Russia remains the EU’s third-largest gas supplier and its second-largest source of LNG.

The transatlantic deal. On July 16, Eni signed a 20-year contract with Venture Global to purchase 2 million tonnes of LNG annually from the United States.

The supplies will come from a new facility in Louisiana and will play a key role in Europe’s energy diversification strategy.

City officials had been given a heads-up about the July 15 announcement, Wieder said. City Manager Trey Yelverton sent details to council members that night. Escalades will be built in Orion Township, Michigan, starting in 2027.

“They gave us pre-notice and we knew this was coming,” Yelverton said. “The key thing is, Tahoes, Yukons and Suburbans will remain in Arlington, and all of the head counts and shifts will be maintained.”

The change will give Arlington Assembly, which opened in 1954, the capacity to build more of the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe as well as the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL vehicles, Anthony Andro, Arlington plant communications manager, said in an email to workers.

The good news, Wieder said, is nothing is changing.

“We understand this is part of a broader strategy to bring manufacturing back to the United States and are balancing out the workload as they re-shore Mexico in particular,” Wieder said.

In June, GM unveiled a plan to allocate about $4 billion over the next two years to enhance its U.S. manufacturing capabilities. The investment focuses on expanding production capacity for both gasoline and electric vehicles. With the financial commitment, GM intends to produce more than 2 million vehicles annually in the U.S.

Detroit-based GM sees the Escalade production move as a way to help meet strong customer demand, spokesperson Tara Kuhnen said.

“GM is proud to call Michigan home, and these moves will further strengthen our manufacturing footprint,” she said.

The announcement was made as part of a change in direction for the Michigan plant after the company received $480 million in state grant funds to expand Orion Assembly to increase electric vehicle production. GM said, however, it no longer plans to produce any electric vehicles there.

Republicans are proposing deep cuts to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations bill, which additionally would limit federal help for farmers dealing with “forever chemical” contamination.

The bill, released this week and debated in a US House of Representatives subcommittee on Tuesday, would impact regulations for clean water and air, use and management of public land, wildlife habitats and endangered species protections.

In addition to a broad 23% proposed cut to the EPA’s overall budget, the bill seeks to reduce the budgets of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service each by about 6%.

All three proposed agency budgets, however, are higher than President Donald Trump requested.

Supporters said the bill would right-size agencies that had become bloated and instead prioritize domestic energy production, tribal and wildfire support. The bill increases funding for Tribal Public Safety and Justice programs, Indian Health Services, wildland fire management and offshore oil and gas development budgets.

However, Democrats and environmental groups said the deep budget cuts threaten clean air and water. There are dozens of sections in the bill that target Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act regulations, including blocking the use of funds to limit greenhouse gases from oil and gas operations or farms, tailpipe emissions, or polluted effluent from livestock farms.

Cuts would also limit financial assistance programs for state clean water and drinking water programs and would reduce resources for the federal Superfund program, which manages the cleanup of dangerously polluted sites around the country.

The bill also eliminates funding for diversity, equity and inclusion programs and environmental justice initiatives.

“It cuts water infrastructure funding, slashes EPA programs, and wipes out environmental justice and climate initiatives,” US Rep. Chellie Pingree said in a statement. Pingree, a Democrat from Maine, is Ranking Member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee that convened on Tuesday.

Related: With Lee Zeldin tapped to head EPA, President Trump sets the stage for regulatory rollbacks

The Senate has not yet released its version of the FY 2026 House Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill.

The House version is one of many currently going through Congress, which has a September 30 government funding deadline. Congress did not pass final appropriations bills last year, rather it passed a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through this September.

PFAS in sewage sludge, pesticide labeling

The bill also prohibits the use of any EPA funds to “finalize, implement, administer, or enforce” the agency’s draft assessment on two harmful types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are that are known to be are contaminating farms, ranches and dairies around the country.

The assessment on perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), released in January concluded “there may be human health risks” from PFAS-tainted sewage sludge fertilizer, and outlined a series of steps the agency would take to address the pollution. PFOS and PFOA are linked to a variety of health problems, including certain cancers and immune system and reproductive harms.

“Across the country, farms have had to be condemned and livestock slaughtered due to PFAS pollution from fertilizers,” Laura Dumais, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), said in a statement. “Further delay in preventing more of these needless tragedies would be unconscionable.”

Last year PEER sued the EPA for delays in addressing PFAS in sewage sludge fertilizers. The case was dismissed in December, and PEER has appealed.

The bill as written would continue the Trump administration’s moves to limit the federal government’s role in protecting citizens from PFAS. In May, the EPA said it will rescind limits set under President Joe Biden on four types of PFAS widely found in drinking water.

The bill wades into ongoing controversy over pesticide labeling by blocking any federal funds from being used to “issue or adopt any guidance or any policy, take any regulatory action, or approve any labeling or change to such labeling” for labels that are inconsistent with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Environmental and health advocates say this signals the feds want to continue discouraging states from adopting pesticide labels more strict than the EPA-approved labels, which is something pesticide makers and large farm groups have pushed for.

And the bill would bar any action to limit use of the sterilizing chemical and fumigant ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen. Its continued use is currently under review by the EPA.

Questioning “fiscal responsibility”

Republicans defended the cuts as restoring fiscal responsibility.

“This bill reflects strong stewardship of America’s natural and financial resources.

Take this new Ford, for example. What we've got here is a bona fide electric Bronco. Sounds pretty neat, right? I mean, an electric off-roader is a sick idea. Here's the issue, though: we're not getting this bad boy stateside. Instead, it'll be offered exclusively in China.

The third Bronco in Ford's lineup — called the Bronco New Energy — borrows a hell of a lot of styling cues from the compact Bronco Sport, but other than looks, the two don't share very much. The biggest difference is what you'll find under the hood: no engine. Instead, this Bronco will either come as a full electric vehicle or it'll be fitted with a range-extender (EREV) system, according to CarScoops. The EV will come with a stout 271 horsepower, while the EREV — which will look identical — will make use of a 1.5-liter plug-in motor that'll pump out 241 horsepower. One drawback of the drivetrain is that they both seem to be front-wheel drive only, which is a bit of a letdown for something that carries the ""Bronco"" nameplate.

The EV Bronco will feature a 105.4 kWh battery that'll be good for an impressive 404 miles of range on a single charge, Motor1 reports. The EREV will have a much smaller 43.7 kWh battery that'll give it just 137 miles of electric-only range. However, if you combine that number with what the fuel tank will offer, Ford says it'll be able to travel up to 758 miles on a single tank.

If the drivetrain options weren't enough to make you feel jealous of our Chinese counterparts, surely the looks will. From the outside, it definitely looks like it belongs in the Bronco family. It combines elements of both the full-size Bronc' and the Sport. Buyers will get cool design cues like flush-mounted door handles, a tailgate-mounted fifth wheel, a floating roof and some interesting wheel options. It also looks to have lidar sensors on the roof, which is fascinating considering we're nowhere near to getting something like that in USDM Broncos.

While the truck does look like it borrows more of its looks from the Bronco Sport, its size more closely resembles the full-size truck. Its 116.1-inch wheelbase is identical to the American four-door Bronco, according to Motor1. That also means its wheelbase is about 11 inches longer than the current USDM Bronco Sport. In terms of overall length, the electric Bronco is 197.8 inches — quite a bit larger than the 189.4 inches of the Bronco and 173.4 inches of the Bronco Sport.

Length isn't the only thing the electric Bronco beats its siblings in, either. It's wider than every USDM Bronco other than the Bronco Wildtrak, CarScoops reports. It's also quite a bit heavier, but that's not exactly a surprise. Ford says it weighs 5,535 pounds in EREV form and 5,800 pounds as an EV. The lightest Bronco Sport comes in at a featherweight-by-comparison 3,500 pounds. Hell, even the Bronco Raptor only weighs 4,945 pounds.

The Bronco New Energy is apparently going to enter the Chinese market sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. It's going to be manufactured by JMC — a joint venture between Ford and Jiangling Motors, CarScoops reports. There's no official word on pricing, but it looks like it'll come in somewhere between $42,000 and $56,000, meaning it'll be much more closely aligned with the Bronco rather than the Bronco Sport.

If you ask me, it's a damn shame this truck isn't coming stateside. I mean, I understand why. EV takeup is slowing in the U.S., and President Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles would make this thing so expensive that no one would buy one.

The project will employ TerraFlow’s large-tank flow battery solution, designed for “safe, stable, and long-life operation.”

TerraFlow’s customer entered into a vanadium electrolyte lease agreement with vanadium flow battery developer Storion Energy.

The company notes that while the lease is directly between the customer and Storion, TerraFlow’s relationship with Storion made it possible.

Storion acts as the keeper of vanadium units stored by Largo Physical Vanadium (LPV) for its electrolyte leasing model used in vanadium flow batteries. Largo Physical Vanadium is a subsidiary of primary vanadium producer Largo Resources.

Earlier this month, Storion and TerraFlow entered into a strategic supply agreement, where Storion will supply its vanadium electrolyte production and manufacturing capabilities to support TerraFlow’s skid-based architecture.

The Bellville project is expected to reach initial energisation in Q1 of 2027.

It is unclear if the project has reached financial close or what the undisclosed customer will use it for; however, longer-duration BESS projects have recently become more valuable for energy trading in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market.

TerraFlow also notes the safety of vanadium flow batteries as a major feature compared to lithium-ion (Li-ion).

Vandium flow batteries do not have a thermal runaway risk, but it is important to note that the sulfuric acid used in some systems can leak or become unbalanced.

Travis Torrey, Chief Technology Officer of Storion said of the Bellville project:

“Our company’s focus is to provide a cost-effective, domestic supply chain to enable the rapid adoption of vanadium flow battery solutions. This lease demonstrates how the right commercial structure can speed up deployment, reduce capital barriers, and provide reliable access to high-quality vanadium electrolyte.”

Torrey previously emphasised a domestic supply chain, speaking with Energy-Storage.news in April, when he said:

“What’s important to us is creating a stable business that can operate in a variety of environments. That way we can consistently deliver to our customers.”

ESS receives US$31 million to advance LDES solution

In other flow battery news, iron and saltwater electrolyte flow battery energy storage manufacturer ESS Inc. has received US$31 million in insider-led funding measures.

The package includes approximately US$900,000 in short-term loans from, and warrants issued to a syndicated group led by members of ESS’s board of directors and the management team, along with participation from an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global.

Additionally, there is a production tax credit transaction with an affiliate of SB Energy valued at approximately US$800,000. ESS has also engaged in an equipment sale-leaseback transaction with a U.S. strategic partner, involving US$4 million in cash, subject to certain closing conditions.

Furthermore, ESS has executed a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement with YA II PN, which grants ESS the right, but not the obligation, to sell up to US$25 million of its common equity to the investor at a time of its choosing over a three-year period.

This arrangement is subject to standard limitations, such as requiring shareholder approval for aggregate issuances over 19.99% of the company’s outstanding shares.

In addition to this funding package, ESS has secured the first order for its newest product, Energy Base, to be used in an 8MWh project for an undisclosed customer.

ESS Inc. effectively discontinued production and sales of its Energy Warehouse commercial and industrial (C&I) solution and Energy Center utility-scale solution, instead targeting much longer duration so-called ‘renewable baseload’ projects with Energy Base, aimed at roughly 10-hour to 23-hour duration applications.

As with the previous iterations, Energy Base uses ESS Inc.’s proprietary iron electrolyte technology for which the Oregon-headquartered company is the sole IP holder, licensing it to partners on a limited basis in overseas markets including Australia.

ESS went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction in 2021, but faced challenges in commercialising.

In 2023, the four most high-profile energy storage companies listed via SPAC mergers, including ESS, saw their share prices fall an average of 80% after going public.

In February of this year, the company’s CEO resigned, and ESS said it had “engaged advisors to evaluate potential commercial or financial transactions to enable this new strategic direction.”

In May, ESS reported that it faced the risk of bankruptcy and required funding to sustain its operations.

At the end of that month, the company received funding and said it would continue forward with the plan to develop the Energy Base solution.

It is unclear if that funding is the same as the recently announced US$31 million funding. ESN asked ESS for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

The company also notes that preliminary unaudited financial results for Q2 2025, compared to Q1, show nearly a 300% increase in revenue, along with a 22% reduction in the cost of revenue, a 37% decrease in operating expenses, a 43% improvement in net loss and a 49% increase in adjusted EBITDA.

➔ Ghost emissions are climate change’s untold story. Globally, emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) are tracked but not included in a country’s emissions inventory. While emissions from managed lands are included, emissions from unmanaged lands are excluded as they are triggered by events beyond human control-such as wildfires. But they are formidable: Wildfire on just managed lands had emissions in 2023 that surpassed Canada’s total accounted emissions-by a lot. This year’s LULUCF emissions could rack up, too. By June 2nd, total estimated wildfire emissions for Canada were second only to 2023, with approximately 56 megatonnes of carbon (or 8% of Canada’s GHG emissions in 2023), according to the EU CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System. That’s years of painstaking climate action wiped out in weeks. This highlights a fundamental tension in Canada’s climate policy: most of the attention has been on emissions mitigation; less attention has been paid to climate adaptation. And we are all paying the price.

➔ Is it time for a $100-billion Pathway + pipeline package? Alberta and Ottawa are making progress on a big energy package that could include a West Coast oil pipeline, the long-contemplated Pathways project to capture carbon emissions, and room for expanded oil production, writes John Stackhouse from Calgary. But Mark Carney’s team may need to finesse its way out of the previous Liberal government’s oil and gas emissions cap. That could involve a new target, or delayed timeline, or a refined approach to measuring abated emissions. The package’s headline costs could also be sobering—up to $100 billion.

➔ The Texas tragedy underscores the frequency, and intensity, of floods. More than 80% of Canadians live in urban areas, and around 8 out of 10 major Canadian cities are located in proximity to flood zones, according to the federal government. Floods are already Canada’s costliest natural hazard in terms of property damage, causing $2 billion in destruction annually, as climate change supercharges weather conditions. As part of a greater National Adaptation Strategy, Ottawa is spending $164.2 million to update Canada’s flood mapping program by 2028. Will it be enough?

➔ David Suzuki and Chris Wright’s recent comments highlight the tension between environmentalists and some energy proponents. Canada’s veteran environmentalist told iPolitics recently that its “too late” to reverse climate change as policymakers are focused on economic growth, not nature. Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Christ Wright sees the climate crisis as a byproduct of progress, not an existential threat. “I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement,” he wrote in The Economist. Policy is often driven by political cycles, with energy proponents winning this round. However, the next political cycle is around the corner.

The Big Cool

Power-hungry data centres get all the attention, but the humble air conditioner is also a major strain on grids. As summers get more oppressive in Canada and around the world, the International Energy Agency expects air conditioners to be a top driver of global electricity demand, with air-conditioner ownership worldwide rising from 37% to 45% by 2030.

Here’s why cooling is emerging as a critical climate issue:

➔ Cooling generated just over 1 gigatonne of carbon emissions globally in 2022 (1.9% of total). Space cooling could also lead to leakage of refrigerants, which have a global warming potential of around 1,000 times higher than CO2.

➔ 2Energy demand for space cooling globally is growing at 4% annually, twice as fast as water heating. This is putting pressure on power capacity, especially as countries like Canada strain to keep their grids clean.

➔ In Canada, the percentage of households with an air conditioner hit 64% in 2021, compared to 55% in 2013. That’s even more impressive given the surge in households over the past decade.

➔ Buildings account for 18% of Canada’s total emissions. Of these, space heating and cooling represent more than 67% of building energy use.

➔ One in 10 Canadian households had a heat pump (which, of course, double up as air-conditioners) in 2021, from virtually zero a few years prior. Heat pumps are 4.5 times more efficient than conventional air conditioners, making them a key pillar of climate action.

➔ Residential heat pump imports jumped 71% in Canada in Q1, compared to the same period last year, the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI) data shows.

➔ Federal and provincial Canadian policymakers are considering building codes that would stipulate at least one room with an air conditioner in a home.

➔ Access to cooling is emerging as a human rights issues, especially after nearly 600 people died in a Vancouver heat dome event in 2021.

➔ “An important driver of activity is climate-change mitigation, driven mostly by policy, rebate programs, incentive,” says Martin Luymes, Vice President, Government & Stakeholder Relations at HRAI. For instance, federal rebates led to record heat pump sales, which then dropped off when the programs ended. Several provinces including Ontario, B.C., and Nova Scotia continue to offer rebates, helping sustain interest.

➔ The Canadian HVAC industry sees the possible termination of the Energy Star program in the U.S. as a “major mistake,” says Luymes, noting that the program, which promotes energy-efficient products including air conditioners, as valuable, low-cost consumer guidance tools. Experts say scrapping or weakening Energy Star could harm climate progress.

The good and the ugly in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act

Donald Trump’s signature 2025-26 budget bill is now law. The legislation changes several clean energy tax incentives that were managed under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), tightens domestic content requirements, imposes new qualification deadlines and sunsets other tax credits that could impact Canadian cleantech firms eyeing opportunities across the border.

Here’s the good, the bad and the ugly of the OBBBA:

Carbon capture: The bill maintains credits for carbon capture, but also provides incentives for captured CO2 for oil production, underscoring the administration’s commitment to the fossil fuels industry.

Nuclear: The bill maintains credits for both existing nuclear facilities and new advanced energy technologies. However, new foreign entity provisions could inject uncertainty in the sector’s growth. The legislation is supported by an earlier executive order that targets a quadrupling of U.S. nuclear capacity from 100GW to 400 GW by 2050.

EVs: Electric vehicle manufacturing and competitiveness will be “hard hit,” according to the Center on Global Energy Policy, noting that the law could reduce domestic demand for EVs, jeopardize battery investment and allow China and other foreign competitors to gain greater market share.

Clean grid: Solar and wind power was particularly hard hit as historic investment and production tax credits sunset earlier than before. The law would reduce the build-out of new clean power generating capacity by 53-59% through to 2035, according to the Rhodium Group. An executive order following the OBBBA directs the U.S. Treasury Secretary to eliminate subsidies for “unreliable green sources like wind and solar,” that it believes is threatening national security. A separate executive order directs the Treasury Secretary to end “market-distorting subsidies for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources.”

Critical minerals: Metallurgical coal is nowdeemed a “critical mineral,” allowing it to qualify for a production tax credit. The law also broadly reduced 45X Production Tax Credits for critical minerals to 2033 (compared to no limits before), which would pose a challenge as most critical minerals projects require long timelines. The Center for Strategic & International says the “amended tax credit disincentivizes investment in newly discovered greenfield projects with longer timelines to production in favour of brownfield legacy mines that may be closer to production but have lower grade reserves.”

This report originally published at UNC Media Hub.

With every passing second, more and more of the North Carolina coast is eroding.

Some of the most intensely affected coastal areas, like Rodanthe, where videos of homes pitching, heaving and crumbling into the sea have been going viral since 2020, have erosion rates as high as 14 feet per year.

It’s an inevitable truth that coastal towns are confronting constantly: their beaches are moving, and there’s nothing that they can do to stop them.

The North Carolina barrier islands, for example, have always shifted significantly.

“There’s going to be—and I hate to use the phrase ‘sand wars’—but ultimately, there’s going to be, ‘Where are you going to get it?’”

“As a coastal geologist, I call it barrier island migration,” Kerri Allen, coastal management program director at North Carolina Coastal Federation, said. “As someone who is operating a government or owning a home on that island, they call it barrier island erosion.”

Hefty budgets are dedicated to beach re-nourishment – replenishing eroding beaches with sand transported from alternate locations – and other temporary coastal mitigation efforts. None of these efforts are long-term. All of them are expensive. Some are controversial. Many of them are environmentally damaging.

But for now, all of them are necessary. All that remains is the question of who gets what.

The North Carolina coast stretches along 320 miles of the Atlantic Ocean. Every mile is shifting in some way or another. There isn’t enough sand to sustain all of it.

“All the coastal towns in North Carolina are trying to figure out where they’re going to get their sand from, because the islands are moving,” Chris Shank, executive director of Bald Head Island Conservancy, said. “There’s going to be—and I hate to use the phrase ‘sand wars’—but ultimately, there’s going to be, ‘Where are you going to get it?’”

Securing sand for beach projects is complicated. The Village of Bald Head Island, for example, typically uses sand from an area called Jay Bird Shoals, but the available sand is limited. Recently, Bald Head attempted to get a permit to dredge sand from Frying Pan Shoals, however, due to a pending environmental study, the Island hasn’t been able to access the sand in that area. For the time being, Bald Head Island will continue to dredge from the waning supply at Jay Bird Shoals.

“We don’t have the luxury of time,” Chris McCall, village manager of Bald Head Island, said. “If you think about when you work on projects like these, and you have to deal with permitting and engineering and design and modeling and review by regulatory agencies at the federal and state level—these things don’t happen in a year.”

What Bald Head Island does have over other coastal areas, however, is money. Much of the area’s coastal mitigation efforts are paid for by property taxes. Bald Head Island, as one of the wealthiest areas in the state, with the highest tax rate in Brunswick County, has a considerably deeper tax base than most.

“Every town is completely different,” Allen said. “There is a definite disparity of resources. It is not equitable by a long shot.”

In Dare County, where Rodanthe is located, officials have struggled to secure money for beach nourishment projects.

Last year, after its fund for beach nourishment projects was maxed out, the county applied for a $40 million Federal Emergency Management Agency grant. FEMA denied it.

“The fund just isn’t growing quick enough to do that,” Dare County Manager Robert Outten said at a Board of Commissioners meeting last July. “We’re trying to get with them and say, ‘Okay, we didn’t get it, why? Were there shortfalls in the grant? Is there something else we can show you?”

And with still no money available for temporary solutions, houses are continuing to fall. The costs of demolishing, relocating or cleaning up the debris also fall on the homeowner,

Earlier this year, similar concerns for funding caused Oak Island officials to postpone a scheduled beach renourishment project to the next year. Oak Island hasn’t been able to fully renourish their beach in over two decades.

Historically, the Village of Bald Head Island, particularly its uber-wealthy residents, has managed to use their wealth to skirt some of the policies typically applied to coastal areas, specifically concerning the construction of hard structures like groins or sea walls.

“Their tax base is astronomical,” Allen said. “They have the funding. They also have the political sway to get what they want, to an extent.”

In 1994, Walter Davis, a wealthy oil magnate, who at one point co-owned Bald Head Island, sued the state in order to prevent his beachfront home from being affected by the coastal erosion. A year later, even with an existing ban against hardened structures along the coast, the Coastal Resources Commission granted the installation of sand-filled tubes by Davis’ home, in exchange for his suit being dropped.

But a year later, when a Wrightsville Beach resort requested permission to place sandbags along their coast, the Coastal Resources Commission denied the request.

Now, the Shoals Club, a beachfront country club on Bald Head Island, is seeking another exception to the law, hoping to receive a permit to build an erosion-control structure on their section of coast.

For environmental groups like Bald Head Island Conservancy, hardened structures aren’t the answer. They carry several risks, such as causing greater erosion in areas down the beach from the structure and environmental damage to marine habitats nearby, according to the North Carolina Coastal Federation. They also aren’t permanent solutions, and still require continual beach renourishment projects.

According to a study conducted by the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission in 2010, the long term results of terminal groins can vary. In examining terminal groin sites along the coast, the study found that often, “a minor to moderate negative result occurs over the first half to three-quarters of a mile,” and while net results become positive after this interval for many of the sites, for Shackleford Banks the results were still a net negative.

The study’s data on environmental impact was limited, but concluded that, “if habitat succession occurs, species suitability may be affected.”

Largely, the process seems to be a guessing game.

“The one thing that hardened structures do not do is fix the problem,” Shank said. “They’re very short-term measures, and a lot of times they end up creating longer-term issues. You might fix it for a year or two, if you get lucky, but you’re probably creating a longer-term issue.”

The problem, Shank says, is that coastal towns often don’t have the ability, due to finances or public pressure, to think in the long term.

“They’re trying to make it through the next few years and then see what happens,” Shank said. “When it’s your house that’s having waves lap up underneath the structure, you’re probably not very patient, and that’s one of the challenges, too.”

In an ideal world, environmental groups would prefer to see towns enact a policy of “managed retreat,” which is where money is directed toward moving buildings and infrastructure further inland—working with coastal erosion and migration rather than against it. However, for beach residents, who want the problem to be solved in the present, it’s not a popular idea.

“It’s one of those things where, if folks could go back in some of these beach communities, 40, 50 or 100 years when they created the properties directly on the oceanfront, maybe they could have considered not developing right along the oceanfront and leaving that as a buffer,” McCall said. “But, now we’re here.”

Still, temporary solutions have long been reaching a breaking point. A 2022 National Park Service report found that 750 structures along the North Carolina coast are currently threatened by erosion. There is not enough money or sand to protect all of them.

“We’re not going to be able to keep pumping sand on the beach indefinitely,” Allen said. “Managed retreat, where you’re purposely relocating and moving off the islands, to me, sounds very logical, but to most of the coastal municipalities, is a dirty word.”

That figure, contained in the company's environmental impact assessment submission, is nine times higher than what N.B. Power said when the plant was first announced last December.

But a spokesperson for ProEnergy said the number comes from a ""stressed case"" scenario in which the plant would be ""responding to a major upheaval in the grid,"" operating at full capacity for almost one-third of the year.

""In our experience, this type of operation would not happen over a long duration period as market conditions and grid operations would respond appropriately,"" spokesperson Chris Evans said in an emailed statement ot CBC News.

Evans said the estimate of 100,000 tonnes from N.B. Power is ""the expected, typical operation of a peaking plant"" like the one it plans to build.

Green MLA Megan Mitton, whose Tantramar riding is where the plant will be built, called the difference between the estimates ""an astounding gap.""

Following ProEnergy's explanation, Mitton said she still questioned the need for a new natural gas plant to generate electricity.

""This supposed transition fuel — this transition is taking way too long,"" she said.

""It's not actually a transition. It's keeping us locked in with this type of infrastructure. We shouldn't be building new fossil fuel infrastructure.""

N.B. Power said it will buy electricity from the plant to provide backup power to the utility's growing use of renewable wind and solar energy.

Because those sources aren't constant, the grid requires a more reliable base load of electricity it can turn on and off quickly when it's needed.

Both N.B. Power and ProEnergy said the gas plant will allow the utility to use less electricity from fuel oil at the Coleson Cove plant and from coal at Belledune, leading to a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 250,000 tonnes a year.

Mitton said there's debate about whether natural gas is any better than coal because of methane leakage that can happen in the natural gas supply chain.

ProEnergy's EIA assessment said N.B. Power looked at other options, including energy conservation to lower consumption, and large-scale battery storage of renewable energy to meet peak demand.

But other options weren't enough to head off a potential shortfall of electricity generation as early as 2028, the submission says.

ProEnergy is seeking approval for a plant with 10 turbines capable of generating 500 megawatts of power, though the agreement with N.B. Power is for 400 megawatts from eight turbines.

The utility said this week it could sign agreements with other provinces to add those two turbines and export the electricity regionally.

Mitton said people in her Tantramar riding are just starting to hear about the gas plant and are questioning whether it's needed and why N.B. Power selected an American company in the midst of a trade dispute with the U.S.

N.B. Power vice-president Brad Coady said the utility invited bids long before the trade dispute began, and five companies submitted bids, including Canadian companies.

""We went with who could deliver the least-cost solution on the schedule that N.B. Power is demanding to meet our energy security needs,"" he said.

""If you look at it through those two lenses, our chosen partner in this project by far was the best solution for New Brunswickers.""

The project must go through a federal environmental assessment. The provincial government is able to waive the need for a separate provincial review.

Work is projected to start at the site early next year, with the plant operational in the third quarter of 2028.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7234124.1718305850!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/shediac-solar-farm.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-07-17 13:45:09.956496

With a primary objective of transmitting electricity from Kansas to the Midwest and eastern cities, the 800-mile Grain Belt Express transmission project is the second largest line in domestic history and is backed by Invenergy, a private company.

According to Invenergy, the new line would gain recognition as a national “energy security backbone” and connect four grid regions, one being PJM Interconnection. Ranked as the largest domestic grid, PJM covers a large portion of the country, including states from Illinois to New Jersey.

With the project promising energy security, it supports the goal of maximizing production output and therefore bolstering President Trump’s “energy dominance” cadence. As a result, the White House touted Invenergy’s $1. A billion-dollar investment is a huge win that helps to shore up the U.S. economy while enhancing national security.

Although the farming industry largely supported President Trump’s run for the 2024 presidential election, a changing mindset might be surfacing. Garret Hawkins, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, informed Reuters of its opinion on the recent matter, indicating a violation of farmers’ rights because of land acquisition through eminent domain and compulsory acquisition tactics.

Hawkins told Reuters the “sole purpose is to serve its own business interests, and in doing so, profit off the backs of farmers and landowners who have to house their infrastructure for decades to come.”

Hawkins’ statement came in response to a post Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, made on X, indicating he participated in a conversation with President Trump and Chris Wright, the Energy Secretary. He noted Wright said, “he will be putting a stop to the Grain Belt Express green scam.”

Invenergy notified Wright a day later by letter and warned Hawley and Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has initiated an investigation into the project, have declared “open season on America’s ability to build needed energy infrastructure.” Invenergy furthered its reach by asking Wright to “put his unfounded noise aside and affirm a commitment” to the project.

Although the project has been in process for the past ten years and was bestowed the conditional loan guarantee, the Whitehouse and the new administration did not offer any response.

Utility company PPL Corp. is the “biggest winner” from the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh this week with its joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to build gas-fired power plants to serve data centers in Pennsylvania and across the PJM Interconnection, Jefferies analysts said Wednesday.

PPL and Blackstone are negotiating with multiple potential hyperscale counterparties, according to the analysts, who noted that any new power plants would be operating by 2030 at the earliest.

“The joint venture is actively engaged with landowners, natural gas pipeline companies and turbine manufacturers, and has secured multiple land parcels to enable this new generation buildout; however, no [energy services agreements] with hyperscalers have been signed to date,” PPL said Tuesday.

Dive Insight:

Plans to build gas-fired generation in Pennsylvania comes amid a surge in data center development across the United States, fueled in part by a race to develop artificial intelligence capacity.

In PPL Electric Utilities' service territory in Pennsylvania, there is more than 13 GW of potential data center load in advanced stages of planning, according to PPL. If all those data centers are built, there would be a 6 GW generation shortfall in PPL Electric Utilities' service territory in the next five to six years, PPL said.

It would cost about $15 billion to build enough gas-fired, combined-cycle units to meet the shortfall, PPL said, noting that it expects the power plants would be built by the joint venture, independent power producers and — if legislation is passed to change Pennsylvania law — PPL Electric Utilities.

Blackstone said it expects to spend $25 billion on data centers and energy infrastructure in Pennsylvania. QTS, a data center operator backed by Blackstone, has secured land sites across northeastern Pennsylvania for data centers, the private equity firm said.

PPL owns 51% of the joint venture, with Blackstone Infrastructure owning the rest.

The joint venture lacks identified customers and gas turbines, and the first power plants likely wouldn't be built until around 2031, so the initiative will have little effect on PPL’s earnings until later in the decade, depending on data center interest, Morgan Stanley analysts said Wednesday.

“As long as the contracts that get signed have strict risk parameters that make the financial arrangements 'utility-like,' we think the earnings upside would be attractive for investors, and this approach makes sense as an effort to boost grid reliability,” the analysts said.

In other news from the Pennsylvania summit, Constellation Energy Group indicated it plans to spend $2.4 billion to add 340 MW to its 2,317-MW Limerick nuclear power plant in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.

The Frontier Group plans to convert the former 2.7-GW, coal-fired Bruce Mansfield power plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, into a “significantly larger” gas-fired power plant with added onsite generation, according to the Buffalo, New York-based company. The company said it has a partner to build a colocated data center at the site.

Also, Capital Power said it plans to spend $1 billion over 10 years to upgrade and expand its 1,124-MW gas-fired Hummel power plant in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania.

US data centers could add 80 GW by 2030

Meanwhile, Morningstar analysts expect data center load will roughly triple to about 80 GW by 2030, at least 20% below some estimates, according to a report released Wednesday. The more aggressive forecasts overlook the practical limitations of building large-scale infrastructure and underestimate the rising energy efficiency of AI chips, the analysts said. Load growth projections vary greatly.

Morningstar expects that 60% of the new data center demand will be met by gas-fired generation, 25% by renewable energy additions and 15% by nuclear restarts and expansions. New nuclear, including small modular reactors, aren’t an option until the early 2030s at the earliest, according to the report.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/oSwQbhjRWp06koZa2k5yTOrLL1nGsxFdzXrSdJL-vmE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI0NTc0MzkyXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-17 13:45:21.400338

The legislation, signed during a July 4th ceremony at the White House, carries significant implications not only for individual taxpayers but also for corporate clients operating both within and outside the United States.

Key Provisions for Individuals:

The new law makes permanent several TCJA individual tax provisions that were previously set to expire at the end of this year, including lower individual income tax rates and an expanded standard deduction. It also raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction from $10,000 to $40,000. Additional provisions eliminate federal taxes on tip income and overtime pay for eligible workers, introduce a new deduction for seniors, and allow taxpayers to deduct car loan interest payments—an uncommon benefit in prior tax regimes.

Expansion of Exclusion of Gain on Sales of Qualified Small Business Stock:

This valuable exclusion under Section 1202 has become even more attractive in three respects. First, the holding period for eligibility for these tax benefits has been extended from three to five years. Second, the size of corporations eligible to issue stock for this exclusion has been expanded from 50 million of gross assets to 75 million of gross assets adjusted for inflation. Third the cap on the maximum amount of gain excludable rises from 10 million dollars to 15 million dollars adjusted for inflation. The above rules applied to stock issued after July 4, 2025.

Corporate Tax Changes Affecting U.S. and Global Businesses:

For corporate clients, the legislation solidifies and extends the reduced corporate tax rate of 21% introduced under the original TCJA, which remains highly favorable compared to pre-2017 levels. The bill also introduces new incentives aimed at stimulating domestic investment, including enhanced immediate expensing of capital investments and expanded deductions for research and development (R&D) expenses.

Multinational corporations are significantly affected by provisions that tighten rules on profit shifting and offshore income. The legislation modifies the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) rules to increase the minimum tax on foreign earnings and introduces stricter anti-base erosion measures. While these changes aim to reduce the incentive for U.S. corporations to shift profits abroad, they could increase effective tax rates for multinationals with substantial non-U.S. operations.

Additionally, the bill enhances the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction to encourage exports of U.S.-produced goods and services. However, international clients with operations or investments in the U.S. should carefully assess the new outbound payment rules and transfer pricing adjustments, as these may impact cross-border transaction costs and tax liabilities.

Impact on International Clients:

For corporate clients outside the U.S., the legislation may indirectly affect investment decisions, especially for foreign companies with significant U.S. market exposure. Stricter inbound investment rules and changes to withholding taxes on certain cross-border payments could alter the after-tax profitability of U.S. ventures. Additionally, with the U.S. further distancing itself from the global minimum tax framework agreed to by OECD countries, international businesses may face increased complexity in navigating conflicting tax regimes.

Fiscal Impact and Energy Policy Rollbacks:

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCX-35-25) estimates that the bill will add approximately $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, a figure that has drawn criticism from fiscal conservatives. The legislation also rolls back several clean energy tax credits introduced under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, although some Republican lawmakers argue the cuts do not go far enough.

Implementation and Next Steps:

In anticipation of the bill's passage, the Treasury Department and the IRS have already mobilized teams to develop guidance for the implementation of the new provisions. Corporate taxpayers—especially multinationals—are advised to closely monitor forthcoming regulations and consider proactive adjustments to tax strategies, transfer pricing policies, and cross-border financing arrangements.

The full effects of this landmark legislation will unfold over time, but it is clear that both U.S. and international businesses face a new and evolving tax landscape that demands careful analysis and strategic planning.

Host Toby Perkins, Chair of Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee, hears from former Conservative MP Chris Skidmore. As a Government minister in 2019, Chris signed the legislation that made the UK the world’s first major economy to establish legal net zero targets. He later resigned in protest at plans to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing, and now chairs the Climate Action Coalition launched by former US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Asked if the UK is moving fast enough to meet the Government’s 2030 target, Chris says he is encouraged by the pace of change seen around the world.

“I was initially sceptical about it,” he says, “but things are moving on so fast that we’ve got to keep up with the rest of the world. It isn’t just about decarbonising or reducing emissions. It’s actually about making sure our own economies and businesses are fit for the future, that they are both sustainable and embracing the latest technologies.”

Chris says the Government should prioritise investment in new energy industries, where the time between investment and delivery is “minimal”, to demonstrate the real-world impact of net zero initiatives.

“For the Labour government,” he says, “you’ve got this target of 2030, which coincides with the 2029 general election if that’s when it takes place. You’ll want to be able to say, ‘we’ve got this in place for 2029,’ prioritising those industries where they can show that they’ve shifted the dial.”

Devolved authorities such as regional mayors will also play an increasingly important role in driving or impeding progress towards net zero, Chris says, especially as more authorities are set to be created by the English Devolution Bill by 2030.

“What happens if you get a mayor like we’ve just got a mayor in Lincolnshire who’s not particularly pro net zero,” he says. “Are they going to try and use the planning system perversely to try and stop things from an ideological perspective?” As the English Devolution Bill creates more authorities by 2026, the next year will be “really critical”, he says.

Chris also discusses reframing the narrative around net zero investment towards saving “found money” rather than simply reducing emissions. GB Energy’s pledge to put solar panels on the roofs of 200 schools and 200 hospitals, for example, should put money “back into the system”, he says, by saving the equivalent of 50 doctors’ salaries.

In the episode Toby also hears from Claire Young, Liberal Democrat MP and member of the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee, and Harriet Cross, Conservative MP and member of the Scottish Affairs Committee.

“If you compare us to countries like France and Germany, we‘ve got a less diverse and more volatile collection of energy sources than those countries,” Claire says. Whereas Germany uses a combination of hydro, coal and gas, while France uses a high amount of nuclear power, the UK is more reliant on oil and gas, which is more exposed to price spikes. “Trying to address that is key to bringing down our electricity prices.”

The Energy Security and Net Zero Committee recently published a report on the UK’s “energy planning chaos”. Clare says the Committee recommended the Government provide much clearer guidance to planners and developers on how strategic plans related to decisions on delivering grid connections. The Committee also recommended “earlier and deeper community engagement, so that you can build trust and deliver more quickly.”

Meanwhile, Harriet emphasises the importance of ensuring a just transition to a net zero future, an issue the Scottish Affairs Committee is currently exploring in its inquiry into GB Energy. The constituency Harriet represents – Gordon and Buchan in Aberdeenshire – is “the absolute heart” of the oil and gas sector, she says.

“One in three jobs in my constituency are directly or indirectly related to, to oil and gas,” she says. “It is so important that these jobs are looked after, transitioned across to whatever the future energy mix looks like, because it's not just in terms of job numbers, it's local skills, it's local economies, it's all the communities that are related to these jobs. So ensuring that the transition is properly just, whatever just means, is absolutely vital.”

Grants support Berks, Lehigh, Montgomery, and Bucks counties

Projects include EV buses, waste haulers, and charging stations

To support business, clean transportation, fund alternative fuel vehicles, new infrastructure, and improve air quality, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) awarded more than $3.47 million through the Alternative Fuel Incentive Grant program.

Grants are designed to aid businesses, school districts, local governments, and nonprofit organizations in 17 counties. In the Lehigh Valley, Berks, Lehigh, and Montgomery counties are among the recipients. In addition, Bucks County received a grant award.

“We are committed to increasing sustainable and renewable energy and these grants will help local governments, businesses, school districts, and nonprofit organizations invest in alternative fuel solutions that are reliable, efficient, and often cheaper to operate,” DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley said in a statement. “AFIG aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality for many Pennsylvania communities with the use of electric school buses, Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) trucks, electric charging stations, and other clean transportation alternatives.”

The grant awarded funding to 27 recipients. The selected projects will result in the deployment of 94 alternative fuel vehicles, including seven new fueling stations. Fifteen projects are also located in or serve Environmental Justice (EJ) areas.

The 2024 second round AFIG projects in the Lehigh Valley include the following:

In Berks County, Jerome H. Rhoads, Inc.: $45,098 for the purchase of two propane trucks. This project also involves Lancaster County.

In Lehigh County, City of Allentown: $60,423 for the installation of eight Level 2 chargers for use by city inspection vehicles.

In Montgomery County, Bryn Mawr College: $75,000 for the purchase of an electric school bus; and BFI Waste Services of Pennsylvania, LLC: $300,000 for the purchase of four electric waste hauler vehicles.

Bucks County recipients include Friends Boarding Home of Bucks Quarterly Meeting (Friends Village): $7,500 for the purchase of one EV passenger vehicle. Solebury Township of Pennsylvania: $5,625 for the purchase of one EV passenger vehicle.

According to a release, the DEP AFIG program supports projects to replace older gasoline or diesel fueled vehicles with cleaner fuel vehicles – like electric and natural gas – and install infrastructure to improve air quality in Pennsylvania. This program builds on Governor Shapiro’s agenda to create a climate and energy plan that will grow the commonwealth’s economy, protect and create jobs, and address climate change, per the release.

In Pennsylvania, 47% of nitrogen oxide emissions come from gasoline and diesel vehicles, and transportation contributes up to 22% of Pennsylvania’s overall greenhouse gas emissions. The awards will save an estimated 1,262,825 gallons of gasoline per year.

For this second-round of 2024 funding, AFIG priorities include zero emission vehicle projects; medium-duty and light-duty fleet refueling infrastructure projects; renewable natural gas vehicle and infrastructure projects; projects predominantly serving Environmental Justice areas; and minority, veteran, or woman-owned businesses.

Texas is one of the nation’s leading providers of welfare for the fossil-fuel industry. The trade-off is rising physical risk and economic hardship for all the rest of us; especially Texans.

By now we know a changing climate played at least a small role in the devastating July 4 floods in central Texas that killed at least 119 people. We also know that burning fossil fuels is the primary source of the greenhouse gases cooking the climate and making such disasters more likely and destructive. And we know Texas leads the nation in producing those fossil fuels.

What’s maybe not as well known is that the Lone Star State keeps that industry well fed with big helpings of taxpayer cash. Along with billions of dollars in explicit and implicit federal subsidies, the industry also receives at least 20 different tax and regulatory breaks and direct handouts from the state, according to a report last year by the nonprofit National Resources Defense Council. The dollar amounts are difficult to pin down, but just three of those tax breaks give the industry at least $1 billion a year alone, according to the NRDC. Subsidies for liquefied natural gas exporters amount to billions more, according to a Sierra Club report in December.

To its credit, Texas has also subsidized renewables such as wind and solar, fostering a nation-leading renewable-energy boom. But state politicians have made it their business to undermine these fossil-fuel competitors at every turn by kicking away their supports while further coddling oil and gas in what my colleague Liam Denning has described as a form of socialism.

Lost tax revenue is just the start of the harm being done to Texans. If somebody asked you to guess the U.S. state most vulnerable to climate change, you might pick hurricane-prone Florida or wildfire-prone California. But because of its size and location on the planet, Texas outdoes them both, being prone not only to hurricanes and wildfires but also floods, droughts, deep freezes, heat waves, hellish convection storms and more.

Between 1980 and 2024, Texas suffered from 190 separate weather events that each caused at least $1 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for total losses of up to $440 billion, adjusted for inflation, more than any other state. These events have increased in frequency and destructiveness in recent decades, as Bloomberg News has documented, with many happening concurrently to compound the misery. A heat wave after Hurricane Beryl knocked out power in Houston last year and led to packed emergency rooms. In the case of the July 4 floods, a drought parched the earth, making it less porous and making flash flooding from a climate-charged deluge more likely.

NOAA has stopped tracking billion-dollar disasters because ignoring problems obviously makes them go away. But Texas has been hit with at least two such catastrophes this year, according to private forecaster AccuWeather. A freak winter storm on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in January inflicted up to $17 billion in economic damage from Texas to the East Coast. And the forecaster’s preliminary estimate of the cost of the July 4 floods tops out at $22 billion.

AccuWeather says its tallies are broader than those of NOAA, which measured only the immediate damage of disasters. AccuWeather tries to take into account the economic disruption and productivity loss caused by these events, including the almost incalculable value of the many lives and future potential lost.

These risks will keep rising as the climate grows more dangerous and Texas grows more crowded. Even before the latest tragedy, Texas led the nation in flooding fatalities, according to a 2021 study by scientists for the University of Texas at San Antonio.

Most of those deaths, like those on July 4, occurred in the stretch known as “Flash Flood Alley,” a crescent that partly parallels the Interstate 35 corridor between Dallas and San Antonio. That also happens to be one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, with a population of more than 12 million, which is expected to double by 2050. Despite being prone to flash floods, this region is also at risk of running out of groundwater. And it’s subject to longer heat-wave seasons. Oh, and its cities are sinking faster than others in the country, probably because of the pumping of oil and gas. Wrestling with this hydra of problems will add up to more costs to taxpayers.

At the same time, thanks largely to the surge in costly disasters, the average Texas home-insurance premium rose 55 percent between 2019 and 2024, the 10th-fastest pace in the country, according to LendingTree. Texas now has the country’s fourth-highest average premium, at $5,180 a year. That’s nearly 85 percent higher than the national average of $2,801.

High and rising insurance rates could hurt home values, as they have in Florida. That in turn threatens the property taxes local governments need to invest in resilience, much less maintain regular services. Perhaps the biggest lesson from the July 4 floods is that our preparedness for such catastrophes is spotty at best, with some people getting timely, life-saving flood warnings and others not. Under President Trump and the Republican Congress, the federal government is taking money away from state and local governments for such investment (while giving even more money to oil and gas), deepening the dilemma.

Texas still has a chance to save itself. For starters, it can keep supporting its renewables industry, which produces almost twice as much wind and solar power as California. Better yet, it can repurpose the welfare it gives to fossil fuels toward strengthening infrastructure and saving lives. Those billions in oil and gas handouts would buy an awful lot of flood-warning systems.",http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heraldnet_logo.png,N,,2025-07-17 13:48:08.273793

Expanding chemical recycling as an economic driver A major focus of the hearing was debate over the role of chemical recycling in advancing U.S. domestic supply chains and job creation.
Ranking member Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY, called for balancing new technological investments with efforts to strengthen the country’s existing recycling infrastructure.
Chemical recycling technologies “are controversial technologies, and not without good reason,"" he said in his opening remarks.","Plastics industry groups and recycling organizations underscored the role of recycling as an economic driver during a congressional hearing on Wednesday.

During a meeting of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s environment subcommittee, lawmakers highlighted chemical recycling and e-scrap recycling as two sectors with the potential to ramp up domestic supply chains for critical materials and create jobs. Speakers also urged action on a range of federal legislation meant to make recycling easier or more accessible.

Subcommittee chair Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., acknowledged the implications of the federal government’s role in supporting recycling. He noted that President Donald Trump has specifically called for policies meant to secure critical mineral and rare earth supply chains as a national security measure meant to decrease the country’s reliance on recycled goods from other countries.

“E-waste is so important for our future” for this reason, he said, adding that the rise of data centers and ever-growing use of technology generates a high volume of end-of-life electronics that can be recycled for critical minerals. “E-waste is a commodity that can be repurposed in our fight to not only be energy independent, but energy dominant,” he said.

Speakers also noted that plastics recycling will play a major role in the future of the country’s economy, but that plastic recycling innovations must also be balanced with investments in current recycling infrastructure.

Speakers from the American Chemistry Council, The Recycling Partnership and the Flexible Packaging Association weighed in during the hearing. Here are some key takeaways from the event.

Expanding chemical recycling as an economic driver

A major focus of the hearing was debate over the role of chemical recycling in advancing U.S. domestic supply chains and job creation.

Ross Eisenberg, president of ACC’s plastics division, noted that chemical recycling facilities have been expanding in the U.S. in recent years. He said this makes them an ideal industry to help create municipal and manufacturing jobs along the supply chain and create a positive ripple effect for local economies. These technologies, he said in his testimony, are a key to “increasing recycling rates and restoring consumer confidence in the industry.”

Dan Felton, president and CEO of the Flexible Packaging Association, voiced support for chemical recycling, particularly as a tool to increase the use of recycled content in some films and flexible packaging. That’s partly because certain packaging used for food and medical devices must meet stringent U.S. Food and Drug Administration quality standards that require recycled plastic to undergo additional washing and processing.

Getting an FDA approval for mechanically recycled content for packaging can be “arduous and slow,” Felton said in his remarks, while chemically recycled content “eliminates some of this lag because the technology returns plastics back into a monomer, eliminating concerns of chemical migration, odor, or color.”

Both ACC and FPA urged the committee to support legislation that would regulate chemical recycling as manufacturing instead of a waste management process. ACC has long said this reclassification would make the permitting and regulatory process more consistent across the country. ACC-backed laws in 25 states already do this. The U.S. EPA recently declined to consider a reclassificiation for pyrolysis, a type of chemical recycling, in recent air quality standards.

FPA supports the reclassification, Felton said, partly because states “continue to grapple with this issue inconsistently,” and some states have in the past sought to ban chemical recycling altogether.

Yet some Democrats on the subcommittee voiced concerns that reclassifying chemical recycling as a manufacturing process could potentially allow facilities to avoid stronger environmental protections under laws like the Clean Air Act.

Ranking member Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY, called for balancing new technological investments with efforts to strengthen the country’s existing recycling infrastructure.

Chemical recycling technologies “are controversial technologies, and not without good reason,"" he said in his opening remarks. “While we should not foreclose consideration of any tools to address problems with our waste management system, we must ensure that these technologies actually displace virgin production and do not introduce environmental and public health risks at this stage.”

Tonko added that he has not “seen much evidence that these technologies are succeeding by these metrics, with much of their output being used as fuels rather than new recycled products.”

Eisenberg said it’s important for the chemical recycling industry to be transparent with its operations and goals, noting the facilities should meet “rigorous environmental safeguards.” ACC also supports “independent certification and strong regulatory oversight for advanced recycling processes, to ensure they deliver measurable environmental benefits,” he said.

When asked for her position on chemical recycling, The Recycling Partnership founder Keefe Harrison noted that any discussion on the technologies should have nuance and specificity, in part because chemical recycling is an umbrella of numerous types of technologies that might have different supply chains or various impacts to the environment or local economies. She emphasized that using such technologies solely for fuel production is not considered recycling.

Federal bills could help drive progress

Speakers also called for Congress to advance key legislation meant to improve recycling systems in the U.S.

Harrison, Eisenberg and Felton all voiced their support for the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act, which aims to improve recycling infrastructure in communities with limited or no access. That bill is also part of the Steward Act, which pairs RIAA with another bipartisan bill, the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act, that calls for collecting more data on U.S. recycling infrastructure and market trends.

These bills were introduced in 2022 and 2023 but have not yet passed despite bipartisan support and support from numerous packaging and recycling groups.

Tonko noted that recycling innovation is an important strategy to improve recycling systems, but lack of recycling access hampers such innovation.

“Our recycling system needs some very basic foundational improvements before we can even begin to suggest that new technologies will save us,” he said. “There are glaring needs for better data accessibility, labeling and education to enable people to feel confident when they use the blue bin correctly.”

Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, said he will soon introduce the Packaging Claims and Knowledge Act, a bill meant to set certain federal standards for compostability and recyclability claims on packaging labels. Ameripen helped draft the legislation.

Harrison also called for support for the soon-to-be-introduced Cultivating Investment in Recycling and Circular Local Economies Act, a bill meant to establish a recycling and infrastructure investment tax credit.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GEic-orsH8mLR5krIqPVMe8UL_mPrptvEawEpFp6Vtg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9pbWFnZV80XzFDSXk4TlcucG5n.webp,N,,2025-07-17 11:33:07.760769

WASHINGTON – Upon returning from the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation summit this week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin published an op-ed highlighting steps the agency is taking to reduce burdensome regulations, unleash American energy dominance, and make America the AI capital of the world. In keeping with President Trump’s executive order in January to enhance U.S. leadership in AI, EPA is committed to increasing certainty in the permitting process that is crucial to securing power demand for data centers and related facilities.

On Tuesday, along with President Trump and other administration officials, Administrator Zeldin traveled to Pennsylvania to share how EPA’s commitment to partnering with state, local, and Tribal air agencies is promoting ways for Americans to invest and develop AI domestically. A main pillar of Administrator Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative is making the United States the AI Capital of the World.

Read what Administrator Zeldin had to say in his exclusive op-ed for Fox News:

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) has begun. President Donald Trump got it right from the start when he issued an executive order in January to strengthen America’s AI – the next great technological forefront.

“From Day One as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, it was clear that EPA would have a major hand in permitting reform to cut down barriers that have acted as a roadblock so we can bolster the growth of AI and make America the AI capital of the world.

“In fact, it’s an endeavor so important, it is a core pillar of my Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.

“Those looking to invest in and develop AI should be able to do so in the U.S., while we work to ensure data centers and related facilities can be powered and operated in a clean manner with American-made energy.

“Let’s put this into perspective. The global AI manufacturing market is valued at about $7 billion, but it’s expected to explode to $48 billion by 2030. Already industries across every sector are integrating AI into their operations, and in order for this growth to continue, AI needs massive data centers, and data centers need electricity that is always on. Lots of it.

“Power demand for data centers that support AI, which only use 3% to 4% of U.S. electricity, will eat up nearly 10% of U.S. electricity supply in 10 years according to the Energy Information Administration. To support this rapid growth, states need to be able to build more baseload power generation, and that’s where EPA comes in.

“EPA wants to increase certainty for owner-operators in the permitting process, making it clear what kind of permits are needed for new and modified projects.

“Policies inherited from the Biden administration have been criticized by many as making EPA a brick wall that impedes the growth of the AI industry.

“In addition, much of current Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for building data centers dates back to the 1990s, when technology was practically prehistoric compared to modern advancements. These rules require companies to install pollution control equipment when they build new facilities or make a change that increases emissions significantly.

“The digital revolution has ushered in new needs and new industries which demand new permitting rules that help, not hamper development.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, the permitting reform we are looking to undertake, if finalized, will help clear the way for data center and AI development across the U.S., while ensuring that human health and the environment are protected.

“If a power company wanted to restart a plant that had been out of service to meet increased grid demand, under the Biden EPA they had to go through the entire permitting process all over again.

“Under our upcoming proposed rules, if finalized, utilities would be allowed to restart plants much faster, especially in times of emergencies like storm recovery. Anyone who has lost power during or after a weather event knows how critical it is to get back on the grid.

“Through the CAA permitting process, EPA will seek to address the minimum requirements for public participation when it comes to minor emitters so the protest of a few does not unnecessarily thwart progress for all Americans.

“Our permitting reforms will also help expedite construction of essential power generation and industrial facilities. EPA will be a partner to state, local and Tribal air agencies instead of a hindrance.

“At EPA, we are also working on redefining preconstruction, which would, if finalized, only require a company to obtain an air permit when the company actually breaks ground.

“A company looking to build an industrial facility or a power plant, should be able to build what it can before obtaining an emissions permit. For example, companies could install cement pads or conduct other construction activities that aren’t related to regulated air emissions.

“Other countries are racing to be number one. America's AI leadership depends on our ability to build the infrastructure that powers innovation.”",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 11:32:49.842217

“These structural changes reinforce EPA’s unwavering commitment to fulfill its statutory obligations and uphold fiscal responsibility. By partnering our operations and mission support services, we can deliver results for American communities while remaining good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

This action is the latest part of EPA’s comprehensive reorganization efforts to address agency inefficiencies by delivering organizational improvements to personnel structure that directly benefit the American people and improve EPA’s ability to fulfill its core mission while powering the Great American Comeback.

The new Office of Finance and Administration creates a streamlined, one-stop-shop for all financial and administrative operations. This will create new efficiencies and improve coordination of EPA's facilities and other critical assets nationwide, acquisition activities (contracts), grants management, human capital, information technology, and information management activities. It will also improve communication within the agency, Congressional committees and staff, and other government organizations that conduct oversight or assessments. This will help ensure the agency is being a good steward of tax dollars.

Changes to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance will better address pollution problems that impact American communities by re-aligning enforcement with the law to deliver economic prosperity and ensure compliance with agency regulations.

Updates to the Office of Land and Emergency Management will better equip the agency to swiftly and efficiently fulfill statutory obligations like preventing contamination, cleaning up and returning land to productive use, and responding to emergencies.

Phase One of EPA’s reorganization efforts established a first-of-its-kind Office of State Air Partnerships within the Office of Air and Radiation, implemented changes to the Office of Water to better align regulatory actions with the science that underpins it, created the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions, and added support to the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention to work on the backlog of new chemicals and pesticides, among many other improvements.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 11:33:38.930649

Sales of electric cars and trucks, including plug-in hybrids, could be scorching hot at the end of summer, according to industry analysts, as buyers hear more promotions about why they absolutely must lock in lucrative clean vehicle tax credits that expire under what has been called the “one, big, beautiful bill.”

A lucrative loophole on leasing EVs ends Sept. 30, too.

A clean vehicle tax credit that’s up to $4,000 for eligible used electric vehicles also expires Sept. 30.

Senate Republicans estimate the change could save carmakers around $200 million, Reuters reported.

General Motors (GM) and Stellantis, which together paid over $700 million in prior corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) penalties, will now avoid further retroactive fines.

Environmental groups criticized the move, with Dan Becker of the Center for Biological Diversity calling it “an obscene gift to pollution law violators.”

The policy is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to ease regulations on gasoline-powered vehicles. Other recent moves include repealing electric vehicle tax credits and blocking California’s 2035 ban on gas-only car sales.

The regulatory change amid plans of automakers, including GM, to ramp up ICE vehicle output.

GM announced a $4 billion investment across Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee to expand combustion vehicle production, including the relocation of Cadillac Escalade manufacturing to its Orion Township plant and the addition of gasoline-powered Silverado and Sierra trucks.

The Orion facility had previously been earmarked for EV production.

Tesla, which earned $2.8 billion last year from selling regulatory credits to other automakers for emissions compliance, may see lower demand for credits under the revised rules.

Republican Senator Bernie Moreno called such payments “outrageous,” and NHTSA Administrator nominee Jonathan Morrison told lawmakers that “at the end of the day, a consumer is going to pay for that.”

Under the Biden administration, NHTSA had proposed stricter CAFE targets that could have led to $14 billion in industry-wide fines through 2032, including $6.5 billion for GM and $3 billion for Stellantis.

China's stranglehold on critical minerals threatens America's national security and economic independence. Beijing controlsapproximately 90% of global rare earth processing and has weaponized these resources against the United States before. Meanwhile, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed the vulnerability of global supply chains. America needs reliable partners, and we need them now.

The answer isn't halfway around the world—it's in Canada.

Canada: America's Untapped Strategic Asset

While Washington scrambles to reduce dependence on hostile nations, Canada sits on a treasure trove of the very resources America desperately needs. Our northern neighbor possesses massive reserves of lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements—the building blocks of everything from F-35 fighter jets to electric vehicle batteries to advanced semiconductors.

Consider the numbers: Canada holdssignificant lithium reserves, enormous copper deposits, and significant rare earth potential. Yet American companies import these critical materials from China and other unreliable sources, funding our adversaries while ignoring our closest ally.

The Trump-Carney Opening

President Trump's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in May revealed unprecedented alignment between our nations. Carney, notably, called Trump a ""transformational president"" and emphasized cooperation on defense, security, and trade—areas where previous Canadian leaders often proved difficult partners.

This represents a historic opportunity. Unlike his predecessor, Carney understands that Canada's prosperity depends on American success, not virtue-signaling to European allies or appeasing Beijing. He's a pragmatist who speaks Trump's language: deals that work.

The Strategic Minerals Imperative

Trump should immediately propose a comprehensive Strategic Minerals Alliance with Canada. The framework is straightforward: guaranteed American access to Canadian mineral wealth in exchange for massive infrastructure investment, processing facilities, and long-term purchase agreements.

This isn't charity—it's smart dealmaking. American companies would secure reliable supply chains while Canadian firms gain access to the world's largest market. Both nations would benefit from joint processing facilities, shared technology, and coordinated defense production.

The alternative is continuing our dangerous dependence on China, which has already demonstrated its willingness to cut off rare earth exports during trade disputes. Every day we delay gives Beijing more leverage over America's industrial base.

Beyond Minerals: A Broader Alliance

The Strategic Minerals Alliance should anchor a wider partnership encompassing energy, defense manufacturing, and technology development. Canada's vast energy resources—from oil sands to hydroelectric power—can fuel American industrial resurgence while reducing our dependence on unstable Middle Eastern suppliers.

Joint defense production offers even greater potential. Canadian firms already contribute to American military programs, but this cooperation remains fragmented and underutilized. Integrated defense manufacturing would create thousands of American jobs while strengthening our military industrial base against Chinese competition.

Making It Happen

Trump's dealmaking expertise is perfectly suited to this challenge. The president understands that successful partnerships require mutual benefit, not one-sided arrangements. Canada gets investment, market access, and economic growth. America gets secure supply chains, reduced dependence on adversaries, and a stronger North American industrial base.

Congress should embrace this vision enthusiastically. A Strategic Minerals Alliance advances our priorities: energy independence, strong defense, economic nationalism, and alliance with democratic partners who share our values.

The Stakes Are Clear

America faces a choice: continue depending on hostile nations for critical resources, or forge a partnership with our democratic neighbor that benefits both countries. China hopes we choose poorly, betting that American politics will prevent the strategic thinking necessary for long-term competition.

President Trump has the opportunity to prove Beijing wrong. By prioritizing Canada as America's essential strategic partner, he can secure our economic future while strengthening the democratic alliance that guarantees our security.

The path forward is clear. The question is whether we'll take it.

Today’s battery supply chain monopoly presents an equally concerning risk for grid resilience and energy security worldwide.
The global battery supply chain bottleneck China’s dominance of the lithium-ion battery supply chain is staggering.
The world must act decisively to diversify energy storage technologies and supply chains.","A stark reality has emerged: China controls almost the entirety of the lithium-ion battery supply chain. Tariffs have already resulted in a large upward surge in battery prices, uncertainty and confusion in the industry, and a geopolitical risk that threatens to snowball as energy storage capacity grows.

China’s near-total control risks exposing potential weaknesses in the global supply chain. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, European nations faced energy rationing and rapid inflation, revealing how energy dependency can threaten national security due to geopolitical tensions. Today’s battery supply chain monopoly presents an equally concerning risk for grid resilience and energy security worldwide.

To ensure national security and energy resilience and meet decarbonisation targets, we must act quickly to diversify energy storage beyond conventional lithium-ion batteries to technologies that rely on globally abundant materials that practically any nation can source domestically.

The global battery supply chain bottleneck

China’s dominance of the lithium-ion battery supply chain is staggering. It boasts 90% of global raw materials refining capacity and produces 70% of cathodes, 74% of separators, 82% of electrolytes, and 85% of anodes. In total, more than 75% of global cell manufacturing takes place in China, and the U.S. imports nearly 70% of its lithium-ion batteries from there.

This didn’t happen by accident. For the past two decades, China has moved strategically to secure a stronghold over virtually every step in the supply chain, from developing mining interests in resource-rich regions globally to building a huge domestic processing infrastructure.

An economic reality check

The economic impacts of this dependency are already here. Tariffs have reversed the 30-year trend of declining battery costs, pushing prices significantly higher. Lithium-ion batteries imported from China could face combined tariffs of up to 82% by 2026, with the potential to reach 132% if additional planned tariffs take effect.

These increased costs will slow deployment of grid-scale energy storage – a technology proven essential for maintaining grid reliability – especially by balancing the intermittency of renewable generation. In 2024, developers built energy storage at a rapid rate, adding nearly 11GW to the grid with projections for even faster growth in 2025. This momentum is at risk precisely as energy storage is becoming crucial for grid stability.

The shortcomings of today’s domestic manufacturing in the US

While laudable, domestic manufacturing efforts face significant hurdles to meeting the growing demand for lithium-ion battery production. New battery facilities in the US often start with production yields as low as 50% and cost 33% more to build than comparable facilities in China.

Additionally, since most factories rely on cell components from China, projections show that even if North America has enough manufacturing capacity to meet cell demand by 2030, it will lack a sufficient domestic supply of cathodes and anodes.

A more secure path forward for energy storage

Simply attempting to replicate China’s lithium-ion cell production to meet demand is both risky and potentially futile, especially considering China controls the raw materials supply in addition to cell production capacity. We do not have time to wait for domestic manufacturing to scale to the degree needed to provide grid resilience and energy security.

Instead, we can ensure geopolitical security by investing in energy storage technologies built on abundant, geographically distributed materials. For grid-scale applications where size and weight are less critical than cost and longevity, alternatives to lithium-ion offer compelling advantages. Technologies with decentralised and flexible supply chains dramatically reduce disruption risks from international conflicts, trade restrictions and natural disasters.

Collaborative and strategic policy measures will be critical to facilitate this transition. Governments and industry should substantially increase investments in alternative battery technologies that reduce dependency on critical minerals and geopolitically sensitive regions.

Large-scale validation of alternative technologies across critical sectors is essential to speed adoption and build investor confidence. Tax credits and grants for manufacturers supporting domestic supply chains will help create resilient local ecosystems that can withstand global disruptions.

The time to act is now

The ability to store energy at grid-scale is becoming vital to any nation’s economy and security. Local sourcing of materials for next-generation storage technologies can put countries on a path to true energy independence by enabling enhanced grid resilience and industrial growth.

We should not wait for the next geopolitical crisis to expose our vulnerability. The world must act decisively to diversify energy storage technologies and supply chains. Our energy future requires technologies that can be produced anywhere from materials available everywhere. Only then can we ensure that energy security and climate goals advance together, creating a resilient pathway to our shared, stable, and sustainable future.

The collaboration, announced on July 16, 2025, represents a significant expansion of the companies' existing partnership and positions GM's battery technology for applications beyond electric vehicles at a time when electricity demand is surging nationwide.

Meeting growing energy storage demands

""The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn't just expanding, it's becoming essential infrastructure,"" stated Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM. ""Electricity demand is climbing, and it's only going to accelerate.

Ultium Cells is GM's joint battery cell manufacturing venture with LG Energy Solution.

The memorandum announced this week enables Redwood to pair its integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and new U.S.-built batteries.

Real-world implementation already underway

The partnership isn't just theoretical—it's already operational. GM's second-life electric vehicle batteries are currently powering what the companies describe as the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America. The 12MW/63MWh installation at Redwood's facility in Sparks, Nevada, supports AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

""Both GM's second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood's energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America's energy and manufacturing independence,"" stated JB Straubel, founder and CEO of Redwood Materials.

The second life of EV batteries

Industry experts note that EV batteries still retain significant capacity even after they're no longer suitable for automotive use.

""When you lose that 30% in battery capacity, you lose around 30%, plus or minus, of range. For a lot of people, that's no longer satisfactory,"" Liz Najman, director of market insights at EV research firm Recurrent, told the Free Press. However, these batteries could potentially serve in stationary storage applications for another 10 to 20 years.

The average new electric vehicle in 2025 produces batteries with approximately 93 kilowatt-hours of charge. Batteries are typically considered end-of-life for vehicle use when around 70 kilowatt-hours remain – still substantial capacity for less demanding applications.

Strategic timing

The partnership comes as GM continues to expand its battery technology portfolio. Earlier this week, GM and LG announced plans to scale production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, a lower-cost alternative to nickel-rich batteries, at their Ultium facility in Tennessee. GM has also recently announced plans to begin producing lithium-manganese-rich cells, expected to reduce electric truck battery pack costs by at least $6,000.

As Forbes points out, finding additional applications for battery cells beyond EVs can help GM maximize its investment in battery R&D and production technology amid changing market conditions.

The Redwood Materials connection

Founded in 2019 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, Redwood Materials has established itself as a leader in battery recycling and materials recovery. The company estimates it's currently processing more than 20 gigawatt-hours of used battery cells annually—equivalent to approximately 250,000 electric vehicles.

Interestingly, Straubel and Kelty have a shared history, having worked together at Tesla building the EV company's battery operations from its earliest days until 2017, when Kelty departed. Straubel left Tesla in 2019 to focus on Redwood.

Beyond GM, Redwood Materials also partners with Toyota, Ford, Volvo, Volkswagen, and Audi to extract valuable materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt from end-of-life battery packs.

Industry perspective

While partnerships between automakers and battery recyclers are growing in North America, they remain in their early stages. Tony Flanagan, a partner and managing director in the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, told the Free Press that the business model's viability is still unproven.

""Europe and China seem to have better business models for these partnerships as we see the global supply of EV batteries for recycling on track to take off in 2028, driven largely by growth"" outside the United States, Flanagan noted. He added that battery recycling capacity is projected to triple by 2030, with China representing approximately 70% of the market and the U.S. just 10%.

GM and Redwood Materials expect to announce more details on their plans later in 2025.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt0c4f26c62bc15a72/66b3b0c783cd1fdcc1d24d30/redwood.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-17 13:43:33.261718

Cars announced July 16 that it will add its best-selling XC60 mid-size SUV to the production line of its Ridgeville plant. The facility also is the assembly site for the fully electric flagship EX90.

The XC60 has been the company’s best-selling model globally for years and is also the most popular Volvo model among U.S. customers, according to a news release. In the first six months of 2025, XC60 sales in the United States were up almost 23%.

“Adding the XC60 to our Charleston production line will further strengthen its position and attractiveness in the competitive U.S. market, while supporting and creating American manufacturing jobs,” Håkan Samuelsson, CEO of Volvo Cars, said in the news release. “It is also in line with our ambition to build where we sell and reinforces our long-term commitment to the U.S. market, where we are celebrating our 70th anniversary and have sold over 5 million cars.”

The company did not say how many new jobs may be anticipated by adding the model to its production line.

In addition to its popularity in the United States, the XC60 is a car of global importance to Volvo Cars as well, the release stated. It recently surpassed the 240 wagon as its all-time best-selling model, with more than 2.7 million XC60s now on global roads.

The company says American customers like the XC60 for its combination of safety, luxury and Scandinavian design. Already this year, over 33% of Volvo Cars’ sales in the U.S. are the XC60, and 25% of those are plug-in hybrids.

As the fourth best-selling luxury plug-in hybrid in the United States, it’s also an important bridge toward electrification for customers. Once they experience electrification in plug-in hybrids, they are more likely to want another plug-in hybrid or fully electric powertrain in their next car, the company says.

“The XC60 is already beloved around the world and in the U.S. and we’re proud we’ll soon be able to offer American families the XC60 they love, assembled here by American autoworkers,” Luis Rezende, president, Volvo Cars Americas. “The XC60 is the right car for this market. It offers the best of Volvo in a versatile size with the powertrain options to suit our U.S. customers. We continue to be impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit in South Carolina and are grateful to the state of South Carolina and Gov. McMaster for their leadership.”

Volvo Cars broke ground on its first U.S. manufacturing plant in 2015, nearly a decade ago. Today, the state-of-the-art facility assembles the Volvo EX90 and the Polestar 3 SUV models.

Volvo Cars has invested $1.3 billion in the plant in the last decade, with extensive investments to make it ready for the future, the release stated. The body shop and paint shop have been renewed and expanded significantly, while the plant also has a state-of-the-art battery pack production line.

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" under the Act is either a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity.""
For an entity's first taxable year after enactment, the determination of whether such entity is a prohibited foreign entity (without regard as to whether such entity is a controlled foreign entity) occurs on the first day of that year.
Publicly traded entities are excepted from being classified as a specified foreign entity under the controlled foreign entity rules, subject to certain exceptions.
However, the prohibited contractual (or similar) rights can accrue to a related party to such specified foreign entity.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law ""An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Re. 14"" (commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""Act"")). On July 7, President Trump released an executive order titled ""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources"" (the ""Executive Order"").

The Act contains sweeping changes to various tax incentives for renewable energy and to other tax credits, and the Executive Order implies that the Treasury may fundamentally revise well-understood beginning-of-construction guidance and provide guidance on the prohibited foreign entity provisions of the Act (discussed subsequently) within 45 days.

The Act applies sweeping ""prohibited foreign entity"" rules to most major credits. These rules may require lenders, tax or preferred equity investors, and tax credit buyers to diligence a broader array of project contracts. It could also require that certain credit claimants disclose more about their organization structure and debt holders. These rules essentially apply a modified and expanded version of the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules that applied to certain credits (e.g., 30D). The Department of Energy's guidance as to when an entity is owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a covered nation is evoked by these rules, but never actually applied in full.

The Act provides that properties that begin construction after 2025 cannot qualify for most major credits if they include ""material assistance"" from a prohibited foreign entity. These rules evoke the current domestic content guidance and require that a certain percentage of the direct costs of the relevant property does not derive from materials from a prohibited foreign entity.

The Act phases out or terminates many credits much earlier than had been provided. In particular, the various credits for electric vehicles terminate quickly, and wind and solar facilities also have special restrictions.

The Executive Order is intended to ""build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind solar, and other 'green' energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act."" Thus, the Executive Order directs the Treasury to take:

all appropriate action to strictly enforce the termination of credits under section 45Y (clean electricity production credit) and section 48E (clean electricity investment credit) with respect to wind and solar facilities, including issuing new and revised guidance to ensure that policies concerning ""beginning of construction"" are not circumvented, including preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of the subject facility has been built1

prompt action to implement the prohibited foreign entity restrictions in the Act.

The major changes from the Act are described in more detail as follows.

Imposition of prohibited foreign entity rules (Sections 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, 48E)

These rules restrict the credits to taxpayers that are not certain types of entities that are not disfavored by the United States. An entity might be disfavored via too much equity or debt ownership by one or more other disfavored entities. These rules also prevent disfavored entities from having any sort of material contractual control right over qualified facilities, energy storage technology, or eligible components.

Broader representations will be required by and from tax or preferred equity investors to be comfortable that the credits are available. It is possible, but less likely, that these investors will have to provide evidence to establish their status. A project or eligible component would also fail to qualify for a credit if certain disfavored entities are counterparties to the contracts that give them material influence over some aspect of the project or eligible component. Thus, certain contracts will also be subject to enhanced diligence.

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" under the Act is either a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity."" For an entity's first taxable year after enactment, the determination of whether such entity is a prohibited foreign entity (without regard as to whether such entity is a controlled foreign entity) occurs on the first day of that year. Otherwise, the determination occurs on the last day of such entity's taxable year.

Specified foreign entities

The categories of specified foreign entities are as follows:

Foreign entity of concern (FEOC): These include certain foreign entities of concern (such as a foreign terrorist organization), excluding an entity controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of, a covered nation (which thereby excludes the DOE's guidance on this term).

Certain Chinese military companies operating in the United States.

Certain other Chinese entities: These entities include entities on a list of entities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region that mine, produce, or manufacture wholly or in part any goods, wares, articles and merchandise with forced labor.2

Certain specific entities: These entities include (i) Contemporary Amperex Technology Company, Limited (also known as CATL), (ii) BYD Company, Limited, (iii) Envision Energy, Limited, (iv) EVE Energy Company, Limited, (v) Gotion High tech Company, Limited, (vi) Hithium Energy Storage Technology company, Limited, and (vii) any successor to an entity specified in (i) through (vi).

Foreign-controlled entities: These entities are: (i) the government (including any government below the national level) of a covered nation (i.e., North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran); (ii) an agency or instrumentality of such a government; (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation that is not also an individual and citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident of the United States; (iv) an entity or qualified business unit (e.g., branch) incorporated or organized under the laws of, or having its principle place of business in, a covered nation; or (v) an entity (including subsidiary entities) ""controlled"" by one of the foregoing entities. ""Control"" is, applying certain constructive ownership rules, more than 50% ownership (by vote or value in the case of a corporation, of capital or profits in the case of a partnership, or of the beneficial interests for all other entities).

Publicly traded entities are excepted from being classified as a specified foreign entity under the controlled foreign entity rules, subject to certain exceptions.

Foreign-influenced entities

Two sets of rules govern whether an entity is a foreign-influenced entity: (i) rules evaluating the level of influence through executive control or through equity or debt ownership (ownership rules); and (ii) rules evaluating the level of influence through the entity's contracts and other arrangements (payment rules).

Ownership rules: An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if, during the taxable year: (i) a specified foreign entity can directly appoint a covered officer (e.g., a board member or member of the c-suite) of such entity; (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns, directly or constructively, at least 25% of such entity; (iii) one or more specified foreign entities own, directly or constructively, at least 40% of the entity; or (iv) at least 15% of all the debt of such entity has been issued to one or more specified foreign entities. Publicly traded entities are excepted from these provisions, including entities owned directly or indirectly, applying certain constructive ownership rules, at least 80% by a publicly traded entity. This rule is subject to certain exceptions.

Payment rules: An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if, during the previous taxable year, such entity made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or other entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or a related person thereto) or (ii) any eligible component produced by (including any applicable critical mineral extracted, processed, or recycled by) the taxpayer or person related thereto.

Observation:

To fall under these rules, (i) there must be a payment (of any amount), meaning that, for example, an existing contract where no payment has been made because certain conditions have not been met would not trigger these rules, and (ii) such payment must be made to a specified foreign entity. However, the prohibited contractual (or similar) rights can accrue to a related party to such specified foreign entity. The fact that only payments to specified foreign entities trigger these rules is helpful, but query whether the Secretary will expand this rule to include payments to related parties to specified foreign entities using its anti-abuse authority.

There are three rules for ""effective control"": (i) one before guidance is issued by the Secretary; (ii) a general rule which the Secretary must interpret when issuing such guidance; and (iii) a special rule for licensing arrangements that applies regardless of the state of guidance.

Effective control before guidance is issued by the Secretary: Effective control is the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty (or related person thereto) to: (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or related party thereto); (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility or the storage of electrical energy in the energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or a related party thereto); (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer (or related party thereto) that produces eligible components; (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer (or related party thereto); (v) restrict access, except as to personnel or agents of the contractual counterparty, to (x) data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer (or related party) or (y) the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or a related party); or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity.

Observation:

This provision could require a great deal of additional diligence with service providers, suppliers, and offtakers, and new representations in these contracts, such as operations and maintenance agreements. These counterparties will have to ascertain and represent that they are not specified foreign entities. If a counterparty is or could be a specified or foreign entity, the contract in question will need to be reviewed to determine whether it provides too much influence over a project or product to a specified foreign entity (or related party). This diligence could be required for lenders, tax or preferred equity investors, or credit transferees. Tax insurance may be necessary.

What is an ""unrestricted contractual right?"" The vast majority of contracts have restrictions or conditions. Presumably, guidance will indicate that ordinary restrictions (e.g., an operator can be removed in the case of gross negligence) will not affect the determination of whether a contract implicates these payment rules.

Effective control in general (i.e., directions for guidance): Effective control is one or more arrangements or agreements similar to those described in the pre-guidance category and in the licensing agreement category (described subsequently) that provide one or more contractual counterparties (or related persons) of a taxpayer (or related party) with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage, which are not included in the measures of control described in the ownership rules.

Observation:

The grant of authority includes anti-abuse authority to ""prevent entities from evading, circumventing, or abusing the application of the restrictions described in subparagraph (C) and subclauses (II) and (III) of this clause through a contract, agreement, or other arrangement."" Subparagraph (C) contains the rules for foreign-controlled entities. It seems unlikely that this is the correct reference, because this clause governs the foreign-influenced entity payment rules, but it is unclear what the correct reference is. The other two references are correct—they govern the rules before guidance and the special license agreement rules.

Special rule for licensing agreements: This rule applies to any licensing agreement for the provision of intellectual property (or other contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related party) which is related to such licensing agreement) with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component. This will likely be most relevant to manufacturing processes with respect to eligible components.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of IP. A bona fide purchase or sale does not include an arrangement in which the ownership of the IP reverts to the contractual counterparty (or related party) after a period of time.

""Effective control"" means, with respect to these contracts, that any (a) of the following contractual rights are retained by the contractual counterparty (or related party) or (b) other features of the contract are present: (i) the right to specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component; (ii) the right to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component; (iii) the right to limit the taxpayer's (or related party's) utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component; (iv) the right to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the tenth year of the agreement (including modifications and extensions); (v) the right to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration of longer than two years (including modifications and extensions); (vi) the contract in question does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity; or (vii) the contract, agreement, or other arrangement was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

Observation:

The last rule is apparently a ""per se"" rule. Thus, if (i) there is any licensing agreement whatsoever (or any other arrangement that is related to such licensing agreement) that is ""with respect to"" a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component, (ii) such licensing agreement was entered into or modified on or after July 4, 2025, (iii) there is a payment made pursuant to such licensing agreement in a prior taxable year, and (iv) the payment was made to a specified foreign entity, then the payor is a foreign-influenced entity. Merely entering into such a licensing agreement after July 4, 2025 is fatal, regardless of whether the agreement otherwise affords the counterparty one of the other listed rights.

It is not clear when a licensing agreement is ""with respect to"" a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or eligible component.

This rule applies ""in addition"" to the rules that apply prior to the issuance of guidance. Nevertheless, it is difficult to imagine the Treasury restricting or refining the impact of these provisions when it issues guidance. The Act seems particularly concerned with licensing arrangements. The grant of guidance includes a specific grant to establish rules to prevent entities from ""evading, circumventing, or abusing the application of the restrictions against impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, such as through temporary transfers of intellectual property, retention by a specified foreign entity of a reversionary interest in transferred property, or otherwise.""

Imposition of material assistance rules (Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E)

Property includes ""material assistance"" from a prohibited foreign entity if its ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than an annually escalating ""threshold percentage."" For purposes of sections 45Y and 48E, the material assistance cost ratio is the quotient (expressed as a percentage) of (i) (x) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) which are incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction, minus (y) the total direct costs of the taxpayer attributable to all such manufactured products (including components) incorporated in the qualified facility or energy storage technology that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, over (ii) the amount in (i)(x). For section 45X, the amounts in the equation are the total direct material costs incurred by the taxpayer for the production of the eligible component, less the total direct material costs that are paid or incurred by the taxpayer for the production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

The constructive ownership rules apply to all ownership determinations with respect to the material assistance rules.

Observation:

It is not clear how the constructive ownership rules would apply to the material assistance rules, which generally relate to the asset level, and not the entity level.

Establishing direct costs:

The Act requires the Secretary to publish certain safe harbor tables (and any other necessary guidance) no later than December 31, 2026 to identify the direct costs of manufactured products and eligible components. For qualified facilities and energy storage technologies, the construction of which begins before 60 days after the date the Secretary issues safe harbor tables, a taxpayer may rely on safe harbors provided in the notice 2025-08 (the 2025 domestic content notice), as long as the applicable supplier provides a certification (i) as to its total direct costs or total direct material costs of such product or component that was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity or (ii) that such product or component was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Observation:

Presumably, the taxpayer must provide this certification regardless of whether it relies on the 2025 domestic or establishes its direct costs pursuant to the principles of notice 2023-38 (the original domestic content notice). The Act is not clear in this regard.

If the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs as attributable to a prohibited foreign entity.

Rules for supplier certifications: If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a certification is false, the taxpayer may not rely on such certification. The certification must be signed by the supplier under penalties of perjury and must include a representation that the supplier does not know, or have reason to know, that any entity further up the supplier's chain of production is a prohibited foreign entity. The certification must include direct costs for purposes or that the relevant property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Observation:

The certification requirement, and all the rules with respect to thereto including the penalty rules described subsequently, apparently only apply before the Secretary issues safe harbor guidance specific to the material assistance rules. It may be possible for the Secretary to create a similar certification requirement when issuing the required safe harbor tables and apply the statute of limitations and penalty rules to such certification.

Supplier certification penalty: The Act introduces a new penalty on suppliers that provide a certification that (i) they know or reasonably should know would be used in connection with a material assistance determination, (ii) they know or reasonably should know that such certification is inaccurate or false with respect to whether applicable property was manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, or the total direct costs or total direct material costs of property that was not manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, and (iii) the inaccuracy or falsity of which results in an understatement of income tax in the lesser of (x) 5% of the amount of tax required to be paid or (y) USD100,000. The penalty is the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to inaccuracy or falsity or (b) USD5,000. The penalty may be abated if the supplier can show reasonable cause. This penalty applies to certifications provided after December 31, 2025.

Exception for pre-existing contracts:

A taxpayer may elect to exclude from the ratio manufactured products, eligible components, or constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents of eligible components, which are acquired by, or manufactured or assembled by or for, the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and (i) placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or before January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities) in a facility, the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025, or (ii) in the case of a constituent element, material, or subcomponent, used in a product sold before January 1, 2030.

Observation:

The exception for existing contracts applies to items which are placed in service in a ""facility"" (excluding wind and solar facilities). The term ""facility"" is not defined. Presumably, this is intended to refer to the defined terms ""qualified facility"" and ""energy storage technology."" Whether guidance is needed to implement this exception properly and define ""facility"" to mean ""qualified facility"" and ""energy storage technology"" is not clear.

The material assistance exception for existing contracts with respect to wind and solar facilities does not harmonize with the exception to the wind and solar 2028 credit cut-off for facilities which begin construction before July 5, 2026. Thus, to obtain the benefit of the existing contract exception for wind and solar facilities, any facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025 must be placed in service before January 1, 2028.

Grant of authority:

The Act provides the Secretary with broad anti-abuse authority to prevent a taxpayer from (i) stockpiling manufactured products, eligible components, or constituent elements under the pre-existing contract rule, or (ii) evading any requirements of the material assistance cost ratio rules through beginning construction by a certain date, when the facts and circumstances demonstrate the construction has not in fact begun.

Observation:

Given that ""beginning of construction"" is a well-understood term, and that the Act defines ""beginning of construction"" explicitly with reference to existing IRS guidance, it is unclear what abuses (ii) is meant to target. Query whether the Executive Order is reflecting the same concerns.

The Secretary is provided leeway to define certain terms beyond their definitions in existing statutes, including ""eligible component"" (which is defined with reference to section 45X) and ""manufactured product"" (which is defined with reference to the domestic content requirement under section 45Y). The Secretary may also provide rules to address facilities that produce more than one eligible component for purposes of the material assistance rules with respect to section 45X.

Statute of limitations and penalty provisions generally applicable to the material assistance rules:

The statute of limitations for deficiencies attributable to errors with respect to material assistance determinations is increased from the default of three years to six years.

Observation:

Although penalties could apply for overstating credits, such overstatement generally did not cause an extended statute of limitations. Now, misstating tax credits, if done through a mistake related to the material assistance provisions, can cause an extended statute of limitations.

Currently, there is a 20% accuracy-related penalty that applies if the understatement of income tax exceeds, for non-corporations, the greater of (i) 10% of the tax determined to be due and (ii) USD5,000 and, for corporations, the lesser of (x) 10% of the tax determined to be due (or, if greater, USD10,000) and (y) USD10 million. This penalty can be abated if the taxpayer's reporting position was supported by substantial authority, or the taxpayer adequately disclosed the facts supporting such a position and there was a reasonable basis for such facts. The penalty is assessed as of the due date of the tax return, and interest on the underpayment also applies to the penalty (interest accrues and compounds daily). The Act provides that the accuracy-related penalty is assessed substituting ""1%"" for ""10%"" in the above determination if the understatement of income tax is due to a disallowance of the credits under section 45X, 45Y, or 48E due to overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

Phase Out in 2034, Imposition of Requirements to Prohibited Foreign Entities, Restrictions for Wind and Solar, and More Modifications (Sections 45Y and 48E)

There is also a special ten-year recapture rule, a denial for certain residential facilities that are leased, an update to the energy community bonus for advanced nuclear facilities, and an update to the greenhouse gas emissions computation provision. The Act also fixes the domestic content glitch in section 48E.

Under section 45Y, taxpayers are eligible to claim a credit for electricity produced and sold by a facility that meets the definition of a ""qualified facility"", specifically one that achieves net negative greenhouse gas emissions. The credit is generally valued at 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), but this amount increases to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) if the taxpayer satisfies prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. The credit is available for a ten-year period following the date the qualified facility is placed in service and can be increased by certain bonuses to the credit.

Similarly, under section 48E, a taxpayer can claim a credit equal to a percentage of the basis of a ""qualified facility"" or ""energy storage technology"" that the taxpayer placed in service. The percentage is generally equal to 6%, unless the taxpayer satisfies certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, in which case the credit is multiplied by five, and can be increased by satisfaction of certain bonuses. The credit is subject to certain recapture rules.

Phase out:

Currently, the sections 45Y and 48E credits begin phasing out for facilities and energy storage technology that begin construction during the later of two years after (i) 2032 and (ii) the year in which greenhouse gas emissions hit a certain rate. The Act causes the section 45Y and section 48E credits to begin phasing out for facilities that begin construction two years after 2032, except in the case of wind and solar facilities.

The Act phases certain wind and solar facilities (but not storage) out for facilities that (i) begin construction 12 months after July 4, 2025 and (ii) are placed in service after December 31, 2027.

Observation:

The Executive Order targets this provision. Whether ""new and revised"" beginning of construction guidance will be narrowly tailored to address only wind and solar facilities qualifying for the sections 48E and 45Y credit is unclear.

Material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity:

This requirement generally applies to qualified facilities, interconnection property, and energy storage technology for which construction begins after December 31, 2025. Thus, these facilities and energy storage technologies will need to have their supply chains scrutinized to ensure that they do not fall below the applicable threshold percentages.

Prohibited foreign entity:

These rules preclude a prohibited foreign entity from recognizing the credit, beginning in any taxable year beginning after the date of enactment. There is no way to begin construction in order to delay this requirement.

Observation:

This provision applies to facilities that were placed in service and claimed the section 45Y credit before the Act was enacted. There is no grandfathering rule.

10-year recapture period for section 48E in certain cases:

Generally, the section 48E credit can be recaptured over a five-year period (with the percentage of the credit recaptured decreasing annually). Under this new rule, the section 48E credit is recaptured if the taxpayer violates a payment rule that would classify it as a foreign-influenced entity. This rule applies for any taxable year in which a taxpayer has been allowed a section 48E credit beginning after July 4, 2027. This recapture period begins on the date a property is placed in service and ends ten years thereafter.

Observation:

The recapture percentage is 100%, unlike the five-year abating recapture percentage otherwise provided in section 50(a).

Qualified fuel cell property:

The Act creates a new provision in section 48E for qualified fuel cell property, which is defined with reference to the existing rules under section 48 (without regard to the beginning of construction deadline of January 1, 2025 therein). The greenhouse gas emissions limitation does not apply to this type of facility. The investment tax credit (ITC) is a flat 30% and may not be increased by any bonuses. This credit is available for property, the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Observation:

Because the percentage is a flat rate, that means that qualified fuel cell facilities do not need to satisfy, or be exempt from, the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for purposes of obtaining the full credit.

Rules for residential wind or solar used to heat water:

No credit is allowed for residential (i) wind facilities or (ii) solar facilities that generate electricity to heat water, in either case that are leased or rented to a lessee that is an individual using the residence with such a facility. This rule applies to facilities placed in service in taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Emissions update:

The Act directs the Secretary to consider certain pre-existing studies to determine net greenhouse gas emissions. It applies for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Advanced nuclear facility energy community:

For any advanced nuclear facility, the definition of ""energy community"" for purposes of the energy community bonus is expanded to include metropolitan statistical areas with certain nuclear-specific characteristics. This bonus is not available if the section 48E ITC is claimed. It becomes applicable for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Section 48E Domestic content glitch:

The Act fixes a ""glitch"" in section 48E whereby the requirement that a certain percentage of the costs of manufactured products be attributable to productions that are manufactured, mined, or produced in the United States did not escalate annually, which did not match the requirements for the bonus in section 45Y. The adjusted percentages are generally increased to match those in section 45Y. The percentages are for facilities (excluding offshore wind facilities) or energy storage technology, the construction of which begins before (i) June 16, 2025, 40%; (ii) January 1, 2026, 45%; (iii) January 1, 2027, 50%; and thereafter; (iv) 55%.

Limited and early phase out, and restrictions of prohibited foreign entities (Section 45X)

The so-called ""stacking rule"" is modified, a credit for metallurgical coal is introduced, and the definition of ""battery module"" is modified.

Under section 45X, taxpayers can claim credits for producing and selling solar energy components, wind energy components, inverters, qualifying battery components, and critical minerals (each as defined in section 45X).

Stacking (i.e., sale of integrated eligible components):

Section 45X permitted a credit where an eligible component was sold to a related person, that integrated such eligible component into another eligible component, and sold the integrated component to an unrelated person. Under the Act, stacking is permitted if (i) the eligible component in which the initial eligible component is integrated is manufactured in the same manufacturing facility as the initial eligible component is manufactured, (ii) the integrated eligible component is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) at least 65% of the direct material costs of the integrated component that are paid or incurred by the taxpayer to produce the integrated component are attributable to initial eligible components that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. This applies to eligible components sold after December 31, 2026.

Phase-out:

Critical minerals (excluding metallurgical coal) produced after December 31, 2030 begin to phase out. The percentage is 75% beginning in 2031 and steps down by 25% each year, with no credit beginning in 2034. Prior to the Act, critical minerals were not subject to a phase-out. There is no credit allowed for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029. There is no credit allowed for wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Material assistance:

The material assistance provisions apply for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. The pre-existing contract rule grandfathers components only if they are sold before January 1, 2027.

Prohibited foreign entity:

These rules apply to taxpayers in taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Like with the technology neutral credits, an entity is only a foreign-influenced entity in respect of the payment rules if the contracts are in respect of the eligible component in question.

Metallurgical coal:

""Metallurgical coal"" is added as an applicable critical mineral for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. It must be suitable for use in the production of steel, regardless of whether such production occurs outside of the United States. The credit is for 2.5% of the costs (whereas other critical minerals qualify for 10%).

Updated definition of ""battery module"":

The Act updates the definition of ""battery module"" (which is a type of eligible component) to mean that it must be ""comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality such as current collector assemblies, voltage sense harnesses, and/or any other essential energy collection equipment."" This applies for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2026.

Certain credits may not be transferred to specified foreign entities

The prohibition on transfer applies to credits under sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, and 48E. This applies for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Extension of clean fuel production credit and other modifications (Section 45Z)

Negative emissions rates are prohibited and the potential double benefit for fuel derived from fuel which received the section 45Z credit is eliminated.

Taxpayers can claim a credit for producing certain transportation fuels, including both nonaviation and sustainable aviation fuels, provided these fuels meet specific greenhouse gas emission standards and the taxpayer sells the fuels to an unrelated person for certain uses.

Domestic feedstocks only:

The Act completely denies the credit for fuel from a non-US, non-Mexican, or non-Canadian feedstock.

The changes apply to transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Extension:

The credit had terminated for transportation fuel sold after December 31, 2027, and now terminates for fuel sold after December 31, 2029.

Prohibited foreign entity:

The rule precluding specified foreign entities applies in taxable years beginning July 4, 2025. The rule for foreign-influenced entities applies in taxable years beginning two years after July 4, 2025, and, for purposes of this section, these payment rules are ignored in defining a foreign-influenced entity.

Sustainable aviation fuel:

The excise tax credit under section 6426(k) for sustainable aviation fuel is disallowed to the extent that a credit under section 45Z is allowable (without regards to the requirement that fuel be produced in a qualified facility or sold to an unrelated person for use in the production of a fuel mixture, use in a trade or business, or to sell at retail for the fuel tanks of retail purchasers). The provisions apply to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 and to fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 if claims under section 6426(k) have not been paid or allowed as of such date. Sustainable aviation fuel had benefited from an increased credit. The increased rate for sustainable aviation fuel is eliminated from section 45Z for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. The excise tax credit terminates for fuel sold or used after September 30, 2025.

Negative emissions prohibited:

The determination of the emissions rate, which helps determine the amount of the credit, may not be less than zero. This provision applies for emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Certain emissions:

The Act adds provisions that (i) exclude indirect land use emissions from the calculation of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and (ii) require the Secretary to provide distinct emissions rates for animal manures, and this emissions rate may be less than zero. This provision applies to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Elimination of double credit:

A qualifying fuel can no longer be produced from a fuel which already received the section 45Z credit.

Related person amendment:

A taxpayer must sell fuel to an unrelated person to qualify for the section 45Z credit. A rule allows a corporation to sell fuel to a member of its consolidated group if the buyer on-sells the fuel to an unrelated person. This related person rule now allows the Secretary to draft regulations to address sales of fuels to controlled groups of entities that are similar to corporations in consolidated groups, including rules for a related person for which the taxpayer has a reason to believe will sell the fuel to an unrelated person.

Elimination of the limited 2%/10% ITC and modifications to geothermal heat pump property (Section 48)

Otherwise, the Act does not generally address § 48, meaning that it and projects safe harbored thereunder are generally unaffected. Section 48 provides an ITC for certain delineated ""energy properties"" of either 2% or 6%, each of which could have been multiplied by five for energy projects satisfying the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, and increased by certain bonuses. Except for certain geothermal heat pump property, the 30% ITC generally terminated for properties, the construction of which began after January 1, 2025.

The 2% ITC is eliminated:

There had been 2% ITC (which, like the 6% ITC, could be multiplied by five for satisfying or being exempt from the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements) for certain solar and geothermal energy property. This ITC, including potential bonus increases, is eliminated. It is eliminated for property, the construction of which begins on or after June 16, 2025.

Geothermal heat pump property:

There is a rule specific to geothermal heat pump property (which remains eligible for the ITC under section 48 for property beginning construction before January 1, 2025), which provides that the ownership of such property will be determined without regards to whether the property is readily usable by a person other than the lessee or service recipient for purposes of section 50 (the recapture provision) and section 168 (the provision allowing accelerated depreciation). This rule applies for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of this act.

Observation:

The function of this provision appears intended to ignore ownership issues applicable to this property. But it is strange that it is described as a ""conforming amendment"" to the denial of the technology neutral ITC under § 48E for certain residential facilities that are leased to the persons using the residences.

Early termination of the clean hydrogen production credit (Section 45V)

The Act terminates the credit under section 45V for facilities, the construction of which begins before January 1, 2028. The amount of the credit is calculated as a percentage of USD0.60 per kilogram, with the exact percentage (ranging from 20% to 100%) based on how much greenhouse gas is emitted during production. This credit can be claimed for up to ten years after the facility is placed in service. Previously, the credit was available for facilities, the construction of which began before January 1, 2033.

Disqualification of energy property (Section 48)

The Act strikes the provision classifying property ""described in section 48(a)(3),"" which is the list of types of energy property qualifying for the ITC under section 48 as five-year property (except that section 168 expands the provision for solar property in section 48(a)(3)(A)(i) to include wind property). This provision applies retroactively to property, the construction of which begins after December 31, 2024.

Observation:

Most property described in section 48(a)(3)(A) is defined to include a requirement that such property begins construction before January 1, 2025 and property that does not contain such requirement would generally qualify for the technology-neutral credit. The Act also terminates the 2%/10% ITC, which is a limited ITC that would have been available for solar and geothermal property for which the technology-neutral credits are not claimed. Such property is described in section 48(a)(3)(A) and it is possible that striking the provision qualifying such property from five-year MACRS is tied to ending the limited ITC. This provision could also force the property for which the 30% ITC otherwise remains into section 48E (i.e., certain geothermal property), and subject it to the prohibited foreign entity and the material assistance rules.

Modification of the carbon capture and sequestration credit (Section 45Q)

Taxpayers are eligible for a credit per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured and either disposed of in secure geological storage or utilized in certain ways. These credits are available for 12 years after the equipment is placed in service, can be increased fivefold if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met, and are indexed for inflation after December 31, 2026. The credit applies to facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2033.

Prohibited foreign entities:

These rules apply for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, but the payment rules are ignored for purposes of defining a ""foreign-influenced entity.""

Parity for different uses and utilizations of qualified carbon oxide:

The paragraph permitting the USD12 credit is struck and all permitted forms of utilization qualify for the USD17 credit. This applies for facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Imminent expiration of the electric vehicle credits (Sections 30D, 45W, 30C, and 25E)

The Act expires electric vehicle credits under section 30D, section 45W, section 30C, and section 25E.

Section 30D:

The section 30D credit for clean vehicles terminates for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. Taxpayers previously could claim a tax credit up to USD7,500 for new clean vehicles that were placed in service during the taxable year, with the amount based on battery mineral and component sourcing (and FEOC limitations in particular), subject to income and vehicle price limits. The section 30D credit had terminated for vehicles placed in service after December 31, 2032.

Section 45W:

The section 45W credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles also terminates for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. Previously, the credit of upwards of USD40,000 per vehicle was available for a portion of the basis of clean commercial vehicles a taxpayer placed in service. This credit had terminated for vehicles acquired after December 31, 2032.

Section 30C:

The section 30C credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property terminates for property that is placed in service after June 30, 2026. Taxpayers are eligible for a tax credit equal to 30% of the cost of advanced refueling property, up to USD100,000. This credit had expired for property placed in service after December 31, 2032.

Section 25E:

The section 25E credit for previously owned clean vehicles terminates for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. Taxpayers had been eligible for a tax credit when purchasing a previously owned clean vehicle of the lesser of USD4,000 or 30% of the sale price. Receiving this credit is subject to income thresholds: USD75,000 for single filers, USD112,500 for head of household filers, and USD150,000 for joint filers. This credit had expired for vehicles acquired after December 31, 2032.

Extension, modification, and limitations of certain credits (Sections 45U, 48D, 42, 45D, and 40A)

The Act extends, modifies, and limits credits under sections 45U, 48D, 42, 45D, and 40A.

Section 45U:

The Act prohibits the section 45U zero-emission nuclear power production credit for taxpayers that are specified foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities by virtue of the control rules. The prohibition on specified foreign entities begins in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 and the prohibition on foreign-influenced entities that are classified as such by virtue of the control rules begins in tax years beginning following two years after July 4, 2025. There is no prohibition on foreign-influenced entities that are such because of the payment rules. The credit is available to existing nuclear power plants for electricity they produce. The base value of the credit is 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), but this increases to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour if the taxpayer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions during the construction, repair, or alteration of the qualified facility. The credit amount is reduced as the market price of electricity rises above a USD25 per megawatt-hour (MWh) index.

Section 48D:

The Act enhances the advanced manufacturing investment credit under section 48D, which applies to property integral to facilities, the primary purpose of which is the manufacturing of semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment, from 25% to 35%. The Act does not eliminate the prohibition on FEOCs and does modify the FEOC provision to refer to prohibited foreign entities. The credit still terminates for property, the construction of which begins after December 31, 2026. The enhancement applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

Section 42:

The low-income housing tax credit under section 42, which is for a certain percentage of the basis of a qualified low-income building, is also enhanced, and the state housing credit ceiling is permanently increased by a factor of 1.125 beginning after December 31, 2025. The rule excepting buildings financed by tax-exempt bonds from the volume cap is expanded to exempt buildings where at least 25% of the aggregate basis of such building and the land on which the building is located is financed by one or more tax-exempt bonds that are part of the same issue after December 31, 2025 and provide financing for not less than 5% of the aggregate basis of the building and the land on which such building is located.

Section 45D:

The new markets tax credit under section 45D, which is a credit for certain investments in community development entities, is permanently extended. The limitation is USD5 billion per year. Excess limitation may be carried forward for five years. These changes begin in 2026.

Section 40A:

Section 40A provides a credit for certain biodiesel and biodiesel mixtures, as well as agri-biodiesel. The section 40A credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel used as fuel is extended and modified for small agri-biodiesel producers. The credit is increased from USD0.10 to USD0.20. The feedstocks for such agri-biodiesel must be exclusively produced in Canada, Mexico, or the United States. The changes allow both the section 45Z and the section 40A credit to be claimed for agri-biodiesel. The small agri-biodiesel producer credit is extended to apply to sale or use before January 1, 2027, whereas it had terminated after December 31, 2024. The Act allows this credit to be transferred, whereas before section 40A, credits were not included in transferability. These changes apply to fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025.

Observation:

The prohibitions on transferring credits to specified foreign entities apparently do not apply to credits under section 40A.

Expiration of other credits within a year or less

These credits include credits under sections 25C (energy efficient home credit, expiring for property placed in service after December 31, 2025), 25D (residential clean energy credit, expiring for expenditures made after December 31, 2025), and 45L (new energy efficient home credit, expiring for homes acquired after June 30, 2026). The Act also terminates the deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings under section 179D, effective for property, the construction of which begins after June 30, 2026. The Act prevents the advanced manufacturing credit under section 48C from continuing with respect to unused allocations, effective on July 4, 2025.

Observation:

The Act apparently contains a typo in the section 25C termination provision and amends section 25C(h) instead of the termination section in 25C(i), leaving the current termination section intact. Section 25C(h) generally provides that otherwise qualifying property placed in service after December 31, 2024 must be produced by ""qualified manufacturers,"" which must assign certain product identification numbers to the qualifying property, and that the taxpayer must include these product identification numbers on its tax return.

In this context, Mexico may become a critical point of entry for U.S. legacy automakers for a much larger strategic incursion.
Four Strategic Futures: Scenarios for 2035 Plotting EV adoption against Chinese market access yields four plausible future scenarios:","In 2014, China’s automotive industry was nearing a structural inflection point. Growth had slowed from an explosive 25% compound annual growth rate to a more GDP-aligned 6% range, while the product lifecycle (number of vehicles produced) and industry lifecycle (number of independent automakers) were beginning to decouple. As a result, overcapacity was rising—along with mounting pressure on margins and costs—and competitive dynamics were shifting.

At the same time, demand was differentiating between major metropolitan areas and smaller cities. In major cities, saturation and wealth effects led to slower growth and a shift toward premium and replacement vehicles. In contrast, smaller cities saw continued growth from first-time buyers. Regional fragmentation in consumer preferences, combined with a shift from compact cars to SUVs, suggested the need for dual business models and multi-brand portfolios. Success would require stronger regional marketing and sales capabilities.

As the market matured, profit pools began to shift. Used vehicles from larger cities started cannibalizing new vehicle demand in less-populated regions. The aftermarket was emerging as a critical source of profitability, though its most lucrative segments risked being captured by independent players and global suppliers. Increasingly, lease and finance products were becoming essential sales enablers, especially for younger consumers.

Altogether, the business model was evolving from a “hunter-gatherer” paradigm focused solely on new car sales to a “seed-harvest” model. In this new context, capabilities such as cross-selling, used vehicle management and aftermarket service and parts became essential. Retailers and dealers, in turn, would require far more robust OEM support.

Perhaps the most radical notion at the time was that some Chinese automakers could become global category killers following a five-stage process: gain domestic dominance, leverage cost advantages, drive innovation through relentless cost focus, expand internationally and move upmarket via R&D and strategic partnerships.

To many industry executives, this sounded fanciful. A decade later, it’s clear that’s exactly what has happened.

From Doubt to Dominance: The Rise of BYD

By 2025, several Chinese automakers, most notably BYD, have indeed emerged as formidable global competitors. Originally a battery maker, BYD has become the world’s leading EV manufacturer. A 2023 UBS teardown of the BYD Seal—a sleek, high-performance sedan - revealed not only a vehicle superior in build quality to its Western rivals but also up to 25% cheaper to produce.

BYD’s growing portfolio includes budget-friendly models such as the Seagull (under $12,000) and Dolphin, as well as larger electric SUVs like the Song and Tang. These models deliver a compelling mix of value, design and performance—qualities that are resonating well beyond China’s borders.

To support its global ambitions, BYD is aggressively localizing supply chains, manufacturing and talent. Its four existing overseas knock-down (KD) plants each exceed 40% localization rates. New facilities in India, Turkey and Mexico are expected to surpass that benchmark.

However, caveats remain. BYD’s core strengths—agility, vertical integration and risk tolerance—are deeply embedded in China’s business ecosystem. Whether these advantages will translate abroad remains uncertain. Challenges around brand management, regulatory hurdles and geopolitical tensions could all slow the company’s advance. And then there are questions regarding the firm’s financial health, including speculation that it might even become the next Evergrande. Still, the parallels with the rise of Japanese automakers in the 1980s are striking: a new competitor, operating on a different productivity frontier, is resetting global expectations.

Strategic Thresholds: Will the Threat Materialize?

Whether Chinese EV manufacturers represent an existential threat to U.S. legacy automakers hinges on two key variables: the pace of EV adoption in the U.S. and the degree of market access available to Chinese firms.

EV Uptake and the Adoption Chasm

The U.S. EV market is currently experiencing a familiar phenomenon in technology adoption: the “chasm” between early adopters and the early majority. Sales have slowed as the latter group—who prioritize cost, convenience and reliability—remains unconvinced. These adoption “saddles” are common, often lasting several years and delaying mass-market penetration. It remains to be seen whether EVs will fully replace internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, or whether the market will segment into a mix of powertrains based on region, duty cycle and use case.

Market Access: The New Gatekeeper

At the same time, Chinese automakers face significant headwinds in entering the U.S. market. From tariffs to national security concerns, the political environment is increasingly adversarial. Yet Chinese OEMs are not standing still. Mexico is emerging as a strategic beachhead.

By leveraging USMCA trade protections, Chinese automakers are building capacity in Mexico to potentially target underserved white space at the bottom end of the U.S. market, namely ICE passenger cars and trucks priced below $30,000. This strategy allows them to build local credibility, scale operations and establish cost advantages before launching a full EV offensive when market conditions permit.

In this context, Mexico may become a critical point of entry for U.S. legacy automakers for a much larger strategic incursion.

Dive Brief:

Panasonic Energy Co. has officially opened its lithium-ion battery factory for electric vehicles in De Soto, Kansas, and has started mass production of 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion cells at the plant, the company announced in a July 14 press release.

The company is targeting an annual production capacity of approximately 32 GWh in Kansas once the plant is fully operational. It will help Panasonic meet growing demand from its automotive customers in North America as they build more EVs.

The plant is Panasonic's second U.S. battery manufacturing facility and the two plants boost the company’s total EV battery U.S. production capacity to approximately 73 GWh a year. Panasonic’s other battery factory in Sparks, Nevada, began operation in 2017 and currently supplies cylindrical cells to Tesla.

Dive Insight:

Panasonic's Kansas battery plant spans roughly 300 acres and is the size of more than 225 American football fields, according to the release. The $4 billion battery production facility is the largest economic development project in Kansas state history and is expected to create up to 4,000 direct jobs and approximately 8,000 jobs in total, including those in supplier and related industries.

“The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” said Kazuo Tadanobu, CEO of Panasonic Energy, in the release. “This facility represents not only our commitment to the region but also a foundation for long-term collaboration and innovation in the U.S.”

Unlike Panasonic’s battery facility in Nevada that supplies cells exclusively to Tesla, the Kansas plant is “independent and designed to serve multiple customers,” a Panasonic spokesperson said in an email to Automotive Dive.

Panasonic says the project represents its long-term commitment of investing in and advancing the EV industry in North America. The company also plans to adopt a “dual-region model,” supplying batteries to global automakers from factories in Japan and North America.

The current generation of 2170 cylindrical cells Panasonic is manufacturing at its plant in Osaka, Japan, use advanced materials to improve battery performance by approximately 5%, according to the release. Panasonic plans to produce these same cells in Kansas. The company spokesperson said the 2170 cells manufactured in Kansas will be optimized to meet “the range, capacity, and demand of North American OEMs.”

Panasonic’s battery plant in Nevada is one of the largest lithium-ion battery manufacturing sites in North America in terms of output, according to the company. The plant employs over 4,000 people and has supplied over 11 billion cylindrical cells to date. Using its learning from operating the Nevada facility, Panasonic aims to achieve stable mass production in Kansas at an early stage, the release states.

Although some media outlets have reported this week that Panasonic is delaying battery production in Kansas due to falling EV demand, the company says it remains committed to the North American market and the future plans for the factory remain in place. A spokesperson said the company maintains “strong partnerships with a diverse range of automotive OEMs.”

“We have seen 11% growth in US electric vehicle sales in Q1 this year compared with last year,” a Panasonic spokesperson said in an email. “We're here for the long-term and are prepared to grow our production capacity in response to demand.”

Outside of Tesla, Panasonic’s battery customers include EV maker Lucid for the Air sedan and Gravity SUV models. The company is also collaborating with Subaru to supply batteries for its future EVs.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/NrJFN8FATy1wcipiIgVUIz9a6D3IrMa-xRb42U8UV78/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjUtMDctMTVfYXRfMy4xMC40OFBNLnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-17 11:35:53.199481

And that latter case and the EPA case are both currently being held in abeyance in the D.C.","Zach Pilchen: Welcome to another episode of Energized Exchange, a Holland & Knight podcast. I'm Zach Pilchen, senior counsel in our Washington, D.C., office, and today we're diving into the recent Supreme Court decision in Diamond Alternative Energy v. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This case has some interesting implications about Article III standing, particularly for companies that aren't directly regulated by government action, but nevertheless are affected by it, and also some practical implications for California's unique authority under the Clean Air Act. Joining me today are Brian Bunger, partner in our San Francisco office, and Rafe Petersen, partner in our Washington, D.C., office. Both of whom are in environmental law and are going to help us unpack this complex case. Brian, why don't we start with you? Can you give us a little background on what the California waiver is and what the context of this case arises in?

Brian Bunger: Sure, Zach. Good to be with you guys today, chatting through this case. This case that we'll talk about is a bit about Article III standing under the Constitution and how parties have access to the federal courts. But the background for the case is related to the California waiver, which people have been talking about for a variety of reasons recently. And the California waiver is a provision in the Clean Air Act that allows, uniquely California, to regulate motor vehicle emissions. For most states, the Clean Air Act preempts any sort of state action on motor vehicle admissions, but because when the Clean Air Act was originally written all the way back in 1967, California already had a fairly robust vehicle emission program in place. So the Clean Air Act carves out a waiver provision for California to regulate in this space. As long as California can show that it needs the regulations to meet its unique air quality problems, then EPA is not just authorized, but really mandated to grant a waiver to California for those provisions. Once California has adopted and had the waiver granted to it, then other states can follow suit — that's under Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act. The particular waiver at issue here relates to California's Advanced Clean Cars program, which was put in place many, many years ago now and has gone through a twisted path, which I think Zach is going to outline a bit for us. But in any event, what it did is mandated a certain level of greenhouse gas control on motor vehicle emissions, and so several challenges were mounted to that and this case arises out of those challenges.

Zach Pilchen: Thanks, Brian. As you indicate, the waiver at issue in Diamond Alternative Energy does have a bit of a ping-ponging history. The Obama Administration had initially granted California a waiver for that program that included the greenhouse gas standards, but then EPA under the first Trump Administration partially withdrew that waiver in 2019. There were a lot of questions about whether the withdrawal of that waiver was lawful and litigation that ultimately didn't go anywhere because, under the Biden Administration in 2022, EPA reinstated that waiver. So, fuel producers and several states challenged that 2022 reinstatement, giving rise to the instant case. And Brian, if you could tell us a little bit about Ohio v. EPA challenging that rule in the lower court, that would be very helpful.

Brian Bunger: Thanks, Zach. So in Ohio v. EPA, which is the D.C. Circuit case at issue, there were a number of petitioners. Chief among them were a set of private party petitioners that challenged the waiver on the ground that it improperly made it more difficult for them to sell liquid fuels into the market because the mix of vehicles would change such that there would be more electric vehicles mandated over the course of time. And then there was a set of state petitioners as well, which challenged the waiver on constitutional grounds. So the state petitioners articulated a claim that under the equal sovereigns doctrine that had been set forth by the Supreme Court, allowing one state to regulate in this space would abrogate their rights as states to regulate the way they saw fit. And so the D.C. Circuit decision that underlies Diamond Alternative Energy actually decided that the states had standing to assert that claim and then found no merit in the claim. But on the private party side, the D.C. Circuit decision was that the parties did not have standing, and that was essentially based on the fact that they are not directly regulated by the underlying rule for which the waiver was granted. So the underlying rule directly regulates only the motor vehicle manufacturers who produce the vehicles that are subject to it. But the fuel producers, of course, are impacted by that. But the D.C. Circuit's view was that they hadn't sufficiently demonstrated that if they set aside the waiver, that the fuel producers' economic injuries would be redressed. Before we get into more details on the decisions, Rafe, could you give us an overview of the standing doctrines?

Rafe Petersen: So that leads really to the question of what is standing, and what standing is, in essence, it's the right to sue. While many entities may be upset about how they're regulated or the effects of regulation, it doesn't necessarily mean they get into courts. And Article III of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to cases or controversies. And what that requires then is a prospective plaintiff to demonstrate standing by showing three elements: they have to show injury in fact, causation and redressability. And many courts in the D.C. Circuit in particular, where a lot of federal litigation takes place, particularly litigation regarding Clean Air Act and over federal action, requires it to be shown at the earliest possible time. And they also require it for interveners. So unlike other circuits, to intervene in an existing case, you first have to also, again, prove injury in fact, causation and redressability. So what is injury? Injury requires a concrete, particularized injury that's actual or imminent. So essentially a party wishing to sue has to show that they have some sort of — sometimes it'll be a legal right that is going to get affected, other times they're going to say that the injury is going be to something that they, maybe it's like an economic injury — but they have to prove that this injury is concrete and particularize it happens to them. To show causation they actually have to show that the injury is caused by the defendant. So not necessarily a third party — we'll get into that — but by the defendant, by the underlying action that they're challenging. And finally, redressability requires demonstrating that judicial relief would redress their injury. You have to show that, hey, if I won this case, the court would do something that would alleviate the concrete and particularized injury to me. The focus is on the relief the court can grant. So the tricky one, and that's how this case kind of evolved, is when a plaintiff is not the direct object of the government regulation. Causation and redressability often depend on how third parties, not before the court, will respond to the regulations of judicial relief. So as Brian mentioned, California intervened in this case, and they immediately challenged the standing of the fuel producers. And to establish the standing the fuel producers produced 14 declarations and devoted a couple pages of their briefs to standing, and they argued that the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel will be depressed by California's regulations because they require the sale of vehicles that use less gasoline and diesel fuel, or use no diesel fuel or liquid fuel at all. The D.C. court explained that the redressability depends on how third-party automakers would act in the absence of these fleet-wide emission standards. They said the fuel producers failed to cite any record evidence or file any additional affidavits demonstrating that automakers will respond in the way in which they said they would. So that's how we got up to the Supreme Court.

Brian Bunger: Yeah, which brings us to the decision in Diamond Alternative Energy. So, in a 7-2 opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit ruling on redressability and held that petitioners had, quote, ""readily established standing,"" end quote, by reference to, quote, ""common-sense economic principles,"" end quote. So specifically, the court found that the California rules forced automakers to produce a fleet of vehicles that would use significantly less gasoline and other liquid fuels. In fact, that was the point of the regulations. And accordingly, the court held that the rule would cause quote, ""predictable injuries,"" and I think we're going to see over time how these concepts develop. But those injuries on the fuel producers could be fairly expected based on eliminating this liquid fuel vehicle fleet or limiting the amount of liquid fuel vehicles that would be sold, and therefore a ruling striking the waiver would redress those injuries. The court pointed to a number of pieces of record evidence to substantiate that analysis, including declarations that prior California rules had substantially harmed fuel producers, statements from EPA in California that the rule would likely decrease fuel use and affidavits from automakers who intervened in support of the rule, on the grounds that it ensured a level playing field, presumably because otherwise, competitors would produce fewer electric vehicles. The Supreme Court also emphasized that the fuel producers did not have to produce expert economic evidence on market behavior if, as was the case here, they can simply show a predictable chain of events between judicial relief and redress of their injuries. So one of the interesting aspects of this case is that ordinarily standing cases seem to be narrowing availability of federal courts, and this decision feels a bit like it's expanding it slightly. And I'm curious, Zach and Rafe, how you perceive that.

Zach Pilchen: Yeah, I mean, on injury, it's kind of been a long-established thing. There are all types of injuries that people can experience that are cognizable. Some of them are very concrete — you're literally physically injured by something — or in economic terms — as the opinion says, $1 of harm is an injury. And there are others that are more abstract: things that you take in response to risks or aesthetic injuries, things that just kind of cause you to potentially voluntarily change your behavior. Now, those often come up in environmental cases, but even though those can be quite complicated and seem to be somewhat falling out of favor, I would say, it's just interesting that $1 is enough to get into court. And that certainly makes the causation and redressability argument a little easier if you can show that you will be $1 better off if the case goes your way. And that really does, I think, make this a much different playing field for companies alleging economic harms than it does for individuals alleging environmental harms, for example.

Rafe Petersen: And like you were saying, it cuts against, a little bit, some of the court's more recent jurisprudence on standing. And it may be because they're sort of expanding almost, we'll call it economic standing, but for a circuit like the D.C. Circuit, I think this has pretty big implications because that's often the centerpiece of where a lot of federal litigation takes place. And I think by expanding the number of parties who can get into the courts, in a court that in a lot ways is at least close to overwhelmed, it's going to be interesting what this does simply to their docket. And we have an interesting period of time where we have differences, really big differences, of opinions depending on who's currently running the executive branch. And you have this really big swing, almost 180 degrees, of different interpretations of our statutes, and now you're introducing into this, expanding the number of types of parties who can sue. I'm wondering if it's going to be a little overwhelming for the courts to have to deal with the pure volume of litigation. The D.C. Circuit has always . . . they really police their docket pretty tightly and, you know, the joke is that you round up the usual suspects before you get to sue in the D.C. Circuit. You're usually challenged by standing, ripeness, mootness and all these other jurisdictional hurdles. And this takes away one pretty big jurisdictional hurdle for some parties, and it's going to be interesting. Especially now where it appears we're going to get a lot more litigation challenging the current administration — is this going to result in a floodgate of litigation? It's possible because this can be used by parties who both favor and then don't favor what the current administration is doing. So stay tuned, it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.

Zach Pilchen: Yeah, I mean, one thing I was wondering on that point, Rafe and Brian, I don't know if you have any thoughts on this, is, on the other hand, this seems like a kind of unusual circumstance where this is a rule that is most plainly directly regulating automakers. Although I think the court in the majority opinion leaves open that perhaps the fuel producers might be, kind of an object of the regulation, even if they're not directly regulated. But I mean, how often do you have a situation like this, where there's a rule that's very heavily controversial and it's challenged by people who are not actually the directly regulated entities? I mean if automakers had been — any single automaker — had been in this case, it feels like the outcome might have been much different.

Brian Bunger: Well, it certainly would have felt more obvious, because that would have been the directly regulated party and, at least in theory, the idea would have been that redressability and injury and that sort of thing were fairly obvious. But this case feels a little bit odd in the long history of jurisprudence, right. I think we've all understood over time that the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. And one of the ways that's always been managed is through the standing doctrines. And in this particular instance, it feels like there's a bit of an expansion, at least in this economic injury domain. Now I wonder whether it will apply as evenly across other plaintiff classes. So for example, if there is some change in how Medicaid or Medicare is administrated, the people who receive it are not the recipients of the regulation, they might ultimately be the target in the same sense that the fuel producers were, but those regulations really apply to the providers. Would they then have standing to challenge those changes? I wonder. That's sort of the type of situation I'm thinking of where there's a third party who's directly impacted, but not directly regulated. I wonder where that goes.

Rafe Petersen: Yeah. And does that expand beyond non-economic harm? Will the court extend this approach to non-economic injuries as well, or is this just unique to economic injuries? And depending on that, that would be, to me, a pretty big sea change in terms of how this court has been looking at standing. And so yeah, this may be a one-off or this may be the beginning of a trend. We'll have to see how the circuits run with it. You know, now you have, for example, the D.C. Circuit and the Ninth Circuit who have different views of the extent of standing, and how those two circuits are going to run with it would be very interesting.

Zach Pilchen: Well, that leads into the dissents and, you know, the dissents are the dissents. There's a dissent from Justice Sotomayor and also a dissent from Justice Jackson. And the Justice Jackson dissent, at least, gets into some of that concept, Rafe, in terms of is this a rule that is just for economic injury and highlighting a number of cases from the Supreme Court's standing precedents that seem to have pretty significant, what we would call colloquially, harms, injuries, but that have not been, where causation and redressability have not been treated as generously perhaps as the economic harms here. Also, I'll just note that Justice Sotomayor has a dissent that's very short and just points out that the D.C. Circuit made an error in its decision, an error that EPA admits at the Supreme Court level, which is that they thought that these California standards would not persist beyond 2025. And she suggests that there should have just been a remand to the D.C. Circuit because that misconception was a critical part of the D.C. Circuit's opinion saying how can you predict what an automaker would do? We're almost at the end of this program and 2025, time has basically run out, when in fact that was a mistake. But I don't know if either of you had any thoughts about the dissents.

Brian Bunger: Well, I agree with you that Justice Jackson's dissent gets into the issues we were just talking about in terms of where does this doctrine end or where does it go from here. Is it really just about business litigants and economic injuries, or is it about any litigant with economic or perhaps other injuries, third-party standing issues? It's an interesting dissent, I think it opens the door to more questions than answers, obviously. The Sotomayor dissent is also interesting in that the view there was, look, we should be careful when we grant certiorari, and this case just didn't warrant it. We had a mistake at the circuit level and we should simply have returned it to them to deal with that first. So, it looks like the court taking a case that at least some of the members of the court didn't feel was necessary to take, and one wonders what that represents for the future as well.

Zach Pilchen: Well, looking forward, there are going to be implications from this case as precedent, but also there are really direct implications from this case for the future of the underlying litigation and California's waiver, which has experienced some unprecedented congressional attention recently, the Trump Administration saying that they are going to reconsider the reinstatement of the withdrawn original waiver, if that's not too many double negatives for you. Any thoughts on what this means for the next steps in Ohio v. EPA in the immediate term and beyond?

Brian Bunger: Yeah, that's a great question, Zach. So as I mentioned earlier on in Ohio v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit said that the states had standing and then went on to actually address the merits of their arguments and found against them, and the states sought review, but that was not granted. So that piece, I believe, is at least law of the case, if not law of the circuit now. The private party claims have not actually been litigated on the merits yet because of the standing decision. So the case went back to the circuit last week, end of last week, and we'll have to see what additional proceedings happen there. There's actually two other cases pending in the D.C. Circuit that are somewhat related. So, in addition to the Advanced Clean Cars program, EPA itself had adopted a set of greenhouse gas emission standards. And those were challenged in a case that styled Texas v. EPA, which is D.C. Circuit case number 22-1031. And then a follow-on California regulation called the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation, which took the Advanced Clean Cars regulation a step further, has also been challenged. There's also a challenge to the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which was the application of similar standards to heavy- and medium-duty trucks. And that latter case and the EPA case are both currently being held in abeyance in the D.C. Circuit pending the outcome of Ohio v. EPA. And when originally the D.C. Circuit opinion came down in Ohio, in Texas v. EPA, the court ordered additional briefing on the standing question, and that briefing was filed. Subsequently, cert (certiorari) was granted for Diamond Alternative Energy. And so the question now is, what does the court do with the merits of those claims being brought by the fuel producers and others? So we'll have to see how that plays out. But the story is not yet done in the D.C. Circuit with those pending cases. And of course, there's the additional complexity, which you mentioned, which is that Congress has acted to revoke the waivers under the Congressional Review Act, and that is itself subject to litigation. So there is a number of parts in motion right now. We'll have to see how this all fits together in the end.

Zach Pilchen: Well, this has been a fascinating discussion about a case that touches on these constitutional issues, environmental legal issues and judicial access. And I just want to thank you, Brian and Rafe, for joining me today and talking through it. And we'll just have to keep watching this space as things further develop.",https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/images/twittercards/hk_opengraph.png?rev=ec0d75523b1f4e68920e3e1b42304866&sc_lang=en&hash=3345DDE33F8D43A99B42BABA11D22AF8,N,,2025-07-17 10:15:17.622156

US President Donald Trump said that tariffs for around 150 countries would be about 15% — lower than some experts feared. Trump has also toned down anti-China rhetoric in order to secure a trade deal and a summit with the country’s leader, Bloomberg reported.

Yet trade barriers are going up elsewhere: Canada announced new steel tariffs, and France is reportedly gaining support within the European Union for a harder line against pressure from Washington. And despite the cooling of tensions, Goldman Sachs now projects the US’ effective tariff rate will peak even higher than the bank previously thought.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled the EU’s biggest-ever budget, but a chaotic rollout and opposition from key players underlined weaknesses in her leadership.

Von der Leyen — who last week stared down a no-confidence motion — outlined €1.98 trillion in spending, including €451 billion to strengthen European industry. But Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, rejected the package as too large, and other parties raised separate concerns: The Commission’s proposal will go through protracted negotiations before it is ultimately finalized.

Troublingly for von der Leyen, senior officials complained they were kept in the dark about the spending plans, and criticized its announcement as haphazard. “You cannot imagine what a clusterf*ck it was,” one official told the Financial Times.

The Chinese yuan is increasingly being used in developing nations in Asia and Africa, a success for Beijing in its efforts to combat the ubiquity of the dollar.

The head of China’s central bank last month outlined his desire for a multipolar global currency order, and new data suggests that — despite the greenback’s global dominance — those hopes are, slowly becoming reality:

The share of dollar-denominated loans in emerging Asian economies declined 16% between the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2024, Nikkei reported, largely due to Chinese banks pivoting to yuan-based lending, while the South China Morning Post noted that an increasing number of African countries have signed up to use the currency for trade and investment.

The share of US adults who want lower immigration fell for the first time in four years, new research found.

The percentage saying immigration is good for the country also reached a record 79%, according to Gallup. The figures may be driven by a decline in illegal crossings at the US southern border — now at their lowest level in decades — which Axios said may be down to President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies.

Even so, Trump is not seeing major boosts to his poll ratings: Gallup found that most people disapprove of his handling of immigration, with just 35% approving.

The US reportedly denied South Africa’s envoy to Washington a visa, the latest sign of their increasingly frosty relationship.

The apparent rejection — which was not immediately confirmed — came as a South African industry body warned the country faced a “serious threat” as a result of American tariff threats and aid cuts: US President Donald Trump has accused Pretoria of allegedly discriminating against white people as well as siding with US rivals including Russia and Iran.

Some analysts think the relationship is now beyond repair: “I cannot see how the differences can be resolved,” an expert told the BBC. “South Africa will just have to carry on, and strengthen ties with other countries.”

Britain’s government said it would lower the country’s voting age to 16 before the next general election in a bid to increase democratic participation.

The proposal to allow 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote in general elections represents the biggest change to the electorate since the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969. The reform was part of a broader package that also includes relaxed voter registration rules and measures to crack down on foreign interference.

The move to extend the franchise was part of the governing Labour Party’s manifesto: Labour argued that the change would bring greater fairness to 16- and 17-year-olds, many of whom already work and are eligible to serve in the military.

The US resumed deportation flights to so-called “third countries” after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the controversial practice.

Five migrants from five different countries were flown on Tuesday to the small Southern African nation of Eswatini. The Donald Trump administration has previously sent deportees to El Salvador and South Sudan as part of its intensifying immigration crackdown, drawing scrutiny and legal challenges.

It’s not unheard of for governments to deport people to countries they aren’t from: Australia sends asylum seekers to offshore processing facilities in Pacific island nations, and the UK’s previous government struck a similar deal with Rwanda. But that plan cost more than $900 million, and only a total of four migrants were transferred.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang heaped praise on China’s technological advancements during a visit to Beijing on Wednesday, but treaded carefully when discussing geopolitics.

The head of the world’s most valuable company received a rockstar reception on the trip, which came a day after the US allowed Nvidia to resume selling one of its high-powered chips to China. But Huang downplayed his role in lobbying US President Donald Trump to green light the sales, and distanced himself from recent Chinese export controls, The New York Times reported.

Even as Huang notches this win, the constantly shifting geopolitical winds mean Nvidia could again find itself weaponized in future US-China spats, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

US President Donald Trump said he wasn’t planning to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after reports of an imminent termination triggered market turmoil.

Stocks plunged, Treasury bonds sold off, and the dollar weakened following reports that Trump drafted a letter to fire Powell and asked Republican lawmakers for their opinion — the market reaction was “presumably the exact opposite of what Trump is hoping for economically,” Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal said.

Trump later said a removal is “highly unlikely,” though he renewed his criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates.

Wall Street stabilized, but the swings showed how any attempt to fire Powell could trigger “revolt in global markets, including a possible collapse in the dollar and US bonds,” CNN wrote.

The Syrian government and leaders in the Druze religious minority announced a renewed ceasefire Wednesday after days of clashes that drew in Israel.

The announcement came shortly after Israel launched air attacks on the Syrian Defense Ministry and areas near the presidential palace, while continuing strikes on Syrian forces in the southern city of Suwayda.

More than 250 people died this week after clashes broke out on Sunday between Bedouin tribespeople and Druze militias. The violence has drawn in both the security forces of the new Syrian government and Israel, which warned Damascus that it would not tolerate harm to the Druze — many of whom live in Israel.

Syria’s new leaders have attempted to assert control over the country following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in December, but deep sectarian divisions remain.

A Chinese artificial intelligence startup released an open-source language model that challenges top US chatbots’ performance at a fraction of the cost.

The release of Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2 shows that the “DeepSeek moment” — in which another cheaply trained Chinese model challenged Western market leaders — of January was not a one-off, Interconnects.ai argued: China is nearing “the absolute frontier” of performance.

The tech writer Azeem Azhar agreed, saying this is the model that should worry Silicon Valley. If DeepSeek represented the AI race’s “Sputnik moment,” shattering “Western assumptions of technological primacy,” he wrote, Kimi K2 is the equivalent of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man in space four years later, proving that the first event was no fluke.

The world’s first “three-parent babies” are living healthy lives, a landmark study found, potentially meaning an end to mothers passing some rare — but often fatal — diseases to their children.

Human cells are powered by tiny components called mitochondria, which have their own DNA, but when that is faulty, it can cause debilitating diseases.

Britain in 2015 began allowing mitochondrial donation, resulting in a pioneering IVF treatment whereby a couple’s genes are removed from a fertilized egg, leaving the defective DNA behind, and then injected into the egg of a healthy woman. Eight children have been born using the technique, and all are developing normally, although three had detectable levels of diseased mitochondria.

US President Donald Trump once again threatened new tariffs — this time on pharmaceuticals and chips — as a spiraling trade war drives huge global instability.

The latest levies would come on top of duties on cars, steel, and aluminum, as well as universal tariffs on all countries’ exports to the US, and could take effect on Aug. 1. ASML, the world’s only manufacturer of cutting-edge chipmaking equipment, said geopolitical uncertainty meant it could not confirm its 2026 earnings forecast, while China’s top trade official warned the world was experiencing “turbulence and transformation.”

The impact of the tariffs on economic growth, and unpredictable American trade policy more generally, will hurt households worldwide, the Bank of England’s governor warned.

French Prime Minister François Bayrou proposed axing two public holidays as part of €44 billion in cuts in order to bridge the country’s gaping budget deficit.

Though the additional working days garnered attention abroad, playing into clichés about French labor culture, Bayrou also wants to freeze increases to benefits and pensions, raise taxes on the wealthy, and reduce health care subsidies — a combination described by Le Monde as “bitter potion.”

The cuts speak to the scale of the fiscal crisis facing France, which has the widest deficit in the eurozone, but they may be politically costly: Nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, whose party tops opinion polls, threatened to oust Bayrou’s minority government with a no-confidence motion unless he backs down.

Mexico’s president said Washington had to do more to stop drug traffickers on US territory as well as to halt the flow of weapons across the border.

Claudia Sheinbaum’s comments came after US President Donald Trump threatened Mexico with 30% tariffs over the country’s inability or unwillingness to curb the production and trade of fentanyl.

Mexican officials have long argued that cracking down on domestic crime would be easier if the US stopped gunmakers from trafficking firearms to their country: Around 74% of Mexico’s illegal guns come from the US. However Washington has rejected restricting gun sales in border cities. “If [Trump] really wants to eliminate the cartels, he should focus on the flow of arms,” an expert told El País.

The UK secretly brought thousands of Afghan citizens to Britain after their details were accidentally leaked.

Following the Western withdrawal in 2021, London set up clandestine programs to help Afghans who assisted allied forces during the war to leave the country, fearing they or their families would be targeted by the Taliban. But in 2022, a spreadsheet of 18,700 applicants’ names was put on Facebook. The UK government obtained a controversial legal ban on reporting on the issue, and has spent billions relocating nearly 7,000 people.

Interpreters, fixers, and other Afghans who worked with Western forces during the 20-year conflict were deemed “conspirators” by the Taliban, Al Jazeera reported in 2021: Many have been killed, detained, or tortured.

US President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he had threatened with 32% duties starting Aug. 1.

Southeast Asia’s largest economy will face a 19% tariff per the pact, while US exports to Indonesia won’t be taxed, according to the White House.

Trump said he negotiated directly with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who has recently been on something of a diplomatic blitz: He attended France’s Bastille Day parade Monday, heralding closer ties with Paris, and he has deepened economic investments in the Gulf.

However, underneath the “whirlwind of international activity,” Prabowo’s foreign policy lacks substance and he “has yet to articulate what Indonesia stands for in global affairs,” East Asia Forum argued last month.

US inflation rose to its highest level in four months in June, suggesting that the effects of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are starting to show up in prices.

According to Labor Department statistics released Tuesday, the consumer price index increased by 0.3% for the month, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.7%.

So far, the levies have had a limited impact on inflation — a point Trump has repeatedly used to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates — partly due to declines in both new and used vehicle prices, travel costs, as well as businesses stockpiling goods before tariffs took effect.

Still, with higher tariffs set to take effect in August, economists said the June inflation data isn’t enough to prompt the Fed to cut rates early.","https://img.semafor.com/72759f18f51b86061d1f56fa62de7db14d14df9b-4455x2970.jpg?rect=0,316,4455,2339&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-07-17 10:14:47.230987

“We're transforming how to use energy resources to create value,” Monteith added. “And we're doing it in a way that aligns with infrastructure funding, clean air goals, and decentralized energy strategies.”

The MOU is effective for 120 days and is expected to result in a definitive Energy Purchase and Sales Agreement (EPSA) upon commencement of site development.

About AGYP:

Allied Energy Corp. is an energy development and production company acquiring oil & gas reserves in some of the most prolific hydrocarbon bearing regions of the United States. The Company specializes in the business of reworking & re-completing 'existing' oil & gas wells located in the thousands of mature oil & gas producing fields across the United States. The Company applies its knowledge, experience, and effective well-remediation technologies to achieve higher production volumes, longer well life, and more efficient recovery of the proven and available oil and gas reserves in the fields/projects in which it has acquired an ownership interest. The Company will utilize updated technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (""fracking""), drilling of lateral (""horizontal"") legs in productive zones, and utilizing new cased hole electric logging to locate bypassed pays, all to enhance daily rates and oil & gas recoveries. By acquiring interests in a growing number of selected projects in various regions, Allied Energy Corp. is diversifying its exposure and effectively minimizing risk as it pursues corporate growth, top line & bottom-line revenues to the benefit of all stakeholders. There are proven, recoverable reserves contained in the many aging oil & gas fields that have been bypassed by companies moving away from these fields in search of deeper, more plentiful, but more costly reserves. The Company plans to concentrate on bypassed oil and gas as there is less competition and, as mentioned above, the costs are considerably less. Additionally, the company will acquire interests in marginal wells that can be acquired at minimal cost, of which there are 420,000 wells in the U.S. Quoting Barry Russell, President of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (""IPAA"") - ""With approximately 20 percent of American oil production and 10 percent of American natural gas production coming from marginal wells, they are America's true strategic petroleum reserve.”

GM batteries can play an integral role.","General Motors and circular economy-focused battery materials provide Redwood Materials announced the launch of a new agreement, aimed at accelerating the deployment of energy storage systems based on both second-life battery packs from GM electric vehicles and new batteries produced by GM.

Energy storage forms one of the key building blocks for the rapidly expanding clean energy transition, given the intermittent generating nature of many sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and the need to satisfy round-the-clock energy demand, while ensuring that energy is not wasted, particularly as demand on the grid grows from areas such as transport electrification and AI computing.

According to the companies, the new agreement comes as U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by data centers, which are expected to nearly triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028, creating a need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

Founded in 2017 by Tesla co-founder and former CTO JB Straubel, Nevada-based Redwood collects, recycles, refines and remanufactures battery materials, with a focus on creating a closed-loop domestic supply chain for batteries. The company has two battery materials campuses in the U.S., including one in Northern Nevada, and another under development in South Carolina, and has set a goal to produce 100 GWh of battery materials annually.

The new agreement follows the recent launch by the company of Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications.

Straubel said:

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry. Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

GM said that the new collaboration will mark a significant step towards expanding its battery technology beyond EVs.

Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, said:

“Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role.

Dive Brief:

Ultium Cells, the electric vehicle battery joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its battery cell manufacturing facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to add production of lower-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, the company announced in a July 14 press release.

The plans are part of a $2.3 billion investment in the plant that was announced in 2021 to produce nickel cobalt manganese aluminum (NCMA) pouch cells and LFP cells at the same facility. The conversion of existing production lines will begin later this year, with commercial production of LFP cells expected to begin in late 2027.

“The upgrade reflects the continued strength of our partnership with General Motors and our shared commitment to advancing EV battery innovation,” said Wonjoon Suh, executive VP and head of the Advanced Automotive Battery division at LG Energy Solution, in the release.

Dive Insight:

Introducing low-cost LFP battery chemistry into its growing lineup can help GM improve margins on its EVs, as well as reduce their costs for buyers. The higher costs of EVs using existing battery chemistries may deter shoppers and impact adoption in the U.S. now that the Federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is slated to end on Sept. 30. The elimination of the credit is included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law on July 4.

GM currently uses more expensive nickel manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) batteries for its EVs.

The cost-effectiveness of LFP batteries compared to NCMA or nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) types is due to the use of less expensive raw materials, including cobalt and nickel. Instead, LFP batteries use a higher amount of cheap and abundant iron and phosphate. LFP batteries contain virtually no cobalt and perform better than other cell chemistries in high temperatures, making them more resistant to cell degradation and fire for greater safety.

“At GM, we’re innovating battery technology to deliver the best mix of range, performance, and affordability to our EV customers,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, in the release. “This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio.""

LFP batteries also have a significantly longer cycle life and can endure more charge-discharge cycles before degrading, translating into a longer service life.

In addition, LPF batteries can be fully charged to 100% without accelerating cell degradation compared to NMC batteries. This is among the reasons why many OEMs recommend charging EVs to just 80% to extend battery service life. However, the tradeoff is that drivers do not receive the vehicle’s full EPA-estimated range.

One of the drawbacks of LFP batteries however, is their lower energy density compared to NMC and NCA chemistries, according to Quantumscape. An automaker must use more LFP cells to achieve EV range targets that buyers now expect. Although the use of additional cells and a larger battery pack may improve range, it also increases vehicle weight and can potentially reduce an EVs interior space.

In addition to Ultium Cells adding LFP cell production in Tennessee, GM and LG Energy announced in May the development of an improved lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cell design for the automaker’s future electric vehicles. The LMR battery chemistry uses a higher percentage of lower-cost manganese to replace cobalt, while still delivering high energy density, according to GM.

For decades, the nation’s per capita energy usage remained largely stagnant, creating a false sense of security while other global powers, like China, dramatically scaled their energy consumption. Now, the accelerating pace of technological innovation has thrust the grid into an urgent spotlight, revealing its profound inadequacy.

David Ulevitch, Erin Price-Wright, and Ryan McEntush, general and investing partners from a16z’s American Dynamism team, recently spoke with Erik Torenberg on the a16z podcast about America’s faltering energy grid and the urgent need for its comprehensive modernization. Their discussion highlighted how a confluence of historical underinvestment, complex regulatory hurdles, and a diminishing workforce has left the nation unprepared for the immense electrical demands now emerging. “We’re not building enough electricity generation, we’re not building enough transmission, and we’re not building enough distribution,” Ulevitch articulated, summarizing the systemic failure to expand capacity.

A core insight from the conversation is that the current grid’s centralized, top-down architecture is ill-suited for the dynamic, distributed energy future. While traditional power plants remain vital, the integration of new technologies like large-scale batteries, advanced solar installations, and next-generation nuclear reactors is paramount. The discussion underscored the potential of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which Ulevitch noted are “so much safer, they’re so much cheaper, they’re so much faster to deploy” compared to conventional nuclear facilities, offering a promising path for reliable, carbon-free baseload power.

The sheer scale of demand from AI data centers alone presents an unprecedented challenge. Ryan McEntush emphasized this point, stating, “The demand for power for AI is immense. It’s truly immense.”

However, the path to a resilient, dynamic grid is fraught with significant non-technical obstacles. A critical analysis revealed that America has, in essence, “forgotten how to build,” as Erin Price-Wright succinctly put it. This sentiment encapsulates the bureaucratic inertia, permitting bottlenecks, and a dwindling skilled labor force that impede the rapid deployment of essential infrastructure projects. Overcoming these policy and workforce deficits is as crucial as technological innovation itself. It will require streamlined permitting, robust investment in vocational training, and a national commitment to prioritize energy independence and resilience.

The experts concluded that the future of the American energy grid hinges on a multi-pronged approach: leveraging diverse energy sources, embracing decentralization, and, crucially, deploying advanced software for intelligent grid management. The conversation underscored that without a significant paradigm shift in how energy infrastructure is conceived, approved, and constructed, the nation risks not only power outages but also a severe bottleneck to its technological and economic ambitions.",https://www.startuphub.ai/wp-content/uploads/maxresdefault-165.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:45:28.904750

CORAL GABLES, FL, UNITED STATES, July 16, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Utilities in the United States are under unprecedented pressure to modernize. Aging infrastructure, rising customer expectations, extreme climate events, and increasingly complex regulatory mandates are reshaping the industry’s priorities. In this high-stakes environment, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer optional—it's a critical enabler that utilities must develop and fully integrate into their strategic plans.

• Urgent and Systemic Challenges Facing U.S. Utilities

• The sector is confronting systemic, urgent, and capital-intensive issues:

• $1.3 trillion in infrastructure investments are required to modernize aging electricity, water, and gas systems (ASCE, 2024).

• Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) remain below 720 on a 1,000-point scale (J.D. Power), driven by increasing demand for real-time, digital, and transparent services.

• Extreme weather events led to a 25% increase in power outages in 2023 compared to the previous year (U.S. Department of Energy), underscoring the urgent need for enhanced grid resilience.

• Decarbonization pressures continue to mount as utilities race to meet net-zero targets by 2040–2050 while scaling EV infrastructure, renewable generation, and distributed energy resources (DERs).

In this context, AI cannot be treated as an isolated experiment—it must become a fully integrated engine of transformation.

With the right leadership, strategy, and digital foundation, utilities can leverage AI to optimize both customer-facing and back-office operations, delivering resilience, agility, and scalable value.

Energy America, a U.S.-based solar panel and energy storage manufacturer and project developer, today issued a statement reaffirming its full compliance with the recently enacted Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules under the U.S. clean energy tax credit regime. In response to new federal requirements that bar renewable energy projects from involving certain foreign-controlled firms or components, Energy America confirms that it has proactively aligned its operations and supply chain to meet and exceed these standards. The company emphasizes that all current and future projects are free of any “prohibited foreign entity” influence or content, ensuring eligibility for federal tax incentives under the updated rules.

Proactive Compliance & Sourcing Strategy

Energy America has implemented rigorous due diligence and auditing across its ownership structure and suppliers to uphold FEOC compliance. Under the new guidelines – which echo CHIPS Act security standards – no clean energy tax credits can be claimed if a project is owned by or receives significant inputs from a designated foreign entity of concern. Anticipating this, Energy America long ago established strict supplier vetting procedures, requiring certifications that no components or materials originate from any banned foreign-owned manufacturers. These measures include comprehensive supplier certifications and ownership reviews to ensure no involvement of entities from “covered” nations (e.g. China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) in our projects. By strengthening its supply chain oversight, Energy America guarantees that every solar module, battery, and subcomponent it uses is fully compliant with the FEOC rules.

“Energy America fully supports the government’s efforts to secure America’s clean energy future. We have left nothing to chance – our supply chain is 100% aligned with these new FEOC requirements,” said Zoheb Khan, Vice President of Energy America. “By building a solar and storage supply network free of foreign entities of concern, we provide our partners and investors absolute confidence that our projects will qualify for all incentives and remain secure long-term. Supporting domestic manufacturing isn’t just good business – it’s the right thing to do for U.S. energy independence and national security.”

Strategic Partnerships Ensuring FEOC-Free Components

In bolstering its FEOC-compliant supply chain, Energy America has forged new strategic partnerships and sourcing agreements that eliminate any reliance on foreign entities of concern in critical components like solar panels and batteries. For example, in 2024 Energy America partnered with a German solar technology firm to integrate next-generation perovskite solar cells into its product line – a collaboration that leverages allied-nation innovation while avoiding any supply risk from unapproved sources. The company has also committed to sourcing 100% of its battery storage components from U.S. or allied manufacturers, thereby steering clear of battery producers linked to prohibited foreign entities. These partnerships with North American and European suppliers ensure that every solar module and battery pack in Energy America’s projects is manufactured by approved, trusted companies, independent of any Chinese or other FEOC-linked inputs.

As a result of these realignments, Energy America’s projects already surpass the strict Material Assistance Cost Ratio (MACR) thresholds being phased in by regulators. (The MACR represents the percentage of a project’s component value coming from non-FEOC sources.) Current Energy America solar installations easily meet the 40%+ non-FEOC content requirement for projects starting construction in 2026, and the company is on track to exceed the higher benchmarks (rising to 60% non-FEOC content for projects by 2030) set by the new rules. Likewise, the company’s energy storage solutions already incorporate well above the 55% U.S./allied content required for batteries in 2026, positioning them ahead of the mandate to reach 75% by 2030. Even at the individual component level – such as solar panels, which must be at least 50% U.S. or allied-made in 2026 and 85% by 2030 – Energy America far exceeds compliance, using solar modules proudly made in the USA for its projects. By proactively exceeding these MACR thresholds across the board, Energy America not only ensures eligibility for Investment Tax Credits and Production Tax Credits but also demonstrates industry leadership in weaning the renewables supply chain off adversarial dependence.

Leading the Nation in Secure, U.S.-Driven Solar Projects

Through these compliance efforts and strategic alliances, Energy America has solidified its position as a national leader in delivering secure, U.S.-driven solar energy projects. All of the company’s solar farms and battery installations are built with domestic or allied-nation components, reinforcing the resiliency and security of America’s clean energy infrastructure. Energy America’s products are proudly made in the USA, and its project pipeline – spanning residential, commercial, and utility-scale solar – reflects unparalleled commitment to U.S. manufacturing. By actively supporting American and friendly-nation suppliers, the company is helping to cultivate a robust domestic clean energy supply chain that aligns with federal policy goals and strengthens national energy independence.

Energy America’s leadership in this new era is evident in its growing portfolio of compliant projects across the country. The company is currently developing and constructing hundreds of megawatts of solar capacity using U.S.-made panels and approved components, ensuring these projects are not only clean and cost-effective, but also free from geopolitical supply risks. This approach directly answers the call from regulators for an industry shift towards secure sourcing and demonstrates what U.S.-driven renewable development can achieve. Energy America’s example shows that meeting the FEOC rules is not an obstacle, but rather an opportunity – an opportunity to invest in domestic innovation, create American jobs, and deliver clean power with confidence in its long-term reliability.

Trusted Partner for Developers, Manufacturers, and Investors

With its end-to-end compliance and transparent sourcing, Energy America has become a trusted choice for project developers, equipment manufacturers, and tax equity investors navigating the new regulatory landscape. Project developers working with Energy America can proceed knowing their solar and storage projects will meet all FEOC-related criteria, eliminating the risk of lost credits due to supply chain issues. Component manufacturers from the U.S. and allied countries also benefit from Energy America’s sourcing commitments – the company provides a ready and reliable market for approved domestic products, reinforcing the clean energy ecosystem by supporting those suppliers who adhere to U.S. standards. Meanwhile, tax equity investors and financing partners can invest in Energy America’s projects with peace of mind. Given the new rules that revoke credits if a project later reveals disqualifying foreign influence, investors are now highly sensitive to compliance. Energy America’s rigorous approach ensures that all its projects are “safe harbor” for credits, with no exposure to future claw-backs or penalties, making the company’s projects a low-risk, high-integrity option for capital in the clean energy sector.

In today’s statement, Energy America affirmed that it welcomes the heightened scrutiny and sees it as aligned with the company’s mission. “Our team has worked diligently to anticipate these policy changes, and we’ve built a model that not only complies with the letter of the law but also embodies its spirit – bolstering U.S. clean energy leadership,” VP Zoheb Khan noted. “Whether you’re a solar developer seeking a compliant partner, a manufacturer of cutting-edge American clean-tech, or an investor looking for stable returns in renewables, Energy America stands out as a partner you can trust under these new rules.”

By championing compliance and forging an FEOC-free supply chain, Energy America is not only securing its own projects but is also helping to set an industry standard. The company will continue to collaborate closely with regulators and industry peers to ensure the transition to a secure, domestically powered clean energy economy is a success. As the U.S. renewable sector adjusts to the FEOC regulations now in effect, Energy America is proud to be leading the way in demonstrating that American solar companies can thrive while putting security and compliance first.

Clinicians, researchers, and public health practitioners must defend the integrity and visibility of climate data as foundational to health equity and security.
To ignore climate data is to abandon public health in the face of its greatest modern challenge.","In recent months, the United States (U.S.) has witnessed an unprecedented contraction in its federal climate-health infrastructure. One of the most visible examples occurred in May 2025, when the U.S. government discontinued the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Billion-Dollar Disasters Database, a resource used by researchers, emergency planners, and policymakers to track high-cost weather events since 1980 [1]. The loss of this data platform is part of a broader suppression of climate data, defunding of research, and political rhetoric that marginalizes the health impacts of climate change [2].

The health effects of climate-driven disasters are well-documented. Heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and hurricanes are associated with respiratory and cardiovascular disease, infectious disease outbreaks, mental health crises, and traumatic injuries [3–6]. Disruptions to healthcare delivery, electricity, and clean water access compound these impacts. The elimination of tools designed to monitor and forecast these events directly impairs public health systems’ ability to prepare and respond.

Disproportionate harm falls on already vulnerable populations—children, the elderly, people with chronic conditions, and those of lower socioeconomic status [7–9]. Surveillance and early-warning systems are particularly vital to mitigating impacts on these groups. Without timely and localized data, responses become reactive rather than preventive—and health inequities deepen.

The dismantling of the NOAA database is one in a series of coordinated rollbacks. In early 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced one of the largest deregulatory actions in its history, which included curtailments in air quality monitoring, heat index surveillance, and disease-relevant climate metrics [10]. These reductions occurred alongside an executive order—Protecting American Energy from State Overreach—which limits the ability of states to enact independent climate policies that might constrain fossil fuel development [2]. In addition to hindering any potential state regulatory efforts aimed at mitigating the risk of climate change, this order also disincentivizes data-sharing and public health preparedness activities between federal and state governments, further weakening collaborative health preparedness.

Simultaneously, research funding has been severely constrained. In February 2025, the administration withdrew federal support for any scientific research using the terms “climate” or “climate change” in project titles or abstracts [11]. This decision immediately impacted NIH-funded investigations into heat-related mortality, wildfire smoke exposure, climate-sensitive infectious diseases, and infrastructure resilience. In March, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) formally ended its climate-health research portfolio, citing shifting institutional priorities [12].

These restrictions represent more than bureaucratic defunding—they are forms of epistemic erosion. Suppressing climate-health research and data weakens the evidentiary foundation required for public health decision-making. It stifles academic inquiry, undermines public discourse, and promotes a culture of self-censorship among scientists.

The effects are not limited to the federal level. In 2024, Florida enacted legislation removing all references to “climate change” from state statutes and agency reports [13]. Simultaneously, the state reversed local climate mitigation strategies despite facing some of the most severe climate risks in the U.S., including sea-level rise, extreme heat, and intensified hurricanes [7]. These actions codify denialism and legally prohibit acknowledgment of well-documented environmental threats.

Even disaster response infrastructure is under threat. On May 8, 2025, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director was dismissed, purportedly for emphasizing the importance of climate preparedness in public remarks [14]. More recently, FEMA’s credibility was further called into question when Acting Administrator David Richardson reportedly stated during a staff briefing that he was unaware hurricane season had begun—a remark later described by officials as a joke, but one that sowed confusion and concern within the agency [15]. This incident occurred despite forecasts calling for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season, heightening fears about the agency’s leadership readiness. In the wake of reduced staffing and the dismissal of FEMA’s prior director, the episode illustrates a broader erosion of institutional competence at a time when emergency response capacity is vital. Such lapses in leadership, whether rhetorical or operational, further undermine public confidence in the federal response to climate-driven disasters and compound the risks posed by dismantled surveillance and response infrastructure.

Together, these developments signal a shift from climate inaction to active climate erasure. Suppressing data does not change the trajectory of planetary systems—it only blinds our ability to see them clearly. Climate-health preparedness depends on robust environmental data, transparent public communication, and a science-informed policy framework. Eliminating any of these components makes disasters deadlier, recovery slower, and inequities worse.

The implications extend globally. As the U.S. retreats from climate-health leadership, it weakens international collaboration on issues like pandemic preparedness, heat resilience, and vector-borne disease forecasting. The climate crisis is transboundary; so too must be our systems of surveillance, adaptation, and response.

The scientific and medical communities cannot afford to remain passive. The deliberate dismantling of climate-health infrastructure is a public health emergency. Clinicians, researchers, and public health practitioners must defend the integrity and visibility of climate data as foundational to health equity and security.

Journal editors and funding agencies can play a powerful role in countering suppression by prioritizing transparency, supporting climate-health research, and refusing to censor accurate terminology under political pressure. Institutions must resist the erosion of scientific norms by reaffirming that evidence—not ideology—guides their actions.

In medicine, we rely on data to inform diagnostics, allocate resources, and protect populations. The same must apply to our response to climate change. To ignore climate data is to abandon public health in the face of its greatest modern challenge. It is to walk into the next disaster with eyes wide shut.",,N,,2025-07-17 13:46:29.936495

In the south-facing watershed, however, clearcutting had virtually no impact on flooding.
“This research challenges conventional thinking,” said lead author Younes Alila of the University of British Columbia.","It has long been understood that clearcutting forests leads to more runoff, worsening flooding. But a new study finds that logging can reshape watersheds in surprising ways, leading to dramatically more flooding in some forests, while having little effect on others.

The study looked at two watersheds in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains that had been logged in the late 1950s, one north-facing and one south-facing. In the north-facing watershed, which saw less sunlight and retained more moisture, floods hit up to 18 times more often for more than 40 years after clearcutting.

As climate disasters worsen, both the federal and local response is increasingly politicised

Texas has experienced a devastating flood that claimed more than 100 lives — including 27 young girls — when cabins, located in a known floodplain, were overtaken by rising waters from the nearby Guadalupe River. There was no adequate warning system. No protection. No infrastructure in place to prevent this tragedy.

This was not just a natural disaster, it was a systemic failure. And it did not happen in isolation.

Floods are hitting communities across the country: New Mexico, North Carolina, Buffalo, one after another. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already predicted up to 25 named storms this year.

The Atlantic is so warm that it is fuelling a storm season we are just beginning to feel, and every year we break the previous year’s record for climate-fuelled disasters.

These events are not just heartbreaking, they are predictable and they are preventable. But unfortunately, they are being politicised at a time when what we need most is leadership, not partisanship.

Disaster response should not be political

We have reached a dangerous moment when it has become “partisan” to help communities recover from disaster. When did it become political to provide rapid emergency response service to communities in need: a central and core service of a nation to its citizens?

President Donald Trump’s federal staff cuts are leaving our nation’s key weather management agencies — Noaa and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — depleted and less able to manage emergencies.

These effective agencies were cut due to the Trump administration’s anti-climate change stance, leaving the federal government less able to protect communities.

The Trump administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal staff positions, and many of them are critical to our nation’s emergency preparedness

The National Weather Service has suffered a 20 per cent cut — even as 72 per cent of Americans say the federal government should play a role in tracking weather events and warning people about natural disasters, according to an Associated Press poll from June.

I served in the Joe Biden administration for two years, advising the president on climate, resilience and on housing, and I saw first hand how clear-eyed leadership can protect people both before, during and after a disaster.

Our house is on fire

In the Biden-Harris administration, we viewed resilience and disaster response as a national security imperative, and as a core function of federal leadership. We invested in flood maps, resilience hubs, risk modelling tools, alert systems and the staffing needed to help communities plan and rebuild. The consequences are real, and the threats are escalating in scale and destruction.

We did this together, across all walks of life and political stripes. Red states, blue states — we came together and led. When your house is on fire, there is no time for partisanship.

We helped pass the largest climate risk reduction package in US history: a bipartisan effort that invests nearly $370bn to cut the root causes of global warming by 40 per cent and protect communities nationwide.

That progress is under threat. The current administration is moving to rescind these funds — ignoring the clear and urgent reality we all face. Climate risk does not care how you vote. We should not either.

The Trump administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal staff positions, and many of them are critical to our nation’s emergency preparedness: Fema staff, environmental regulators, infrastructure engineers, disaster recovery teams.

These are the people who protect our air and water, keep our roads safe, and respond when disaster strikes.

Worse still, the federal flood risk management standard — originally developed under President Barack Obama, repealed by President Trump, and reinstituted by President Biden — was quietly dismantled once again earlier this year.

We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while the tools that keep us safe are dismantled

That standard was designed to ensure that federally funded infrastructure would not be rebuilt in known flood zones, that our tax dollars would not be wasted, and that lives would be saved. Its removal is not just shortsighted, it is dangerous.

Tools such as the national climate assessment, once used by local and state governments to guide planning, are being defunded and buried. Fema’s programmes that supported local planning and resilience are being starved. This is not just a policy shift, it is an erasure of science, safety and public responsibility.

Who benefits?

No one benefits from communities being hollowed out by disaster. No one wins when neighbourhoods are lost to fire or flood. But some are benefiting from the weakening of federal guardrails: developers building in high-risk zones, industries polluting with impunity, and policymakers pushing austerity over safety.

The American people, however, are not benefiting. We are paying the price — in lives lost, homes destroyed and futures upended.

We need urgent, non-partisan action. The climate crisis is not coming, it is here. And the response must be bold, consistent, and grounded in justice. It is the federal government’s job to protect its people. Not just with words, but with infrastructure, data, science and action.

We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while the tools that keep us safe are dismantled. And we cannot let compassion, competence or disaster recovery become partisan. Because next time, it could be your city. Your home. Your family.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/d9e1c4dc-af3e-4f91-b8dd-b362b608e681.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:48:14.634500

How the OBBB boosts critical minerals funding

“You don’t know exactly how OBBB will affect the industry; there are so many nuances” a US-based trader said.

“The bill allocates a massive incentive for critical minerals; it is a massive ‘carrot,’” Stephen Empedocles, chief executive officer of Clark Street Associates, said. Clark Street Associates is a government strategist and advisor to technology companies, focused on securing large customized federal and state government funding.

The OBBB appropriates a total of $7.5 billion to the Department of Defense (DOD) for critical minerals direct funding under Section 20004 Enhancement of Department of Defense Resources for Munitions and Defense Supply Chain Resiliency.

Strategic use of critical minerals funding under the DOD

“The problem is not the amount of money, it is making sure [that money] is spent in ways that make a difference,” Empedocles said.

The US has the resources for the critical minerals it needs, but it is missing the ability to extract and process them, he said.

“That’s where most of the funding should go,” he said, adding that the government should allocate the funds efficiently, so they have the most impact and, to achieve this, it is essential for the government to have engagement with the industry.

Other available funds

“In addition to amounts otherwise available,” the OBBB also appropriated $1 billion for the fiscal year 2025 under section 50403, “Energy Dominance Financing.” The funds will remain available through September 30, 2028.

“Our understanding is that supporting brownfield projects and preventing early retirements of existing fossil fuel generation will be part of the uses of this funding. The office is given authority to invest in ‘identification, leasing, development, production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining, and generation needed for energy and critical minerals,’” Leslie Hayworth, senior vice president of public affairs at the nonpartisan energy advocacy group SAFE, said.

Another $1 billion is appropriated under section 30004 of the Appropriations for Defense Production Act, which will remain available until September 30, 2027.

“[The Defense Production Act] has been used to fund minerals projects by both [former President Joe] Biden and Trump,” Hayworth said.

Targeted minerals

With the majority of funding available under the DOD, “early signs predictably point toward a focus on materials with a strong defense nexus,” Hayworth said.

“The [MP Materials and] DOD deal is the first project to receive support from [the Defense Production Act] since OBBB topped off this pot of funding,” she added.

On Thursday July 10, the only rare earths producer in the US, MP Materials, announced it had entered an agreement with the DOD for a comprehensive, multi-billion-dollar long-term package of investments that includes convertible preferred equity, warrants, loans and price floor and offtake commitments. The company will use the proceeds from the agreement to build its second magnet production facility in the country.

“This partnership will facilitate the expansion of MP’s rare earth magnets manufacturing capabilities, for which both defense and commercial sectors currently rely overwhelmingly on [China]-controlled supply chains,” Hayworth said.

“The deal will also help them build out heavy rare earth (HREE) separation capacity. The [Chinese Communist Party] currently controls 99%+ of global HREE separation capacity, and HREEs are particularly important for defense applications (including for use in permanent magnets),” she added.

45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

Meanwhile, a majority of the proposed cuts under the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit were moderated in the final version when compared with the version that had passed the House of Representatives on May 22.

A phase-out of 45X tax credits was introduced under Section 70514 of the OBBB, but the dates were extended when compared with the May 22 version.

The 45X tax credits for critical minerals are permanent under the current law. Under the OBBB, critical minerals produced in 2031, 2032 and 2033 will be entitled to 75%, 50% and 25% of their tax credit value respectively. The program will be completely eliminated for critical minerals produced after 2034.

The OBBB also adds metallurgical coal to the list of critical minerals eligible for 45X tax credit. Tax credits for steel-making coal terminates after 2029 under the OBBB.

In a move celebrated by Battery Council International (BCI), the phase-out of 45X tax credits for batteries and battery components was also extended from the May 22 version, like for critical minerals.

“This vote sends a powerful message that America is committed to building and maintaining the world’s most advanced battery manufacturing ecosystem,” BCI president Roger Miksad said in a statement. “These credits don’t just support individual companies — they strengthen our entire domestic supply chain and ensure America remains the global leader in battery innovation.”

Long-term implications of critical minerals funding changes

The timelines introduced for both 45X and 30D credits will influence electric vehicle (EV) demand, but the affect of this on overall battery raw materials demand is likely to be limited, according to policy experts.

“In our view, the loss of meaningful demand signals for US minerals from the automotive sector will be the biggest difference,” Hayworth said.

“The [Inflation Reduction Act] structure of tax incentives for both producers (45X) and manufacturers (30D) purchasing US-based minerals not only gave producers a buffer to compete in a global market dominated by comparatively lower-cost producers in Asia, but also gave manufacturers an incentive to purchase said minerals, even though they came with a higher price tag,” she explained.

“The decreased value and increased compliance costs associated with the OBBB 45X rollbacks and the full repeal of 30D definitely changes the economic rationale for companies to invest in US production and a more secure supply chain,” Hayworth added.

Internal Revenue Code 30D provided a credit of up to $7,500 to qualified buyers of new clean vehicles, including EVs. For the vehicle to be eligible for the credit, the manufacturer had to meet several requirements, including those related to qualifying content of critical minerals and battery components; the vehicles could not contain battery components or critical minerals extracted or manufactured by a Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC).

Section 70502 of the OBBB repeals credits for new EVs for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025.

“Certain minerals might be impacted by the EV decision,” Empedocles said.

“Even without [demand for] EVs, there is not enough lithium in the US. Data centers consume a lot of lithium and critical minerals, and the rate of growth in data centers has been greater than the rate of growth in EVs,” he added.

Industry participants agreed that the effect of the repeal of these incentives will be limited.

“The bill is pulling back on some incentives but so much of that is not made in the US, they are mostly imported,” a second US-based trader said.

“It is not like EV sales in the US were driving the [battery raw materials] market,” the first trader added.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/12/FM_Location_USCapitolSunset_AdobeStock_605924727-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-17 13:47:34.764626

A landmark report from Power Shift Africa paints a transformative vision for the continent: a complete shift to renewable energy by 2050 could unlock up to US$5 trillion in savings, expand energy capacity more than fortyfold, and create over 5 million clean energy jobs.

The report, issued by Power Shift Africa, a Kenyan climate and energy think tank, argues that this green transition is not just an environmental imperative but a profound economic opportunity.

The study shows that building a fully renewable energy system would cost significantly less than continuing with fossil fuels.

While the ambitious transformation requires a significant investment of US$7.3 trillion in renewable infrastructure, the study calculates that it would generate US$8.3 trillion in direct fuel savings alone.

Crucially, it would also avoid an estimated US$22 trillion in costs related to fossil fuel dependency, making the transition vastly more affordable than maintaining the status quo.

The findings project a staggering increase in energy generation, soaring from 80 gigawatts (80 GW) in 2023 to a projected 3,500 GW by 2050, powered primarily by the continent’s abundant and largely untapped solar and wind resources.

This energy revolution would also reshape the job market.

“The shift to clean energy would not only reduce reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports, which trap the continent in debt cycles, but also create millions more jobs.

“A 100% renewable pathway would support 5.4 million energy jobs by 2050, compared to just 3.2 million under the current fossil fuel-dependent scenario,” the report states.

A core recommendation is the adoption of decentralized renewable systems. These are seen as a vital and rapidly deployable tool to address the estimated 600 million Africans currently living without electricity and the 720 million residing more than 10 kilometers from a power grid.

To finance this monumental shift, Power Shift Africa urges the adoption of measures including Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), substantial debt relief for African nations, and compensation through the Loss and Damage fund.

The report concludes that with the continent contributing only 3 percent of global emissions, Africa holds the moral high ground to champion this change. By leveraging its immense renewable potential, the continent can not only secure its own energy future but also lead the global clean energy revolution.",https://enviropresszim.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Renewable-energy.jpeg,N,,2025-07-17 13:44:19.295374
,Indiana Environment,2025-07-17 13:05:19+00:00,Inside Climate News,"Consumers (and a Utility) Get a Win in Ohio, While Data Centers Take the Loss","Dan Gearino, Aman Azhar",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17072025/inside-clean-energy-ohio-data-centers-penalties/,"An Ohio utility has won an important fight over who assumes the financial risk of data centers, and the result may help guide decisions across the country.
And it’s a loss for data centers, since the commission rejected an alternative plan from the companies along with the companies’ main arguments.
Many of those costs will be paid by data centers themselves since they will be major electricity consumers, but there is nothing in the new rules specifying that data centers must cover all of the costs needed to serve them.
This is in contrast to what happened leading up to AEP’s 2023 moratorium on new data centers.
Lucas Fykes, director of energy policy for the Data Center Coalition, a membership organization for the data center industry, said his group is disappointed with the Ohio ruling.","An Ohio utility has won an important fight over who assumes the financial risk of data centers, and the result may help guide decisions across the country.

Data centers will now need to pay penalties if they say they are going to build a project and then fail to live up to commitments, which provides some protection to other consumers.

Ohio utility regulators issued their decision last week, approving a proposal from Columbus-based American Electric Power (AEP) that sought to create a new rate class for data centers. The losers are corporate giants such as Google and Meta that now have special rules that may put them on the hook for additional costs.

This was a hard-fought case, litigated for more than a year, and I expect that it will inform decisions across the country at a time when electricity demand from data centers is exploding. Utilities and regulators can now look at the thousands of pages of testimony from Ohio to get a sense of the arguments on all sides.

The ruling recognizes that data centers “pose a different type of risk, as well as an increased amount of risk,” said the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio in its 5-0 decision.

The new policy probably is a win for consumers, as shown by the fact that Ohio consumer advocates supported AEP’s position. And it’s a loss for data centers, since the commission rejected an alternative plan from the companies along with the companies’ main arguments.

But let’s not pop any corks. The new rules—which only apply to AEP’s territory in Ohio—help to rein in some of the excesses of projects that can be highly speculative, but there are many other concerns related to data centers that remain unaddressed.

Here’s the policy: The rules apply to new data centers with a peak demand of at least 25 megawatts, which is a lot—the equivalent of a small town. Note the word “new.” If a data center is already built or already has an agreement with AEP to receive power, this policy doesn’t apply.

Data centers would need to pay for at least 85 percent of the energy they sign up to use, even if they end up using less. This provision helps to cover the costs of building infrastructure to serve the new development.

The requirements would last for 12 years in a typical example, which would include a four-year ramp up to full capacity. After that, the contract between AEP and the data center would automatically continue unless either side gives three years’ notice of an intent to terminate.

The policy also allows for a data center to immediately end the contract after eight years by paying an exit fee equivalent to three years of electricity use.

“I think this is an improvement on the status quo,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program.

But he thinks that greater consumer protections are needed.

“My view is that the data centers are underpaying,” he said.

He explained that data centers are going to require grid upgrades that are paid for by all of AEP’s Ohio customer base. Many of those costs will be paid by data centers themselves since they will be major electricity consumers, but there is nothing in the new rules specifying that data centers must cover all of the costs needed to serve them.

Instead, the rules aim to protect against scenarios in which AEP would make investments to serve a data center and then the developer abandons its plans, leaving a portion of the grid that has more capacity than it needs. Excess capacity leads to costs that get absorbed by other ratepayers.

Ideally, the regulations will mean that some of the most speculative data center plans will never reach the stage of making a power agreement with the utility, which makes it easier for AEP to plan for its future needs.

This is in contrast to what happened leading up to AEP’s 2023 moratorium on new data centers. The utility said in filings that companies already building data centers in its territory would need 5,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity by 2030. This exceeds the current peak demand of the Columbus metro area, which was about 4,000 megawatts at the time of the filing.

In addition to confirmed projects, AEP said it received inquiries from data center companies that would require an additional 30,000 megawatts of capacity. This was the number—which exceeds the peak demand of the entire New England grid region—that led the utility to declare the moratorium.

Now, with the approval of the new rules, AEP has said it will lift the moratorium.

This case has been active since May of last year, which feels like much longer considering how much data center development has accelerated across the country.

Lucas Fykes, director of energy policy for the Data Center Coalition, a membership organization for the data center industry, said his group is disappointed with the Ohio ruling.

“The decision is a stark departure from solutions enacted in other key data center markets and, more consequentially, is a deviation from the long-established, sound ratemaking principles that have carried both Ohio and the nation through periods of electricity demand growth and flat demand,” he said in an email.

Ohio now joins Indiana in having similar approaches to data center policy, and both states did so in response to requests from AEP subsidiaries.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved a plan in February stemming from a request from Indiana-Michigan Power, which is owned by AEP. The new policy covers data centers with demand of at least 75 megawatts at a single site or at least 150 megawatts at multiple sites owned by the same company, as Utility Dive reported. Contracts have a 12-year term that includes a ramp-up period and an exit fee, similar to Ohio.

Unlike Ohio, where the process was contested by data center companies, AEP reached a settlement with its adversaries in Indiana, which helped to ease the way to a decision by regulators. It’s not clear to me why the process was smoother in Indiana, but it probably helps that the sides got to know each other in the Ohio litigation and saw value in coming to an agreement.

Suzanne Glatz, a Pennsylvania-based energy policy consultant, sees the Ohio and Indiana policies as replicable because of the way they provide clear consumer benefits but are still within the range of what many businesses would view as reasonable.

“The states that are facing [data center development] will be looking at what Ohio has done and what’s happened in Indiana, and will figure out what fits and what elements make the most sense,” she said.

Any state facing a lot of development needs to make sure its regulations are ready, said Glatz, who has prior experience working for PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for large portions of the Mid-Atlantic, South and Midwest.

“We could end up all paying an awful lot more for our electricity if it’s not done well, and those costs might be also more unevenly spread,” she said. “The other risk is, of course, reliability, because if we don’t do this right, and we don’t recognize where data centers are going to be developed, we could be facing a mismatch of where the generation and transmission are needed versus where the [demand] is.”

The action at the state level is happening in legislatures and regulatory commissions.

For example, Georgia regulators approved a policy in January that allows Georgia Power, the state’s largest utility, to have new requirements for data centers with electricity demand of 100 megawatts or more. The specifics cover some of the same ground as the Ohio and Indiana rules.

One of the big questions about the current boom is how large it will be. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory issued a report in December showing huge differences in forecasts for data center electricity demand, which indicates a lot of uncertainty.

On the high side, forecasters have said data centers may consume more than 400 terawatt-hours by 2030. For perspective, this is close to 10 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States last year.

My main takeaway from the Lawrence Berkeley report is that the forecasts keep growing, which is a hint that the actual numbers in 2030 may be a lot higher than even the highest forecasts.

It also may mean that forecasters are like a blindfolded person throwing at a dart board.

I expect that any large increase in electricity demand will lead to an increase in prices and will put a premium on figuring out new ways for data centers and everyone else to become more efficient. We’re in the early stages of figuring out how this will work, and I feel like many people are underestimating the role that efficiency will play.

In the meantime, policies like the one in Ohio are important steps toward a hazy destination.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

Cuts to Wind and Solar May Undermine the GOP’s Promise of Energy Dominance: Leading experts on the energy economy say that the rapid phaseout of some renewable energy subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will lead to rate hikes for consumers and harm the United States’ global standing in the clean energy transition, as my colleague Aidan Hughes reports for Inside Climate News. The idea of energy dominance was dubious even before this latest legislation. But now, with the country deciding to pull back on support for the fastest-growing sources of electricity generation, it’s difficult to see how the country is well-positioned to meet the needs of the next decade.

U.S. Electric Vehicle Sales Fell in the Second Quarter: Sales of new EVs were down in the United States in April through June compared to the prior-year period, according to figures from Cox Automotive. The 6.3 percent decrease is only the third decline in the years Cox has been doing this report, which signals uncertainty and weakness in the market. But EV sales are likely to surge in the third quarter as consumers rush to make purchases that receive federal tax credits ahead of the credits ending on Sept. 30. Among the bright spots in the second quarter was Chevrolet, whose Equinox EV is a hit, with 17,420 vehicles sold, up from 1,013 vehicles in 2024 when the model was brand new and filling its initial orders. Tesla continues to struggle, with sales down 12.6 percent compared to the second quarter of last year.

Unpacking the Paradox of Rising Needs for Electricity Infrastructure and a Desire to Limit Rate Increases: Rising electricity demand and a need to replace aging infrastructure are leading to high costs at the same time that consumers and regulators are already wary of recent rate increases. The result is a push and pull of priorities that are a serious challenge for just about everyone with a stake in the electricity system, as Herman K. Trabish reports for Utility Dive.

That's Good—and Proof Reform Is Possible.,"Veronique de Rugy, Christian Britschgi, Eric Boehm, Anne Dias, Beth Bailey, Jesse Walker",,,,,https://reason.com/%3Fp%3D8341685,"One positive step was to repeal many of the Inflation Reduction Act's green energy subsidies.

""—as evidence of the outrage and unfairness that it is to trim green energy subsidies down.
Scaled by energy output, green energy receives subsidies at rates 19 to 30 times those of coal, oil, and natural gas.
In other words, the idea that green subsidies got eviscerated while fossil subsidies thrive isn't correct.","The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" did a lot of things, not all of them good. One positive step was to repeal many of the Inflation Reduction Act's green energy subsidies. It's a little disappointing that Congress didn't repeal all of them, as President Donald Trump promised during the campaign. Yet it's also somewhat amazing to witness a genuine rollback, something that was never a given for this bill and which typically loses out to special-interest politics.

To be clear, I want more green energy from more sources, including wind, solar, geothermal, and whatever other promising avenues innovation makes possible. But subsidies like those of the Inflation Reduction Act are the wrong way to get there. They distort the tax code, misallocate capital, and favor companies already in the game, to the detriment of new entrants that might bring something more transformative.

The result isn't more abundance; it's cronyism masquerading as climate policy.

The promise to roll back the Inflation Reduction Act's sprawling tax credits and handouts was once a central part of the GOP's economic platform. According to a Cato Institute analysis, these at one point were going to amount to $1.2 trillion over 10 years, many times the originally projected cost. The House version of the budget took a meaningful swing at it, with hard deadlines for wind and solar tax credits, and tighter eligibility geared toward projects that could begin construction within 60 days of enactment and be in service before 2029.

It wasn't perfect, but it was a real attempt to inject discipline into a policy that had run off the rails. The Senate, however, had other plans, and the reform was diluted. New carveouts were added. Key provisions were extended, and the effective phaseout was punted years into the future.

Thanks to generous grandfathering language, projects that start construction within a year of the bill's enactment can lock in 10 more years of production or investment tax credits. And what, by the way, counts as starting construction? Spending just 5 percent of expected costs on solar panels or booking a consulting firm. In Washington, that's good enough.

The good news is that even this watered-down reform is expected to cut green subsidies by about $500 billion over 10 years. That's no small feat, especially in a town where ""cutting"" usually means ""slightly slowing the growth of programs we already can't afford."" It's doubly impressive given that the forces fighting to maintain the subsidies outspent reformers by orders of magnitude.

Now, we're hearing the usual refrain—""But fossil fuels are subsidized too!""—as evidence of the outrage and unfairness that it is to trim green energy subsidies down. I sympathize with the desire to end fossil fuel subsidies.

I want an end to all private-sector subsidies. If your business model depends on special treatment in the tax code, then, as economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin once put it, you don't have a business. You have a tax shelter.

Yes, there are some lingering fossil fuel subsidies on the books. Cato's Adam Michel helpfully identifies them: credits for enhanced oil recovery, for marginal wells, and for carbon capture and sequestration. These are targeted giveaways, and they should also go.

However, what most people clamoring for the end of fossil fuel subsidies are pointing to aren't subsidies at all but simply neutral tax treatments—like expensing and percentage depletion—that apply across many industries. They might distort investment decisions in general, but they are not special favors for oil and gas.

In addition, when you compare the size of green versus fossil fuel subsidies, the difference is staggering. Scaled by energy output, green energy receives subsidies at rates 19 to 30 times those of coal, oil, and natural gas. According to Michel's analysis, 94 percent of the fiscal cost of energy-related tax provisions over the next decade—$1.2 trillion—would have gone to renewables. Only 6 percent—about $70 billion—would benefit fossil fuels. And again, much of that 6 percent isn't tailored to fossil fuel companies; it just happens to benefit them.

In other words, the idea that green subsidies got eviscerated while fossil subsidies thrive isn't correct. That's not an argument for maintaining fossil fuel subsidies; that's an argument for taming the outrage.

If we've learned anything here, it's that cutting subsidies is hard. Once they're in place, armies of rent-seekers mobilize to preserve them. Renewable energy developers, financial firms, and politically connected manufacturers descend on Capitol Hill to keep the money flowing.

But we've learned something else: Fighting back can work. Even this partial rollback shows that reformers aren't powerless. The next time someone says eliminating tax preferences is impossible, point to $500 billion in savings. We got that rollback not because the politics were easy but because some people stood firm.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/07/big-beautiful-bill-energy-subsidies-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:46:01.482910

China leads the way in terms of EV sales growth, with 5.5 million electric vehicles sold, a 32% increase on the previous year, the data showed.

In Europe, some 2.0 million units were sold, a 26% increase, while sales in North America rose by just 3%, to 0.9 million. In the Rest of the World, meanwhile, sales were up 40%, to 0.7 million.

‘Steaming ahead’

“Today’s EV sales figures for the first half of 2025 show that China and Europe are steaming ahead in terms of the electric transition,” commented Charles Lester, data manager at Rho Motion. “Over one in two electric vehicles sold in the world are being bought in China and around half of purchased new cars in the country are electric.

“Despite some nervousness over subsidies, we expect this strong EV sales trend to continue over the course of the year. European growth, while strong, hasn’t been uniform across the region. The UK and Germany are leading the way, leaving France in their dust as price-sensitive drivers continue to be at the mercy of subsidies. North America, and in particular Canada, is experiencing a slowdown of EV sales in 2025.

Tax credits

In the US, the forthcoming removal of federal EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, is likely to significantly impact the market – more than half of the EVs sold in the US this year qualified for these credits, according to Rho Motion.

“With Trump’s latest cuts in his ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ the USA could struggle to see any growth in the EV market overall in 2025,” Lester added. Read more here.

The Environment Ministry described it as a “fatal blow” to environmental protection, while the Agriculture Ministry backed it.

The bill, backed by 267 lawmakers to 116, simplifies permits for “strategic” projects and allows some to proceed based solely on a declaration of commitment.

Despite seeking to make Brazil a leader in the fight against global warming, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva backs oil exploration as key to growth in Latin America’s biggest economy.

Experts say the new measures could fast-track infrastructure development in the Amazon rainforest.

The bill was approved by the Senate in May. It must now be considered for enactment by Lula.

The measure has divided the president’s left-wing government.

The Environment Ministry described it as a “fatal blow” to environmental protection, while the Agriculture Ministry backed it.

Supporters of the reform argued that it seeks to “streamline” the licensing process to boost the country’s economy.

But Environment Minister Marina Silva said the fact that “something is of strategic interest to the government does not eliminate the environmental impacts”.

Furthermore, environmental licensing “did not prevent the construction of any project in the country,” said Rodrigo Agostinho, president of the Brazilian Institute of Environment (IBAMA) public watchdog.

IBAMA has announced it will challenge the law in court, arguing it is unconstitutional.

The Brazilian NGO network Climate Observatory also warned in a statement that the law “could lead to the approval of works and projects that generate significant environmental degradation”.

As much as 2.3 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption went to cryptocurrency mining in 2022, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives declared this week to be “Crypto Week,” during which they hope to pass several bills related to cryptocurrency. Chief among them is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS for short.

The bill has bipartisan support, including from U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who say the legislation, which passed the Senate in June, will provide key safety measures for consumers and financial markets.

President Donald Trump, no stranger to crypto with his own $TRUMP meme coin and an estimated $1 billion in crypto holdings, announced Tuesday evening on Truth Social that he convinced House GOP crypto holdouts to vote in favor of the bill.

While some economists say the GENIUS Act will have the opposite effect of its intended goals, bringing economic chaos and the next global financial crisis, environmental advocates say the bill will supercharge a destructive industry no matter its impact on the financial system.

“The more that crypto currency generally is legitimized and used, the more crypto mining there will be,” said Mandy DeRoche, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice’s clean energy program.

Mining is the most common method for authenticating or generating new cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. It involves powerful computers that work around the clock running endless series of random numbers before hitting upon the correct code. Every time a Bitcoin miner’s computer successfully guesses a transaction code, the miner receives a limited number of newly minted Bitcoins.

As both cryptocurrency’s popularity and the complexity of its codes for new coins have grown, the industry’s energy demands have skyrocketed.

As much as 2.3 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption went to cryptocurrency mining in 2022, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

Many of the mines are sited in small towns and rural areas.

“They’re billion-dollar corporations that just come in, bully [and] steamroll local communities,” said Jackie Sawicky of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining. “There’s almost no oversight.”

Water use and noise complaints from large mines face increasing backlash in Texas, which leads the country in Bitcoin mining.

However, another method exists to authenticate cryptocurrency that doesn’t involve mining and its associated environmental concerns. Known as proof of stake, the method relies on validators, individuals who already have a significant amount of, or stake in, a given cryptocurrency, who check the transactions used to generate the new currency. Validators earn transaction fees for their work and agree to freeze a portion of their own stake during the verification process to ensure they work honestly.

Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, saw a 99.99 percent drop in its energy usage after switching from mining, also known as proof of work, to proof of stake verification in 2022.

The GENIUS Act seeks to regulate stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is tied to the value of another asset, such as the U.S. dollar, to reduce price volatility.

New stablecoin can be verified either through mining or by proof of stake. The GENIUS Act doesn’t set any requirements on how new stablecoins are minted.

Neither Gillibrand’s nor Booker’s office responded to a request for comment about the continued allowance for cryptocurrency mining under the GENIUS Act.

Most cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, which controls more than 60 percent of the global crypto market, relies on mining. Environmental advocates say any growth in the industry through stablecoin will simply drive additional mining.

Amanda Wick, the founder and chief executive officer of the Association for Women in Cryptocurrency, said in an interview with C-SPAN on Wednesday that the majority of stablecoins are minted through mining.

However, it doesn’t have to be that way, said Adi Wolfson, a researcher at the Shamoon College of Engineering in Israel. He recently published a study on the sustainability of stablecoin relative to other cryptocurrencies. Mining them has just as large a footprint as other cryptocurrency, he said, but producing them via proof of stake means “less energy, less pollution, less carbon.”

Strengthening American agricultural supply chains and supporting rural communities

Reducing dependence on foreign fossil fuels and boosting U.S. energy security

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESS Newswire / July 17, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (NASDAQ:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Synthetic Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") today announced that its supply chain features domestically sourced feedstocks for producing its renewable fuels during the ramp-up process, reinforcing the company's support for American farmers, strengthening rural economies, and advancing U.S. energy independence.

XCF's New Rise Reno facility is designed for flexibility, capable of processing a variety of waste- and residue-based feedstocks into renewable fuels. These feedstocks, which are not suitable for direct human consumption, include waste oils, agricultural residues, animal fats, and co-products from industrial agriculture. Currently, New Rise Reno uses ISCC-certified distillers corn oil (""DCO""), a byproduct of U.S. ethanol production, to produce SAF and crude degummed soybean oil, a co-product of the U.S. oilseed supply chain, to produce renewable diesel.

Distillers corn oil is recovered at ethanol plants after corn has been processed into fuel ethanol and animal feed. By converting this low-value agricultural byproduct into SAF, XCF is turning a waste stream into valuable, low-carbon fuel.

Crude degummed soybean oil supports U.S. farmers and helps reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels; it is a widely available co-product that plays an important role in building domestic renewable fuel supply chains.

Today, XCF's feedstock supply chain is strengthened by its partnership with Phillips 66 (""P66""), which provides reliable access to these critical, domestically produced feedstocks. This partnership ensures stable sourcing, quality control, and scale, underpinning XCF's support for U.S. agricultural communities while maintaining robust production reliability.

""We're proud to put American farmers at the center of our supply chain,"" said Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair of XCF. ""Our supply chain supports domestic jobs and rural economies, while strengthening our nation's energy independence. XCF's approach ensures that the U.S. leads the clean energy transition on our own terms - by using American resources to power American innovation.""

By sourcing feedstocks domestically and partnering with P66 for consistent supply, XCF:

Provides new income streams for U.S. farmers and ethanol producers

Strengthens American supply chains for renewable fuels

Reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels

Supports domestic jobs in agriculture, engineering, logistics, and technology

XCF's New Rise Reno facility, commissioned in February 2025, is designed to flexibly process a variety of feedstocks into drop-in SAF and renewable diesel. The company's planned expansion sites in Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida are expected to replicate New Rise Reno's patent-pending modular design, enabling rapid scale-up of renewable fuel production. Each additional site is expected to have a nameplate production capacity of 40 million gallons of neat SAF bringing XCF's total expected production capacity to ~160 million gallons of neat SAF by 2028.

MGL has formed a joint venture with US-based International Battery Company (IBC) to set up a giga factory in Karnataka. The new company, owned 56per cent by IBC and 44per cent by MGL, has been allocated land for the project, and construction work is set to commence later this quarter.

MGL and IBC are jointly investing around ₹825 crore in the facility, first phase of which is targeted for commissioning in FY27 and the second phase in FY28.

The new facility will be a technology-agonistic centre, initially producing prismatic NMC lithium-ion battery cells having wide applications across mobility and battery storage sectors. Shinghal said the JV will commence operations with 1 GWh capacity. “If results are satisfactory, we can expand to produce 5 GWh,” he said.

Shinghal said the JV company is already in the process of testing batteries, which it aims to supply to two-wheeler and three-wheeler makers in India from the new facility. Separately, MGL has inked an agreement with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to set up 1,000 tonnes per day (TPD) compressed biogas (CBG) plant in Maharashtra at an investment of around ₹500 crore. The proposed plant will process up to 1,000 TPD of deep segregated food and vegetable waste that will be supplied by the civic body.

While CBG production in India is limited currently, Shinghal said there is a lot of potential for growth going ahead given automakers like Maruti Suzuki too are exploring utilising the gas in vehicles.

A PhD project at the University of Bath in the UK aims to make an alternative refuelling infrastructure a reality with a new concept design

IMAGINE if refuelling your car was easy as changing a lightbulb? No need for hoses or cables. No need even to lift a finger, with swappable fuel tanks and robotic attendants for cars, buses and trucks under one standardised fuel tank architecture.

My name is William Forshaw and I am developing a swappable, high-pressure hydrogen gas storage tank concept as part of my research project funded by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Advanced Automobile Propulsion Systems at the University of Bath (https://www.aaps-cdt.ac.uk). The concept came about from a suggestion to modularise hydrogen storage from Professor Tim Mays at the university, and my understanding of the challenges facing sustainable transport.

Energy for transport accounts for roughly a quarter of global CO2 emissions but vehicles fuelled by green hydrogen can help reduce this figure. A barrier is the “chicken and egg” challenge with drivers reluctant to buy vehicles without a place to refill and businesses unwilling to invest in stations without customers lined up. Swappable batteries are already growing in popularity1 with Chinese electric vehicle company NIO putting them in SUVs and India developing standards for swappable electric bus batteries. However, swappable hydrogen has remained relatively unexplored in the public domain.

Reducing costs and increasing reliability

In a conventional refuelling station design, high-purity hydrogen is delivered or produced onsite. This is compressed to a delivery pressure then dispensed through a nozzle into the vehicle. Due to the high pressures involved (~950 bar(a) / ~95 MPa(a)) and the negative Joule-Thompson coefficient of hydrogen, a pre-chiller unit is needed to counteract the heating experienced during refuelling which pre-cools the gas to around –40°C (233K). Compressors, chillers and dispensers are the most expensive components of a refuelling station2 and they are also responsible for a majority of the maintenance and servicing downtime.3 Therefore, removing these components from individual stations would drastically reduce their construction and operating costs while also increasing reliability.

I propose a different way of refuelling via the swappable method. Empty hydrogen tanks are removed by a robotic attendant and replaced with a full tank from a nearby storage rack; the customer can then drive away. A delivery vehicle can visit the station and drop off full tanks before the empties are collected and returned to a central distribution centre. Here, they are refilled at scale using green hydrogen and compressed using renewable electricity. This can be done when energy is available at a low-cost during off-peak times and at a slow, steady pace removing the need for chilling equipment. As the gas is transported at a much higher pressure and in lighter carbon-fibre vessels, road transportation is much more efficient compared to a typical steel tube trailer. I have calculated that delivering conventional hydrogen requires ~46 MJ kg-1 while a swappable system only requires ~14 MJ kg-1 for an equivalent distance, representing a significant improvement in well-to-tank efficiency.

While the technology is in its early stages, a swappable system is expected to be safer. As the fuel tank is pressurised to the final delivery pressure in a central facility by trained personnel, each refuelling station would not require its own gas handling plant, reducing both cost and risk exposure. While using multiple smaller, swappable containers increases the number of potential leak points, the risk is mitigated by the significantly lower impact of a 4.1 kg tank leaking compared to a 200 kg trailer.

Composite tanks have a finite service life due to fatigue from factors like pressure and thermal cycling. They can additionally prove difficult to examine when mounted inside a vehicle.

With a swappable system, tank health could be regularly tested when they are refilled at the central facility using non-destructive methods like X-ray scanning to ensure they are safe and in service for longer. Tanks that are damaged or near the end of their service life can automatically be removed from circulation and collected for repair or recycling, disconnecting tank wear from vehicle life. However, work will need to be done to guarantee the functionality of the quick-disconnect system for general road use and to ensure safety in the event of a crash.

The next work packages for the project involve a full techno-economic analysis comparing conventional and swappable hydrogen systems using Life Cycle Impact Assessment. This is key to understanding whether swappable systems are a practical way to help cut human-made CO2 emissions cost-effectively.

I am currently working to publish these initial findings in a peer-reviewed journal. After graduation I have ambitions to develop the swappable hydrogen concept further as well as seeking other challenges requiring creative problem-solving.

And the EPA under Trump’s leadership has proposed repealing Biden administration regulations that would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions from coal power plants and required the power sector to cut mercury and other air toxics.
“It doesn’t help to have the EPA telling the state it’s illegal to close coal-fired power plants,” Nichols said.
“Many coal plants have already shut down or are on track to retire — driven by economics and cost savings for consumers, not federal mandates.
Those power plants also create a coal ash byproduct that leaches contaminants such as lithium and selenium into groundwater.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday signaled it no longer believes Colorado can mandate utility companies close their coal-fired power plants, leading environmentalists to accuse the Trump administration of attacking the state’s plan to shift to 100% renewable energy by 2031 to meet its climate goals.

The EPA published a notice in the Federal Register that it intends to deny Colorado’s plan to shutter coal-fired power plants as part of the state’s strategy to reduce the regional haze that clouds views at Rocky Mountain National Park and other federal lands. Colorado was previously allowed to list coal-plant closures as an acceptable strategy to reduce haze.

Cyrus Western, director of EPA Region 8, which includes Colorado, affirmed to The Denver Post that the denial is part of the Trump administration’s plan to make sure no federal regulations stand in the way of coal-fired power generation.

Western, a Trump appointee from Wyoming, which is the nation’s largest producer of coal, did not say the EPA would override Colorado’s laws that require the coal-burning plants to close, although the Federal Register notice indicates the agency might do so.

“What the legislature does and what the governor does, the laws they pass, that is the state’s business,” Western said. “But from a federal standpoint, we want to be sure there will not be a single shutdown of a coal-fired generation unit because of federal regulation or by the federal government breathing down their necks.”

The EPA’s proposal alarmed environmentalists who have been leery of President Donald Trump’s repeated remarks about “beautiful, clean coal” and his executive orders that promote the coal industry.

The president this year has used executive orders — citing energy emergencies — to force coal plants to remain open in Michigan and Pennsylvania. And the EPA under Trump’s leadership has proposed repealing Biden administration regulations that would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions from coal power plants and required the power sector to cut mercury and other air toxics.

“It’s in keeping with the ideology of this administration to do everything possible to prop up the dying coal industry,” said Jeremy Nichols, senior advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s absurd.”

The ruling is a pivot from past EPA decisions that allow the closing of coal-fired power plants to count toward clean air goals, Nichols said, and it could pave the way for Xcel Energy and other utilities to keep their coal-fired plants running.

“It doesn’t help to have the EPA telling the state it’s illegal to close coal-fired power plants,” Nichols said. “This is a punch in the face to Colorado’s climate progress.”

But Colorado regulators said the EPA’s proposed denial of Colorado’s plans will not have an impact on the state because the retirement dates for all of the state’s remaining coal plants remain enforceable under state law and the transition already is underway.

“Utilities are moving away from coal because it’s no longer the most affordable or reliable option,” said Michael Ogletree, senior director of state air quality programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “Many coal plants have already shut down or are on track to retire — driven by economics and cost savings for consumers, not federal mandates. That transition is locked in through utility planning and will continue regardless of this federal decision.”

Gov. Jared Polis’ office reiterated the point that the utility companies operating in the state already have plans to close those plants.

“Colorado utilities have their own ambitious plans to reduce costs, including retiring costly coal plants to transition to more stable clean energy, and lower costs,” Ally Sullivan, a governor’s spokesperson, said in an email. “The EPA’s proposed denial has no meaningful impact on utilities’ plans to move away from coal because it’s no longer the most affordable or reliable option.”

Utilty wants to keep plant open

However, the EPA’s notice in the Federal Register stated that Colorado Springs Utilities told the agency in April that it wants to exclude its Ray D. Nixon Power Plant in Fountain from the state’s closure plans. The utility also met with state regulators on April 23 to ask that Nixon be allowed to remain open, according to the Federal Register notice.

Danielle Nieves, a Colorado Springs Utilities spokesperson, said the company is still scheduled to shutter Nixon in 2029, but that date is causing reliability challenges and the utility is having difficulties finding resources for the transition to renewable energy.

“The market for renewable energy resources across the country is tremendously challenging with ongoing supply chain congestion and regulatory uncertainty — resulting in renewable energy resources being three to five times more expensive than originally forecasted,” she said in an email.

Nieves said the utility is supportive of the EPA’s recommendation to exclude Nixon from the regional haze plan “because Colorado doesn’t need the Nixon closure to achieve its reasonable progress targets, and that choosing to include Nixon could present serious reliability challenges for Colorado Springs Utilities.”

Spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said Xcel remains committed to retiring its coal units — including the Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo — by the end of 2030.

“Nothing in this action from the Environmental Protection Agency directly changes our Colorado resource plans,” she said in an emailed statement.

Although Western said that “what Colorado does is Colorado’s business,” the EPA’s notification argued that the Clean Air Act does not give states the ability to order coal power plants to close, citing the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the government from taking private property without just compensation.

The EPA also argues — although without specific evidence — that forcing the closures would violate Colorado state law.

Coal is one of the dirtiest forms of electricity generation, annually releasing millions of tons of pollutants into the air that contribute to global warming and harm human health. Those emissions include carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter. Those power plants also create a coal ash byproduct that leaches contaminants such as lithium and selenium into groundwater.

‘Turning that progress backwards’

Coal emissions help create a haze in the skies, and that haze has become a problem at national parks across the country, including Rocky Mountain National Park, Great Sand Dunes National Park, Mesa Verde National Park and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, said Tracy Copolla, the National Parks Conservation Association’s Colorado program manager.

“We are still in a situation where there is significant regional haze in Colorado,” Copolla said. “It goes for miles and miles and miles.”

Ulla Reeves, the National Park Conservation Association’s clean air program director, said the EPA’s proposal is undercutting Colorado’s progress to clean its air.

“Colorado had one of the strongest plans that we’ve seen in the entire country,” Reeves said. “This is really turning that progress backwards. It’s extremely concerning what the EPA is doing here and undercutting the state’s authority.”

The EPA opened a 60-day public comment period on the proposed rule and multiple environmental groups said they plan to weigh in. They hope Colorado does as well.

“The state really needs to flex its muscles and try to stymie the feds,” Nichols said.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TDP-L-Comanche-coal-RJS-10344.jpg?w=1024&h=708,N,,2025-07-17 10:15:53.418849

The company’s 2024–2025 Sustainability Report places strong emphasis on decarbonisation, resource reuse and inclusive development — all central to its long-term operational strategy.

While LG’s international footprint continues to expand, its sustainability framework aims to redefine how a global technology manufacturer can influence both business and society.

The report sets a detailed path toward achieving lower environmental impact through both product development and production strategy.

Pushing for net zero in production

A primary aim of LG’s sustainability strategy is to reach net zero emissions from operations by 2030. This target includes Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas emissions, with LG reporting a 40% cut since 2019, using 2017 as its baseline.

A central part of this goal is LG’s RE100 commitment, which pledges to transition all production sites to 100% renewable electricity.

That includes factory-level changes across global facilities, where the company installs solar power infrastructure, uses smart grid systems and applies AI to improve energy use efficiency.

William (Joowan) Cho, Chief Executive Officer of LG Electronics, states: “To achieve carbon neutrality in the production stage by 2030, LG Electronics is expanding the use of high-efficiency equipment to improve energy efficiency and accelerate the transition to renewable energy across our production sites.”

By the end of 2023, LG reports an 11% year-on-year increase in renewable energy usage, supported by a combination of on-site generation, Power Purchase Agreements and certified green energy procurement.

The adoption of AI-powered optimisation and integration of renewables are expected to cut emissions further over the next five years.

Building a circular supply chain

LG’s sustainability plans extend well beyond energy. Its “3Cs” framework — Carbon Neutrality, Circularity and Clean Technology — and “3Ds” — Decent Workplace, Diversity & Inclusion and Design for All — together define the company’s mid to long-term environmental and social tasks.

The report highlights LG’s global take-back schemes and design-for-repair practices as critical to its circular economy efforts.

In 2023, the company recovered 527,000 tonnes of electronic waste across 52 countries. Product designs now also prioritise recyclability and durability, especially across the Styler, WashTower and LG OLED product lines.

Plastic reuse forms another major focus. Last year, LG used over 32,000 tonnes of recycled plastics in product manufacturing and plans to exceed 600,000 tonnes cumulatively by 2030.

To enforce sustainability across the supply chain, LG uses its Green Program Plus system to assess more than 2,900 suppliers annually. The evaluation centres on environmental performance and circular practices, ensuring standards are upheld across all tiers of production.

William adds: “We have identified three key areas for the planet: Carbon Neutrality, Circularity and Clean Technology (the 3Cs) and three for people: Decent Workplace, Diversity & Inclusion and Design for All (the 3Ds) as our mid- to longterm strategic tasks.”

Inclusion, ethics and customer choice

LG also expands its sustainability work into diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), human rights and corporate ethics.

Internally, the company reports an increase in the number of women holding managerial and executive roles, alongside the launch of leadership programmes aimed at underrepresented groups.

Human rights risk assessments are now mandatory at overseas sites, and corrective actions are tracked at executive level.

The Sustainability Management Council, led by the CEO, manages environmental, social and governance (ESG) oversight across the business. ESG-specific key performance indicators are also used for board-level reporting and influence executive pay structures.

Meanwhile, LG supports customers in adopting lower-impact lifestyles through technology. Its Smart Home Energy Platform, presented at CES 2024, enables real-time energy monitoring and appliance control, encouraging energy-aware decisions at household level.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/55bd1523447cb69e476e0e5cfbda21de:da393ca8dc8591718fe0ae6af3ec3236/lg-ai-home.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:44:24.196528

While prior bill drafts provided for gradual phase downs, the final bill eliminates the credits entirely after 2027.
In addition to forthcoming guidance surrounding begun construction, OBBBA also includes several other key changes affecting the renewable energy industry, generally, which are summarized and outlined below.
Foreign Entity of Concern One of the key areas for concern within the energy credits sector is the implementation of the ""foreign entity of concern"" (FEOC) provisions, which become effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.
Residential Rooftop Leases OBBBA denies Code Sections 48E and 45Y credits for residential rooftop systems that are leased directly to homeowners.","President Trump signed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (""OBBBA"") into law over the July Fourth holiday. The OBBBA is a massive budget reconciliation bill that contains a number of tax and spending reforms, including many changes directed at the renewable energy space – particularly with respect to solar and wind projects.

Among the major changes, OBBBA includes sunsets for a number of renewable energy incentives, in particular, phasing out the Code Section 45Y clean electricity production credit and the Code Section 48E clean electricity investment credit for solar and wind projects that fail to place in service by the end of 2027. While prior bill drafts provided for gradual phase downs, the final bill eliminates the credits entirely after 2027. The phase out, however, is subject to an exception for solar and wind projects that begin construction within one year of the date of enactment of OBBBA (i.e., July 4, 2026).

Under current guidance, a project is deemed to have begun construction either by incurring 5% or more of the costs of credit-eligible property, or by starting physical work of a significant nature, as outlined in IRS Notice 2018-59. However, on July 7, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury Department to issue ""new and revised guidance"" within 45 days aimed to restrict the current begun construction safe harbors unless a substantial portion of the project facility has actually been built, adding additional uncertainty to existing guidance.

Another interesting nuance in the OBBBA text concerns its treatment of energy storage technologies. As enacted, the Code Section 48E credit for standalone storage projects will continue to qualify for the Code Section 48E credit at the enhanced rate (i.e., 6% base rate, multiplied by 5 if the Project either satisfies the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or has a maximum output of less than 1 megawatt (AC)) to the extent such projects begin construction on or before December 31, 2033, until being phased down to a base rate of 22.5% in 2034 and a base rate of 15% in 2035, before phasing out to 0% in 2036.

In addition to forthcoming guidance surrounding begun construction, OBBBA also includes several other key changes affecting the renewable energy industry, generally, which are summarized and outlined below.

Depreciation

One of the key changes included in the OBBBA is reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for properties acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025. While OBBBA eliminates the 5-year property designations for energy property claiming the Code Section 48 energy credit, the 5-year property designations remain for ""qualified property"" and ""energy storage technology"" that qualifies for the Code Section 48E clean energy investment tax credit. As the Code Section 48 energy credit was set to phase out for solar and wind facilities that do not begin construction on or prior to December 31, 2024, these changes are not likely to have a big impact on future solar and wind projects. However, unlike solar and wind projects, the phase down under Code Section 48 for equipment used to produce, distribute or use energy derived from a geothermal deposit does not take effect until after 2032. Thus, the main effect of the designated elimination under Code Section 48 is to deny geothermal projects from being eligible for 5-year depreciation.

Foreign Entity of Concern

One of the key areas for concern within the energy credits sector is the implementation of the ""foreign entity of concern"" (FEOC) provisions, which become effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025. Thus, for calendar year taxpayers, a project that begins construction on or prior to December 31, 2025, will not be required to comply with the FEOC restrictions. In general, the FEOC restrictions would disallow the Code Section 45Y and Code Section 48E credits to the extent that the applicable taxpayer is determined to constitute:

A specified foreign entity – A specified foreign entity includes any entity owned by the governments of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, owned by a citizen of such countries (unless such person is an individual who is a citizen, national or lawful resident of the United States), or organized or having a principal place of business in such countries;

A foreign-influenced entity – A foreign-influenced entity is an entity in which: (a) a specified foreign entity has direct authority to appoint a member of the board of directors (or equivalent governing body), an executive-level officer, or an individual having similar powers or responsibilities, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity, (c) one or more specified foreign entities owns in the aggregate at least 40% of such entity, or (d) at least 15% of the debt of such entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more specified foreign entities; or

Is deemed to be effectively controlled by such entities – An entity may also be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if, during the prior taxable year, such entity made certain payments to a specified foreign entity, if the arrangement allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise ""effective control"" over such entity's energy production or storage functions.

The FEOC restrictions also apply to the Code Section 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit and prohibit taxpayers from making an election under Code Section 6418 to transfer credits to such entities.

In addition to disallowing Code Section 45Y and Code Section 48E tax credits, the OBBBA's FEOC restrictions incorporate a separate recapture rule, requiring 100% of a project's Code Section 48E tax credits to be recaptured if, at any time during the ten (10) year period following the project's placed in-service date, payments are deemed to allow a specified foreign entity to exercise ""effective control"". While the Treasury Department has been directed to release guidance establishing rules to prevent entities from evading, circumventing or abusing the application of the FEOC restrictions, a contract implicates the ""effective control"" standard if it includes any provisions which allow the counterparty to:

Determine the quantity or timing of electricity produced or storage capacity available;

Determine who can purchase electricity or storage capacity;

Restrict access to data critical to energy production or storage of energy; or

On an exclusive basis, maintain, repair or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary for the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity.

Licensing agreements should avoid provisions which allow the counterparty to directly operate the project, that limit use of intellectual property related to operations, allow the counterparty to receive royalty payments for more than ten (10) years, or obligate the project to hire the counterparty to provide services for a period of more than two (2) years. The ""effective control"" prohibitions are effective for contracts that were entered into or amended on or after July 4, 2025. These prohibitions do not apply in the case of a ""bona fide purchase or sale"" of intellectual property.

The FEOC restrictions also disallow Code Section 48E and Code Section 45Y tax credits to the extent that the project is deemed to have received ""material assistance"" from a specified foreign entity. Material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity is determined first by calculating the ""material assistance cost ratio,"" which is equal to: (i) the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products and components incorporated into the project upon completion of construction, minus the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products and components which are incorporated into the project upon completion of construction and mined, produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products and components incorporated into the project upon completion of construction. For example, if the total direct cost of all manufactured products and components for a project was $100 and $40 of such total direct costs was attributable manufactured products and components that were mined, produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the ""material assistance cost ratio"" would be ($100-$40)/$100 or 60%.

If the material assistance cost ratio is less than the threshold percentage, the project is deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. The threshold percentage varies depending upon the year in which the project began construction and differs for energy storage technology and solar PV/wind projects. Such percentages are shown in the table below:

Begun Construction Year Solar PV/Wind Threshold Percentage Energy Storage Technology Threshold Percentage During CY 2026 40% 55% During CY 2027 45% 60% During CY 2028 50% 65% During CY 2029 55% 70% After 12/31/2029 60% 75%

Domestic Content Rules

For projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025 and before January 1, 2026, the adjusted percentage for purposes of determining a project's eligibility for the domestic content adder is 45%. However, for projects which began construction before June 16, 2025, the adjusted percentage will remain at 40%. This change is to fix a drafting error under Code Section 48E, which allowed projects beginning construction in 2025 to use the lower 40% adjusted percentage, which was inconsistent with the requirements under the legacy Code Section 48 credit, which provide for a 45% adjusted percentage for 2025.

Allowance of 48E Credit for Qualified Fuel Cell Projects

OBBBA amends Code Section 48E to allow qualified fuel cell projects to qualify for the credit without regard to the greenhouse gas emissions rate requirements. Additionally, qualified fuel cell projects will not have to demonstrate compliance with the burdensome prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements that apply to other technology types in order to qualify for the enhanced Code Section 48E credit percentage of 30%.

Phaseout of Legacy Section 48 Credit

Projects which began construction after December 31, 2024, had the ability to claim a 2% base credit in lieu of the Code Section 48E credits. Such 2% base credit could be increased to 10% if the project met the additional requirements set forth in Code Section 48(a)(9)(B) (e.g., compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, or less than 1 megawatt (AC)). OBBBA amends Code Section 48(a)(2)(A)(ii) by making the energy percentage 0%, effectively phasing out the Code Section 48 credit for most technologies after 2024.

Residential Rooftop Leases

OBBBA denies Code Sections 48E and 45Y credits for residential rooftop systems that are leased directly to homeowners. Effectively, this means that residential portfolios can only utilize tax credits in states where the use of a PPA or other offtake arrangement is allowed under local laws. Certain states and territories, like Puerto Rico, for example, prohibit developers from selling electricity directly to homeowners. Residential solar developers have relied on rooftop leases as a way to allow homeowners to benefit from rooftop generation systems in those states.

The partnership builds on an existing collaboration between the two companies and signals a broader ambition: to extend the role of GM’s EV battery technology beyond vehicles and into critical energy infrastructure.

The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding — it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s Vice President of Batteries, Propulsion, and Sustainability. “GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars — we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.

Repurposing Batteries to Reinforce the Grid

Redwood Materials, led by former Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, recently launched Redwood Energy, a new venture deploying both used EV battery packs and new battery modules into low-cost, high-speed energy storage systems. These systems are built to meet surging demand from AI data centers, industrial sectors, and backup grid applications.

GM’s repurposed EV batteries are already in action, helping to power North America’s largest second-life battery project and microgrid — a 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, Nevada, supporting AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

Addressing a Growing National Need

The urgency for scalable energy storage is rising fast. According to industry projections, AI data centers are expected to triple their share of national electricity use, jumping from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. This growth places immense pressure on the national grid, amplifying the need for systems that can store and deploy electricity during peak loads or outages.

However, he later reversed course, bringing mining projects under the scope of the new streamlined licensing framework.
A joint manifesto signed by parliamentary fronts focused on social, environmental, and human rights issues warned that the bill represents a “serious rollback” in Brazil’s environmental policy.
It argued that the proposal weakens oversight mechanisms, diminishes public participation in licensing processes, and jeopardizes the country’s Ecological Transformation Pact.
“We believe it is possible to create a more modern environmental licensing law than the one we have today.","In a hybrid session that started at 11:44 p.m. on Wednesday (16) and extended into the early morning of Thursday, Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies approved the new legal framework for environmental licensing, effectively loosening and simplifying the rules for project approvals. The main text of the bill passed by a vote of 267 to 116, despite pressure from nearly 30 parliamentary caucuses, business groups, and civil society organizations to postpone the vote.

All proposed amendments were rejected, and some lawmakers from the governing coalition said they would challenge the bill’s constitutionality before the Federal Supreme Court (STF). The leader of the Workers’ Party (PT) in the lower house, Federal Deputy Lindbergh Farias (Rio de Janeiro), said he was “certain” that President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would veto the bill.

José Guimarães (PT of Ceará), the government’s leader in the Chamber of Deputies, stated that presidential aides had pushed to delay the vote until after the legislative recess, but this proved impossible. The government formally advised lawmakers to vote against the bill.

Throughout the day, business leaders, third-sector organizations, parliamentary groups, and academics renewed calls to postpone the vote. However, Chamber Speaker Hugo Motta (Republicans of Paraíba) proceeded with the session, even after tensions flared around 3 a.m. in an altercation between Federal Deputy Kim Kataguiri (Brazil Union of São Paulo) and Indigenous Federal Deputy Célia Xakriabá (Socialism and Freedom Party, PSOL of Minas Gerais), who was subjected to verbal abuse by colleagues mocking her ceremonial headdress. Ms. Xakriabá felt unwell and left the chamber.

The bill, sharply criticized by Environment Minister Marina Silva and dubbed the “Destruction Bill” by environmentalists, nonetheless received support from other ministries within Mr. Lula’s government, including Transportation, Cities, and Agriculture.

The legislation introduces the so-called License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), allowing automatic licensing based on self-declaration by project developers, eliminating the need for prior technical evaluations. Another controversial provision creates a Special Environmental License (LAE), which can be granted to projects deemed strategic—even if they carry significant environmental risks.

The bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Zé Vitor (Liberal Party, PL, of Minas Gerais), dismissed the criticism, saying it lacks technical merit. “It is purely ideological,” he told Valor. “What we’re dealing with here is an administrative, bureaucratic, and technical procedure. We’re establishing clear rules and deadlines, determining who can weigh in during the licensing process and when, and defining each stakeholder’s role,” he added.

Mr. Vitor initially amended the Senate’s version of the bill to exclude mining activities, subjecting them only to resolutions from the National Environmental Council (Conama) until dedicated legislation could be enacted. However, he later reversed course, bringing mining projects under the scope of the new streamlined licensing framework.

Lawmakers also upheld a Senate provision that effectively relaxes rules and eases the approval process for offshore oil exploration in the Amazonas River Mouth, part of Brazil’s Equatorial Margin oil province. This measure was championed by Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union of Amapá), a leading advocate for oil drilling in the area.

In a win for the Agricultural Parliamentary Front (FPA), the bill preserves the exemption for the agricultural sector from licensing requirements, provided activities comply with the Forest Code. The legislation also repeals certain provisions of the Atlantic Forest Law.

A joint manifesto signed by parliamentary fronts focused on social, environmental, and human rights issues warned that the bill represents a “serious rollback” in Brazil’s environmental policy. It argued that the proposal weakens oversight mechanisms, diminishes public participation in licensing processes, and jeopardizes the country’s Ecological Transformation Pact.

In an interview with Valor, businessman Pedro Passos, co-founder of cosmetics giant Natura, also advocated for more time to debate the bill. “We believe it is possible to create a more modern environmental licensing law than the one we have today. There are many opportunities to improve it and reduce bureaucratic hurdles, but not the way this proposal is being handled,” he said.

Mr. Passos further highlighted the negative optics of passing such legislation in a year when Brazil is set to host the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30), especially amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims that deforestation risks are grounds for a trade investigation against Brazil. “This creates unnecessary vulnerability at a sensitive moment,” he stated.

On the other hand, Rodrigo Justus, environmental advisor for the Brazilian Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock (CNA), praised the bill, saying it “modernizes, speeds up, and cuts red tape” in the licensing process. According to him, the measure will lower logistical costs and provide greater legal certainty.

In our high coal demand case, coal generation is, on average, 32% higher than in our base case from 2025 to 2050.

CCUS remains the holy grail of coal power CCUS technology theoretically solves coal's biggest challenge: to maintain operations while capturing CO2 emissions.","The world is facing a stark reality: coal-fired power could be a bigger part of the energy mix for longer than expected, scuppering efforts to meet climate change goals. New realities for energy markets in recent years have become more, not less, supportive of coal-fired power.

Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine and the turmoil in the Middle East have pushed energy security to the top of government agendas. Power demand growth is surging around the globe. Large loads driven by the proliferation of data centres and energy-intensive manufacturing mean energy markets are pulling in all the power they can get, often regardless of carbon intensity. What’s more, coal technology has room to run with the prospect of lower-emission innovations that could make coal more palatable in a renewables-dominated world.

Despite falling coal demand across Europe, the US, Japan and South Korea, the availability of cheap domestic coal resources continues to drive strong demand in the power sectors of many economies across South and Southeast Asia. China is the key driver of our outlook for peak coal as renewables, nuclear and hydro expand, but coal has proved resilient even as the country’s energy transition gathers pace.

In this issue of Horizons, we explore how energy security, power demand and technology choices risk the greater use of coal for longer. Anchored by a new high demand case for coal, developed specifically for this Horizons report, we examine the drivers of a higher outlook for coal and what this means for investors, technologies and global climate goals.

Predictions of ‘peak coal’ have long proved premature, however. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2015 Paris Accord and the global agreement at COP26 in 2021 all fired up optimism that coal had had its day, but global coal demand has continued to rise nonetheless. Between 2013 and 2025, China’s coal-fired power output increased by more than 36% as its economy doubled in size. Right now, coal is the single largest source of electricity generation globally.

This underscores the reality that coal demand has consistently proven more resilient than expected. We continue to believe that our base-case forecast of peak coal demand in 2026 is the most likely outcome, but have developed a high coal demand case, in which coal demand is more resilient for three key reasons:

Energy security and affordability: For several of Asia’s largest and fastest-growing economies, coal is a strategic domestic resource that supports energy security, affordability and employment.

Power demand growth: In an era of rapid power demand growth driven by data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and wider electrification, governments and companies may opt to run existing coal assets harder and longer, slowing investment in lower-carbon alternatives.

Technological improvements: Progress in the use of coal as a flexible power supply source, and advances in technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen co-firing, could improve the emissions profile of coal plants, extending their operational life.

In our high coal demand case, the world’s power systems are still dominated by low-carbon sources of power. But nine countries in Asia hold the cards to the future of coal. In a departure from our base case, coal demand in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh grows faster, reflecting stronger capacity growth and young asset lifetimes. Markets such as Malaysia, Thailandand the Philippines with an effective moratorium on new-build coal could alter course if cheape rcoal can sway the debate. In recent years, China has proven adept at running its coal assets harder to meet strong demand growth and could repeat this as its power demand climbs.

In our high coal demand case, coal generation is, on average, 32% higher than in our base case from 2025 to 2050. Coal still peaks, but around four years later than our base case, in 2030. This is followed by a slower plateau for coal through 2050.

With higher coal burn, there is a corresponding slowdown in zero-carbon power capacity, energy storage and natural gas-fired power. Wind, solar, energy storage and natural gas capacity falls by around 2,100 GW from 2025 to 2050. Reducing carbon emissions would become an even greater challenge. Without significant investment in carbon capture and storage capacity, unabated emissions from the coal sector rise by 2 billion tonnes compared with our base case.

China and India are the bedrock of global coal demand. The world's largest coal producers and consumers, both regard their vast coal resources as pillars of their energy security and are working to limit energy imports. China mined more than 4 billion tonnes of thermal coal last year, covering 90% of its total coal demand, and its government has been clear that despite massive investment in clean energy, it will prioritise energy security ahead of phasing out coal. India continues to expand domestic coal production to reduce its import reliance, producing over 1 billion tonnes for the first time in the 2024-25 fiscal year.

Coal production globally sustains substantial direct and indirect employment, serving as a vital driver of local and regional economic activity. Provinces and states such as Shanxi in China and Jharkhand in India rely on coal-mining royalties and taxes as essential revenue sources. These funds underpin economic development, social welfare programmes and infrastructure investment.

Coal-fired power also helps to keep energy prices low across Asian markets. Domestically produced 5,500 kcal/kg bituminous coal in India and China currently ranges between US$3-$4 per mmbtu at the power plant. Domestic coals cover 85% to 90% of demand in China and India.

Comparatively, seaborne thermal coal markets have proven to be extremely volatile. While prices can be competitive with domestic markets, prices for an equivalent imported coal climbed to more than US$14/per mmbtu following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Pacific basin LNG prices are currently more than double the price of domestically produced coal. Like imported coal, LNG prices have surged as high as US$36 per mmbtu. Countries that import energy have an economic incentive to double down on domestic coal production.

Latest coal-fired plant innovations provide flexibility

Between 2020 and 2025, China has deployed 200 GW of advanced coal plant capacity via retrofits, corresponding to more than 15% of its current 1,200 GW fleet. The new capacity allows flexible ‘deep load-following’ operations. India is on a similar path, with about 6 GW of its 228 GW coal fleet undergoing pilot-phase retrofits.

Upgraded coal units support variable renewable generation in a similar vein to gas power plants. Supporting high renewable output periods, these plants can sustain lower minimum power output levels in the 20-40% range, compared with 50% for traditional coal plants. Flexible coal plants can achieve faster ramp-rates of 5% or more of maximum load per minute and quicker hot starts of two hours or less, compared with 1-2% and four hours for normal coal plants.

These plants typically require support from capacity payments or other market mechanisms, however. Such support helps to offset higher operating costs from lower efficiencies, higher fuel consumption and increased maintenance from unit cycling and ramping. Without adequate compensation, plant economics become challenging. Policy support will be critical to the widespread adoption of flexible coal operations.

CCUS remains the holy grail of coal power

CCUS technology theoretically solves coal's biggest challenge: to maintain operations while capturing CO2 emissions. Currently, coal plants with CCUS are few and far between. Only two commercial-scale operations exist – one in the US and one in Canada, with a Chinese demonstration plant under construction.

The biggest barrier to CCUS projects at power plants is their exceedingly high operating and capital costs. Higher utilisation rates for coal-fired power would help support the economic argument for investing in CCUS. Carbon storage costs, however, will be a limit to how far coal with CCUS can scale up in Asia. Markets such as Japan and South Korea require capital-intensive cross-border CCUS trade because they have limited domestic storage capacity. If these countries abate thermal capacity, they are likely to jump to natural gas, which generates less carbon per TWh of electricity.

To address cost challenges, investment incentives and adequate policy support are required, including grants, capital investment and production-based tax credits, infrastructure development, and government-backed CO2 offtake agreements, coupled with clear permitting and liability policy frameworks.

Coal plants can co-fire with alternative fuels

The next generation of co-firing technology to reduce coal-plant emissions rests with ammonia and hydrogen. Co-firing involves burning ammonia or hydrogen alongside coal to generate electricity. Japan and South Korea are leading the charge to test and implement this technology in their coal fleets. Other countries, including Indonesia, India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, are conducting trials and studies.

Future success with ammonia and hydrogen co-firing depends heavily on several factors, including overcoming high costs, a need for significant government incentives and technological challenges. Infrastructure and logistics also present major hurdles. Initial optimism in Japan and South Korea appears to have subsided amid high costs and relatively limited gains: achieving 50% ammonia co-firing in coal plants results in similar net CO2 emissions to those from unabated gas-fired plants. Plus, additional harmful nitrogen oxide emissions are generated during co-firing.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/horizons/2025/july-2025/horizons-july-2025-epi-website-asset.png?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-07-17 08:10:18.964431

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said solar photovoltaic (PV) technology continues to evolve rapidly and remains the backbone of the country's clean energy transition, highlighting the importance of continued investment.

""Demand for renewable electricity is expected to increase significantly as Australia moves towards net zero. Ultra low-cost solar PV is a critical source of electricity to meet this demand and will be a crucial enabler of the energy transition.""

""ARENA has been at the forefront of investing in solar innovation since the Agency was established 13 years ago and has materially shifted the renewable energy landscape in Australia.""

""Our ultra low-cost vision recognises that solar must be cheaper still to support and enable the renewable energy transition, especially if we are to decarbonise heavy industry and create new export industries. This funding round is seeking the pioneering innovation Australia is so well known for in solar PV to achieve that vision.""

The $60 million funding round reflects ARENA's increased ambition for the next generation of innovation in solar PV through six focus areas across two streams:

Stream 1: Cells and modules ($30 million)

Increase efficiency

Reduce cost

Improve stability

Stream 2: Balance of systems and operation and maintenance ($30 million)

Reduce balance of system deployment costs

Reduce operations and maintenance costs

Other LCOE reduction or innovation to increase yield.

To date, ARENA has provided over $388 million to solar PV R&D and an additional $104 million to support the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP).

This new funding round provides an opportunity for Australia's leading universities, research groups, start-ups and entrepreneurs to make significant breakthroughs in achieving ARENA's ultra low-cost solar vision of reducing the installed cost of solar to 30 cents per watt and bringing the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) below $20 per megawatt hour by 2030.

In the last decade, solar R&D in Australia has led to major breakthroughs in photovoltaics that have helped shape the global solar industry; driving down the cost of solar power, strengthening Australia's leadership in solar research and supporting the growth of a vibrant renewable energy sector.

ARENA's previous support has enabled researchers to push the limits of solar cell efficiency by exploring advanced characterisation techniques, enhancing solar cell and module reliability and stability, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to better monitor and optimise PV system performance, and pioneering recycling solutions to reduce waste and support a circular solar economy.

Their work has also enabled the development of next-generation technologies, including tandem solar cells, lightweight flexible panels and innovative manufacturing processes, unlocking new possibilities for solar energy.

The Solar PV R&D funding round is now open. For more information on applying, please visit the ARENA funding page.

Two days after Stevenson issued his recommendation, the state House on April 30 gave final approval to a bill aimed at preventing oil drilling near the Apalachicola River.
Ron DeSantis signed the bill (HB 1143) on June 26, 10 days after the Department of Environmental protection denied the Clearwater Land & Minerals permit.","TALLAHASSEE — A company that wants to drill for oil near the Apalachicola River has gone to an appeals court after the Florida Department of Environmental Protection last month denied a permit for the project.

Louisiana-based Clearwater Land & Minerals Fla. filed a notice Tuesday that is a first step in appealing the Department of Environmental Protection’s decision to the 1st District Court of Appeal.

The notice, as is common, does not detail arguments that the company will make at the Tallahassee-based appeals court. But it is the latest development in a controversy that spurred state lawmakers in April to pass a measure aimed at preventing oil drilling near the Apalachicola River and Apalachicola Bay.

The Department of Environmental Protection last year approved a draft permit for Clearwater Land & Minerals to drill an exploratory well in an unincorporated part of Calhoun County, which is between Tallahassee and Panama City.

But the environmental group Apalachicola Riverkeeper challenged the draft permit at the state Division of Administrative Hearings. Opponents argued, in part, that oil spills could harm the river and bay, which the state and federal governments have long taken steps to try to protect.

Administrative Law Judge Lawrence P. Stevenson in April issued a 53-page recommended order that said the permit should be denied. Under administrative law, the issue then went back to the department for a final decision.

Reversing course on last year’s draft-permit decision, the department on June 16 issued an order denying the permit. Clearwater Land & Minerals is appealing that order.

In his recommendation, Stevenson wrote that the proposed site would be within the 100-year floodplain of the river, was within a mile of two ponds that are hydrologically connected to the river and was surrounded by swamplands. In addressing last year’s draft permit, he wrote that the “DEP and Clearwater took an exceedingly narrow view of the scope of the project for purposes of environmental review, limiting it to the immediate location of the drilling pad on the site.”

“A spill would have catastrophic consequences due to the proximity of the well to nearby streams, wetlands and ponds,” Stevenson wrote.

But Clearwater Land & Minerals has argued that the environment would be protected in the project. Also the Department of Environmental Protection in 2019 approved a permit for another company to drill on the same Calhoun County site. That company did not end up drilling.

Two days after Stevenson issued his recommendation, the state House on April 30 gave final approval to a bill aimed at preventing oil drilling near the Apalachicola River. The bill would effectively prevent drilling within 10 miles of the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the bill (HB 1143) on June 26, 10 days after the Department of Environmental protection denied the Clearwater Land & Minerals permit.

Ucore has emerged as one of the few companies in North America pursuing rare earth processing.
The fully computerized facility produces light and heavy rare earth oxides with raw material from Australia and Brazil, and has a current annual output of 110 tons.
He foresees producing heavy rare earth magnet materials in Louisiana — such as terbium, neodymium, samarium and praseodymium — and using Kingston to produce cerium and gadolinium.
Ucore also owns a rare earth deposit in Alaska, but building a mine isn’t a priority given the need for processing capability in North America.","Canada’s Ucore Rare Metals Inc. aims to start producing rare earth elements at a new Louisiana facility next May, boosting US processing capacity in an industry that’s currently dominated by China.

The move comes as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to increase domestic production of rare earths, which are strategically vital for weapons and other high-tech applications.

The company is transforming an 80,000-square-foot building on a former Air Force base into an $80 million plant for rare earth magnet materials — including some metals that are under China export restrictions.

Ucore has been able to move ahead with processing at a bigger scale after securing a site designated as a foreign trade zone. Such zones allow companies to delay or reduce duty payments, and enable duty-free treatment on re-exported goods.

“You can bring inputs from Brazil, you can process the material and send it back to Japan for magnet making and there’s no tariff consequence coming in, coming out,” chief executive officer Pat Ryan said in an interview.

Ucore began work in June turning the building at England Airpark in Alexandria, Louisiana into a facility to process and refine rare earths — key ingredients in a range of applications for defense, electric vehicle manufacturing and consumer electronics. The company received $18.4 million from the US Defense Department for the first of four phases of construction.

The company aims to produce as much as 3,000 tons of rare earths next year and reach 12,000 tons by 2027 when the entire plant is finished, Ryan said.

Ucore was founded in 2006 and its stock trades in both Canada and the US. Shares have more than doubled this year, giving the Halifax, Nova Scotia-based firm a market value of around $100 million. Ucore jumped as much as 14% in Toronto Wednesday to its highest price in two months.

Ucore has emerged as one of the few companies in North America pursuing rare earth processing. MP Materials Corp. has a commercial-scale operation in California, Saskatchewan Research Council is ramping up production at a plant in Western Canada and Energy Fuels Inc. has processing capacity at a facility in Utah.

Ucore built a demonstration plant in Kingston, Ontario three years ago that’s the size of two tennis courts. The fully computerized facility produces light and heavy rare earth oxides with raw material from Australia and Brazil, and has a current annual output of 110 tons.

Ryan said he is already thinking about building a second plant, probably in Ontario. He foresees producing heavy rare earth magnet materials in Louisiana — such as terbium, neodymium, samarium and praseodymium — and using Kingston to produce cerium and gadolinium.

The company is in talks with a range of potential buyers for its end product, including defense contractors, multinationals involved in the Japanese market, electric vehicle contractors and a wastewater treatment firm.

Ucore also owns a rare earth deposit in Alaska, but building a mine isn’t a priority given the need for processing capability in North America. Ryan said his team had a “eureka moment” in 2018 that prompted them to shift focus to refining to counter China’s dominance across the supply chain.

“If you control the refining, you’ll control the resource,” he said.

In short, it’s a great time to buy your first electric car.
Some estimates have China’s global EV share at 80 percent by 2030.
Why abandon such a direct trade-war tool — subsidies that make a major American industry globally competitive?
The global EV transition will probably continue without us.","If you’re an American looking to buy a car right now, you’ll notice an awful lot of deals on electric vehicles. Ford is offering free home chargers; it’s also offering EV loans at 0 percent — as are Chevy, Hyundai, Nissan, Polestar, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Lots of EV-makers are offering cash bonuses, and leases are shockingly cheap. In short, it’s a great time to buy your first electric car.

Stacked deals and convoluted promos are standard for EVs, which have tended to be more expensive than their internal-combustion counterparts and which automakers are still trying to figure out how to market to the American public. But there’s unusual urgency right now because, as a dealer might put it, time is running out: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act gets rid of a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs (and a $4,000 credit for used ones). EVs are cheaper than they’ve ever been but are about to get significantly more expensive. When they do, a recent slowdown after nearly a decade of rapid EV sales growth threatens to turn all the way around.

Automakers have been expecting this for a while, which means we already have a pretty good idea of how they’ll respond: by scrapping plans for some new EVs, particularly models targeted at the massive (but globally unusual) American market. Ford and Honda have pulled back from plans to release large electric SUVs. Like Tesla, Ford is hoping to push into cheaper (and perhaps smaller) EVs, which is a sensible general strategy, but it will take a while to overcome the loss of government incentives in the U.S. (The expiring tax credits were limited to cars that meet certain production criteria and price rules, so they won’t matter as much for luxury models, but losing a $7,500 credit on a $35,000 car is a big deal.) Economists have also had time to model what might happen if incentives were to disappear, with one estimate by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research predicting a massive drop in sales, pulling total annual EV units by more than 300,000 and sending them back to under a million a year.

In the narrow context of American domestic politics, an EV-credit repeal under a Republican administration isn’t so strange. The credits were a Democratic invention extended and expanded by the last administration, a costly government intervention made, at least in part, in the name of environmentalism. And despite the head of America’s largest electric-vehicle company helping to get Donald Trump elected for a second term, attitudes toward EVs remain politically polarized. Rather than transcending the culture wars, the EV brand has somehow been pulled into them even more. (Tesla’s big current sales pitch is a warning that the credits are about to expire.)

In the wider context of the global auto market — and within the feverish trade-war logic of the Trump administration — the move is harder to make sense of. EV incentives were always partially about industrial policy in relation to China, and their Biden-era extension carried with it provisions intended to onshore battery production and penalize automakers for relying too much on imported technology. (In 2024, Republicans criticized these measures for not being stringent enough.) Chinese EVs may be invisible to the U.S. market, where they’re subject to heavy tariffs, but they vastly outnumber units made by European and American companies in the rest of the world.

Some estimates have China’s global EV share at 80 percent by 2030. The Chinese government’s massive subsidies and support for the industry have helped keep EV prices artificially low. But now, cars from companies like BYD and Geely (which now owns Volvo and Polestar, among other western-oriented brands) are quite good and very cheap without the state-support caveat.

China has flipped the affordability equation … even without subsidies. BYD’s compact Seagull BEV, priced around USD 11,000, was one of the best-selling models globally in 2024. In Thailand, BEV prices have reached parity with conventional cars, and in Brazil, the price gap shrank from over 100% in 2023 to 25% in 2024.

Why abandon such a direct trade-war tool — subsidies that make a major American industry globally competitive? Maybe this is about satisfying the oil industry, which has been vocally against EV subsidies (and supportive of Trump). Maybe it’s about undoing as much Democratic legislation as possible. Or maybe it’s just that Trump dislikes, or has learned from his supporters to dislike, the EV concept in general, which, when he’s not selling Teslas on the White House lawn, he calls a “hoax” and a “transition to hell.”

In the near term — and amid a slowdown in American EV sales that predated the Big Beautiful Bill Act — it looks as though the United States will be effectively sitting out the global EV race for a while, or at least coming to grips with drawing up the rear for a few years.

In the long term, things could get quite a bit weirder. In a world of relatively free trade, the Trump-era EV drawdown could be a chance for American companies to (painfully) reorient their EV businesses around international markets instead of building electric SUVs and performance cars. Or perhaps it will just result in a series of lost years from which the industry never quite recovers. That scenario would leave China — MAGA enemy No. 2, apparently, after the Biden administration’s legislative record — to dominate the global automotive industry of the future. In a world with more trade restrictions or continued hostility to EVs and EV infrastructure, the rest of the world may simply move on, turning the United States, now the second-biggest car market in the world, into an island of gas. The global EV transition will probably continue without us.

According to the company, the project is a first in the UK automotive industry – establishing an electric, end-to-end supply chain that transports materials into the Nissan plant and delivers finished vehicles out. The project is the first on site private shared charging station of its kind in the UK.

The electric truck charging station will potentially save 1,500 tonnes of CO2 a year.

The £1.4m facility has seven charging stations, capable of powering up to 10 eHGVs simultaneously. It complements the plant’s EV36Zero vision for sustainable manufacturing, bringing together electric vehicles, renewable energy and battery production.

Michael Simpson, Vice President Supply Chain Management, Nissan AMIEO, said:

“It is fantastic for our plant to be leading the charge to an electrified supply chain with this project.

“We welcome the support we’ve received from our partners to bring the charging station to life and we’re proud of what we have achieved.

“The charging station looks brilliant and is a big step forward in Nissan’s EV360 vision, which brings together electric vehicles. zero carbon energy and battery manufacturing.”

The station will support 60 UK eHGV deliveries to the plant daily and represents just the start of the plant’s journey towards electrifying its supply chain.

Simpson added: “We’re exploring further opportunities to allow other hauliers to use the charging station as well as looking at other opportunities to maximise its full potential.”

The charging station will support a fleet of 25 trucks with a charging capacity of up to 360kW. The trucks will collect parts from Nissan’s UK supply base stretching as far afield as Derby; as well as delivering finished vehicles to and from the Port of Tyne. That equates to more than 2.4 million kilometers travelled per year, fully electrified, saving 1,500 tonnes of CO2 annually.

Bringing together Nissan, Fergusons, Yusen and BCA, the project is part of the Electric Freightway consortium that is transforming sustainable freight logistics through deployment of eHGVs and high-power charging infrastructure.

Led by GRIDSERVE, Electric Freightway forms part of the Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Demonstrator programme, funded by the UK Government and delivered in partnership with Innovate UK.

UK Government Minister for the Future of Roads Lilian Greenwood said:

“We’re working closely with the road freight sector to slash transport emissions, and our £200m zero emission HGV programme is helping businesses across the country to power the electrification of its fleets.

“It’s great to see Nissan taking advantage of our scheme which is supporting high paid jobs and putting money in the pockets of working people – all part of delivering our Plan for Change.’

Daniel Kunkel, CEO, GRIDSERVE said:

“The decarbonisation of transport logistics is much stronger and reaches far wider when done in partnership.

“This is why, as leaders of the Electric Freightway consortium, we are so pleased to support this UK first with Nissan and their haulage partners. Depot charging is critical for the electrification of HGVs, going hand in hand with future public infrastructure developments.

“As a first shared usage site, this location is leading the way in sustainable freight logistics.”",https://transportandenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nissan-electrifies-supply-chain-with-electric-truck-charging-station.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 09:07:07.332854

This lack of apartment and condo chargers is a “pinch point” in the EV market that California could take the lead in solving.
Despite having the most EVs, California is a punch line in the charging industry.
Sacramento just reformed the California Environmental Quality Act to accelerate home building; it should do the same for EV charging and make building high-speed public “rechargeries” faster and easier.
Gavin Newsom, a longtime EV driver, and the state Legislature can fill the void left by Washington, championing EV manufacturing jobs and keeping California and the nation competitive in the race to electrify transportation.","When he signed his budget bill into law on July 4, President Trump dealt a heavy blow to America’s electric vehicle industry, ending most federal support for U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing and hobbling automakers’ $100-billion effort to catch up with China, the world’s new automotive manufacturing superpower. Now California alone has the size and market power to fill the void left by Washington’s surrender. Our leaders in Sacramento must step up.

The gutting of EV support never got the national debate it deserved. Americans, including many in Congress, fail to see the real EV issue: China. As the world moves toward a future auto market dominated by electric vehicles — a reality no global auto executive doubts — China has seized the opportunity. It’s China, not the United States, the European Union or Japan, that now rules global automotive manufacturing. For every car, SUV or pickup built in America, China builds about three, and the Chinese have the manufacturing muscle to build five.

Detroit understands this. Along with their European and Asian peers, U.S. automakers have invested tens of billions in North American factories to build the next generation of EVs and compete in global markets. This month at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley put it bluntly: “If we lose this [the race for EVs], we do not have a future Ford.”

Unfortunately, the Trump administration is forcing free-world automakers to race against China at a disadvantage. Chinese automakers, awash in government help and subsidies, now manufacture 70% of the world’s EVs. Their advanced, low-priced cars are quickly taking market share in Australia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Mexico is a sobering example. In 2017, 1% of Mexican cars came from China. Last year that number was 20%.

Despite China’s success, have no doubt that U.S., European, South Korean and Japanese automakers can compete. Much of the EV technology that the Chinese have exploited was first developed in the United States. Although China has more than 100 EV brands, only a handful are profitable; many will fade away. For America and its allies to compete in this race, carmakers must succeed in their anchor American market. (Remember, most foreign car companies — Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes — build EVs in the United States, employing thousands of Americans.)

What makes California so important? First, it’s America’s EV leader; over a third of all U.S. EV sales are here; 1 in 4 cars sold in California is electric. Second, California is on the front line of the U.S. auto industry’s research and development battle with China. Lucid developed its world-class power train technology in Orange County. Rivian, in Irvine, licensed its world-class software and electrical architecture to Volkswagen for billions. Tesla has two large factories and several labs here, employing more than 40,000 workers. Ford, the pride of Detroit, has bet the company’s future on a California skunkworks, where hundreds of engineers are working on a new, affordable EV platform designed to compete worldwide.

What can California do to fill the massive void in EV support left by Washington? Plenty. Here are three priorities.

Save consumer credits. Until Sept. 30, buying or leasing a new EV still qualifies for a $7,500 federal credit. When that ends, California should replace it with a $3,500 state credit to lower most lease payments by nearly $100 a month (as any auto salesman knows, consumers make their decisions based more on monthly payments, not total cost.) The $3,500 credit should also apply to used EV sales.

The state has a tangle of consumer EV subsidies; this simple approach should replace them.

To control costs to taxpayers, lawmakers could make these “conquest” credits — that is, they would be limited to first-time EV buyers and leasers. This program should not have income limits. The more new EV drivers the better because data show that most consumers happily stick with EVs once they have leased or bought one. Income limits would simply limit sales volume.

Fix the multifamily charging problem. Many Californians in large metropolitan areas such as L.A. or San Francisco live in apartments or condos without the convenience and cost savings of overnight charging. Instead, they are often forced to wait in line at fast-charging stations, where electricity prices are usually higher than at home. This lack of apartment and condo chargers is a “pinch point” in the EV market that California could take the lead in solving.

Sacramento should agree to fund landlords’ and condo boards’ Level 2 charger installation costs. By my calculations, for the average cost of one six-nozzle fast-charging station, more than 120 multifamily parking spaces could get permanent Level 2 chargers. Tenants would pay for the electricity system maintenance; landlords could charge a modest monthly fee for Level 2-enabled parking spaces.

This would not only spur EV sales among working families but also create thousands of good, union infrastructure jobs. A bonus: Many of California’s full-time ride-hail drivers use EVs and live in apartments. Access to overnight charging where they live would convert their current daytime charging time into earning time and probably reduce their overall energy costs.

Fast-track fast-charging permits. Despite having the most EVs, California is a punch line in the charging industry. Building gas-station–style fast-charging stations here is difficult because of utility company delays and permitting headaches. As a result, billions of dollars in private capital ready to invest in charging infrastructure has been chased out of California. Of the first wave of fast-charging stations built by Ionna, a well-funded consortium of eight automakers, just one is in California. Sacramento just reformed the California Environmental Quality Act to accelerate home building; it should do the same for EV charging and make building high-speed public “rechargeries” faster and easier.

,EVs,2025-07-17 11:32:12+00:00,CNN,China puts new restrictions on EV battery technology in latest move to consolidate dominance - CNN,John Liu,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/business/china-new-export-controls-ev-battery-intl-hnk,"Several technologies used to manufacture EV batteries and process lithium, a critical mineral for batteries, were added to the government’s export control list.
Huge numbers of car manufacturers around the world use Chinese EV batteries in their vehicles.
Chinese EV battery makers accounted for at least 67% of the global market share, according to SNE Research, a market research and consultancy firm.

And Gotion, another major EV battery maker in China, has plans to build a production plant in Illinois.","China has put export restrictions on technologies critical for producing electric vehicle batteries, in a move to consolidate its dominance in the sector that has contributed to the country’s lead in the global EV race.

Several technologies used to manufacture EV batteries and process lithium, a critical mineral for batteries, were added to the government’s export control list.

Inclusion on the list means transferring the technologies overseas – such as through trade, investment, or technological cooperation – will require a government-issued license, according to a statement by the country’s Commerce Ministry.

The new controls mirror similar restrictions introduced just three months ago on certain rare earth elements and their magnets – critical materials used not only in EV production, but also in consumer electronics and military equipment such as fighter jets. China’s dominance of the rare earths supply chain has emerged as among its most potent tools in a renewed trade war with the United States.

China has emerged as a leading player in the competitive global EV market, thanks in part to its ability to develop high-performance, cost-effective batteries through its comprehensive supply chain, from raw material processing to battery manufacturing.

Huge numbers of car manufacturers around the world use Chinese EV batteries in their vehicles. Chinese EV battery makers accounted for at least 67% of the global market share, according to SNE Research, a market research and consultancy firm.

First proposed in January, the latest licensing requirements have cast uncertainty over Chinese EV makers’ overseas expansion plans, particularly as markets like the European Union have employed tariffs on Chinese car exports to push them to set up shop there. Many Chinese battery makers also have plans to localize production in markets such as Southeast Asia and the US.

The Commerce Ministry said the restrictions “aim to safeguard national economic security and development interests, and promote international economic and technological cooperation.”

Liz Lee, an associate director at Counterpoint Research, said the move “deepens the emerging geopolitical tech decoupling beyond materials to process IP (intellectual property).” She added that this could accelerate efforts by the US, EU and others to boost localization of precursor materials and metal refining capabilities.

China’s CATL, the world’s largest EV battery producer and a key supplier of Tesla, has plants in Germany and Hungary and has plans for a joint venture factory in Spain with Stellantis, the owner of Fiat and Chrysler. It is also licensing its technology to be used in a Ford EV battery plant under construction in Michigan.

Meanwhile, Chinese EV giant BYD, which manufactures its own battery and surged past Tesla in 2024 sales to become the world’s largest EV maker, has EV production facilities around the world, from Hungary and Thailand to Brazil.

And Gotion, another major EV battery maker in China, has plans to build a production plant in Illinois.

Analysts said the true impact of the new export controls remains uncertain, as details are still unclear.

Lee noted the restrictions “appear to target upstream process technologies… rather than battery cell and module manufacturing.”

Since CATL’s plants in Germany and Hungary focus on cell and module production and do not appear to replicate the restricted processes locally, the near-term effect may be limited, she said.

For BYD, which only assembles battery packs overseas and does not manufacture battery cells abroad, the controls do not appear to affect operations at this stage, Lee added.

Vincent Sun, senior equity analyst at Morningstar covering China’s EV sector, said the ultimate impact would depend on how easily companies can obtain permits – something that “may take some extra time to see.”

CNN has reached out to CATL, BYD, Gotion and Ford for comment.

China’s dominance in EV batteries

One part of the newly announced restrictions surrounds the battery cathode production technology for the making of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, a type of lithium-ion battery that has become increasingly popular in EVs in the last five years for its lower price and greater safety. Another part focuses on the processing, refinement and extraction of lithium.

China dominates the production of LFP batteries and the processing of lithium globally, according to Fastmarkets, a United Kingdom-based research company. Last year, it held 94% market share for LFP production capacity and provided 70% of global processed lithium production.

But while LFP batteries amounted to 40% of the global EV market by capacity, adoption of them is more prevalent in EVs made by Chinese manufacturers than elsewhere, according to Adamas Intelligence, a data analysis and consultancy firm focusing on critical minerals and batteries.

James Edmondson, vice president in research at IDTechEx, a research firm, told CNN that despite LFP’s lower energy density, its much lower cost, compared with its common alternative battery made of nickel, manganese, and cobalt, has made it “a staple in lower-cost vehicles” and there are plans for greater adoption by EU and US automakers.

China’s dominance in LFP production means that “even for LFP produced outside of China, Chinese suppliers would still often play a part in the production of precursors to LFP cathodes,” he said.

China holds a “significant lead” in the technology itself, as shown by BYD’s “Super E-Platform” that promised a 250-mile range on just a five-minute charge, Edmondson added. The technology outperforms Tesla’s Superchargers, which take 15 minutes to deliver 200 miles.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2223598568.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-07-17 09:07:10.887063

However, the need for energy security and cleaner energies in the face of global warming are putting nuclear energy back on the agenda of some countries.

The accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011 was among the most serious in history. The disaster released large amounts of radiation and displaced more than 150,000 people.

It also marked a turning point in the energy policy of some countries in response to a public backlash and as they reassessed security of existing plants. Switzerland and Germany decided to phase out nuclear power. Other nations, including Belgium and Taiwan, reiterated their intention to shut down nuclear power plants.

Nearly 15 years after Fukushima, the atom is back in vogue. New power plants are being built around the world, and several governments, including Japan’s, plan to revive their atomic power generation programmes.

Why are some countries updating their nuclear policies?

International geopolitical crises such as the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East have raised questions about energy supply. Countries that import oil and gas can no longer rely on historic suppliers and are looking for alternatives. The European Commission, for example, plans to ban the import of Russian gas into the EU by the end of 2027.

Increasing electricity consumption is also a challenge for energy supplies. Electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres require large amounts of power that renewable sources cannot always supply reliably.

And then there is climate change. Nuclear power generates little CO2 compared to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency sees nuclear power as a key element of global decarbonisationExternal link.

A recent reportExternal link by the Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences (SCNAT) details the advantages of nuclear power: the atom provides low-carbon electricity, requires little space and few materials per kilowatt-hour produced and provides power regardless of weather conditions.

>> Claiming that nuclear power is a clean energy source is wrong, according to some researchers:

Which countries have nuclear power plants?

Thirty-two countries, or about one in six, produce some portion of their electricity from atomic energy. A total of 439 reactors are in operation worldwide, according to the most recent statisticsExternal link (June 2025) from the World Nuclear Association (WNA).

Nearly half are located in the United States, France and China, which are also major producers of nuclear power. Overall, nuclear power accounts for 9%External link of global electricity generation.

Switzerland has three nuclear power plants with a total of four reactors (Beznau I and II, Gösgen and Leibstadt) in operation. They produced about 23 terawatt hours of electricity in 2024, accounting for 28% of the country’s total electricity production.

Which countries are building nuclear plants?

Twenty-four countries are planning to build nuclear reactors or are already building them, according to the WNA. In China alone, 76 new plants will be operational in the next 15 years. Egypt, Turkey and Bangladesh are building their first nuclear power plants.

Thirty or so countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and France have committed to triple nuclear power generation capacity by 2050External link as part of efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Developing countries in Asia and Africa, such as Rwanda and Nigeria, are also considering the nuclear option to diversify and increase their electricity production.

The EU’s ambitious climate goals have led states such as Belgium and Italy – which had already closed its power plants in the late 1980s – to revise their previous opposition to nuclear power. Last May, Belgium officially abandoned its plans to phase out nuclear power.

Germany decommissioned its last reactors in 2023, but the new government may reconsider a return to nuclear energy. Denmark wants to analyse the potential benefits of new nuclear technologies and consider whether to lift its 40-year ban.

Japan, despite the Fukushima accident, has decided to rely again on nuclear powerExternal link to meet its emission reduction goals. Nuclear power could also make a comeback in Taiwan, despite the fact that the country has just completed a nuclear phase-out launched in 2016. A national referendum will be held on August 23 on the reactivation of its Maanshan reactor, which was shut down in May.

Are the new nuclear power plants safer today than 15 years ago?

The major nuclear power plants under construction around the world are mainly third-generationExternal link. They are ten to 100 times safer than existing ones, which are mostly second-generation, according to SCNAT. For example, they can cool automatically without an external power supply. In Fukushima it was the failure of cooling systems that caused the meltdown.

Fourth-generation reactorsExternal link can use alternative fuels such as thorium or waste from old plants. Cooling is no longer done with water, but with gases or liquid metals. While promising, these reactors are still at the prototype stage and “major uncertainties in terms of technology and profitability” remain, said SCNAT.

There is more than just the technical aspect, however. Some expertsExternal link stress the importance of developing a strong safety culture and closer cooperation between countries and their independent regulatory bodies.

Will Switzerland build a new nuclear power plant?

A few weeks after the Fukushima accident, the government drafted its national Energy Strategy 2050 strategy. This planned the gradual closure of existing nuclear power plants and a ban on the construction of new ones. This was backed in 2017 by the Swiss population.

However, today the debate on new nuclear power plants is also taking place in Switzerland.

The government plans to amend the Nuclear Power Act as part of its counterproposal to the “Stop Blackout” popular initiative, which calls for allowing all types of climate-friendly electricity generation. The government aims to leave the door open for new nuclear power plants if renewables are not sufficient to meet the nation’s electricity needs.

“I hope that the ban on the use of atomic energy will be removed from the Federal Nuclear Energy Act,” said Energy Minister Albert Rösti on July 8.

‘I hope that the ban on the use of atomic energy will be removed from the Federal Nuclear Energy Act.’

Energy Minister Albert Rösti

A 2023 reportExternal link by the federal technology institute ETH Zurich’s Energy Science Center says nuclear energy could be an option to achieve energy security in a net-zero future. But the construction time and costs for building nuclear power plants in Switzerland are uncertain.

SCNAT says construction of a nuclear power plant would take at least eight years. This is significantly less than the more than 16 years needed to build the Olkiluoto plant in Finland, which opened in 2023. The French company Electricité de France (EDF) built the two reactors of the Taishan power plant in China in nine years.

However, the construction in Switzerland needs to be preceded by a long political process, SCNAT points out. The project could fail throughout the process, such as if the initiative or the government’s counterproposal were rejected or if there were opposition from the public or local authorities to the construction permit.

“Any decision will be accompanied by uncertainties at all levels – political, economic and technical,” said Jochen Markard of ETH Zurich and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). A new power plant could be connected to the grid no earlier than 2050, according to SCNAT.

The facility has seven charging stations, capable of powering up to 10 electric HGVs simultaneously, and establishes an electric, end-to-end supply chain that transports materials into the Nissan plant and delivers finished vehicles out.

It complements the plant's EV36Zero vision for sustainable manufacturing, bringing together electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy and battery production.

Michael Simpson, vice president supply chain management at Nissan Amieo, said: “It is fantastic for our plant to be leading the charge to an electrified supply chain with this project.

“We welcome the support we've received from our partners to bring the charging station to life and we're proud of what we have achieved.

“The charging station looks brilliant and is a big step forward in Nissan's EV360 vision, which brings together electric vehicles. zero carbon energy and battery manufacturing.”

The station will support 60 UK electric HGV deliveries to the plant daily and, says Nissan, represents just the start of the plant's journey towards electrifying its supply chain.

Simpson added: “We’re exploring further opportunities to allow other hauliers to use the charging station as well as looking at other opportunities to maximise its full potential.”

The charging station will support a fleet of 25 trucks with a charging capacity of up to 360kW.

The trucks will collect parts from Nissan's UK supply base stretching as far afield as Derby; as well as delivering finished vehicles to and from the Port of Tyne.

That, says Nissan, equates to more than 2.4 million kilometres (1.5m miles) travelled per year, fully electrified, saving 1,500 tonnes of CO2 annually.

Bringing together Nissan, Fergusons, Yusen and BCA, the project is part of the Electric Freightway consortium that is transforming sustainable freight logistics through deployment of electric HGVs and high-power charging infrastructure.

Led by Gridserve, Electric Freightway forms part of the Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Demonstrator programme, funded by the UK Government and delivered in partnership with Innovate UK.

UK Government minister for the future of roads, Lilian Greenwood, said: “We’re working closely with the road freight sector to slash transport emissions, and our £200m zero emission HGV programme is helping businesses across the country to power the electrification of its fleets.

“It’s great to see Nissan taking advantage of our scheme which is supporting high paid jobs and putting money in the pockets of working people.”

Daniel Kunkel, CEO at Gridserve, added: “The decarbonisation of transport logistics is much stronger and reaches far wider when done in partnership.

“This is why, as leaders of the Electric Freightway consortium, we are so pleased to support this UK first with Nissan and their haulage partners.

“Depot charging is critical for the electrification of HGVs, going hand in hand with future public infrastructure developments.

“As a first shared usage site, this location is leading the way in sustainable freight logistics.”

The electric HGV charging depot comes as the Government has launched a new depot charging scheme for fleets with a £30 million fund, which was announced on Sunday (July 13).

Eligible businesses will have the opportunity to claim up to 75% of the costs associated with charger procurement and installation back, with a cap of £1m per applicant applicable to all sites.

The addition of another trier of sustainability at Nissan also comes as the Government stressed its new £650m electric car grant would be based on a carmaker’s sustainability standards.

-Athul

In April 2025, Slate Auto emerged from secrecy, surprising the automotive world. This new company, backed by Jeff Bezos, aims to produce an affordable, customizable electric pickup truck. Operating covertly for 3 years in Troy, Michigan, Slate Auto has been developing its unique business model and product.

Slate Auto's approach stands out in the U.S. electric vehicle sector, where many companies face challenges like bankruptcies and failed launches. Despite these hurdles, Slate's backers and innovative business model offer a promising path forward as they aim for production in late 2026. The company's journey from inception to its current status is noteworthy.

Slate Auto's Unique Business Model

Slate Auto's electric pickup truck is designed to be highly customizable. The base version is minimalistic, with a range of 150 miles and no power windows or infotainment system. Customers can personalize their vehicles extensively, even choosing the number of seats and overall design. This customization extends beyond initial purchase, allowing owners to modify their vehicles over time.

The company plans to produce these vehicles at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana. This facility spans 1.4 million square feet and had been unused for about two years before Slate identified it as their production site.

Early Success and Challenges

By May 2025, Slate Auto had already received over 100,000 refundable reservations for its affordable EV truck. This strong interest came despite the company's recent emergence into the public eye. However, changes in federal tax credits have affected pricing strategies. The Trump administration's tax-cut bill ended the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in September 2025.

This change forced Slate to adjust its pricing language on their website before the bill was signed into law. Initially promoting a starting price under $20,000 with the tax credit, they had to revise this claim due to the credit's removal.

Investment and Growth

Slate Auto's funding round in 2023 included at least 16 investors, one being Jeff Bezos. While most investors remain unidentified, Los Angeles-based Slauson & Co. shared insights into their decision to invest early in Slate Auto during both initial funding rounds.

The company has grown significantly since its inception in 2022 with just 18 employees in Troy; now over 400 people work there as they continue hiring more talent from various industries like GrubHub.

Innovative Features and Future Plans

Slate Auto offers an ""a la carte"" model for building electric vehicles that empowers customers to choose features based on necessity rather than luxury. For instance, power windows are optional while cruise control and air conditioning come standard.

The company also plans direct-to-customer sales without traditional dealerships involved—an approach inspired by other industries' best practices brought by new hires from diverse backgrounds.

The marshy area started Texas’ oil boom in 1901, when a gusher spewed 800,000 barrels of crude over nine days.

Now, while the area’s oil production has faded and a few industrial sites dot the landscape, Spindletop is home to what may become a new gold rush: underground natural gas storage.

The U.S. could face a shortage of natural gas storage capabilities because of rising demand for liquefied natural gas exports and gas-fueled electricity to help power artificial intelligence and data center hubs. If companies don’t boost storage capabilities as demand for natural gas expands, a crunch could upend natural gas prices and how the market works, said Jason Feit, an adviser to energy data provider Enverus.

“We’re getting really close to a timing mismatch risk where you’ve got LNG exports that are going to be in service and operating before new storage sites are going to be in service,” Feit said. “You can expect gas price volatility for the next few years and even more so if these storage projects don’t go forward.”

Natural gas production has risen by an average of 4.7 percent a year from 2013 to 2023, according to the American Gas Association. Underground natural gas storage capabilities, meanwhile, have grown by 0.1 percent annually from 2014 to 2023.

The trend is apparent near the U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. That’s where large LNG export facilities are expected to come online in the next decade.

But bringing underground storage online takes years, and some environmental groups and neighbors of gas facilities worry about safety risks — especially after a handful of accidents such as storage cavern collapses that have spawned sinkholes, swallowed personal property and triggered evacuations.

“It is not a clean track record,” said Matt Rota, a senior policy director with Healthy Gulf, an environmental group. “These injections can have impacts on drinking water and can cause seismic disturbances and other things as well.”

In response to questions from POLITICO’s E&E News, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said boosting natural gas production and LNG is a priority for the Trump administration.

“President Trump is leveraging every tool of government to boost natural gas production and LNG exports,” Fields said in a statement. “This stands as a major priority and success for President Trump, as we’ve already witnessed significant demand and interest from our trading partners for more American LNG.”

Roughly 306 billion cubic feet of natural gas is stored in salt domes across the country over a five-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while another 782 billion cubic feet of gas is stored underground in places like depleted oil and gas fields and old aquifers, typically located outside the Gulf Coast. The amount of gas in storage ebbs and flows based on seasonal demands.

Prices also change over time and can affect gas production levels as well as projects such as power plants that plan to run on natural gas. On Thursday, the U.S. benchmark natural gas price was trading for less than $4 per million British thermal units. Average spot prices last year swung from a high of $3.18 per million British thermal units in January to $1.49 per million British thermal units in March, according to EIA.

The science

Southeast Texas and Louisiana are dotted with little isolated mounds — but they’re not hills. They’re called salt domes, a geological formation that’s created when large masses of salt, buried thousands of feet underground, rise upward and pierce through layers of rock toward the surface, creating a domelike feature.

In the 1990s, the United States Geological Survey estimated there to be some 624 salt domes both onshore and offshore stretching from Texas to Mississippi.

For nearly 70 years, companies have used them to store natural gas, petroleum products, and other liquids and gases, said Siddarth Misra, an associate professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University.

Misra said salt is the ultimate sealed container for gas.

“First and foremost, salt, also known as halite, is incredibly dense and solid, meaning it has virtually no tiny holes or cracks for gas to sneak through,” Misra said in an email. “Unlike many other common rocks in the Earth’s crust, like sandstones, which are designed to hold and let fluids flow, salt acts as an almost impenetrable barrier.”

The process to create salt-dome storage starts with water — lots and lots of water. Crews drill into a salt formation and lay a pipeline that streams millions of barrels of water into the salt formation. The water chips away at the salt, becoming extra salty in the process. Once the extra salty water is removed, it leaves an empty void in the salt formation.

“You need anywhere from seven to 10 units of water, raw water, for every barrel of space you want to create,” said Scyller Borglum, underground storage lead in the U.S. with WSP, an engineering and professional services firm. “So if you want a 9-million-barrel cavern, you’re going to need anywhere from 63 to 90 million barrels of raw water.”

At Spindletop, a natural gas cavern owned by Entergy and operated by WSP gets water from a channel diverted from the Neches River.

Disposing of that extra salty water is another issue. At the Entergy storage facility, operators inject it underground through a disposal well. Borglum said other companies pipe it out into the ocean, dumping it about three miles offshore and diffusing it so it’s not as concentrated when it mingles with seawater.

“There are no chemicals involved, and so it literally is just saltwater, just highly, highly saturated saltwater that you’re pumping into the ocean, um, and that’s it. We wouldn’t be able to do that if there were any chemicals involved,” Borglum said.

But that disposal practice has raised concern among environmental groups, which argue that changing the chemistry of the water by adding more salt can damage the coastal ecosystem.

“All of this ocean life is adapted to a certain salinity level,” said Rota with Healthy Gulf. “So if you’re putting in a lot more salt, you’re going to basically impact this wildlife that have a very specific balance that they need for salinity.”

The economics

The amount of U.S. underground storage capacity has remained relatively stagnant for decades, according to Enverus’ Feit.

Natural gas companies, utilities and pipeline companies historically would buy and inject natural gas into the storage in the summer, when demand and prices were relatively low. Those companies would then withdraw the natural gas in winter, when many homes rely on natural gas for heating, and sell it at higher prices.

“Historically, it used to be somewhat predictable aside from the weather,” Feit said of the natural gas market. “So that delta between the value of gas in the winter and the value of gas in the summer used to be enough to cover the cost of building the storage field and paying the operator to store your gas.”

That began to change because of the U.S. shale boom earlier this century, when the use of fracking drilling technology led to a surge of natural gas production, especially closer to the Northeast. No longer were Northeastern natural gas customers needing to get gas piped from the Gulf Coast to Northern states — operators could pull it out of the ground as needed in places like Appalachia or the Marcellus Shale formation and deliver it on almost an as-needed basis, Feit said.

“So the requirement to use storage isn’t quite what it used to be because you can ramp up and down the gas that’s directly coming out of the wells a lot more than you used to be able to do historically,” he said.

The market is beginning to change.

Demand for natural gas is poised to boom in coming years. Last week, EIA forecasted that dry natural gas production could grow by more than 10 percent to as much as 44.3 trillion cubic feet a day in the early 2030s.

Some of that will help feed growing demand for electricity, which is expected to grow after decades of remaining stagnant in the United States. Texas has created a $10 billion loan plan to help bring new natural gas generation online. And Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, signed into law a bill to encourage new power generation, especially from natural gas sources.

Data centers and AI could also create a spike in power demand, with their share of power consumption forecast from about 4.4 percent of U.S. electricity consumption in 2023 to as much as 12 percent by 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

But more than anything, Feit said, there will be surging demand along the Gulf Coast as more LNG export facilities come online. He said projects capable of exporting a combined 10 billion cubic feet of LNG daily are expected to come online by the end of the decade, translating to a roughly 10 percent increase in natural gas demand in the Lower 48 states over that time period.

Without a way to store natural gas before export facilities can liquefy it and ship it off, natural gas prices could be more volatile.

“I think you might end up with more LNG being exported well in advance of these new storage facilities coming online — at least there’s a risk for that to happen,” Feit said. “And then if that occurs, then just the potential for gas price volatility becomes higher.”

Growing demand

Already, a supply-demand mismatch is showing up in data. EIA reported that the use of natural gas storage grew by 1.7 percent in 2024 “due to market conditions.” The amount of storage available grew by just 0.1 percent that year.

“What we observe is a market that’s growing, but our ability to store and transport gas kind of both across time and space is becoming more limited,” said Richard Meyer, vice president of markets, analysis and standards with the American Gas Association, a trade group for the natural gas industry. “We have the pipeline infrastructure, but now we also need storage.”

The hunt for more storage is evident in the Gulf Coast.

Bryce Dubee, a spokesperson for the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates oil and gas, said the agency has received 10 applications for permits to add salt cavern storage capacity over the last year. In Louisiana, officials have received two similar applications this year, two in 2024 and seven in 2023, according to the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

At Entergy’s Spindletop gas storage facility, officials are working with contractors to expand one of the storage caverns and increase its capacity from 4 million barrels to 6.5 million barrels.

“When I came in 2012, no one was talking about gas,” Phillip Colvin, assistant vice president of projects for WSP. “Now with LNG exports moving forward, you hear about it a lot.”

Borglum with WSP said the potential for booming LNG growth on the Gulf Coast makes the location of these salt dome storage sites ideal.

“They are all along the American Gulf Coast, which is also where we happen to have the bulk of our ports and terminals for export for LNG,” she said. “So there’s a beautiful synergy there in terms of the availability of subsurface storage capabilities plus surface infrastructure, all of which would work together.”

But growing storage along the Gulf Coast has caused some concerns, especially in areas that have seen salt domes fail in recent years.

Salt dome debate

In 1980, oil drillers accidentally punctured a hollowed-out salt dome used for mining, creating a 150-foot waterfall as water from the nearby Delcambre Canal rushed in. What was once a roughly 10-foot deep lake called Lake Peigneur is now more than 200 feet deep and 1,125 acres in size.

In 2012, a sinkhole opened up at Bayou Corne in Louisiana after an operator punctured a salt dome. About 350 residents were asked to evacuate as the hole grew to more than 22 acres in diameter, and the salt cavern operator Texas Brine Co. was ordered to pay about $48 million in a settlement with residents.

More recently, former Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) issued an emergency declaration in 2023 after land began to subside around a salt dome mine near the town of Sulphur, Louisiana. Residents there remain concerned over drinking water as an operator has been pumping saltwater into one of the caverns to prevent collapse, according to Louisiana TV station KPLC.

“There are multiple examples of salt caverns having issues and swallowing large swaths of land, including people’s property,” Rota with Healthy Gulf said.

Charlie Riedl, executive director at the Center for LNG, said in a statement that the industry follows a litany of federal and state rules and prioritizes safety. He said storage facilities are constantly tested to ensure their integrity.

“Safety incidents are taken seriously and have shaped stronger oversight and risk mitigation measures over the years,” Riedl said. “It’s also important to distinguish between legacy cases with limited regulatory oversight and modern facilities developed under today’s stringent rules.”

James Minter, a compliance manager with WSP who helps operate Entergy’s Spindletop gas storage facility storage site, said pressures in the salt domes are measured constantly. In Texas, the state’s oil and gas regulators requires underground storage facilities to empty their caverns and check their casings, use sonar to check for any issues underground and conduct mechanical integrity tasks.

“We have 11 people monitoring the pipes 24/7,” Minter said. “The industry is very safe.”

And in other instances, the underground natural gas storage can serve as a lifeline to the power grid, said Ben Marsh, an asset team lead for Entergy.

Entergy, for example, doesn’t use its storage to ship to LNG liquefaction plants or to sell its gas on the market. It only uses its stored gas to power its power plants — including a 2,000-megawatt plant in Bridge City, the smaller Lewis Creek Power Plant north of Houston and a combined cycle plant near the Sabine River that’s slated to come online in 2026.

The stored gas can act as a backstop when there are disruptions to natural gas supplies.

Its two caverns can store up to a month of emergency power supply when they’re full, Marsh said. That helped Entergy keep the lights on at its power stations in the 2021 winter storm that plunged much of Texas into darkness as natural gas supplies became scarce, he said.

And when weather is not an issues, Marsh said the storage helps Entergy keep power prices lower by allowing them to inject gas when its cheap and withdraw it when prices on the open market rise.

For LNG, Riedl said salt dome storage will help manage supply fluctuations and ensure consistent deliveries to export terminals, especially during periods of peak demand.

But Rota with Healthy Gulf said it’s one thing to have storage on hand to help with emergencies or to serve as strategic stockpiles for U.S. consumers and another to create more storage to serve the growing LNG industry.

“Why do we need these LNG storage caverns? It’s just we have too much natural gas — we’re fracking too much,” Rota said. “And the solution to that is not to cause more environmental damage by hollowing out salt domes when we could just stop fracking as much.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/68/5b/df90c4e54e61a237b164863e6b03/ew-0717-webb-gasstorage-2000-01.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 10:16:20.757107

“But because of the special midnight rider, Oklahoma was granted that authority.” KOSU reached out to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes for a comment, but did not hear back at the time of this publication.","The Oklahoma Corporation Commission, or OCC, obtained a copy of a letter sent by the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, addressing all oil and gas operators operating within the tribal nation’s territory, stating that they have environmental regulatory authority over these lands. It noted that the tribal nation’s newly established Environmental Protection Commission can inspect oil and gas facilities, monitor air and water quality and enforce environmental regulations on their lands, such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.

“Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Commission directives may result in the assessment of fines, issuance of enforcement actions or other remedial measures as deemed necessary by the EPC to protect the health, welfare and natural resources of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes,” the letter stated.

The letter referenced three bills that were passed this year in the tribal nation’s legislature and signed by Governor Reggie Wassana. Those include the Clean Air Quality Act of 2025, the Clean Water Act of 2025 and the Environmental Quality Act of 2025.

However, Corporation Commissioner Brian Bingman said in an OCC press release that oil and gas operators do not need to worry about the Cheyenne and Arapaho’s environmental oversight, saying: “The agency is moving forward with business as usual.”

“We always look for ways to work collaboratively with our tribal partners when appropriate, but as it sits today, the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes do not have the proper ‘Treatment as a State’ designation by the federal government required to claim and execute this regulatory function,” Binger said in the press release.

Earthjustice attorney Mike Freeman explained the designation called Treatment as a State, or TAS, occurs when a tribal nation applies to the EPA to obtain authority, similar to that of a state, to operate and administer environmental programs and conduct permitting on their lands, such as for the Clean Air Act. However, getting TAS status is extremely difficult for tribal nations in Oklahoma, stemming from a midnight rider that was tacked onto a transportation appropriations bill 20 years ago by former Republican Senator Jim Inhofe.

“Because of The Midnight Rider, Oklahoma basically has a veto over tribes getting treatment as a state,” Freeman said.

Freeman elaborated that this rider limited tribal nations' efforts to obtain TAS status because it requires them to reach a Memorandum of Understanding with the state in order to get a TAS designation. The 2005 rider also allowed the state to gain more environmental control over tribal lands.

“The other thing that the midnight rider did was to say that if Oklahoma already has delegated authority to administer, say, a Clean Water Act program or any federal environmental program on non-tribal lands, the state can go to EPA and seek authority to also run that program on tribal lands,” Freeman said. “They can basically take over environmental permitting on tribal lands, even though they normally would not have any jurisdiction over those lands.”

Following the landmark McGirt decision, Gov. Kevin Stitt submitted a request to the EPA to essentially take over environmental programs on --- Indian lands that were reaffirmed in the McGirt ruling. His request was granted by the Trump administration and remains in effect today.

“Nowhere else in the country would a state have been able to do that,” Freeman said. “But because of the special midnight rider, Oklahoma was granted that authority.”

Sunderland, UK – An electric truck charging station that will potentially save 1,500 tonnes of CO2 a year has gone live at Nissan Sunderland Plant.

The project is a first in the UK automotive industry, establishing an electric, end-to-end supply chain that transports materials into the Nissan plant and delivers finished vehicles out. The project is the first on site private shared charging station of its kind in the UK.

The £1.4m facility has seven charging stations, capable of powering up to ten eHGVs simultaneously. It complements the plant's EV36Zero vision for sustainable manufacturing, bringing together electric vehicles, renewable energy and battery production.

Michael Simpson, Vice President Supply Chain Management, Nissan AMIEO, said;

""It is fantastic for our plant to be leading the charge to an electrified supply chain with this project.

""We welcome the support we've received from our partners to bring the charging station to life and we're proud of what we have achieved.

""The charging station looks brilliant and is a big step forward in Nissan's EV360 vision, which brings together electric vehicles. zero carbon energy and battery manufacturing.""

The station will support 60 UK eHGV deliveries to the plant daily and represents just the start of the plant's journey towards electrifying its supply chain. Michael Simpson added: ""We're exploring further opportunities to allow other hauliers to use the charging station as well as looking at other opportunities to maximise its full potential.""

The charging station will support a fleet of 25 trucks with a charging capacity of up to 360kW. The trucks will collect parts from Nissan's UK supply base stretching as far afield as Derby; as well as delivering finished vehicles to and from the Port of Tyne. That equates to more than 2.4 million kilometers travelled per year, fully electrified, saving 1,500 tonnes of CO2 annually.

Bringing together Nissan, Fergusons, Yusen and BCA, the project is part of the Electric Freightway consortium that is transforming sustainable freight logistics through deployment of eHGVs and high-power charging infrastructure.

Led by GRIDSERVE, Electric Freightway forms part of the Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Demonstrator programme, funded by the UK Government and delivered in partnership with Innovate UK.

UK Government Minister for the Future of Roads Lilian Greenwood said: ""We're working closely with the road freight sector to slash transport emissions, and our £200m zero emission HGV programme is helping businesses across the country to power the electrification of its fleets.

""It's great to see Nissan taking advantage of our scheme which is supporting high paid jobs and putting money in the pockets of working people – all part of delivering our Plan for Change.'

Daniel Kunkel, CEO, GRIDSERVE said; ""The decarbonisation of transport logistics is much stronger and reaches far wider when done in partnership.

""This is why, as leaders of the Electric Freightway consortium, we are so pleased to support this UK first with Nissan and their haulage partners. Depot charging is critical for the electrification of HGVs, going hand in hand with future public infrastructure developments.

""As a first shared usage site, this location is leading the way in sustainable freight logistics.""
